 In terms of the real economy, Mr Chairman, I would be inclined also to view it as a little better this month than it looked last month I am also inclined to the view that, at least over the next couple of quarters, the real economy might be a bit stronger than the staff forecast But I am only willing to say that for the next couple of quarters I think, for example, that we may see a little more strength in housing in that period and that auto sales might be a little stronger than is suggested simply because of the greater availability of fuel efficient cars Partly because of consumer credit reductions but also because of what's happening in the stock markets, consumer balance sheets are probably a good deal stronger than they were, which I think is consistent with that development But looking out a bit further I see some risks, including the point that has already been made about what will in fact happen to interest rates and what that may mean for housing and capital goods On the price side, we have a situation where in the near term the CPI certainly will look better But my own perception, like that of others, is that the price outlook and [inflation] expectations actually have deteriorated in the last month or so The unit labor cost situation, of course, looks terrible The budget deficit situation, in terms of its implications for expectations, is a matter of concern The weather and [its impact on] food prices is an unknown, but at least for now I think it can only work in one direction And I sense a growing element of concern in the markets [about] the recent money statistics and what they may portend for inflation over a longer period of time The fiscal [side], as has been said, is full of uncertainties The one thing we are sure of is that the deficits are going to be big Financing requirements of the Treasury are going to be substantial, whatever that implies Certainly we think we know something about what it implies for interest rates In summary, as I look at the situation, I think the relative risks have shifted While we still have a weak economy, in the near term it may be a little stronger than we thought it was But the price situation, if anything, looks a little worse--conceivably a good deal more than a little worse--rather than a little better  -18-    8/12/80   Yes, if one looks at both the asset side and the liability side, we really do have a--   Two quick questions, Ed I am inclined to the same view that you articulated in terms of M2 and these asset preference shifts If that's right, is it also your judgment that that pattern will likely continue for at least several months? If anything, presumably in this environment, we are talking about at least a couple of months in which money market certificates or savings certificates are going to be perhaps even more competitive   One other quick question I have heard that there is already talk in the markets, for whatever it's worth, of a very, very, large money supply number this Friday Do your numbers suggest that?   The number I've heard--and I've heard it from two sources--is $4 to $5 billion on M-1 So I was just wondering   Mr Chairman, I am very comfortable with "A" at this time I say "at this time" because I am inclined to the view that the near-term risks on the aggregates are probably on the up side I am willing to wait and see what happens But if in fact that strength in the aggregates were to materialize, a lot of this debate about rates would be academic because the mere fact of that strength would quickly reflect itself in higher interest rates in the marketplace in any event If that too were to occur, we would be a lot closer to the kinds of real dilemmas we were talking about earlier, which were very well captured in Governor Wallich's comments about the task of getting back to where we want to be for 1981 So, I think "A" is fine for now, but if indeed the aggregates do run strong, we're going to to have a dilemma immediately in front of us All of this underscores to me the point that somehow, somewhere, we have to get help from other elements of public policy in this [fight against] inflation And I just don't see that coming I'm not sure how or where we get it   Paul, this is Jerry Corrigan I understand what you said about the problems the staff is having with the path But what is the sense, [given] everything we know right now, as to what may happen to the funds rate in the immediate period ahead--in the next couple of weeks or so?    8/22/80   I appreciate that Is there any sense of how much it might have to go up given what's going to happen to borrowing?   I appreciate that   Paul, is the August 6th increase--now that all the numbers are in--highly concentrated?   Not concentrated in big New York banks?   Jim, I have noticed--and this may be grasping at straws--that the average hourly earnings series for the months of July and August shows a very marked deceleration to around 4-1/2 to 5 percent on top of almost 10 percent for each of the first two quarters Is there anything to that or is that just a statistical aberration?   Mr Chairman, I can't disagree with the staff projection, although I put myself in the camp that thinks the potential for a W shape [outcome] is very real But we are also in another period where I think there may an inordinate focus on what the next quarter is going to be, whether it's going to be a little plus or a little minus In a sense that question is academic because when we look beyond those numbers and underneath the numbers what we really have to come face to face with is a rather dismal picture We are almost a year after October 6, 1979; and the year was by any standard a very wrenching one Certainly, I think one can conclude that if it were not for the role the Federal Reserve played, it would have been a heck of a lot worse But the fact of the matter is, looking now a year later at the price numbers, for example, one can throw a very, very small net around the annual inflation numbers for 1979, 1980, and  -23-    9/16/80  1981 And certainly the prospects for the real economy are at best mixed When I think about the whys of that, I am even more persuaded now than I was that the volatility and the uncertainty that we see still reflect a fundamental fear and expectation that somehow or other inflation is going to get worse There is a recognition, I think often subliminal, that if inflation does get worse, the result will be even more instability  When I put that all together in the context of public policy, bypassing the tax question for a minute, it seems to me that we have another credibility problem to deal with Up until now there has been a lot of discussion about credibility measured in terms of whether we stick to and hit these targets for the money supply If one looks at 1981 and assumes that we stick to them and hit them, it seems to me that we are openly facing another credibility question That is Okay, we've done all this and we've hit these targets for two years in a row or whatever it will be, so where are the results? The credibility question that ultimately will arise is Does it work, can it work, or will it work? And if we are looking at a situation at the end of 1981 that looks anything like the forecast, it's going to be even more difficult to justify the kind of policy we are talking about simply because people's frustration levels in terms of [unintelligible] and performance will have been eroded, I suspect  That's a back door way of getting to the tax question My instinct is like a lot of other people's Looking at the sheer numbers and the sensitivity of expectations and all the rest, my gut feeling is that a tax reduction, even a well structured one, would be counterproductive at this time But at the same time, I also feel that there has to be a way that a tax reduction can be structured in a positive way, along the lines that Mr Ford and Mr Solomon spoke of I am still very intrigued with the idea that somehow or other there should be a way to structure a tax cut that helps us get at the wage question And I think the pressures are going to be enormous in that direction I wish I could figure out a way to make some more sense out of it But my bottom line on the tax cut again comes down to its structure and how it is done If it's just a straight traditional kind of tax cut, then I would have to resist it   Since I got penalized for my double-dipping before--   Well, I'm not sure I can add anything much to what has already been said This is a nasty dilemma One point that hasn't been mentioned, which does loom somewhat large in my mind, is the fact that how we end up in 1980 is going to have a bearing on how we start 1981 as well And that at least has led me in the direction of "B," but that's not a very powerful feeling at this time because of the uncertainty The other thing that is bothering me about this quarter is that it's a quarter in which we are probably going to have even more problems with numbers because of all the news reporters and everything else We could be a bit more in the blind than we usually are I just wonder [about that] in terms of the interval we're looking at now, if we did something like Mr Solomon has suggested in the very near term If we do get continued rapid [monetary] growth in September and early October, I think the credibility issue will become very real Market rates are going to move up anyway, and we'll have the worst of both worlds Maybe there is a middle ground Perhaps in the context of something like Mr Solomon has suggested, the quarter as a whole could be looked at again at the next meeting and we could operate more with an eye on the next month until we see where we are   I think that's right But as I would look at it, I tend to think we're at or near a pretty critical crossroads All I'm suggesting, within the framework of some sort of compromise, is that maybe we can get September under our belt and keep a little more open position on the fourth quarter until we see where September comes out That's because if September [growth] really is modest, I don't think we're necessarily talking about the kinds of pressures that people are so concerned about and that I'd be concerned about   Yes, but we don't have much room for error That's my problem   Yes, but September to December is a very short period in terms of controlling the aggregates   Mr Chairman, I'm inclined to the view that the real economy may be a tad or so stronger over the next quarter or two but nothing dramatic Beyond that, it's very hard to see with any clarity I think where we are on inflation will have a lot to do with the longer-run performance of the economy There are big uncertainties about fiscal and other economic policies as they will be enunciated by the new Administration The question of consumer resistance to these high car prices is an area of uncertainty and it's one that could work against us I am not as sanguine as many people seem to be about the oil price situation either I don't claim any particular expertise but the more I look at the information coming out of the Middle East, the more I think it could turn into a very negative factor by sometime in 1981 On the financial side, I don't know to what extent the Ninth District is representative; it probably isn't But I can say this There is intense advertising and pushing by commercial banks on ATS types of business to try to get a leg up on the thrifts, which is compatible with what Steve was saying about this departure between M-1B and M-1A I think it is very real It's moving a lot faster than we thought it would, and I think we can have some impact in terms of trying to explain it in a coherent way, particularly if we start to do it sooner rather than later  Broadly speaking, on policy I lean toward "A" But in the current situation I think a more important consideration than "A" or "B" is the point that Steve made on how we might want to shape the language in the directive so that whatever we come out with is couched in terms of an upper limit Therefore, if we continue to get the  -26-    10/21/80  overruns that we've had in the last eight or ten weeks, we can respond to that more quickly   Mr Chairman, I'd like to repeat something I said earlier I don't think it matters a great deal here in terms of either "A" or "B" When we talk about all the dangers and risks that are out there, what still bothers me is that the biggest danger is that if we get another month or two of money growth rates like the ones we've had over the past three or four months, then all those dangers we're talking about are going to materialize anyway We're going to have higher interest rates Indeed, I think we'll have the instabilities of interest rates that you spoke of We'll go into 1981 on a growth plane in money that will give us a more difficult problem then I could easily live with "A" or "B," but I personally would like to see the directive couched in terms that forcefully get across the point that if we continue to get this cumulation of errors on the plus side, a [tightening] movement would be [warranted] because if that happens, we're going to have to do it anyway   May I ask just one quick question, Steve?   In terms of what you mean to publish, I think you said that the reserve numbers will include the required reserves associated with the new reporters The money supply numbers and total benchmark when done will not? Is that correct?   The sample of nonmember banks?   I appreciate that Do we now have a firm fix on how many nonmembers will actually have to post reserves and what the level of total reserves associated with the nonmembers is?   Mr Chairman, as far as the economy is concerned, I think the staff projections and estimates are as good as they can be I agree entirely with Mr Winn's comments about the uncertainties associated with oil and I agree that the whole fiscal economic policy area is one where what does or does not come out of the hopper could have an enormous impact on expectations if nothing else  In looking at policy, I am driven by two conflicting thoughts One is the desire to come as close to the 1980 targets as we can, or at least in line with Mr Morris's comments not to adjust the targets for the current quarter upward at this point But at the same time I'd like to enter 1981 on a growth trajectory that is roughly compatible with what our targets for 1981 might be There is a bit of a paradox in that I think the first criteria would bring one squarely to "B" and the second in some sense might bring one to "A" in terms of the growth rates for the aggregates I would reconcile that paradox by accepting aggregate growth numbers somewhere around "B" or maybe a bit higher But in line with one of Steve's suggestions, I'd treat those numbers as maximums, with the explicit understanding that if we were hitting or exceeding those maximums we would adjust the nonborrowed growth targets to offset any growth over the maximum I  -27-    11/18/80  recognize that that in itself would probably mean that we'd end up above the maximum for the period anyway because of the time it takes to know we are above them and then to respond But I, too, am a bit encouraged by these more recent money supply numbers And if there were some maximum, I think it is possible that such a maximum could be compatible with a funds rate band of maybe 13 to 16 or 13 to 17 percent On borrowing, I'm just having a heck of a time figuring out what might be [appropriate], given all of these number problems   That's why I like the idea of trying to use a maximum as more of a guide than perhaps we have in the past   Mr Chairman, on this matter of whether or not to have some maximum If we took something like "B" or a little higher or something between "B" and "A" for the aggregates paths and treated them as a max--if for no other reason than having that be our consultation point rather than perhaps the federal funds rate--I don't think those things have to be incompatible It comes down to a judgment as to how much of an impact the things we already have done will have I think it might be possible to structure something like that, which would just put somewhat greater weight [on the aggregates], even if merely for consultation purposes   I'm saying in terms of this maximum, [use] "B" or something a little higher than "B"   In a sense I think that's the key because if it turns out that we get a couple more strong weeks, then all of a sudden we're in a position that we're not even realistically looking at [an outcome close to] "A" and then we're really in the soup   If we had a $2 billion increase in the money supply next week, all of these numbers presumably would be out the window   But another thing, too, is that the Federal Reserve in its own way has done a marvelously effective job of convincing people that the growth of money matters, to the point where even for nonmembers of that small group it is very easy to latch onto [monetary policy] as the scapegoat Even the nondoctrinaire people who don't even understand it--   This is Jerry Corrigan I would tend to line up with the remarks of Frank Morris I do think we have to go to 18 percent, but I myself am reasonably uncomfortable without the implications that we have great [unintelligible] of that That is my comment   Same for Minneapolis   This is Jerry Corrigan I, too, am in agreement with the proposal   Mr Chairman, on just a technical point first, I'm not unduly concerned about tolerating some base drift, maybe even  -46-    12/18-19/80  a lot, because I think not accommodating some base drift runs a risk that the brunt of [the effects] will hit particularly hard early in 1981 when perhaps we will least want it In terms of our basic posture, I think it has to continue to be one that is consistent with a reduction of inflation and is understood as being that The near- term outlook for the economy, I think, is fairly well-defined in the sense that we are going to have some reduction in activity in the first half of [next] year In my view, however, the amount of the reduction is open to some considerable question We have major uncertainties in oil We have major uncertainties regarding how long interest rates will stay in their current range and certainly the longer they stay there, the more significant the implications And that does involve some very real dangers to the economy and the financial system We have the uncertainty of budget and tax policy I, too, draw some consolation from the fact that there appears to be some momentum on that side, but I'm not by any means sanguine yet We have short memories We had coordinated economic programs in November of '78, October of '79, and March of '80, and I think the public is pretty wise at this point and business is pretty wise If indeed there is to be a very strong and credible assist coming from the fiscal side, it has to be one that really meets the test And in some ways the critical part of the test is perceived to be the expenditure side of the budget where making real inroads, as we all know, is very, very difficult So I'm still not quite sure how much weight to put on what may or may not come out of that process I'm hedging my bets until I see a little more about it  In terms of monetary policy, let me just say a word about the 1980 performance Certainly there are aspects of the performance, particularly the volatility, that I'm not happy with I don't think anyone is But at the same time, I think we make a serious mistake in going around to the extent we do with our tail between our legs in terms of the overall performance of monetary policy in 1980 When I look at the targets and at where I think we are coming out now, with any kind of appropriate adjustment for NOW accounts or ATS problems, I think our record in fact is pretty darn good In some sense I think we make our own problems with the editorial writers and others by perhaps being unduly sensitive and defensive about what seems to me a pretty credible--and indeed in some ways remarkable--performance looking at the year as a whole So I'm not about to be too apologetic about that  In looking ahead, broadly speaking I would hope we could keep the focus in terms of aggregates more or less where it is Having said that, I should also add though, Henry, that I don't want to get trapped in a cage with your 200 monetarists either And that, too, requires walking a bit of a thin line The thinness of the line in 1980, for what it tells us, does suggest to me that if there was a mistake, the mistake was probably in the second quarter in chasing the money growth rates down too fast and letting interest rates go down too fast To whatever extent it's possible in 1981 I think we should try to target something we can hit with a little better success in the short run than we did in 1980  When I look at that in the context of Mr Morris's simplicity criterion, I have a bit of a problem, because my hunch--and it's just a hunch--is that the NOW account/ATS account impact on M-1B is probably going to be larger, and maybe significantly larger, than the  -47-    12/18-19/80  estimates contained in the Bluebook I conclude that for three reasons First of all, I think the sameness of the Q-ceilings on passbook savings accounts and the NOW-type accounts is very important It's very important particularly when, as the Chairman has suggested, the impact of that is likely to aggravate the shift out of savings deposits into M-1B So maybe the two-thirds/one-third [estimate] is also wrong Also, consumer sensitivity obviously is higher now than it was in New England or even in New York And finally, the competition factor is very real The thrift industry is looking upon these types of instruments as a bit of a salvation in the short run, where they can get their hands on money at the expense of commercial banks While it's expensive money, it is cheaper than other money that's available to them right now So my hunch is that they are going to go after that business very, very aggressively and force commercial banks--even those who might not want to go after it--to respond in kind My conclusion--and again I can't document it any better than anybody else--is that the risks in terms of the possibility of larger flows from savings into these types of instruments are on the high side If I'm anywhere near right, that could put actual growth of M-1B during 1981 almost out of sight  Having said that, I do agree with those who say that it's impossible to explain all these shifts away; but I don't think it's impossible to explain that they're there without trying to quantify them Because of that, I would be prepared to give a lot more weight for the time being to something like M2 or perhaps Nancy's version of M2 My willingness to go in that direction would be perhaps somewhat greater if it weren't for the information in paragraph 11, page 9 of the Bluebook that says the broader aggregates are going to grow faster in 1981 than we thought they were But I don't fully understand what's implied in that paragraph, and I for one would like to see some further analysis of it, particularly in a context in which the scenario we're looking at might be one where interest rates in the first half of the year decline by, say, 500 or 600 basis points from where they are now and then level off for the balance of the year at some relatively high level If that were the framework of interest rates, I'd have to ask myself whether in fact we are as likely to see the kind of shift that the staff is suggesting in paragraph 11  The other thing that [concerns me is that] I know we can't monitor these shifts very well, but I'm not sure how much we can monitor at all what in fact is going on Wherever one comes out in terms of the relative emphasis to put on the Ms, that doesn't fully solve, and maybe it doesn't even begin to solve, the related problems of how to conduct operations That's because these very same shifts in deposit categories, particularly shifts from savings accounts into NOW accounts, are going to produce a huge impact on reserves as well Basically, I think we have two alternatives One is to stick with the current procedures, constructing the reserve paths more or less as we do, perhaps in the process giving more weight to M2 But I'm not fully persuaded that that's necessarily the best thing to do I was struck, for example, by the question that kept entering my mind during 1980 as to how the lagged impacts of what we did in a given week or a given couple of weeks on those reserve paths and interest rates affected growth in the Ms three or four months down the road and the extent to which that in itself contributed to the sharp short-run swings we have seen And partly for that reason I'm still a little intrigued about the possibility of rethinking the use of total  -48-    12/18-19/80  reserves during this difficult period of transition as more of an operational target than in the past; we might do that at least on a quarterly average basis or something like that I recognize all the problems associated with that But it would raise the possibility that we'd be talking a little more directly about something that we may be able to hit on a quarterly average basis And in that context I would use M2 or something like that and interest rates as Henry has suggested, more as informational variables than as operational variables That covers a lot of turf But because of the many uncertainties that we all have, I would like to think that maybe what we could do today is at least to narrow this down a bit Also, Mr Chairman, you suggested yesterday that we may need a meeting in January before we get down to the real hard [sell] of picking the numbers And I wouldn't object to that   Let's keep going   Steve, this is an unfair question, I suppose, but what is your view as to the level of borrowings that might be compatible with this, say, over the next four weeks?   If there's anything to this view that once we get below $1-1/2 billion or whatever the thought is about the frictional level of borrowings, the implication then might be that the funds rate could indeed come down fairly fast   Well, that's not inconsistent with what I'm saying   Why, Peter?   Yes, but isn't that very recent experience a combination of some banks getting a little discipline at the window plus this expectational effect that may well be built into the funds rate right now?   I can live with a 16 to 20 percent range, but the real question then becomes under what conditions you would feel compelled to adjust the nonborrowed path if things worked in the direction that we are talking about now and the edge came off the funds rate for whatever reasons--borrowing got at or below this frictional level--even in the framework of six weeks The real question is What would be the attitude toward adjusting that path?   8-3/4 percent   Steve, or Dave, or whoever, on this business about random monthly or weekly movements of money Is there anything in your work that sheds light on the question of how you know when it stops being random? My casual observation here--I hear your pluses and minuses--is that it always seems that once the thing starts to go, it cumulates [in one direction] It isn't a plus and minus relationship   So, there's nothing here that really bears on how we know whether we should consider something random or not in the short run?  -18-    2/2-3/81   This is partly a question, Steve, if I could Let's say we stayed where we are now in an operating mode, recognizing the interest rate/money supply variability tradeoff Could we buy any materially greater amount of stability in interest rates if we significantly widened reserve carry-forwards and permitted carry- forwards of both deficiencies and excesses, maybe even up to 5 percent or something like that, and let financial institutions put a much greater cushion in there to absorb some of these rate effects that we might otherwise get?   That's right It has the same effect   That's what is not clear to me Is there a real cost there?   Well, my instinct is--   Well, if we did this kind of thing, we'd have to have it work both ways There would have to be some kind of penalty; it wouldn't be a freebie   Doesn't it follow from what Steve was saying before that we also get that result if we take the position that we're only going to use the discount window for real emergencies?   I think the excess and deficiency carry- forwards are worth thinking about It does seem to me that having some kind of an arrangement where we provide more flexibility there with a penalty on deficiencies and a penalty in reverse on excesses--   It has been asked whether we're thinking about bigger banks and contemporaneous reserves literally or with a one-day lag   The one-day lag   Yes  -61-    2/2-3/81   And a lot of programming   That's right   Part of the problem in terms of pre-1968, too, is just the amount of churning in the banking system then as opposed to now The Fed-wire didn't even work prior to the--  -65-    2/2-3/81   No, I mean just the turnover of financial assets in the [banking] system   I think I will too  [MR BOYKIN I will also]   Well, on balance, if we did something with deficiencies and so forth, I'd go   No, no Just [on changing] the lagged reserves regime itself But I think if we did some adjustments--   If we got into operating that way, we really would need to look at the whole ball of wax   No   No, it just provides another safety barrier   Do we know anything more, Steve, about where NOW account money is coming from?   One of the things that bothered me about that was this The report made the argument that we didn't, through our actions, build in a cyclical pattern of money [growth] That is, the things that we did didn't create their own cycle I just had some trouble rationalizing that three-month lag, [given] the very low interest elasticity of money demand in the short run, with the conclusion that the practice itself didn't help to generate the cycle If we only adjust--   Again, those two things, the one-third type reaction coupled with the very low short-run interest elasticity of money demand, seem to me to reinforce the casual observation that maybe we were creating--creating is too strong a word--contributing to that cycle of money growth itself   Let me ask the question differently I only saw the summary; I'm not sure what you drew the conclusion from Is that where you were going?   The conclusion that our own techniques didn't in some sense create or contribute to the cycle of money   Let me ask the question differently, then In any of that material, was there an effort made to estimate the lag between, say, a change in the nonborrowed path and its ultimate impact on money? [Was there any analysis of] how long that process takes?   No, it's a slightly different one   That's the question I'm asking   Yes   That's where I get stuck I don't see how you can get the up and down interest rate movements without in turn getting an up and down movement in money, because the interest rates presumably are what cause the--   I'll have to look at that paper   My instinct, though, is that the way we operate could very well produce those results   Well, looking at this array of numbers here, I see that I am very much on the high side in terms of [the forecasts]   The Northwest is getting to me, I guess! My projection is on the high side and may be the highest in terms of real GNP I'd like to have a nice, scientific, neat explanation as to how I arrived at that conclusion, but I don't Basically, a lot of what I have put into my own forecast does reflect quite strong growth in the second half of the year, keyed to the assumption that there will be a major spending cut that has a strong and positive psychological effect coupled with the tax [cut] programs  -89-    2/2-3/81   That's not rational; that's irrational, I think But that's the catalyst in terms of the forecast as I have put it together here Obviously, with the kind of forecast I have, the weight of risk is on the down side And we do have many of these vulnerabilities in the financial system and not just in the thrifts in my mind I'm still not sure where we're going to be on oil prices What is your [estimate] of the average oil price for 1981, Ted?   That's the annual figure?   Anyway, we have all those risks that we've talked about before The other side of the coin is that, whether it's housing or autos or just about anything you can think of, there's a tremendous residual of underlying demand, if we can ever get the right conditions in place where the right kind of demand can flourish rather than be surpressed and frustrated as a lot of it is now But in a nutshell, basically the driving force behind why my numbers are on the high side is my assumption about fiscal policy and the way that's going to affect the psychology in the short run   Steve, in terms of the estimate, 50/50 sounds as though it might in fact be closer to what is happening   Well, that's one of the things I wanted to ask about I don't know to what extent it's representative, but at least in the Ninth District virtually all of it is coming from ATS accounts   My question is What happens to the original savings account, the second leg of the existing ATS account? At the  -107-    2/2-3/81  precise moment in time that the switch is effected, the balance has to be in the demand deposit part of the ATS account, but that's only at that precise moment The day before or the hour before it was in a savings deposit   Well, that's what I'm wondering   Okay, I guess that's my question And you are as comfortable as you can be [about that]?   Well, the average balance says that   Mr Chairman, on the presentational part, I think we have to try to get as much emphasis focused on the right-hand part of that table as we can I agree very much with Governor Schultz on that point On the substance, I come out for alternative I basically, partly because I'm not too concerned about this base drift either After we get through, no one will be able to tell what it is Also, I think alternative II really runs a risk of wrenching the [economy] too hard I am a little concerned about the larger numbers on the ranges for the broader aggregates I just wonder whether we couldn't look at M2 and M3 as 7 to 9 and 7 to 10 percent That is a little narrower on M2, but I'm not sure that's all bad if Steve is right about the things that are happening there I'm most concerned  -121-    2/2-3/81  about bank credit because, given what is happening in the economy and given that so many of our big firms are continuing to lose money and all the rest, there is going to be a lot of lending activity in banks [this] year So, I would not be allergic to putting bank credit at 7 to 10 percent either In sum, I would have the M1 ranges as they appear in alternative I; I'd take a chance on 7 to 9 percent on M2 and 7 to 10 percent on M3 and bank credit  As for the presentational part, if I were you I might even be willing to go a bit further and come fairly close to committing to going back [to Congress] as early as April to try to explain what has happened and what these numbers might mean If you do that, this idea that Bob Mayo had earlier might have some merit in the [period of] transition That would be to try to use an average of the right-hand column for M-1A and M-1B--not as a firm target, but as a talking point You could then say without a great deal of difficulty in communication that basically we're shooting for the average of M-1A an M-1B to grow within a 3 to 5 percent range during this period in which the transitional problem is the greatest The 3 to 5 percent average, I think, does encompass the range of possibilities that we're thinking of in terms of the shift And they are convenient numbers because even the upper end falls below the numbers that everybody has been looking at in terms of actual growth in the narrow aggregates for the past year I don't know how it would work out in precise terms, but I for one would not be allergic to trying to use that handle as a way to get over the worst part of this transition, leaving open as I said the possibility of going back up there as early as April   With a dogleg   I'm not entirely clear on this point that it is fundamentally misspecified I think the numbers that John Balles was ticking off before work at least a little in that direction Now, it's probably true to say, given everything in M2 and the fact that half of it is positively related to interest rates and the other half  -137-    2/2-3/81  is negatively related to interest rates, that it should be more stable If anything, as I said before--although I really don't think it's necessary to do it--that might suggest that the band can be narrower and that we can more reasonably assume that it will come out somewhere near what the staff forecast implies But I'm not entirely persuaded that it is structurally that far off the mark   But we've already corrected for it; we did all these redefinitions and things We built a lot of that right back in If you looked at it as you went along, you wouldn't find that   Well, if this NOW estimate that the staff is making here is right, maybe that's true But if the NOW estimate is a lot higher than that--ie more comes from savings-type instruments, as Frank Morris suggests--then I think it works the other way   No, but it will narrow the spread between--   Yes   I think there is an argument--it's not a very strong one--for saying that M3 might be the stronger, simply because the prospects for a fair amount of term business borrowing are pretty strong When you look at the auto industry and the steel industry and so forth, there's a lot of term big business lending going on I think banks are more likely to try to fund that with CDs That is compatible with some risk that M3 and bank credit could be toward the high side, as I suggested earlier   Well, last year we did   If they stay with the idea of accelerated depreciation--I don't know if they will or not--the numbers I've seen on cash flow on that in the first year, even if it's retroactive, are pretty small because of the nature of the tax change It's not the same as a change in income tax rates in terms of the cash flow effect   I'm not uncomfortable with it   I am comfortable with "B" or something slightly less than "B" But I have one question to Mr Axilrod When you construct the nonborrowed reserve path, you effectively will have to do that off the numbers in parentheses in Table 10, right?   So, no matter what we pick in terms of a path, the pressures on the funds rate that we will see or not see in this interval may be more directly a function of the accuracy of these estimates than anything else   Mr Chairman, this is Jerry Corrigan I would very much support the approach that you have suggested, and I would be disposed also to go in the direction that you and Tony both suggested of coupling that with accepting a shortfall for the time being   Yes, I don't have anything much further to report We have some people up here looking at it, and all I can say at this point is that the raw numbers look funny   I think that's right   It depends on where that savings part is in reserves, too At least it's bothering me in terms of M1-B Again, I don't have any way of knowing this, but I just wonder if some of this flow into money market funds in the last six weeks or so may not be more of a shift of consumer-type accounts out of banks into the money market funds   True, but I'm thinking in terms of Chuck's point that he can't find any other reason to think that M1-B--   Is it exactly where we are now? I thought that under the way we operate now, if we changed one component, we didn't necessarily change the total Whereas this contemplates that if you went to--   But the presumption here would be that there's an automatic dollar-for-dollar lifting in the total   But then the understanding would be, barring an express decision that way--   What did borrowings average in that second four weeks?  -14-    3/31/81   I was obviously one who was thoroughly confused in this second four-week period Is it not true, despite all of this, none of which I disagree with, that had we not adjusted the nonborrowed path back to where it was the probabilities are that the funds rate would have been down over that three-week period, anyway-- just as a behavioral thing   Yes Had we not readjusted the path back--   Okay   That I have no problem with   Let me ask my question differently For that 2-week period at the end of the first four weeks, I understand perfectly what was done and why it was done I, too, have been under the assumption, obviously erroneous, that the path that you established for the last two weeks of the first 4-week period was the same one you were going to stay on for the second four weeks as a whole My question is Had that been done, would we still have seen in that roughly 3-week period the funds rate below the original 15 percent floor?   I thought it was a new path for six weeks   That's all my question is I thought it was for six weeks And my question is Had it been for six weeks as a whole, would we have had more borrowing and presumably a somewhat higher funds rate? And Governor Partee's and Peter's answer are the same   I think we're saying the same thing   Peter, on the first page of your memorandum, there is a reference to the volume of trading and that it may have put strains on your automatic clearing mechanism in government securities Are you talking about our system or are you talking about the Street systems there?   No The clearing mechanism through the Fed?   The dealers, then, have never set up any kind of interface of their own with our system to move a lot of stuff out of ours   Well, we did a more comprehensive survey of institutions up in the Ninth District While it wasn't a big survey, it was done very carefully; we did in-depth interviews with the accounting officers and all the rest We are finding the same thing Mr Balles was suggesting, including that for large numbers of these accounts the kicker is in what they call a "hostage" account, a savings account And, therefore, there is no minimum balance to speak of at all in the NOW account itself I'll send that to you, Steve   Well, Mr Chairman, let me start with a word on the price outlook I sense for the first time at least a few straws in the wind that are consistent with some backing off on inflationary expectations I don't think there's much hard evidence one can point to, but I do get a little flavor of that It's also true that we could get lucky in terms of the consumer price index toward the end of this year Now, if the staff's estimates about mortgage rates [are right]--that they're just going to stay high--they presumably won't be adding And I think the outlook for food prices, assuming we continue to get some moisture in the Midwest, is a good deal better than it was even a few months ago   Yes, some rain is starting to come And the energy price outlook, I think, is also distinctly better So, maybe there's a little ground for optimism there On the economy, I look for a flattening out in the second quarter, but I think the potential for strong upward pressures later in the year is very real And in line with one of Mr Schultz's two scenarios, I think the potential for strong financial pressures in the second half of the year and strong pressures on money growth is very real I noticed in Mr Kichline's forecast, for example, that he has the Treasury borrowing almost $50 billion, $492 billion, in the fourth quarter, which is considerably greater than even the $35 billion we had this [quarter] So, I sense that whatever problems we may have now with controlling money and interest rates are only going to get worse as the year goes along, partly because the risks are that the economy is going to be stronger rather than weaker in the second half of the year And I  -31-    3/31/81  couple that with my sense that M-1B is giving us the wrong signals On this money market fund thing, for example, we did a little exercise It doesn't mean anything, but just as an example If you took the growth in money market funds over December to March and just added in one-tenth of the growth to M-1B, that raises the growth of M- 1B for the quarter to 62 percent And that, again, doesn't say anything about this other matter that Mr Balles was pointing to earlier   No rationalization It's just a guess, just a number You just take one-tenth of the growth in the money market funds phased in at the rate at which they actually grew and add that into M-1B   Why should I do that?   Well, but they're in M2 I don't think it makes--   Well, we can dispute that, but I think this understatement of M-1B is very real   Well, whether or not it is, I think it is It just adds further weight to the argument that M-1B is giving us some false signals here When I put it together, in terms of policy, I would not be allergic to giving a little more weight to M2 in line with one of the points that Steve made Also, the whole [situation], at least in my mind, argues in the direction of doing the best we can now to keep well within the targets because later on I think it's only going to get harder   I'm kind of a "B-," but I could go with "B" if we put a little more explicit weight on M2, even if just in terms of looking at the path   I would prefer to state the March-to-June growth rate at 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less I could go either 12 to 18 or 13 to 18 percent on the funds rate and borrowings starting out in a range of $12 to $13 billion But I still have a question in my mind Suppose we did either one of these things and M2 continued to grow at, say, 15 percent If M-1B was around 5-1/2 or 6 percent but M2 was 15 percent, what would we do then?   No, I [realize that]  -52-    3/31/81   Well, there's a little more to it than--   I'm reacting a little, Tony, to that memo that you distributed, which effectively points out that we don't make any adjustment in the paths for the nonreservable components of M2 regardless of what they do   I agree with that   That's $12 billion   No, there's at least one other conversation going on here, Paul   Paul, may I ask one other question, please? Somebody mentioned M2 When we swing over and incorporate the new seasonal for M-1B, is anything going to be done in terms of the fact that the money market funds component of M2 is also not seasonally adjusted?   I don't suppose you do, but I just raised the question because those--   I know it's the same problem in theory The question that has been running through my mind is Is there any merit at all to applying the same solution to the problem, recognizing that the solution is imperfect?   That's true   It might not be a bad idea to mention that in your explanation Having done this with other checkable deposits is going to draw attention to the fact that we haven't done anything there and [that will] then raise more questions   I understand   I understand what you did, Steve I'm just raising the point that it might be a bad idea to be totally silent   This is Jerry Corrigan I will be brief I agree with almost everything that has been said, certainly in terms of adjusting the nonborrowed path now   This is Jerry Corrigan I must say I come out at just the opposite way from what John has just said If you look back prior to February 24th, for almost two years we've been trying to convey the message that the funds rate band is a consultation point We've also been trying to convey the message that when it has been hit, consultations have been held and in one way or another, explicitly or implicitly, and when the forces have dictated, we effectively have waived it I think that putting new numbers around it in the context of the current situation works in exactly the opposite direction; it reinforces the view that we're playing footsies with the funds rate To me the language the Chairman has suggested is clear enough It does by implication say that something in the area of 20 percent is fine But by implication it also says that something like 25 percent isn't fine, and if we found the rate moving in that    5/6/81  direction, we'd have another consultation I think that's what the market, at least as I read it, is looking for And that's the message that we've been giving them, or trying to give them   Mr Chairman, I continue to believe that the economy is stronger than the so-called consensus forecast, which I think would encompass Jim's forecast In terms of the underlying demands, the suppressed demands, given that in the short run the capacity to snap back very quickly in housing and other areas is so great, I can't see much of a significant downside risk The major imponderable in all of this is how much financial stress is really there that we don't see We focus a lot on the thrift industry because we know a lot about it But I suspect that there probably is a good deal more stress around on balance sheets and other things than we perhaps really perceive  -3-    5/18/81  The other point I would make is that, at least in the Ninth Federal Reserve District, I have a hard time finding anybody who thinks that a three-year tax cut is a good idea There's a certain hesitance for people to talk about that publicly I'm not sure why I guess so much hope is pinned on getting some spending cuts here that they don't want to compromise that But certainly in private discussions I can't find anybody who thinks that a three-year tax cut is a good idea right now   But even in terms of the residential construction that is still going on, I don't know for sure, but I would venture a guess that a substantial fraction of the housing starts we're seeing right now is being creatively financed Every place you go you see condominiums, and the sign out front says 10-1/4 percent mortgage money   No, these are term loans The way they're being financed is that the builders go to the bank or the S&L and work a deal for a construction loan They take out all the first mortgages on a term basis at 10 percent or something in exchange for $300 or $400 or $500 thousand in fee income, which the institution takes right in, charges it as current income, and passes it right down to the bottom line   Absolutely, yes they do   There are some of those, but there is an ample number of these deals that I've just described where people still can get a 20-year mortgage at 10 to 11 percent   But the fact is that in the first four weeks you actually moved the nonborrowed path up   Mr Chairman, when you were out, Governor Gramley spoke of some frustration in terms of trying to figure out what the economy is doing We have more than our share of frustrations in policy here, too We just got through revising up the money supply a little in the first quarter, convincing ourselves that that made more sense But now we find that the GNP may be revised up more, so we're further away than we thought we were   We have a little frustration, too, with respect to this question of how quickly the banking system responds to what we do We saw a classic illustration of that in this period here, apropos to your comment earlier, Governor Partee We seem to have a situation where, even when we begin to firm up, what happens for a couple of weeks is that the banks sit there and wait until Wednesday and cover their whole position on Wednesday And the funds rate doesn't change except on Wednesday and then everybody discounts the change And then for a week or two after the banks run down their excess reserves and end up with deficiencies Somehow or other, in ways that are not clear to me, it takes a couple more weeks and we revise away all those deficiencies with "as-of" adjustments Then finally, after all of those processes have run their course, we begin to see some pressure either in terms of borrowing or the funds rate, or both I will also confess to a little continuing sense of frustration about the construction of and subsequent adjustments to the reserve paths, which comes up again in this forthcoming period The Bluebook indicates that, looking out over the April-June period, any of the alternatives contemplates a substantial acceleration in reserve growth while at the same time about the same or less growth in money I don't know what all that means except that maybe we don't know as much as we think we know  As I suggested earlier, there are some risks here, and I think we have to be prepared to take some risks In the current circumstances I come out somewhere around "C," too, partly because I think the economy, if anything, is stronger, and partly because I think money growth is likely to be stronger in the short run than we expect And finally, like Governor Rice, if we have to take a bit of a slowdown or a decline in the economy, which we may have to do, I'd rather do it now than later, partly because I think it makes more  -30-    5/18/81  sense in the context of hitting the annual targets but partly because it forestalls an even more serious problem that would occur if we let [money growth] continue to build up Given all of that, I come out somewhere around "C"   From my vantage point, if we had 3 percent in there as you suggest, Mr Chairman, and in fact ended up there, that wouldn't bother me too much because I don't see an enormous difference even between the 6-1/2 percent [of "B"] and the 5-1/2 percent [of "C"] for March to June My concern is this I'm inclined to the view that whatever we set we are likely to exceed in this immediate situation; and given the lags in the reaction process both by us and by the banks, if we start out saying we would live with 3 percent, we could easily end up with a quarterly growth rate for March to June of not 6-1/2 percent but even more than that I'm not sure what [directive] construction allows us to deal with that   What's wrong with a range? I guess the problem is that it doesn't let us deal with the bottom side   For the sake of discussion If we set a range of 1-1/2 to 3 percent so as to be generally consistent with the quarterly objective and--   I'm not That's the problem   If we use some language like this, is it absolutely essential that the language be right in the directive itself? Let me explain where I'm coming from The advantage to a federal funds rate consultation guideline is that the federal funds rate, whatever else it is, is the only thing we have in the short run that is fairly unambiguous Borrowings and the money supply and reserves and those things are all over the lot The funds rate at least is unambiguous I certainly agree with the idea of trying to get the markets and everybody else to recognize the de facto role that it plays But I'd like to see something [about the federal funds rate] preserved, and I wonder whether it can't just be part of the general discussion and not right in the directive language itself   This is strictly as a consultation point, you're saying?   I accept this  SPEAKER(?) Do you prefer it?   Chuck, I've had reports of noncompetitiveness [with foreign producers] even in computers and high technology in the last couple of months   A cooperative policy of intervention is better than not having one and I think the arguments that Tony makes are really the cogent ones over a period of time I'm not sure it matters day-to-day in terms of any particular exchange rates, but in terms of being able to ameliorate at least some of these more violent swings that produce these crazy effects over time, I think it is desirable   You didn't say anything about answers   Mr Chairman, I'll start off by saying that I didn't really use any model, but for the balance of this year my view of the economy is very similar to that in the Greenbook for essentially the same reasons I do see a bit steeper drop in the second and third quarters but a little faster snapback in the fourth quarter For 1982 I haven't seen all those forecasts you have in front of you there, but I suspect that mine is probably an outlier in that I'm looking for real growth in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range, a slight fall in unemployment over the year back to where we are now, and inflation around 8 percent but with a hunch that we could do better on that  There are several reasons why I put down that kind of scenario One is the pent-up demand that Mr Kichline referred to before, combined with the tendencies toward creative financing At any level of interest rates I think we're liable to see more activity than we might otherwise assume simply because of the way things are being financed these days The second point that I think is important is the implication of this improved inflationary outlook, regardless of whose numbers one looks at With any of those numbers, we're getting near the point where we've got to see some improvement in  -25-    7/6-7/81  inflationary expectations begin to feed through into long-term interest rates, along the lines perhaps that Mr Ford was suggesting before Certainly in the long-term area I do expect to see interest rates quite a bit lower than they are now I'm not as pessimistic as the staff is either in terms of the near-term or the longer-term outlook for interest rates in general, partly for the reasons I just mentioned But I also think that financial innovation, or however you want to describe it, will have continuing implications in terms of the behavior of M-1B, even if interest rates are lower I also am inclined to the view that at least in the context of next year, we probably will see a fairly exuberant response to the tax package, although I'm not sure about the durability of that going out to '83 and '84 So, there's a good chance that we could see a fairly strong economy throughout next year  I have to hedge my bets a little, too, though Obviously, an outlook like mine assumes, among other things, that we do get at least some give in wages; and it assumes that we don't get any fresh shocks from energy or food More importantly, it assumes that we're able to sneak through this [period of] financial strain and keep things reasonably in check There I must confess to being a little more nervous now than I was even a month ago Paul Meek mentioned the FNMA situation I think it is symptomatic I had another incident relayed to me the other day when the people at the Independent State Bank in Minnesota who are [pooling] bank CDs and selling them [as] money market mutual funds told me that they were now having trouble selling these funds, even [though they consist of] bank CDs that are fully insured by the FDIC The sensitivity level has reached that point, so they reported to me That's obviously a major question mark  The other thing I'll mention in terms of major question marks is this deficit outlook Obviously, we still don't know where we're going to come out on the tax package But if we look at the staff's estimate for the '82 deficit, they have about $80 billion compared to $45 billion They have about $100 billion in Treasury and agency financing for the year as a whole and they are $30 billion above the Administration's estimate of outlays despite, I think, having lowered defense expenditures as well Now, if the staff is right and the Administration and Congress are unable to make offsets, that comes near to resulting in a $50 billion deficit and I think we will have problems both in terms of the real economy and in terms of expectations and everything else For the moment in my own forecast I'm willing to assume the best, but I wouldn't bet all I own on it   No   Mr Chairman, making a couple of general points first, I certainly count myself solidly in the camp of those who would say we should err on the side of firmness now I think that is very important I also tend to agree with Mr Solomon that in all of the scenarios that are laid out here, particularly in the short term but maybe even beyond that, the interest rate profiles are too high I also think that the actual growth of money over the second half of the year is very important in terms of how we start off 1982 And when I look at some of those numbers that have money growth at 8 or 10 percent in the second half of this year looking toward getting down to 2 or 3 percent next year, the trajectory that presents creates some real problems for me as well One other general point I think Steve implied that the staff thought that some of the definitional kinds of problems associated with M2 and M3 relative to M1 might be less next year I'm not at all sure of that It seems to me they could be greater, given what the DIDC is doing and the possibility of legislation for an all-saver type certificate or something like that   Okay Well, I don't think we're out of the woods by any means in terms of those problems with the broader aggregates As far as the specifics, taking the 1981 targets first, I rather strongly favor the view of retaining the '81 targets as is To change them involves two problems for me One is the strategic problem for next year; and the other, which may be more important, is that to do so would give the impression that we really know enough to be able to fine-tune these aggregates at midstream by 1/2 point or whatever I don't find that very appealing So, I would retain the existing targets for 1981 although, as I will indicate later, I certainly would not mind an outcome that looks like alternative 2 on page 8 I would not change the targets I do have some sympathy for the idea of getting rid of the M1-A measure just to get rid of it  -51-    7/6-7/81  In terms of 1982, again partly because of this potential problem I see with M2, M3, and bank credit, my view at this time would be to state a target for M-1B of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, using the 3-point band And as Mr Solomon suggests, right now I would leave the targets for the broader aggregates for '82 where they are for '81, with some rather full explanation in your testimony that partly because of uncertainties about the tax legislation or whatever we will have to take a harder look at these at the beginning of next year   It's a half point on the top and a full point on the bottom   Steve, what's the published fed funds band in the last directive?   For the past 3 weeks in this past intermeeting period, what did you think the borrowing level was?   Okay   Mr Chairman, I'm in the area of "C" partly because I think we don't want to repeat 1980 but also because I have an eye on where we're going to start off 1982 Steve said that the quarterly average number toward the end of the year with "B" gets us up in the 8-1/2 percent area and that to me is troublesome I get more and more attracted to "C" with the advantage of Mr Solomon's  -64-    7/6-7/81  comment to the effect that, at least as they view the world, we could get [the growth rates of] "C" with a funds rate of 15 to 20 or 21 percent--either one would be all right with me--and an initial borrowings level of $1-1/2 billion   A question to Paul Meek Do the market people perceive that the 18 percent surcharge rate is a de facto [floor] on the federal funds rate? It shouldn't be, but is that the perception?   If you're selling federal funds--   Does that mean that M2 is within its range for the year?   The implication is that it has some relevance for whether or when we change the nonborrowed path?   We could say that just in terms of setting this objective, the Committee noted that the quarterly average was such and such That would clearly divorce it from any operational significance   That's the decisive thing I don't like this fine-tuning; that argument is the one that is a real potential trap  -91-    7/6-7/81  And I just don't see why we want even to run the risk of finding ourselves in that position   Leaving the targets as is   Steve, what's your current estimate for the shift adjusted growth of M-1B in July?   This is Jerry Corrigan I feel a little between a rock and a hard place It's hard for me to ignore these money numbers, but I guess a couple of days doesn't matter that much   [We'll know] the reaction to those numbers this afternoon, but I think that's going to point in the direction of making the adjustment anyway  SPEAKER(?) I think we're going to have to act, so I'd just as soon do so now   I think that's why Frank Morris is right, though, when he suggests that even at fairly moderate levels of borrowing the surcharge rate becomes a de facto floor in terms of the federal funds rate The other thing that I think is going on here, and I at least don't fully understand it, is the way that these banks continue to manage their reserve positions If you look at the daily federal funds rate over the past three months, we get almost a perfect 10-day cycle It just repeats itself as if it's drawn with a machine Obviously, that has something to do with the way they're playing the    8/18/81  game in terms of either letting their deficiency build up or avoiding the window or something But the pattern is just incredible   These are business days, yes   That's a perfect two-week cycle   I just took it back to May   Well, the way I have it plotted is ten business days   But it's a two-week cycle   You have total borrowings, including the agencies, next year at what $108 billion or something like that?  -18-    8/18/81   Mr Chairman, I'll just make a couple of comments on inflation and the business situation On inflation, I would align myself with Governor Gramley; if anything, I think we have been guilty perhaps of underselling even where we are, much less where we might be In that regard, I would point to food and energy prices where there is a tendency to pass them off as transitory technical factors; but even in those areas monetary policy and high interest rates have had a bearing and have reinforced the underlying market forces that have been working So, I do feel better on that score Looking [ahead] on the inflation situation, I get the clear sense from both my own staff and from some of the people in the District that the food prices, while they will show some acceleration, may not show the kind of acceleration that the staff is suggesting over the balance of the year Certainly, I can't find anybody who agrees with the latest Agricultural Department estimates of food prices over the balance of the year So we may have a little more good fortune going our way in that respect than some are suggesting There is another aspect of the staff's analysis of prices that I just can't reconcile, and that is the data that they are still finding on home prices Nothing that I run into of an anecdotal nature supports anything like the 8-1/2 or 9 percent increases in home prices that your raw statistics are still pointing to So there, too, things may be a little better  A couple of other developments have come to my attention I am beginning to see a lot of scrambling in state and local governments as they begin to assess the implications of this change in budget policy on their problems in the near term, both in terms of taxation and their own spending policies I would also say that the high technology firms in the Minneapolis area report to me that there has been a very, very sharp increase in defense activity, even over the last month None of that has yet gotten to the point of contract signing, but there is a tremendous increase in the amount of discussion and negotiation on what seem to them to be major commitments in the defense area On this deficit question, I would just add that while we can all dance on the head of a pin here as to what it means and what percent it is and all the rest, to me it is a major overhang both in the markets and in the perceptions of business people and consumers in the public at large in terms of what is going to happen to the economy and interest rates over the next 6 to 12 months Notwithstanding whether the economics and the theory of it are quite right, that clearly is the impression I get, no matter whom I talk to   I, too, am fairly comfortable with "A," but I may look at this a bit differently than [implied by] a lot of the comments that have been made so far I do think that M-1B growth in a real sense is artificially low and that the equivalent of what it should be is probably growth at a rate of more than the 09 percentage point measured rate that we can attribute to the direct effect of money market shares I also still think that in some sense interest rates are either artificially high or technically poised to come down, partly because of the view that I happen to take regarding what that surcharge rate is doing to behavior So to me it is still conceivable that we could get some give, particularly in short-term interest rates, under either of the scenarios that are being talked about here, particularly if we could find a time slot within which that surcharge rate could be changed But that's not easy to do   At the surcharge rate, which now could be lower   No   The other thing is that there is some upside danger here in terms of these money growth rates We're looking at two months where we'll have pretty steep growth with a clear need later for such growth to come back down That's where this tradeoff between interest rates and the problems we have now has to be viewed in the context of similar problems later on So, while I think you are right in suggesting that we would be ill advised in the current circumstances to change the directive, I for one am sensitive to the potential for an overshoot now in terms of money growth and other things And, as I suggested, I think we may at least in the short run be able to have the best of both worlds If we can, I wouldn't mind that at all   The best of all worlds in the short run would be to get some give in short-term interest rates while having money growth rates that are perhaps not as steep as those associated with alternative A  -40-    8/18/81   Neither do I   Back to Europe   There's no thought here that we would be implicitly tolerant of short-run money growth of a little less than perhaps these 8-1/2 and 11-1/2 percent numbers   I have some predisposition or a mild prejudice in the direction of money growth being a little slower, if it turns out that way, simply because I still think it's in our better long-run interest to have it work that way than the other way But I am comfortable with the overall formulation   Then they will think we've eased   Then we can say we're really in the middle     Is that commonplace in the market now, Peter?   I don't think there's any doubt that in the last month or two or so the signs of the long awaited credit quality problems have begun to emerge in ways that bankers and other people can see them Frankly, I run into that point of view from virtually all the bankers that I have had an opportunity to talk to Indeed, one prominent banker told me not too long ago that any banker who says he's not seeing that either isn't looking or is lying Be that as it may, the one somewhat qualitative thing that I would add is that, in a number of cases where people are willing to talk about these problems, they tend to tell me that these were semi-marginal to marginal credits to begin with Maybe they shouldn't have extended to begin with; and if they were having trouble at 10 or 12 percent, certainly they're going to have trouble at 18 or 20 percent I run into that kind of attitude with some regularity, the point being that it's not just the question of, say, housing or wood products or farmers, it's also a question of the well-run business versus the not-so-well-run business almost regardless of the nature of the business But I don't think there's any question that the problem is increasing  Two other quick comments One I find very curious, and that is that throughout all of this I begin to sense a little backing away, if I can put it that way, in terms of people's outlook for inflation over the next months, which I can't attribute to anything except that some of the euphoria of those really good consumer price index numbers earlier in the year has worn off and people are now starting to get back to reality Those wage rates are there and those medical prices are there, and the view is that, indeed, the next step on the road is going to be a damn tough one I perceive that now that we've gotten to the point where businesses are starting to look hard at the question of "Where do we go from here?" They are coming back to reality, as it were, in terms of what still lies ahead with regard to their own pricing decisions in an environment in which they obviously all are looking for every opportunity they can find to pass through costs to try to regenerate cash flow and profit margins And I think that is a curious thing to find at this point--the reevaluation of how far we can really expect to go in the near term on inflation, given all the forces that they see pushing on them in terms of their own wage and price decisions  On the economy, I would certainly agree that it's moving downward I don't see at the moment any evidence of a pervasive or  -12-    10/5-6/81  precipitous decline, but I would align myself with Willis Winn in suggesting that the potential for that is clearly there The biggest single vulnerability in my judgment would be not so much that something will happen to the thrift industry--I think that's all been discounted--but that some other sizable financial shock may be looming out there and none of us seems to know quite where it is or where its ugly head might pop up I think that risk is there And if that kind of thing were to happen, that might well change my view as to whether or not there is some potential on the down side beyond what one would find just by looking at the numbers in front of us today   In terms of my own remarks, I didn't want to leave [the impression] that all of it was on the wrong side of things In one sense I was trying to suggest that it was on the right side of things because people were aggressively thinking about what to do And that in itself says something, because heretofore I think the decision was almost automatic when the corporate business plan came up They just filled in the numbers and didn't even think about it So, I was trying to suggest that it's not all bad   In most years that would get us in a lot of trouble   You have to understand, though, that when they talk to Congress, they turn the whole thing around   Steve, I have a technical question on a different subject I can't quite understand the recent relationship between the reserve numbers and the money numbers One of your tables shows, for example, that you estimate that total required reserves in September grew by 179 percent I know we have all these shifts going on in terms of reserves phasing up and down and across and all the rest, but when I look at the components across the board, it's very hard for me to see where one can find anything that would account for that much of an increase in required reserves   Oh, that's right; you're picking up that big August jump   Those large CDs are still at what--3 percent?   Oh, that's right   Mr Chairman, I am not as disturbed as some members of the Committee are by the so-called shortfall in M-1B, even though I would concede in the ideal order of things that M-1B is probably what we should be looking at When I look at that aggregate this year, shifts into money market funds, mutual funds, and even the possibility that all savers money might come out of there leave me quite comfortable with the general pattern of its behavior, particularly in the context of the broader aggregates, and in the context of what it would take to get it back near the bottom of the range for this year  Somebody mentioned earlier that we should be conducting policy with an eye on the long haul and I certainly agree with that I very much agree that we must avoid another of the very sharp swings in interest rates And the point that Governor Schultz made about the trajectory for 1982 is rather critically important in that context In the current setting, obviously, there is a great deal of attention and sensitivity focused on this Committee [There is] a particular element of sensitivity out there to any major signs of some give on the part of the Fed That sensitivity is particularly important among the group of people who really are important in determining what happens over the next couple of years the business leaders who set prices; the union leaders who negotiate wages; and the institutional money managers who have to make decisions whether to buy some long- term paper or not to buy some long-term paper  Given all of that, when I look at alternative B and see that the staff says, for what it's worth, that "B" would involve monthly growth rates of M-1B shift adjusted of 7-1/2, 10-1/2, and 11-3/4 percent out through December, I am very, very troubled by that I think that pattern of monthly behavior, even in the context of the shortfall that we have seen earlier in the year, would run a real risk of compromising what has been achieved to date in this effort to get inflation down And in the context of that trajectory question, it might well leave us in the worst of all worlds In that light, I think that we clearly should be taking a very, very go slow attitude That is reinforced, in my judgment, by the recent behavior of the reserve aggregates And on a less technical note, it's also reinforced by a thought that the law of averages is running against us in some sense One of these months interest rates and everything else notwithstanding, the money supply is going to jump for whatever reasons And, in terms of the economy itself I draw some consolation from the fact that there are very sizable latent demands out there  -35-    10/5-6/81  that will resurface as interest rates come down and will have a tendency to surface in any event in the environment of the tax cuts that are now on board and will be coming on line next year  In the light of all that, I come out rather squarely on alternative C, with some disposition toward initial borrowings of around $1 billion or so As usual, the big question is what do we do if we are not on that track as the period unfolds There is one other comment I would like to make, too We've all been talking about this credit problem and financial shakiness or whatever it is out there, and obviously we should be talking about it When I think about that, the worst of all situations there for me would be for us to find ourselves getting blindsided by some development that we have totally missed in our intelligence gathering and other activities That, too, could compromise our ability to hang in there I also would suggest that there are things that we can do, at least in our intelligence gathering activities, to try to minimize the likelihood of getting totally surprised And I for one would like to see some efforts made in the direction of redoubling that intelligence apparatus to try to sensitize ourselves fully to what may be out there   [13] to 18 percent?   There is another option, which I don't think much of, but we could do it And that is to start out the way that Chuck and Lyle are saying but to put in the directive that to the extent M2 departs significantly because of all savers certificates or for whatever reasons we would have a consultation So, it would be couched in terms of triggering a consultation rather than triggering a shift in the reserve path   Not if it's all because of all savers certificates   But it seems to me that it all works in the same direction If you go back to the beginning of the year and look at the spread between the M1 and M2 targeted growth rates, it was going to be 2-1/2 percentage points But we had fudged that; it was really something like 3-1/2 points Now, if you look at where the year is probably going to come out, that spread that we thought was maybe 3-1/2 is going to be 7-1/2 percentage points The 4 percentage point difference in the observed spread versus what we thought the spread was going to be suggests to me that the weight of the argument is overwhelmingly in the direction of M1-B being understated, whether it's because of money market mutual funds or whatever While I'm under no illusions that we knew exactly the relationship last January either, that alone leads me to the conclusion that I simply am not nearly as preoccupied with what the statistical measure of M1-B is versus what I think the reality is   Mr Chairman, I certainly would agree that the economy is soft We even have some sense of that in the Ninth Federal Reserve District at this point And that softness is well reflected in statistics and in business behavior and sentiment My own personal hunch would be that the fourth quarter at least could be even softer than the staff is now suggesting But at the same time I also sense that there is at least a residue of optimism in terms of the longer- term outlook and expectations In part that grows out of people looking ahead to the tax cut and in part out of some of these pent-up demands that people have been talking about There also is still some lingering hope that the inflation rate may be coming down in a meaningful way, although recent events perhaps have not worked in the direction of reinforcing that The relevant point here is that if we want to talk about a sustained recovery--whether it starts in the second quarter or the third quarter--the sustainability quotient is going to depend on two or three critical things One is bending down that inflation rate, including the wage side Another is the budget situation, which hasn't even been mentioned here, and as I would look at that right now recent events seem to have worked in the direction of making it harder rather than easier to get on with the further adjustments that have to be made in that area The other thing that is very important in connection with sustainability is that we simply have to create and maintain an environment in which some of these very serious liquidity and balance sheet strains that are all over the economy can be turned around And achieving that turnaround under the best of circumstances is not something that is going to be done quickly or easily It's going to take some time, which in turn implies that it will not be done in an environment in which we have these zigzag patterns of interest rates and these zigzag patterns of economic activity That leads me very much in the direction that Governor Gramley suggested And fundamentally it leaves me with the view that we ought to be proceeding slowly and deliberately with respect to this interest rate situation, even though I, too, obviously would conclude that there is some further latitude that can be constructively used here But I think we have to be cautious and we  -23-    11/17/81  have to try to avoid some of the problems of the past as we try to walk this very thin line   I didn't say anything--   Well, I've always been elliptical looking!   I have been thinking about alternative directive formulations this morning, too I must say I struck out because of the very problems we're running into here already My preference at this point would be to have the directive state the aggregate numbers for October to December that are in alternative C with the language "or somewhat higher" with borrowings at $350 to $400 million I could accept combining that formulation with a federal funds rate of 10 to 15 percent, simply because I think it's going to be hard to get the aggregates specifications even in alternative C, given the economy But I do think that kind of language formulation, notwithstanding Frank Morris's concerns, is more prudent and safer in terms of people understanding what we're doing And obviously, if the aggregates were soft, we still would have the opportunity to use the consultation procedure to make further judgments as we go along   No I said notwithstanding his concern about how to explain why we're now at 5-3/4 percent instead of 7 percent I think that can be dealt with No, I'm talking about "C" or somewhat higher and, as I said, I could go with 10 to 15 percent for the funds rate band simply because I think it's going to be hard to hit any of these things   That's my preference, too I'm saying I could live with it   The shortfall in October is the easiest one in the world to--   The next six weeks matters, too, if we get borrowings down to whatever that frictional level is I agree with Governor Schultz; I have a hunch that the frictional level of borrowing is higher than Steve was suggesting, although I can't be sure   Look what happened in August and September   Did that happen in those weeks that you mentioned last year?   The way you stated it, isn't really the operative question how fast we want to get to that frictional level of borrowing? If we started with $400 million and a 6 percent path as  -43-    11/17/81  distinct from $400 million and an 8 percent path, doesn't the operative question then reduce to how fast we want that borrowing level to get down to whatever that frictional level is?   I would still argue that if we're going to get there, I'd rather get there in an orderly way I would start off constructing the path off 6 percent with the borrowings at $400 million and if we have to adjust, we have to adjust But I would want to get there in a deliberate, orderly way if we have to get there   I don't know I'm not sure I agree with that   My concern is getting into the realm of this frictional level of borrowings I'm not sure I know what it means, but in my own mind's eye I have to leave room for the possibility that getting there could result in a situation where we would get a buildup in excess reserves and the federal funds market would really fall apart That may be an outlier concern, but I have it   But on the reserve path, it's only different by $40 million   That's the problem   If we put the "somewhat higher" thing in there, that makes it explicit  SPEAKER(?) Sure   Regardless of what number we pick, if we put "___ percent or somewhat higher," it makes it explicit that we're not going to run up the borrowing if the money supply comes in stronger   What if we took your language there--I'm not sure I have it right--and got rid of the business about the generally declining interest rates and next year's targets, and just had the initial reference to 7 percent growth for the quarter We could put in a phrase that said the Committee sought growth in the monetary aggregates consistent with the 7 percent, taking account of the shortfall in October, and said nothing else   Well, it means we could go ahead and construct a path--   I was trying to get around the problem some people have with declining interest rates and next year's targets   Yes, one each way   Didn't we have something like that in the directive in April or May of last year, Steve?   And we weren't faced with zero borrowings   I didn't say it very well, Governor Partee, but that's the gist of what I was trying to say before   What was that first alternate directive language you had earlier in the meeting about five hours ago? The one that we didn't have [in front of us]   No There was some nuance in there that allowed you to keep the 7 percent quarterly number   But isn't the presumption clear enough there that if it's lower, we would respond the same way?   Why don't you ask who will accept 10-1/2?   Yes The scope of the cutbacks that General Motors announced on Friday for their white collar workers was rather astonishing They are freezing pay, cutting back vacations from six    12/21-22/81  weeks to two weeks, and putting in a major cost-sharing provision in their medical insurance programs--all three at once   Well, obviously, in this case they chose to do the [cutbacks of] white collar workers with a view toward trying to influence the [labor union] negotiations But doing that kind of thing for 150,000 white collar workers is a big, big bite   In terms of the business picture, this is a bit of an outlier observation, but some of the business types that I  -11-    12/21-22/81  have been talking to, in the Minneapolis area at least, clearly are already at the point where they are looking across the valley Even from the nonfinancial types I don't get that sense of gloom that Mr Solomon and Mr Boehne are picking up I think there is a recognition that we have had a very, very steep decline; but they are already clearly looking out to what they think is going to be a very strong second half of next year   Mr Chairman, given all that has been said here about the problems with M1-B, I would point out a little arithmetic exercise we did I had my people go all the way back to October of 1979 and construct from the fourth quarter of 1979 the level of M1-B that we should have in the fourth quarter of this year  -33-    12/21-22/81  assuming that we had achieved the midpoints of all the targets that the Committee has had for that whole period of almost 2-1/2 years   No, the long-run targets   Right   Right   Yes Now, doing these numbers gets a little tricky, but let me just point out for the record that the target level of M1-B that comes out of that exercise is $4292 billion The actual level, leaving aside the last two weeks in December, is $4286 billion, a whopping difference of $600 million Perhaps things aren't quite as bad as we make them out to be   My own view, Frank, would be that the errors over the period haven't been all that big There has been some luck and there have been some ups and downs, but when you look at the performance of policy over the whole period, I don't think it is all that bad It could be better, but certainly it isn't something that one has to be ashamed of by any stretch of the imagination That is where I start from I am under no illusions, of course, that we can measure M1-B right now I don't think we can And I think these discussions about what model would say what really miss the point because in order to have a model you still have to plug in the money supply number to get the GNP out the other end And quite apart from one's views about monetarism, models, or anything else, there is a legitimate question as to what to put in on the money assumptions  My instinct, however, in thinking about the 1982 targets, is to leave them where they are In the case of M1, I think the likelihood is great that we will continue to see strong forces working in the direction of a continuation of the so-called downward shift in the demand for M1-B I don't see those forces lessening; as a matter of fact, if anything, I think they will remain as strong or maybe strengthen further But even if that is the case, I still have some concern that later in the year the targets that we have for M1-B, even allowing for some further shift adjustment, could prove very difficult to hit if the economy were to pick up the way the staff is projecting, recognizing that there are an awful lot of private forecasts around that would place the economy stronger in the second half of the year than the staff has So, my point here is that even under the best of circumstances those targets for narrow money, particularly as we get out in the year, will prove to be ambitious And in fact it may be  -34-    12/21-22/81  that the only way they will prove workable in that timeframe is in association with a price performance that is a little better perhaps than is currently being forecast Incidentally, Jim, what was the CPI this morning?   Anyway, as I said, unless we get a little luckier on prices, I think those targets could be ambitious even allowing for demand shifts On M2 I find myself attracted to Governor Partee's comments yesterday I think there is a possibility that we could see some rebound in savings in the fundamental underlying sense next year At least as far out as one can reasonably see, cash-type investments are probably going to continue to look pretty good And I, at least, am inclined to the view that the IRA account could be a bigger factor than most of the discussion around the table has suggested so far It is very attractive to begin with, but the fact that so many companies are going ahead with payroll deduction plans will make it such a simple thing and so attractive from an ease of transactions point of view that that could really generate some momentum in these accounts as the year unfolds I must say I am perplexed as to what that means I might even be prepared to make an argument that IRA accounts don't belong in M2 because they are a much more permanent type of savings than are the other [components of] M2 I get that feeling a little more so when I recognize that it is only the pure coincidence of who is managing an IRA account that is going to determine whether it ends up in the banking system or someplace else The distinction is pretty arbitrary as to whether a particular IRA ends up as a component of M2 or in a money market instrument of some kind or another And I would at least raise the question of whether they belong in M2 at all But if we have them in M2, they alone could create some real problems in terms of the upper limit of the target for M2 That would lead me a bit in the direction that Governor Gramley suggested yesterday even though I am hesitant, to put it mildly, to change any of these targets, although they were only tentatively agreed upon by the Committee in July That is it   That is right   That is right   That is what the payroll deduction could do   This really gets murky because people can [wait to put in the] money all the way out until April of 1983   They can put it in [then] and get the tax deduction for 1982   Well, that's the problem with turnover One of the ways that people use the money market mutual funds is that they write a check at the end of the month against them and put it in their checking account and then write 20 checks against the one check And if you just measure turnover, you get one check   You'd have a shift-adjusted M2   That would be November-to-March then, Steve?   I am comfortable with Mr Solomon's variation of "B," although I'd like to think of the initial borrowing as more like $400 million or maybe a bit higher rather than the $350 million that Tony suggested just because I'd still like to leave a little room down the road But, basically, I'd go along with something like Mr Solomon's suggestion   So 4 and 9 percent would be the numbers in the directive?   Is that an illusion or elusion?   That's not going to help M2, though   And missing them by a large amount   I like "about 4 and 9"   We still have to draw the path, which makes a difference   I have a preference for 4 and 9 percent, but not on the cosmetics It is a small distinction but I still think the economy will turn around, and I would like to have the leeway down the road rather than now But the initial borrowing of $300 million is fine with me   In this particular case we can probably get away with it a little more easily simply because of this problem of going from shift-adjusted to non shift-adjusted I hadn't thought of that That really does make a difference in terms of our transition   Is that a personal reference?   Let me pick up, John, if I may, on the point that Tony started to get at I think there's a natural coincidence of conversation about the downside phenomenon here, but this real/nominal interest rate issue strikes me as something that really may cut the other way, even if it's only in the realm of possibility As I look at all of the numbers here, basically, you have nominal interest rates unchanged between 1981 out to 1983 And that's true whether it's mortgage rates or bill rates But at the same time, you do have in that time frame a very sharp change in the measured rate of inflation, ending up with 57 percent or something like that in 1983 My question is Isn't it at least conceivable, everything else equal, that you could end up with quite different nominal interest rates,    2/1-2/82  particularly when you're also talking about higher savings? In Mike's flow-of-funds tables, I must say I am struck by the fact that even with the deficits the way you have them, total funds raised as a percentage of GNP is down fairly sharply from where it was as recently as 1980 Now, I wouldn't project it, but isn't there clearly some [possibility that], if things worked a little differently, we could be looking at something much more favorable in terms of nominal and real interest rates?   You have mortgage rates on there   But Chuck, under that argument, if you didn't have the 42 percent, you could end up with the best of both worlds in the sense that all credit demands were interest sensitive and the real economy could be stronger even though you had lower deficits   Well, Mr Chairman, we tried to look at this question of the money supply both analytically and by relying on anecdotal information as well Let me just touch on each of these briefly On the analytical side, we really looked at two things One was the seasonal adjustment, and there I guess what we found is a bit of good news and bad news There was good news in the sense that using a different procedure than X-11 one could point to a pattern of weekly movements in January that is quite different from the one that the official numbers suggest Now, I don't mean to imply that one method is better than the other But it really tends to underscore how extremely volatile these seasonal factors are and how badly they can lead us astray in a given period of time The second thing we did is probably more important We tried to take a quick and dirty look at this question of how the measured money supply responds to changes in interest rates, recognizing that there are at least some people on the staff--it's not many--who argue that if you go back and look at declines in interest rates in the late summer and fall of 1981, maybe what we have been seeing over the last 3 months isn't all that unusual We tried to look at that and found at least in a very tentative way that perhaps more of what we've seen can in fact be explained by declines in interest rates earlier on Indeed, while this work is very tentative since it has been done in only about 8 days, it does suggest that the response in money to changes in interest rates or shocks in the federal funds rate is a lot greater than I thought possible And it may well argue that the problem isn't so much too quick a response on the part of policy but the other way around That the harder we hit the short-run blip in the money supply by jiggling reserve paths or whatever the more we may be creating a worse problem for ourselves a little further down the road in the sense that by hitting it hard it builds in this perpetuating cycle that we've seen a little of over the past 2-1/2 years or so Of course, the argument could be made the other way as well I don't know the answer yet, but certainly this work does suggest that more of the increase in money than I thought possible can be explained, at least by this exercise, by what happened to interest rates earlier And to my way of thinking that's not inconsistent with the argument    2/1-2/82  that we ought to respond more slowly rather than faster to some of these temporary blips in the money supply  But even under the best of circumstances, I don't think either of those factors can fully explain the more recent developments in January And there we did try to develop some anecdotal information Certainly in our case we were able to find on the business side patterns of window-dressing by large corporations that involved larger amounts of money than both they and their bankers said had been typical in earlier years And that phenomenon was very short-lived, which of course is compatible with the idea of that big bulge in business-type checking accounts in the first week with washouts in the next two weeks On the household-type checking accounts, NOWs and so on, we really don't have much to add In our area, in terms of Frank's point, we too didn't see many new accounts It was all existing accounts The bankers and others we talked to basically made the argument that we have some kind of precautionary phenomenon here, some of it related to the economy and unemployment, some of it related to uncertainties about the interest rate outlook, some of it maybe related to savings flows themselves, and some of it-- at least in the case of our own employees in the Bank, based on a little informal survey we did--related just to a desire to build up larger balances to pay off bills incurred in December faster than they might ordinarily do That's about it   Is that another way of saying, Steve, that you view the midpoints of the tentative ranges for M1 and M2 for '82 as consistent with each other in a structural sense?   May I ask one other definitional question? I saw the comment in the Bluebook about retail repos Has a decision been made to take the IRAs out of M2?   What about the ones that are already there?   There's a footnote on page 12   Mr Chairman, I too have been around this a lot of different ways, and basically I come out to the view that we ought to maintain the targets that were adopted tentatively last July, in part for the reasons that Governor Schultz articulated and for a few others as well I wouldn't be allergic to trying to do something with this base issue, but I've looked at that a number of ways and I'm not sure how to do it in a way that doesn't add more confusion rather than less I am still a little concerned that any change we make here among the ranges that are being discussed is going to be perceived as tinkering that won't materially influence where things come out anyway And I think we have to give some consideration one way or another to changing the targets at a point in time when some people are telling us to change them as well To me at least all of those things point to--   Basically, the way I read the newspapers and things like that, the message that seems to be coming through both from the Hill and the Administration is that it's time to change this monetary policy in some [way] The money supply has to be allowed to grow faster and it will grow faster even with the existing targets But my point is that if we change the targets, the risk we run is a little different than just the risk Governor Schultz was referring to I think we run the risk that credibility will be affected in a more amplified way because of the perception that the Fed has buckled under again; they always have and they always will And that just elevates the concern that Governor Schultz spoke of   Well, that's the kind of thing I had in mind when I mentioned this point Now, I know it can cut either way in terms of being responsive on the one hand or being whipsawed on the other hand As I look at it, particularly in the context of M1, which is the measure most people seem to want to look at, no matter what we do to the targets we're going to be looking at a rate of growth on a comparable basis that is going to be above last year Indeed, if we ended up at the midpoint of the current range, M1 growth would be    2/1-2/82  roughly 2 percentage points above last year's growth even though it is still within the tentative targets I do recognize, as I said, that maybe something can be done with the base, although I'm not sure how to do it Personally, I would have sympathy for the notion that maybe M2 is a little incompatible with M1 or from a presentational point of view maybe talking about an M1 range of 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent Just changing the bottom and not changing anything else doesn't matter, and I wouldn't fight that to death But anything that comes across as a systematic raising of these targets--raising them all, for example, instead of maybe raising the bottom end of just one--will cause us to run into some problems  On this question of what growth is left for the [remainder of the] year, I am very sensitive to that as well I would just observe that all these lines in the Bluebook are drawn more or less on the assumption that we will go through the year without having any negative months I don't know when we're going to have them, whether it will be February or July or whatever, but the one thing I am sure of is that we will have some negative months So, I don't think the situation is quite as bleak as the pattern one gets just by drawing those straight lines off of that January number In a nutshell, I'd like to see us retain the targets either at or pretty close to where they are   But doesn't that argue that if we stay with the $15 billion, we're going to get lower interest rates anyway?   I have just one little anecdote here We talk about all these statistics all the time, and I would note for the record that many of the people who are always telling us what to do tell us we should look at the monetary base If you look at the monetary base for 1981, it's actually quite stable on a quarterly basis But the most interesting thing is that the growth rate of the monetary base was slowest in the fourth quarter when the growth of the money supply was fastest And I think there's a little message there  As to the substance of the short-run decision that we will be making, I personally would have quite a strong preference for having something like the second alternative directive [shown in the Bluebook] as our basic marching order, with M1 at zero and M2 at 9 percent I would be very comfortable with a funds rate range of 12 to 16 percent I for one would feel very, very strongly that we should maintain a band on the federal funds rate for some of the reasons that have already been stated I don't think there is a great deal of misunderstanding in the marketplace as to what that band means right now; most people know exactly what it means So, I would be very uncomfortable getting away from having a federal funds rate band, and I would fix it at 12 to 16 percent On the borrowings, again, I would feel fairly strongly that we should start at $15 billion At least as I read the Bluebook and look at what has happened even since this Bluebook was written, I would interpret the staff's analysis as saying that over the intermeeting period as a whole a borrowing level of $15 billion should be compatible, from where we are right now, with both lower interest rates and a lower actual level of borrowing That's how I would look at it, Mr Chairman   On a quarterly average basis, I think it is the slowest growth rate of the year    2/1-2/82   $25 billion?   This is a reversal of Nancy's problem  SPEAKER(?) Imagery   With it being clear that if something were to change, we would be making the base adjustment?   But if we have Governor Gramley's situation now and we did end up rebasing, say, in March or something like that, the combination of rebasing and being in the upper part of that M1 range produces a couple of percentage points at least in terms of the money growth that is implied just by looking at the midpoint for the period from March through December   And it would be rebased   I don't know; frankly, I am very troubled at the prospect of opening up this rebasing issue and changing the M2 target I think Governor Schultz is right on the mark on this question The issue, as Governor Teeters suggests, is getting unemployment down and all the rest, but not for a quarter or two The issue in some sense is trying to be supportive of a sound approach to fiscal policy But we are sitting here looking at a fiscal situation that is just untenable And one of the concerns I have--and maybe it is tilting at our windmills a little--is that if the perception is that we really are easing, any prospect of being able to do better on the fiscal side is weakened as well because that creates the impression that we are going to sit here and monetize all that debt I am under no illusion that we are going to have a magic wand come over fiscal policy in the next six months; but if we are perceived as easing, I think fiscal policy will go in the direction of further ease rather than the other way around So, I must say I would be troubled at the prospect of doing both of these things, because for the long term it does not produce the result of lower unemployment and healthier thrifts and all the rest I think it works the other way   Suppose interest rates come down and we get some bond financing?   Steve, you mentioned this 8 to 10 percent figure What is the dollar increase in the not seasonally adjusted M1 number in [unintelligible]?   That's a very big number now   So, roughly what you're saying here, in the context of the first two weeks in January, is that we have a situation where on a not seasonally adjusted basis we have 4 weeks out of the 52 in the year that account for a multiple of what the money supply is supposed to grow in a year Is that right?   That's absolutely crazy   Well, Mr Chairman, I certainly agree with the comments that have been made suggesting that while the economy may be bottoming out, it's pretty hard to find any evidence that much more than that is happening Indeed, even that could be transitory Several points have been made about financial strains or credit quality, call it what you will My own sense of that phenomenon is that the degree of uneasiness associated with that certainly has    3/29-30/82  increased and perhaps sharply so, even in the framework of the last 6 or 8 weeks For example, bankers in the Ninth Federal Reserve District, who aren't used to those kinds of things, all of a sudden are speaking very openly and candidly and with some real concern in terms of how they are now looking at the situation At least in our area, the clear deterioration in the farm sector has something to do with that It's always hard to make a judgment as to the underlying situation in the farm sector because farmers tend to make it sound bad even when it's good But, certainly, both the anecdotal and the hard information that one can pull together would suggest that we are perhaps on the threshold of a very troubling situation in the agricultural sector I'm not sure what can be done about it, perhaps nothing The thought crossed my mind that perhaps we should dust off the seasonal borrowing program and talk about it a little as a way of maybe trying to provide a little help there But it clearly is troublesome  On the inflation side, I think the evidence of a slowing or moderation is getting more and more pervasive About the only place I can't see any hard evidence of it is in some of the white collar service areas, including banking and finance   I left that to you  SPEAKER(?) What is that smile on Steve's face?   The other thing that is taking on a slightly different tone is what I guess I would call a level of frustration that is associated with the interest rate situation itself Many people look at the obvious inflation [improvement] and they look at interest rates and they see these enormous premiums Regardless of what those premiums precisely reflect, in a sense there seems to be nothing that is going to get rid of that problem I don't think it's something that people--at least in a major way--are blaming the Federal Reserve for Indeed, one gets some feeling that people do recognize that at this point at least the Federal Reserve is locked in to some extent, and I think that's right At least as I would look at it, when you question what could be done by the Federal Reserve to try to deal with that problem, the hard fact of the matter is that we have very little room to maneuver I personally can't see how we're going to get much relief from that when we're looking at, in Mr Kichline's case, $160 billion deficits Nor can I see, without taking exception with your forecast, Jim, any real possibility for any kind of sustainable growth in the economy with this fiscal situation the way it is I'd like to think that political and other forces would be brought to bear to do something there, but I don't see that happening either So, I come out with the sense that we are indeed between a rock and a hard place at this point   There's an element of perversity Some schools want to raise their tuition by a whole bunch just because they think it makes them an attractive school It's perverse but true  That is literally true   Well, Mr Chairman, as to the comments that have been made, ranging from chasing aggregates to the NOW account analysis, and did we have a bulge or didn't we What does it mean? The comments about leaving some room in the second half of the year I think are all relevant And in the context of this potential April bulge problem, they take on a special significance But I think they also relate in a fundamental way to an analytic problem that I don't think we have quite dealt with yet The manifestation of that analytic problem is the simultaneous phenomenon of a lot of interest rate variability and a lot of money supply variability We sit here, of course, and make judgments about reserve paths and we make judgments about changing those reserve paths But implicit in both setting the paths and changing the paths is this notion that it is ultimately changes in interest rates that are the trigger variable that sets in place the adjustments in portfolios that in turn ultimately reflect themselves in altered rates of growth of the money supply Now, that's all well and good But I think we have to keep some perspective on that The perspective that I think is important is the recognition that those interest rate changes are only one of the factors that determine the nature and pace of the portfolio adjustments that ultimately do reflect themselves in the rate of growth of the money supply In the context that we are operating now, it seems to me almost self-evident that the nature of those adjustments in response to any pattern of interest rate change has in itself changed Indeed to take the extreme--and this is relevant in the context of this April bulge--if we are going to smooth out all those bulges and all those short-run blips in the money supply, we must be prepared to get to the point where the interest rate impact that we can create by changing reserve paths is large enough to outweigh all those other factors, ranging from seasonal adjustment factors on up Now, as it may impact on the observed behavior of the money supply in the short run, we must be prepared at the extreme to do that in a context in which, at least in my mind, the jury is out as to what the nature of the interest elasticity of money demand is Indeed, I still find myself, at times at least, attracted to the argument that in some sense we may be creating some of the variability that we have seen in both money and interest rates by the nature of our own activities I'm not persuaded of that, but at least I have to leave my mind open to it  In that analytical setting, I must say I would be a little troubled with the prospect of aggressively chasing a bulge in the money supply in April, even though that would prolong the amount of  -44-    3/29-30/82  time that we might be over the stated targets for the behavior of M1 for this year Again, from an analytical point of view, I think Mr Axilrod's earlier comments are relevant here If that were to happen, it does in some sense aggravate the problem But at the same time, if some of the speculation around the table about this NOW account phenomenon is accurate, one could still reasonably expect that the NOW account build-up would wind down later in the year and still would leave plenty of room for the kind of expansion in the economy that is implicit in the staff's forecast The long and the short of it from my point of view would be at this time to go slow indeed in terms of this April bulge, should it materialize I hope it doesn't because if it doesn't, we're obviously in pretty good shape in any event As to specifics, I would come out somewhere between "A" and "B" And if we got a bulge, and the net result were that we ended up with a quarter that looked like "A," that wouldn't bother me all that much either   But if the NOW accounts were starting to unwind, 3 percent wouldn't be the wrong thing to do   So, in those four weeks it averages to about $12 billion   It depends on whether we get the bulge or we don't get it   But in that case, doesn't that mean that the path effectively would have to be redrawn?   Not if we are quiet!   Well, if M1 is between 3 percent and 9 percent you're talking a minor thing, but if--   In the extremes--if it's greater than 9 percent or less than 3 percent--it's not minor   That's a variation of Partee's law, isn't it?   A sign of things to come, Mr Axilrod?   Are those annual averages, Jim?   Steve doesn't know the answer   On the economy, Mr Chairman, I made a forecast that looks like everybody else's, and the fact that everybody's forecast looks essentially the same is one of the things that worries me I think it suggests that none of us knows what is going to happen I do agree with all that has been said on the  -17-    6/30-7/1/82  downside risks I think that's where the problem may lie But there is at least a tinge of a different interpretation one could put on all that has been said, and that is that we may be losing sight of the fact that in all of this there are also some things that have occurred in the fairly recent past that aren't all bad The inflation improvement is no longer just a statistical aberration; it's very real We have a situation where in my judgment, for the first time perhaps in the postwar period, businesses are really looking at themselves They are not just going through the superficial aspects of counting noses and cleaning house in the conventional ways Beyond that, I think we do recognize that the consumer has done a reasonable job of getting his balance sheet in order There's the prospect, if we're right about a near-term recovery, that at least the deterioration in corporate liquidity in a statistical sense could moderate  Fundamentally, what I am suggesting is that in all the doom and gloom there are some elements that with a break or two might bode very well for the future rather than all being on the down side However, I do agree that the downside risks are there And they all come back to the question in some simplistic sense of the way to alter the balance of the risks that everybody has talked about It seems to me to reduce to the proposition of How do we get interest rates down? That's the one thing that would alter that balance of risks I don't want to sound too agnostic on this score but my sense of things is that jiggling the money supply and the ranges that we're talking about jiggling either in real terms or in target terms isn't the answer That is not what is going to get interest rates down The interest rate problem, as I see it, is a combination of an expectational phenomenon partly growing out of the fact that the reality of lower inflation has not sunk in--and maybe we shouldn't expect it to have sunk in this fast--but more fundamentally a continuing reflection of this overall Federal budget situation I think a great opportunity was missed a couple of months ago and that miss was very visible in the eyes not just of Wall Street but of Main Street Regardless of whether the number is $140 billion or $160 billion, the sense on the budget situation is that it is in fact deteriorating And it's very hard for me to see how, given that and the other factors I've mentioned, there's a lot we can do in jiggling monetary policy that really is going to get at that fundamental problem in the near term of lowering interest rates, which again I think is the only thing that really can alter the balance of risks  Taking that into this strategic discussion about the targets, let me do it backwards by looking at 1983 first I very plainly would come out in favor of leaving the 1983 targets where the 1982 targets are, across the board I would do that partly in the context of saying that there is more than the usual amount of uncertainty But I might also suggest, depending upon what we do for 1982, that keeping the same targets for 1983 might well produce a situation in which the actual growth of money in 1983 is lower than in 1982 But I certainly wouldn't be disposed to do anything now other than restate for '83 the targets from '82 Now, on the question of the '82 targets, I do count myself in the camp of those who would say "Let's stick with what we have" I say that for a couple of reasons First of all, I am willing to put my bet on the proposition that we will get some rise in velocity in the second half of the year I say that partly because I do think that some of that NOW account activity could wind down; and I    6/30-7/1/82  also would suggest that the kind of velocity increase that we would need to achieve in order to see the economy behaving something like Jim's forecast isn't all that big If we had 5 percent money growth in the second half of the year, that would leave us in pretty good shape vis-a-vis the M1 target   Well, I don't think we would be all that bad off My point is that if we had something like that, it gets the kind of economy that Jim is projecting You're talking maybe about a 4 percent velocity [increase] or something, which doesn't strike me as all that unusual in those circumstances So, analytically, I don't find it hard to envision a set of circumstances in which we could produce that result But beyond that, I must say, along with Tony, that even if we're talking about changing the target by a point, it strikes me as adding an element of precision to something that inherently is not all that precise And if we get a bulge in July and we change the targets, I could be really cynical and say that then the markets are going to say "My word, they're really going to miss" And are we any better off? I don't know But the fact of the matter is that even if we miss by a point, that's not a lot It's $4 billion or something like that We get weekly changes that exceed that So, I would stay where we are I think changing them, particularly in the context of the fiscal situation, does entail a very high risk of some significant loss in credibility when all that has been achieved so far is so fragile I don't want to lose that There are a lot of different ways to skin this, Mr Chairman, but I would hope that perhaps between now and when you ultimately have to testify we can at least find the time to look at some of the presentational aspects of those target ranges which I think hurt us as well, whether we change the targets or not I don't want to get into that in any great detail now, but while 1 percentage point sounds like a lot, $3 or $4 billion on a quarterly average basis doesn't sound like a lot to me   You could draw a line   Something doesn't sound right   Could we have the numbers, Steve? This is getting ridiculous Could we have the June-to-September numbers for page 10 that reflect your current estimate of June?   That might be better than what we have now, because right now we have--   Well, Mr Chairman, I'd like first to ask Paul Meek Where does the market think we want borrowings right now?   Well, that's understandable, but--   That's the market perception Steve, could I ask you, too Back in April, when we were looking at a similar situation in terms of a money supply burst, we adopted a path; but as I recall we had some kind of fail-safe understanding How did we finesse that?   But there was some understanding--   Well, fundamentally, I'd start off by saying that the thought of doing something that would be construed as a basic change in policy right now is totally unappealing to me I just don't think the time is right to do that I am very sensitive to the problem of an increase in interest rates But if July really turns out to be a problem, I think we can finesse that, for example, by doing something like we did in April And I would certainly want to do all the finessing we could do in that event My instincts, in terms of the short term, are very much driven by the same considerations that I mentioned yesterday in the context of the long term I don't think there is a heck of a lot that we can engineer that is going to produce some fail-safe reduction in interest rates, much less an absolute assurance that they won't rise I would lean toward Governor Gramley's earlier suggestion, which if I understood it was basically to focus on the September numbers as we see them As he worked it through, I think he was suggesting maintaining quantitative money targets that are something like those in "A," but preserving in that context the funds rate and borrowings targets that are more or less compatible with "B" That would be quite satisfactory to me Borrowings would be $800 or $900 million, or something like that I don't care whether we put the funds rate range at 10 to 15 percent or 10 to 16 percent; I don't think it matters a whole lot But I would look for the possibility of putting in the directive something that does allow a little more flexibility in accommodating any real aberration in July   What is the level you get with that, Lyle, for September?   I see; that's right   Couldn't we put something in the directive, Mr Chairman, that says we are shooting for about 5 percent with the understanding that we would be tolerant of unusual developments in the money supply early in the period, associated with the tax reduction and all that, and use that as--well, as our excuse?   If we use that argument, you can even put Milton Friedman's statement in your testimony   But doesn't it imply, Steve, whatever tendency might be there because of the fundamentals, that things should if anything be easier in early July rather than tighter?   The dollar increase in the money supply in early July   Well, isn't the point here that if the end-of- June numbers held up and we drew the path with the monthly pattern as it is in alternative B in the Bluebook, with an initial level of borrowings of $800 million, that anything less than roughly a $10 billion increase in the money supply in early July should produce an easing of money market conditions?   So we do that and we take account of liquidity preferences and--   I like the 32nd!   In terms of this bulge issue--and I think it's worth voting on--given what has happened in the first two quarters, I don't think the market is going to be anywhere near as sensitive to--   The July bulge is a different finesse   The way we want to handle the initial borrowings--   We can seasonally adjust it, though   Also, by not changing it now, we may be working in a direction of creating the flexibility to be able to change one of these targets sometime later   No, I think this time it works the other way   Well, for the '83 numbers I was thinking more in terms of when we have to review them again next February If we state now that in effect we're going to leave them where they are because we don't know where to put them, that works in the direction of giving us the flexibility then to change them in February At least that's the way I would envision the logic of this   This year?   I think what Nancy is saying is that she wants to put a number on the tolerance   That's what Governor Partee wants to do   I assume, Gretchen, in answer to Governor Wallich's question, that all of these people would have a number that is larger than one   What we should say to them on this is not to worry too much about this mix question just yet My inclination would  -93-    6/30-7/1/82  be just to state that there is no evidence to speak of that the underlying structural problem of the deficit has been dealt with And as long as we're faced with prospects for deficits [of the magnitude] that Mr Kichline has for 1983, there's simply not room for the economy to behave in a reasonable way This analysis-- with those flow of funds numbers, as imperfect as they are--to me is just overwhelming We can't have the government soaking up 50 percent of the credit in the whole economy and expect that the economy is going to work well It's an intolerable situation That just can't work And there is nothing we can do in terms of wiggling the money supply by a couple of percentage points that is going to make a big difference as long as we have that situation   That's what I mean by the statement that the underlying structural problem simply has not been dealt with   Again, those GNP comparisons are interesting; but the one that just hits me dead between the eyes is that 50 percent of the total credit flows in the economy [will be taken by government]   That's correct It's going to grow We can debate whether we have a crowding out problem today But if we get into '83 and have any kind of growth in the economy and any kind of private credit demand building up because of healthy developments in the economy, boom, there's no place to go   Not I   Can't you make the point that if we have this brave new world where all these nice things would--   Can you make the analytical point, to give ourselves a little more movement and maneuvering room, that if this problem were dealt with, it would leave open the possibility at least that the public's demand for money--the thing we call money--might be higher at any level of interest rates? So, in those circumstances, quite apart from Henry's arguments, we might conclude that a higher money growth rate would be entirely appropriate and not in any way associated with higher inflation   Yes   I have a little of the same uneasiness I don't want to muddy us up with another suggestion but one thing that might take care of both of these concerns would be after the comma to say "and would continue to evaluate developments in the light of any evidence of unusual precautionary demands" Maybe I'm splitting hairs, but to me that would suggest a posture not unlike what in fact we did during the first half of the year and it might also get at Tony's point a little in suggesting that we're not talking about letting this go crazy on us   Peter, where does the market think the funds rate should be? Or does it have any idea?   Assuming a further--?   We'd get a bigger bulge!   I'd start off with the point that if we find that some of these financial things we're worrying about begin to come a little more unglued, obviously, a lot of this somewhat technical discussion about borrowing levels and all the rest will have to go by the boards But abstracting from that, it seems to me that one of the key questions implicit in what has been said already is whether or not interest rates are at sustainable levels for, say, a few months or quarters I have some concern that they may not be And it seems to me, in view of all the financial strains and concerns, that one of the things we have to be particularly sensitive to is the possibility of another whipsaw effect in the markets where, despite our actions, we find interest rates rising again I'm not sure how to do that My own view on the economy, which I think is relevant, is that with the general range of rates that we're talking about I would still look to a modest recovery in the fourth quarter out into 1983, and maybe even a recovery that is a bit stronger than what the staff has in the Greenbook But, certainly, I'm a little more cautious in that statement than I would have been even a month ago  As to the money supply numbers I must say, like Governor Rice, I don't have a strong preference one way or another between "A" and "B" And, Steve, if I'm reading that table on page 13 in the Bluebook right, I think it suggests that building off either alternative we're looking at a growth rate of, say, 5 or 6 percent in the fourth quarter, which still would get us to around the top of the range for this year Is that correct?   Well, that just reinforces my view I don't have a strong view; I could go with "A" just as easily as "B" I do think that a critical question in the short run is where the funds rate is and where the borrowings are Again, just because I am perhaps a little more sensitive to the sustainability of the current general pattern of interest rates, I would probably lean toward a borrowings level in the $350 million area I don't want to sound too precise here, but I'd probably be more comfortable with the funds rate in the 9-1/2 percent area right now than I would seeing it below 9 percent But, unless we're very lucky and the money supply behaves exactly the way the Bluebook suggests so that the nonborrowed reserve path behaves exactly the way it suggests--neither of which will happen--we have a Catch-22 If money is stronger, interest rate pressures will build; and if it's weaker, the tendency will be for us to adjust the nonborrowed path at some point, and that would aggravate the problem that Governor Wallich spoke about in terms of the discount rate and the funds rate The only way I can see out of that is to lower the discount rate and try to nudge up the federal funds rate at the same time I'm not sure how to produce that result, but it seems to me that that's the result we want   I might shade it up   That's my Catch-22 At the moment, I am suggesting that I think the probabilities are that we are going to be on the other side of the Catch-22   That should really make you worry!   I'm getting more and more nervous about this [wording] Again, I have no problems with any of this, but this language or prospective language about unusual volatility or instability or whatever we put in there runs at least some risk, it seems to me, of a self-fulfilling prophecy down the road   I started out liking it, but I'm getting more and more gun-shy about it I'm not sure it's the right way to go   What I'm suggesting is that when that language is published, even though it will be some time from now, it entails some risk--and I didn't think it was much until I listened to this discussion--that we are telling the world that things are a lot worse than the world thinks they are   That's precisely what worries me As I listen to the discussion, I'm beginning to think it's a bit too much of a red flag   Why don't we put some language in there that doesn't have those sensational sounding adjectives Use a range of 7 to 10 percent, say, but add a phrase such as "giving due regard to evolving financial and credit market conditions" That gives some greater flexibility without--   Well, no I think what Paul is looking for is something a little more than that   Why don't you have a show of hands on--   Even then, we still could get a very sizable buildup in M1 balances in connection with the account It's very simple to conceive of that situation even with a $1,000 limit   With all this understandable talk about Mexico and all the rest, you didn't say a word about small banks at the other end of the spectrum But I think it's relevant to this general conversation We started about four or five months ago carefully monitoring the small banks in the Ninth District The monitoring takes several forms, including literally getting an instant picture of an examination the minute it is completed, and we are compiling lists of one-bank holding companies [in difficulty] The criteria that we used was that if a one-bank holding company will consume at least 75 percent of the bank's 1981 earnings to meet its debt service requirements in 1982, it is on the list It's really striking, to put it mildly, to see the number of institutions that fall into that category in the case of the one-bank holding companies The number is substantial, and that of course assumes that they have the equivalent of 1981 earnings to work with in the future to meet these debt service requirements at the holding company level With the problem loans and the loan losses and this new instrument and all the rest, one could at least question the proposition that they're going to be able to retain those earnings Similarly, in the case of small banks, at least the ones that seem to be scattered around the Ninth District, it's not uncommon to see that the classified loans in the recent examination versus the last one are up anywhere from 200 to 500 percent As of yet most of that increase is in the commercial sector and the Main Street retailers There is not yet a major increase in the problem loans reflecting the agricultural sector itself But one has to wonder how long that can last, given what is going on right now  The other thing that I would observe in terms of these small and medium size banks that I think is directly relevant to what was said earlier is that it is rather astonishing to me to see the extent to which these regional and small institutions have money placed in the London market There are very logical and natural reasons why they should do that, and certainly we don't want to chase that money out of there right now Nevertheless, it is a form of exposure even in these banking organizations that ties in with this international situation and goes in many cases well beyond our general perceptions   Mr Chairman, I clearly would fall on the side of the argument that says we don't want an increase in interest rates, even by accident An increase in interest rates in the current setting, even if it came about by accident, would border almost on being irresponsible at this point On the other side, I'd like to think that maybe we could orchestrate a moderate and temperate and further gradual reduction in market interest rates In the current circumstances that inevitably calls into question relationships about the discount rate and our view about what frictional levels of borrowing really are, much as they did back in July when the last reduction of the discount rate took place But having said that, I would be somewhat uneasy to find ourselves in a situation where we are dealing with an unbridled attempt to force down interest rates as opposed to trying to nudge or orchestrate them in that direction So, in general, I have no great problem with what is being suggested here I would just throw out the idea, and I'm not sure how to do it, that one way we might dissipate some of the concern about the longer-run implications of this--or stated the other way, reinforce the view that it is a temporary thing--would be to put a sentence in the directive someplace that makes at least oblique reference to a continuing longer-run commitment to achieve moderate and declining monetary growth, perhaps in the context of the '83 targets or something like    10/5/82  that It's not easy to do But it might help deal with this perception problem   I don't think anybody reads the boilerplate The kind of thing I'm talking about, since I gather the Chairman intends to say something, could be dealt with in that way as well   There's a certain appropriateness to these two guys being last!  -47-    10/5/82   In terms of the range of proposals around the table, I can easily live with borrowings of $300 or maybe $350 million; I would have a small preference for putting a 7 to 10 percent federal funds range in the directive for no other reason than a desire to reinforce continuity at the margin    I think that second to the last sentence is very helpful   Who knows how the market will interpret it? I think the other argument is just as likely That the absence of it would lead to the view that we really have zeroed in on a specific number I don't know   I think the continuity argument has some real weight   I do get a little sense of it, at least in an anecdotal sense; there certainly are no hard statistics at this point But I do have a very distinct sense of a bit of a change in business attitudes and so forth just in the timeframe of the past month or so One place where it is very evident, as Jim mentioned, is in the housing sector There clearly is a little action developing--I don't want to say a burst of activity--in the housing sector  who is in the wood products business even acknowledged that in a very forceful way last week In terms of the number of plants making wafer board and that type of thing, all of a sudden they are back on 7-day workweeks So, I think there is something there More generally, I do perceive in a variety of places and contexts a sense that a bit of momentum is beginning to materialize   The commercial construction situation is really very, very bad Indeed, not only do I suspect that that sector of the economy is going to remain very soft for a long time but I think that is going to show through in another clustering of real problem situations for the people who are financing these buildings that are just being finished   It's not good Certainly, the price situation is terrible These people, though, really do have remarkable staying power, in our District anyway I sent my staff out to visit 6 or 8 major agricultural lenders to try to get a first-hand picture of what they thought was going on, and I was astonished We are seeing a lot of problem situations and problem loans and all the rest, but it's still the Main Street [retailers] and the implement dealers [that are mainly affected]; the farmers themselves are hanging in there pretty well The livestock people, again despite low prices for livestock, are benefitting obviously from lower grain, feed, and energy prices So they actually are hanging in there in a reasonable fashion But with regard to farm-sector purchases of any equipment, they are virtually non-existent   There's a point that I think is lost here We keep talking about the fact that interest rates have come down I don't know what the real interest rate is, but if you look at the relationship between current nominal interest rates and current rates of inflation, the reduction in real interest rates, if it's there at all, certainly is not very significant   Mr Chairman, the way I view the current situation is that I just don't think it's possible that the economy can stumble along at essentially zero growth for much longer The financial strains that are there just won't permit it If we float around zero for too much longer, with very little difficulty we could end up in a more severe downside situation It is clear from the international side that the LDCs need to generate some exports On the domestic side, I suppose some consolation can be drawn from recent developments in the financial markets but, underneath all that, the extremely serious financial strains are still very much with us My own bet is that, even with the current interest rate structure or something very much like it, the prospects for some growth in real terms emerging in early 1983 and getting up in a range of 4 percent or so are reasonably good But at the same time, while that is my own bet, I have to concede that the amount I'd be willing to wager at the moment is not much more than a nickel  There is another characteristic of the outlook for 1983 that I'd like to mention, too All the forecasts, of course, assume that unemployment is going to stay high no matter what I think something is going on that may make it stay even higher than the conventional forecasts And that is that a lot of businesses have really cut into their management and white collar work force during this correction period, and I think they are finding that they didn't need all those people As we begin to see a recovery, that phenomenon is probably going to make unemployment stay higher than it normally would, which simply is going to add more fuel to the fire  Having said all that, in terms of the alternatives that are before the Committee, if I understood them or if I thought they meant anything, I would be inclined to alternative B That may in one sense seem to contradict what I said earlier, but I don't think it really does Again, I'm not sure what any of it means, but the thrust of my  -27-    11/16/82  position is that I would tend to be a bit on the cautious side right now, [given] the monetary growth that we are seeing--whatever the numbers mean The potential is at least remotely there that we could find ourselves facing a bit of a problem in early 1983 The problem, other things being equal, might even call for a slight increase in interest rates It seems to me that that is a total no-win proposition That view is reinforced, at least in my mind, by the peculiarities of the operating environment that we are in If we have to snug up, regardless of what alternative we are working from, given the way the path is drawn and the operational mode that we are in, the snugging up process inherently is going to be slower and less precise than it would have been under the former procedures  The last thing that is relevant, in terms of being a bit cautious, is this new [financial] instrument It really won't hit until December, but it seems to me that it is going to depress the growth of M1 when it hits; and on top of that it is going to produce a shift from higher reserve requirement instruments to lower reserve requirement instruments, which as that begins to happen would in turn mean that a given reserve path, however drawn, might have different implications for the amount of money growth, however defined, one might have assumed in the first place That, too, leads me to the view of being a little cautious among those alternatives I would hedge my bet along the lines of Mr Guffey's suggestion of putting the borrowing level down a bit from the $350 million that the staff associated with Alternative B so that we could see a reduction in the funds rate coupled with or followed by a reduction in the discount rate I might even be prepared to go one step further If for technical reasons, we aren't able to orchestrate that, I'd be inclined to take my chances with a reduction of the discount rate even with the fed funds rate trading about where it is right now   One can't entirely dismiss that either  -30-    11/16/82   If one looked at the composition of M2 three years ago, what percentage were demand deposits and savings accounts then? I don't know but it was pretty big, wasn't it?   What about the exchange rate situation? Doesn't that situation give us a little more leeway in terms of being able to do something directly with the discount rate, without having to worry about finessing the market?  -42-    11/16/82   There you are   But if we do something like setting borrowings at $250 million and do whatever you want with the federal funds rate,  -45-    11/16/82  it seems to me that we have some reasonably high degree of assurance that we're not going to see interest rates higher than they are now; and depending upon finessing the market or [the Board's] willingness to do something with the discount rate in any event, there is the clear potential for lower rates In the worst of conditions, [the Board could] reduce the discount rate even if the fed funds rate is at 9-1/2 percent; [you would] just bite the bullet and do it My personal view is that the markets and everybody else would accept that   But I don't see that--   That will occur with reserves declining   I think one thing we would buy is inquiries for more information   If they see the directive, they are going to say "Well, I want to see the forecast that it is based on and all the rest of it"   That's the problem In terms of the argument that releasing the directive would take care of the leak problem, I'm concerned that it will work the other way If we put out the directive on the day of the meeting, in the form in which it is now written, we inevitably are going to get reporters snooping around asking "What does this really mean?" and trying to get interpretations And we will end up with more confusion and not less   That's easy to say But over a period of time--say we've put an absolute restriction on talking to the press for a week or something like that--that doesn't solve the problem    11/16/82   I don't know   Until we've had another meeting   Is there any question of that?   In the housing sector I do hear from bankers and thrift people that there's a lot in the pipeline that hasn't even shown up in mortgage commitment figures, much less in permits or starts So, notwithstanding the seasonal problem, I think there is some momentum there   Steve, in the larger paper, and I think in the Bluebook as well, the point is made on several occasions that we are left with a 2 percent average reserve requirement on M2 and 1-1/2 percent or whatever it would be on M3 The inference is that that is the problem My question is Is that the problem or is it the definitions [and] elasticities? Suppose we had an aggregate the size of M2 but it was a nice clean M2 like the old M1 or something like that, then wouldn't a 2 percent average reserve requirement be more than adequate?   I guess I understand I certainly agree with what you are saying in terms of the kinds of results we could face but I have some problems with the notion, even as you elaborated it, that the nub of the problem is that we have a 2 percent reserve requirement We would have the kinds of problems you're talking about if we had a 5 percent reserve requirement    12/20-21/82   The reason I asked the question is because you hold out the hope that when all this transition is through we may be able to go back to a happy world of M1 I have some trouble, given a reasonable guess as to what the components of M1 will be and what it is going to look like, seeing how even by June or July we are going to be able to operate in that happy little world   Well, Mr Chairman, we've heard from the theologians and now we will hear from someone who is maybe not agnostic but at least a little more eclectic To me it's very clear that we will continue to need some kind of rule that is more flexible I think we need that for the reasons of self defense, in a political sense, that have been identified by many others But we also probably will need it for a self-disciplinary reason as well The point will come, though I don't know when, when there will be a need to raise interest rates or to tighten or whatever you want to call it And for purposes of this Committee in terms of its internal functioning as well as its external relations, a rule serves a very good purpose Again, it should be a flexible rule, too There has been some question about nominal GNP and things like that I have a lot of problems with those kinds of objectives If we were to pick something at that level, I'd be more inclined to pick the price level, but even that to me is a can of worms It puts us in a no-win situation in terms of our ability to deal with other problems, the political problems included The biggest difficulty I have with a lot of the discussion, at least implicitly to this point, is that there seems to be some sense that after all these shifts have taken place our problems will go away I think that may be just when our problems will begin because after the shifts have taken place, each of the aggregates, M1 included, is going to mean a different thing in relationship to GNP and interest rates and velocity and the price level and everything else Now, we try to capture that difference by saying in some sense that the interest elasticity in the future will be at least different, and in most cases smaller, than it has been in the past But I'm not sure that even that statement fully captures the extent to which the various Ms will be indicators that tell us things in the future that have much of a bearing on what they have told us in the past  Whatever else all of that means, I think it does mean unequivocally that the danger of interest rate overkill, even with M1 after all these shifts have occurred, will be greater and indeed potentially significantly greater than it has been in the past I do think that for the next three or six months if need be we can probably muddle through--if that's the way to describe it--along the lines implied in the Bluebook and suggested in the larger paper, partly because we have a built-in smoke screen for that period and partly because, in my judgment at least, it will be extremely unlikely in that timeframe that we will have to come to grips with the need to tighten monetary policy materially My suspicion and my hope would be that when the transition is finished we will know enough about M1 that we can use it in a more flexible way, but I'm not even sanguine on that point It is probably a premature judgment But I do think, as may have been implied by Mr Guffey's comments, that at some point we are going to have to take a more in-depth look not just at the question of which of these indicators should serve as the primary guides to monetary policy, but a fresh look at the operating side-- questions as to how to draw a reserve path and what kind of response mechanism to build in automatically Otherwise, my hunch is that six months or nine months from now it is still going to be a pig-in-the- poke in terms of which one of these variables we think is best And if that's the case, what will become more important at that time is  -27-    12/20-21/82  the manner in which the Committee wants to go about trying to steer-- and I say steer, not control--the variable or variables that it thinks best suit its overall purposes   I think what a lot of this discussion really comes down to is that we're looking for some kind of steering mechanism that we can in some sense advertise as a target Much of the discussion has gravitated toward M2 as being put in the role of the primary steering mechanism or the primary target, and that's where I started out But I'm having some second thoughts even about that I would at least raise the question of whether we aren't underplaying M3 too much, by inference Normally, I would never say that But if you think about M3 in 1983, quantifiably it is going to be less subject to shifts than even M2 If you look at it in the post Regulation Q disintermediation period, in fact it has really been quite stable Whatever the relationship between any of these aggregates and GNP might be, the relationship between M3 in this period is also less susceptible to change certainly than M2 or M1 And of course it is so vague that it inherently provides us with more flexibility in terms of short-run operations and avoiding the tendency of stepping on interest rates too aggressively So, I would just like to suggest that in all this we not lose sight of some potential advantages that there may be in M3, particularly from a communications point of view   Well, at least equal weight with what I hear people giving to M2 right now   Well, that's the problem, though I don't see any difference conceptually between controlling M2 and M3 As a matter of fact in this period with all these shifts and things, I would guess that M3 will be easier to control because the multiplier effects from the deposit shifts can wash each other out more in M3 than in M2 I don't minimize that problem Intuitively, I think it might be less of a problem with M3 than M2   I don't think it's more controllable either, but I don't really care about that; it's not less controllable  SPEAKER(?) That's right   But I don't think it's less controllable I think Frank is right    12/20-21/82   No, I concede that   Could I ask one other quick question?   If we are going to report this central tendency in some way or other, do you contemplate that in any explicit way you would try to draw, however gingerly, a connection between departures from the performance of the economy vis-a-vis the central tendency in terms of what we would be looking for in M2 or M3?   Just a simple case Assume that we have not only a central tendency but a tremendous convergence that says nominal GNP is going to grow by 9 percent; prices will rise by 4 percent and real GNP by 5 percent to make it nice Then we say we think M2 and M3 and total credit will look like X, Y, and Z But then this central tendency [puts our forecasts] in a different light than the old forecasts if, as we get into the year, there's a marked departure in actual performance of the economy from the central tendency even though the Ms and whatever else we use in our steering devices look all right The question is Do you contemplate any more of a direct  -48-    12/20-21/82  linkage between what we would do with the steering devices or targets and that central tendency forecast?   That reason, as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, led me in the direction of thinking a little more about M3 because I think it will give us more flexibility   Well, certainly I'm not saying--  -49-    12/20-21/82   That's precisely the point   We haven't got a recovery yet   Peter, where do you and the market think borrowings are these days?   That's why I think that sentence has to be limited to M2   That's right   I have no problems with this formulation I think it's fine   You're not supposed to do that, Steve!   They will go make some more lousy loans!   Large CDs   Should that be just M2 there, too?   In terms of the real sector, the number that I have is 4-1/2 percent, as opposed to the staff's 3-1/2 percent, and it's hard for me to get too excited about those kinds of differences But I'm inclined to the view that the inventory [liquidation] has probably run its course to a greater extent than the staff has [in its forecast] I also think there's at least a fair potential that the housing sector will be stronger than the staff has projected as well The area that I find a little more provocative in looking at the range of the forecasts is not so much the real numbers but the price numbers I have a deflator number that's a little over 4 percent and I struggled a bit to get to that number But I do agree with the sentiments that were expressed by several people earlier to the effect that productivity will be stronger than the staff forecast In my own case, I ended up using a unit labor cost number of 2 percent on a fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis Now, what's interesting about a 2 percent unit labor cost number is that if you attack the GNP from the income side, and you assume unit labor costs are going up 2 percent and you assume that unit interest and proprietors' income and all the rest do the same thing, a 5 percent rate of inflation permits something like a 40 percent increase in profit margin measures in terms of the GNP accounts That, together with the oil price situation and the food price situation, in the context of a 2 percent    2/8-9/83  rise in unit labor costs, leads me rather solidly to the view that we can, in fact, do better than 4 percent on inflation I think it's important to do it because if we found ourselves with the kind of recovery that's being talked about here and with prices rising at a rate of 5-1/2 or 6 percent by the end of 1983, we'd have one heck of a mess in 1984 irrespective of all the problems financing the deficit is going to cause in 1984 So, I am more optimistic on the price side I think that's solid But more importantly, if we don't get that kind of price performance in 1983, it bodes very poorly in my judgment for 1984 and beyond   No, I just went through it I said that I attacked the question of what the inflation rate might be primarily by looking at the income side I started out with a 2 percent unit labor cost assumption and made a bit of a subjective allowance for oil prices and food prices and then worked through the rest of it It looks very doable to me to have the inflation rate in the higher 3 percent area--at something like 38 or 39 or 37 percent I think that's very important   That's right   No, with 5 percent   Again, that assumes basically nothing special about oil prices Even if you take the staff's estimate of an 8 percent drop in oil prices, then in a sense it's a shoe-in If we get a larger oil price drop, I don't know That could get to be a problem too   In this flow of funds chart, for example, you don't have the business borrowing by '84 getting anywhere near where it was even in '81 I have the same problem As I look through this in terms of the sources and uses, it's almost inconceivable to me that you could produce the kind of growth that you have there without putting a lot more pressures on interest rates than--   In terms of this question of how firmly we put forward the targets, which I obviously think we need, I certainly would favor the direction that I think is implied in Steve's comments and your own, but I'd be inclined to go maybe even one step further And that is, in your testimony at least, in some carefully construed way, I'd suggest that we might indeed use the GNP as a bit of a steering mechanism Again, I don't want to get trapped into the business of saying we're going to use it for a target, but I do think there is something to be said for getting a little more flexibility into the approach by saying that we're more willing to look at GNP and be guided by it rather than trying to make the case for flexibility simply on the basis of all these technical arguments about the components of the Ms, which people don't understand or care about The one other point I'd like to make quickly, in terms of asymmetry or lack of risk, is that at this point I do see a somewhat asymmetrical risk in one sense on the up side But I can't ignore the fact that if one of the things that you and others have mentioned goes wrong on the down side, while the probabilities of that may be smaller, the implications are much larger and we'd really have one heck of a mess So, I have some asymmetry in my evaluation of risks; it's asymmetrical in its own right   That's the problem It is totally dominated by government And I don't know how you can walk away from that   On the following paragraph that deals with the question of emphasis on--   I do have a bit of a problem in terms of this question of emphasis on Ml As I look at it, we're talking about targets in general that at least strike me as being toward the high side in a context in which there's at least a 50-50 chance that we are going to get some recovery, if not a fairly robust recovery, in velocity Now, if we find ourselves in that situation, M1 with all its imperfections and everything else is really the only device to use, in terms of the way we run monetary policy, to be able to snug up That may develop out in the year some time, but I--   Why do I say it? I guess I have at least a degree of concern that we could run into a problem on the up side   Well, in terms of open market operations, the fact of the matter is that--take the extreme case where it's not even a question of emphasis but we have nothing there on M1--as a practical matter our ability to react in a reasonably effective way to what is happening with M2 or M3 or credit or whatever is limited   Let me try to make the point a little differently, then I am thinking out perhaps well into 1983 I'm not worried right now and I probably won't be worried for at least a number of months But I could be worried come the summer or sometime when I see the velocity rising 4 or 5 percent and we're at the top of  -72-    2/8-9/83  the M1 range We'd have a mess on our hands at that point to suddenly be in a position where we have to reemphasize Ml because we want to be able to live with the automatic mechanism in a more direct way I think that is a very difficult position   My question is that I'm not sure the extent to which, in fact, it might be separable That's what I worry about   Actually, I don't like Ml   That's the point I was trying to make You just made it much better than I did   That helps me   Is the word "degree" in that sentence or not?   "With the degree of weight," okay   Peter, do you have a sense from looking at the last six weeks or so what the underlying growth in reserves is--in other words, extracting from the reserve impact of all the shifts in deposits and so on?   A rough estimate   Right   The total informal limit would go to $55 billion   The state and local [situation] is even worse than the numbers suggest because, for example, a large number of states don't even have their state pension plans anywhere near fully funded They've been living off that to the tune of billions of dollars And at some point they not only have to raise taxes but one way or another have to replenish those pension arrangements, and I would imagine for the 50 states as a group we're talking about an enormous sum of money there   I won't make the case, but--  -29-    3/28-29/83   I'm not about to make the case myself but I will at least report that at our board of directors meeting last week I think I can fairly say that our directors were more bullish than they have been at any point since I've been at the Bank   Clearly, their comments [conveyed] a tremendously different atmosphere Some of that does reflect what Mr Boehne spoke about--just the fact that it was so bad that if things begin to look at all better it sounds a lot better than that But I think housing has an awful lot to do with it The thinness of inventories in the retail sector in particular is something that people cite, and to some extent there's a little glimmer of hope in the agricultural sector because livestock prices are a little better and people are feeling a lot better because of the PIC program, even though it's recognized that that's not going to mean much until well down the road The other thing that is more or less compatible with that is that a significant body of my colleagues in my research department also take the view that the economy is in fact a lot stronger than some of the numbers now suggest at current interest rates I think they pretty much take the view that if long-term interest rates in particular were to go up at all, the fragility that Mr Guffey speaks of could be manifested in a hurry But in the framework of current long-term interest rates, a number of those people are really quite bullish I myself have not quite bought into all of that yet, but I do think in the framework of roughly the  -30-    3/28-29/83  current level of rates that the prospects for the economy performing along the lines of the staff's forecast or maybe even a little above it are quite good But, again, I certainly would agree that any number of things could unravel that in a hurry   How many billion?   The cost of the rigs?   Mr Chairman, let me start by making a couple of observations about Ml, because I do think in the eyes of the financial markets that Ml is the aggregate that is causing the most problems in terms of expectations right now We've done a little look  -46-    3/28-29/83  behind some of the numbers and I must say it leads me to the view that the shifting phenomenon as it relates to Super NOW accounts in particular is having an impact that I think at this point clearly works in the direction of overstating Ml We looked at a sample of about 20 banks outside of the Twin Cities in terms of what is going on with Super NOW accounts, and it's rather revealing because we find that the average balance in household Super NOW accounts runs in the range of $15,000 to $20,000, which is 3 or 4 times the balance in conventional NOW accounts In addition, we have found a number of instances that involve very, very sizable Super NOW account balances-- balances associated with institutions, state and local governments, hospitals, and so on This is a very limited sample, of course, but in some cases we have seen average balances in individual institutions as high as several hundred thousand dollars in Super NOW accounts And we're led to believe from some limited discussions that those balances, in particular, were not M1 balances before Both of those phenomena, to the extent that they represent anything close to a pattern--and obviously I can't draw that conclusion from 20 banks-- do suggest to me that the measured growth of Ml may be more affected than perhaps we've been thinking I'm not saying this is right analytically, but if you assume that the difference in the average balance size in the Super NOW household account as opposed to a conventional NOW account, is a proxy for the additional savings component that's reflected in these NOW accounts and you make any kind of adjustment for the measured growth rate in M1 over the first quarter for that, it's not very hard to find yourself looking at a situation where shift-adjusted growth in M1 is in fact within the ranges that we're talking about for the year But again, that is highly speculative and based on a very limited sample In any event, I am persuaded from this limited exercise that we may have more of a problem in terms of what Ml is really doing than perhaps we have recognized up until now Obviously, to the extent that is right, it could have quite a bearing in terms of market psychology itself  Just one other quick point on money I mentioned yesterday in the context of some of our directors' comments about the economy being pretty strong that one of the very interesting things that they reported was a tremendous increase in the use of currency for financing retail transactions in size--not toothpaste transactions, but fairly sizable transactions being paid for with the currency of the realm Surprisingly, one person brought it up and several others immediately said that they--   It was both bankers and trade people, as I recall But it was interesting because once one person mentioned it several others chimed right in and said that they had seen exactly the same thing   Nope   Currency   I was really astonished by these comments As I said, they were seeing currency being used to pay for retail transactions of size Again, I'm not talking about a tube of toothpaste or a can of peas   If you look at it that way, using cash--   On policy itself, for reasons that have already been stated, I would come out somewhere along the lines of alternative B in the Bluebook I do have a preference for the alternative II language in the directive as well, for the reasons  -49-    3/28-29/83  cited by both Governor Partee and Governor Wallich I think they were saying the same thing; if they were I agree with both of them   I'm talking about alternative B in the directive language   Yes, right Well, in the Bluebook it's alternatives I and II and in the draft that was handed out it's alternatives A and B I'm talking about the second one The case for staying more or less where we are in policy both tactically and operationally makes a lot of sense to me The only other point I would add is that, looking out from where we are, it really does strike me that we're approaching a situation where analytically each of these money supply measures is just a horse of a totally different color I must say I am not at all sure what that is going to mean for the evolution of monetary policy over a long period of time both in terms of operating procedures, definitions, and all the rest I think the day may be at hand when the Committee and the staff have to start to explore some of these questions on a more fundamental basis because the point will come when we're going to have to have a better mouse trap And I just don't know what it's going to be at this point   Put 6 to 7 percent for Ml   You have imports rising by $60 billion between the first and fourth quarters of this year How much of that is oil?   Mr Chairman, with regard to the near term, I'm inclined to the view that we'll probably do better than the staff forecast in terms of real growth and maybe even in terms of inflation But I'm not nearly as sanguine about 1984, certainly I think for some of the reasons Mr Martin and Mr Solomon suggested on the international front, we're by no means out of the woods there But in addition to that, I must say in looking at the budget process and the body language that it is associated with, it doesn't seem to me that  -13-    5/24/83  any real progress has been made on the so-called structural deficit-- maybe some, but certainly nothing to write home about But on top of that I do think we have to recognize that there is a lot of pent up pressure out there to raise prices I think we're going to be able to avoid a manifestation of that pressure, perhaps for a period of time, simply because the productivity/unit labor cost phenomenon is working almost perfectly right now That's not going to last forever So, as I say, the near term looks fine, but I'm just not sure about 1984 And, looking at the staff's implied forecast, it gets a little hard for me to imagine out in 1984 how we really can keep those interest rates where they have them with underlying conditions what they are   Mr Chairman, I started out where a lot of people are Internationally, the case is overwhelming that we would be better off with lower interest rates and a lower exchange rate But looking at this domestically, I must say that I do get some sense that there may well be a case for some snugging up or whatever you want to call it I would lean in that direction not because of M1 as much as I would because of the economy I do think that the risks are on the side of the economy being stronger rather than weaker than the staff's forecast And I am very much inclined to the view that a more moderate and balanced recovery right now works in the direction of making that recovery more durable and more sustainable, partly because I do think it works in the direction of minimizing the risks that some of those pent up pressures on prices, that I at least sense are there, could be unleashed In some very practical ways the question that we face right now is If we do snug up a bit, does that assist in [achieving] our longer-range objectives for the economy? In part I try to answer that by asking myself the question What will happen to bond rates if we do snug up a little, recognizing that they have already increased 50 basis points in the last two weeks? On the other hand, what would happen to bond rates if we didn't do anything? In some ways I think that is the $64 question My instinct is that in the current circumstances a gentle move in the direction of snugging might well produce the result of helping to stabilize long-term  -27-    5/24/83  interest rates; and we have had experience in the past to suggest that some increase in short-term interest rates early on in a business recovery can be reversed I think that happened in the mid-1970s in a way that did not inhibit the early phases of recovery So, I would come out in the direction of, say, putting borrowings around $400 million in the expectation that the federal funds rate might move up toward the 9 percent range--again, not because I'm paranoid about Ml but because of the way I'm looking at the economy and the way that over time I think that might help us rather than hurt us in terms of our long-term objectives for the economy   That's why we should go to $400 million   I think the key thing, Roger, is how one reads the economy rather than how one reads Ml   Frank, I wasn't here; you were But I have a hunch that exactly this same discussion probably took place sometime around 1976 And I think it's very apparent where we came out, partly on the grounds that we didn't have to worry about inflation  SPEAKER(?) I think that's pretty unfair   That might be the way to do it   Could we put a phrase before M2 and M3 there and say "in the context in which M2 and M3 are only slightly below their"   Would that language you have there, Mr Chairman, perhaps be a bit more acceptable if it said "increase slightly the degree of restraint The action was taken in the context in which M2 and M3 were slightly below their paths for the quarter but Ml was well above and the economy was stronger" Does that help at all in terms of how--?   Well, I think it pushes M1 a little further off into the wilderness   Well, it's saying two things It's saying M2 and M3 are just in a statistically insignificant way below where we want them to be and, on the other hand, Ml is very strong and the economy appears to be strong   Yes, but I think it says it in a slightly different way than the way it's there now It pushes M1 further into the background than it is now   I myself would be willing to put it on the economy but that gets us into the trap of saying we're going to run policy more generally on the economy I'm not ready for that either   Well, it's--   Basically I said you have the operative sentence--   "This action was taken against the background in which M2 and M3 were slightly below their targets for the quarter,  -55-    5/24/83  while at the same time M1 was growing very rapidly and the economy appeared to be picking up"   If there is one thing we've got to do it's eliminate the participle, even if it--   We have to put something in now that says the action was taken because the Committee was getting hungry!  -56-    5/24/83   I think the market thinks you're talking about higher rates  -10-    7/12-13/83   The earlier period is shown in this other chart, isn't it, Jim?  -11-    7/12-13/83   Well, Mr Chairman, I look at the situation as a Catch-22 By way of a preparatory remark, I don't have a great deal of problem with the staff's forecast in terms of real economic  -15-    7/12-13/83  activity I'm also somewhat influenced by what Mr Prell said earlier about this tremendous buildup in liquid asset holdings of the public; whether they're in the form of things we count in Ml or "M21," they're all there Against that background, a lot has been said about the deficit I don't know about this Treasury paper, but it seems to me that we unambiguously have a situation in which the structural deficit is increasing when most of us were hoping a year or two ago that it would be decreasing Now, there are a lot of ways to measure it, but one interesting way that I came across, which somebody on my staff [worked out], was to use the CBO estimates all the way out to 1988 And what is interesting about that is that they have the unemployment rate in 1988 basically the same as it was in 1980, about 74 percent, but they have the deficit in 1988 at 56 percent of GNP as opposed to the 23 percent in 1980 That's at least one measure of where things stand with regard to the deficit  I also am inclined to think that a number of people, including the Chairman, have done such a good job of educating people about at least a potential for crowding out that, Treasury studies notwithstanding, the [perceptions] of crowding out and the implications for interest rates are very, very real I don't have an answer for that quandary, but clearly the potential for anything being done about the deficit for at least 18 months is slim to none I had felt that we had some breathing room in regard to how much pressure that deficit was going to put on the financial markets and interest rates over the forecast period, but I am no longer sure of that I don't know how you look at it, Mike, but I observe that private credit demands right now are rising in this cycle as fast as they have in postwar cycles as a whole And if that continues for any period of time when we have the Treasury borrowing where it is, my hope that we had some room there becomes rather diminished   We did it on one of those trough-to-cycle peaks, Mike We took the average for the postwar recoveries, and I think it's true that the lines are pretty close together Well, that's part of my Catch-22 The other part is that even in the context of the staff forecast, which is very much like my own, I am worried about the potential for some adverse developments on the up side with regard to inflation I also think it's true that taking the postwar cycles as a group we have a situation in this recovery where raw industrial prices and foodstuff prices are actually rising faster than they did in the postwar recoveries even though crude materials are rising a bit more slowly We have rapid money growth The staff is assuming, among other things, that we can hold compensation costs to 5 percent Maybe we can, but maybe we can't We're going to get a tremendous burst in profits in this quarter and next quarter and how durable that more moderate rate of wage increases is going to prove to be is a big question  More generally, again looking back at history for what it tells us, we find that in the second year of recoveries the spread of price increases over unit labor costs tends to be about 2 percent, roughly Again, the staff forecast and my own forecast essentially assume that that spread is close to zero in 1984 What that implies about pressures on the part of corporations that raise prices is a  -16-    7/12-13/83  good question It seems to me that the only real hope in terms of mitigating some of those pressures is that we may get productivity behavior that's a good deal stronger than what is implied in the staff's forecast, recognizing that it has its own tradeoffs with regard to how fast unemployment can come down Now, my concern about those considerations is fundamentally based in a deeper concern that I have, and that is that looking out to 1984 in the context in which the deficit situation and the financing requirements of the Treasury are what they are, it seems to me that there is at least a risk, however small, that if inflation started to move up, it could jump up rather sharply Instead of getting the nice little modest 1/2 point or 1 point acceleration in inflation, we could get something well in excess of that in a context in which we would already have enormous pressures on interest rates and in a situation in which financial deregulation has made it almost an absolute necessity that banks and other financial intermediaries pass through the full cost of higher interest rates onto the borrowers who, in turn, pass them onto the consumer through their products I don't equate that, to take Mr Boehne's phrase, with the potential for a runaway boom--   Well, in the short run, it's a situation that to me holds the potential for a heck of a collision out there, to put it mildly That's why I look at it as a Catch-22, because even in the context of the staff's forecast I can see where we could run into some very, very nasty problems   I'm not saying it's 50-50, but I'm not saying it's 90-10, either   I'd just make a brief comment on this Ml issue A fellow who works for me did basically the same analysis that Mr Lindsey did, approaching it in a completely different way, and came to the same conclusion that he could explain the growth of Ml by interest rates and income and all the rest of it My problem is that I don't believe either one of them Just to approach it a slightly different way--admittedly, this is a very crude measure--we took the experience of the Ninth District on the Super NOW accounts and extrapolated it nationwide We said What would Ml growth look like if the average dollar value of Super NOW accounts had stayed just where the average dollar value of NOW accounts was, at roughly $5,000 as opposed to $16,000? When you do that calculation, at least on this crude extrapolation that we did, you end up with the implied Ml growth rate, excluding that marginal savings associated with the higher Super NOW account balances, of 5 or 6 percent over the first half of the year That probably understates it too But I just cannot believe that one can explain what we've observed in Ml by simply assuming that the new shifts into Super NOWs and into MMDAs account for all that moving around I just can't accept it   I have about as much faith in those numbers as you do But even if they offset, it seems to me that you have to concede that a $15,000 average balance has substantially more of a savings component than a $5,000 balance, much less the balance of an old demand deposit And that's why I have a great deal of difficulty with Dave's and my staff's analysis   Yes, but that implies that the underlying--   The February reaction to Ml was at least in part couched in terms of what was going on in the economy Most people thought the economy was still declining in February   That 5 to 9 percent sounds nice but I don't like it partly because of where I think the risks are If there is some strong sympathy that way, I'd rather see us rebase off June and use 4 to 8 percent, which would give the same practical result anyway I really think that saying 5 to 9 percent in the context of everything that's going on, at least as I look at it, is very troubling   It's quite high   Mr Chairman, when you look at velocity historically, though, I think the potential for a rise in velocity has to be related directly to the actual decline in velocity And there are all those balances sitting there and we can't ignore them  -49-    7/12-13/83   I think that is a very distinct possibility, yes We just can't ignore all that money that's sitting there   That's where I think they lie   Well, the issue here is not to agree on how much we know about Ml for this year I don't think we know a helluva lot about either [year] But the problem that I think we ought to avoid is having a set of targets that won't provide the opportunity to tighten up further if we have to And if we have targets like 11 percent or even 9 percent--   But the broader aggregates don't really provide much of a mechanism--or they have not provided much of a mechanism--to permit this   We can use it; we don't have to I'm not saying we would But as a practical matter, it does give us the opportunity to move if we think we have to move And that's what I'm concerned about--having a set of targets that gives us the flexibility even though we may not use it   I think one can make the argument the other way around Rebasing, depending upon how we articulate it, can be construed to say that we had this unusual period and we're recognizing that it's unusual We are cutting the umbilical cord from it and we're going from there That clearly leaves open the option and demonstrates our willingness to do something like that again   If Ml is growing at 12 percent, I don't care if we have a target or not, the market is going to look at it and we're going to get interest rate effects We can't wish that away It's just not going to go away   I don't see that as a problem If we're faced with the situation later this year or next year where velocity isn't growing, I think it's a fairly easy matter to make that kind of adjustment both in policy and what we say about policy But I don't think the reverse follows If we have a target that's 5 to 9 percent and money supply is growing at 9 percent and the economy is growing like gangbusters, how do you go up [on the Hill] and explain that we're tightening when we're within our target range? I think it's a real problem   There's somewhat of an historical tendency to be unwilling to do that in this Committee   The problem is that there's a reluctance to do that even in the confines of this Committee, much less to go up and tell Congress that that is what we are doing I don't give a darn about M1 in and of itself either My concern is simply that we formulate policy in a way that it provides us with flexibility to do what has to be done, if indeed it has to be done   Another thing on this rebasing If we don't rebase, we are going to have a target this year of 8 to 12 percent or 7 to 11 percent or something like that and then what do we do next year? We're left having to hang out a target for next year that on the surface is going to look like it's 4 or 5 percentage points below our target for this year   What, an easy money policy?   If we are not careful, it may not be an eighth   No, I don't think that follows   We could have 5 to 9 percent this year and 4 to 8 percent   Heck, I want 4 to 7 percent next year   Would it be too much of a break from precedent to have it structured so that we have in effect two votes--one on M2 and M3 and then a separate vote on the associated range for Ml and total credit?   Maybe   What does that forecast have for inflation?   Mr Chairman, in terms of the economic situation and the commentary that one picks up, at least as you move away from Wall Street and Constitution Avenue, the thing that has struck me most of all in the past month or two is the extent to which the overall international situation has crept into Main Street Some of that grows out of the LDC debt problem situation and the IMF legislation It's truly incredible to me how much attention the subject of the IMF legislation gets in places where I would not have expected it It's quite astonishing But I think beneath it what perhaps is really going on is the extent to which our trade account, our exports and imports both, really is having a perceptible impact on people in ways that are quite new to them At our last meeting one of our directors told a story that I think in some way captures this best  It was quite obvious as he was talking that they have had an informal policy to buy American for a long time I think he said that they historically have bought everything by way of equipment that they use from an outfit down in your District They had to replace a single piece of machinery that he described as a $900,000 piece of equipment They put it out for bid and got the bid back from their customary supplier for $900,000 But they got a bid from a German firm for $500,000 Obviously, the difference between $500,000 and  -10-    10/4/83  $900,000 had crossed the threshold point where this outfit could live with their informal buy American policy If I am reading the tea leaves right, I don't think that situation, while it's obviously just one anecdotal case in point, is unrepresentative of what is going on Indeed, when you talk about the capital goods industry in the fourth quarter in the Seventh District, I just wonder to what extent this phenomenon at the margin may be making a very, very big difference in terms of what they are seeing versus what they might normally expect to see And certainly this is also true in the agricultural sector, both in terms of exports of agricultural goods and in terms of imports of agricultural machinery; it's hitting on both sides I don't know what it means but Karen Horn mentioned it I do think that it begins to get the smell of a very perceptible but creeping element of protectionism that is now out there in a way that I have not seen it I don't know what it means beyond that, but it is something clearly different in terms of attitudes and commentary about the economy and the financial system  On inflation and concessions and all that, I am inclined to the view, at least for the moment, that bankruptcies even when they're quite removed from a particular situation--whether they're in the airline industry or piano manufacturers who have decided to get into the financial business--are still having an effect on wage behavior that's fairly pervasive But I am not at all sanguine that the wage situation couldn't turn around very quickly in the context of these substantial cash flows and profits that are being generated by the business sector in general On agricultural prices, the fellows in our Bank who look at that agree with Mr Kichline that we're looking at [increases of] 7 or 8 percent Some of our directors who are involved in the agriculture business are on the low side of that The commentary we get from them rather forcefully suggests that most of the official forecasts, including the Agriculture Department's own forecast, have not adequately taken into account the manner and way in which the PIK program is going to free up very substantial quantities of inventory that have to go into the marketplace By and large our directors who are involved in agriculture have a more optimistic outlook in terms of the inflation in agricultural prices, although in some cases it may be more pessimistic from their own self interest point of view Abstracting from this overall international thing, my own view continues to be that in the near term--and by that I mean out, say, to the middle of 1984 anyway--the risks or dangers or whatever you want to call them are on the up side What that really means in the context of Frank Morris' question--I think he was questioning when crowding out really will become a problem as opposed to the kind of problem it is now--is that it is probably going to be sooner rather than later And, that's about it   There's a Catch-22 here, though My concern, as I said before, is that, if anything, the economy may be stronger than the forecast and then inflation might be greater than the forecast I think that way because in some ways the focus now should be 1984 rather than just the fourth quarter of 1983 Personally, I would be happier if we came out someplace closer to between "C" and "B" rather than "B" I think the Catch-22 is very important because if the economy is stronger and inflationary pressures are greater, then we get Frank Morris' collision sooner rather than later And if that happens, we will not have helped the LDC problems; as a matter of fact, it works the other way I get troubled by this whole argument that says that the solution to the LDC debt problem is [for us] to ease monetary policy The real solution is beyond our control It's a tighter fiscal policy But I think there is some danger in overplaying that and ending up with just the results that we're trying to avoid   That would be almost 10 percent   No, it's a matter of being less symmetrical   If by the end of the period we're shooting for, say, 1-1/2 percent, would that loosely translate into saying that we could afford 1 percent per year more real growth? Or, what's the order of magnitude?  SPEAKER(?) We have not done that exercise specifically but I would guess that it would just be a marginally lower unemployment path on average compared to the one here   You don't want to hear about it   In some ways that's the other side of the productivity point, because to the extent they get a lot more productivity they're going to get more profits and more cash flow; that, in turn, will solidify even further on the part of labor [their resolve] to get their piece of the action   Yes, but some of that probably is already built in Look at the auto industry The best guess now seems to be that this year the auto industry is going to earn $5 billion in profits, and that's in a context in which not insignificant concessions have been made across the board in a setting in which the wages are too darn high to begin with I would just speculate, even on the basis of what has happened this year, that trying to hold wages in the automobile industry in any reasonable proportion is going to be very difficult with that $5 billion in profits there   No I think there's some good news and some bad news The bad news is My hunch is that, if anything, the model as we're talking about it here probably underestimates the amount of inflationary pressure in this period, even though I would agree that it's likely that we're going to have more productivity growth than the model suggests My reason is that I think inflationary expectations, however latent, are probably stronger than this model contemplates And I continue to believe that the speed effect, if that's what it's called, in the short run will hurt quite a bit if prices even begin to pick up moderately--say, gravitate up to 5 percent   I assume, and maybe I'm wrong, that it's something like what is in that early chart, which basically says 4 percent   But the converse is also true  STAFF(?) Or one could lower the unemployment by maybe a percentage point   Would you like to hear my good news?   My good news is that some of my staff have developed an alternate model, which is a very interesting model It basically says that the deficit over time effectively has to be financed through inflation, with a very direct connection between the size of the deficit and the amount of inflation in the system Now, working backwards from that, we're going to see a happy result because this suggests that if you could eliminate the deficit net of interest payments, which are roughly $65 or $70 billion, quickly--say, in a period of a couple of years--you could find yourself with the happy result of a combination of real growth of around 3 percent and real interest rates of around 3 percent I don't believe that, necessarily--   The inflation rate effectively would be zero or something close to it   Yes   No, I don't think you have to associate them rigorously, but it does say that financing the deficit in effect can only be done in one of two ways through new money, however defined, or through inflation But if you get rid of the deficit and you get rid of that constraint, then you can have real growth and the real interest rate at about the same level, 3 or 4 percent   You couldn't   You couldn't explain Chart 1, but it does provide to me a more useful framework for being able to answer the question of how the deficit gets into all this And it doesn't produce the kind of perverse result we get here, which says you get a better result if you increase the deficit  -18-    11/14-15/83   All right, but that view is not incompatible, because it comes down to the same thing It would say in that case that you will end up with more inflation because the deficit in effect forced you to create more money   Well, for that whole period going back to the 1950s, the federal deficit net of interest payments was basically zero until two years ago For that whole period it was basically zero   But look out from where we are now and take the latest CBO estimates of the deficits out to 1985 If you take out interest payments and look at it that way, as a percentage of GNP there is no precedent in the postwar period for the kind of phenomena we're looking at in the period from now to 1988   And interest rates are very high and growth is very low   I think that's the key If we could cap inflation at 4 to 4-1/4 percent, while the economy for the next two years is growing at, say, 4 percent   The situation in the Ninth District is a lot like what Bob Forrestal has just described in the Atlanta District The reports that we're getting are of strength across the board, even in some of the areas that have been very weak, such as iron ore and so on It's not booming yet but the mere fact that one of the big taconite companies has just announced that they're recalling 1600 workers as of January 1st, in the context of the situation up there, is quite a dramatic development The lumber and timber areas are very, very strong There is even a renewed surge of activity--I don't want to call it a burst yet--in the oil and gas producing areas in western North Dakota and Montana The number of operational rigs in the field has doubled--from admittedly a low level--in the last couple of months The farm price situation as it was reported to me is probably compatible with what Jim said earlier; in a sense it's looking better If anything, our people are suggesting that they think it looks even a little better than Jim says One of the things that is now being cited is that the change in the dairy and milk  -42-    11/14-15/83  program that was enacted by Congress last week in all likelihood is going to put a lot of milking cows into the slaughter market and that will work to hold down the widely expected big jump in beef prices next year So, by and large, our agriculture price outlook is thought to be improving, if anything  In the Twin Cities area, the character of the situation, I think, really has changed For example, we even heard reports last week of strengthening in office space rentals in a context in which there's a tremendous amount of new building going on in the Twin Cities And last of all, in terms of an anecdotal leading indicator, I've been struck myself just noticing the number of help wanted signs in the store windows of small businesses throughout the Twin City area That is something that I certainly can't recall seeing since I've been up in those parts of the woods On the housing side, though I don't know to what extent this is generalized, I get the sense that the housing market is being held up by the increased acceptance of variable rate mortgages on which the initial rate, the rate that people are looking at today, is a relatively moderate rate compared to the rate on conventional fixed-rate mortgages To what extent that will last is another thing But right now I think it is one of the things helping to hold up the residential side  I also think, as I have for some time now, that the risks are on the up side in terms of the economy and clearly on the up side in terms of inflation I've looked very hard to find any hard evidence of a resurgence of price pressures and can't really find it But I must say I have the distinct sense, extracting from the numbers, that it's either there or lurking close at hand Certainly, we do get a lot of reports of disappearing discounts--in some cases substantial discounts off posted prices for industrial goods--which may or may not be captured in the price statistics And, getting back to the discussion of yesterday, I think the character or the chemistry of the recovery as it pertains to the interaction of wages, productivity, unit labor costs, and cash flow to the business sector--any way you look at it--clearly is about to change Even if productivity is stronger than the Board staff's forecast, we still are going to have a marked shift away from the phenomenon of the last few quarters in which wages were decelerating, productivity was growing very sharply, and unit labor costs were actually declining for two quarters running So, even if productivity is stronger than the staff estimates, which I think it will be, I still think that the character of the recovery as it pertains to cost-price pressures is about to change And that is one of the reasons why I think it's going to be very, very difficult to hold the inflation rate in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range   Mr Chairman, I would favor what I would call a small precautionary move in the direction of firming a little at this point What I would have in mind is perhaps letting the borrowing level go up to $750 million or so, or maybe a bit higher, with the funds rate moving from 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent to 9-1/2 to 9-3/4 percent, at least for the time being I say that, of course, primarily because of the way that I'm looking at the economy Again, if I look at the staff forecast for 1984 fourth-quarter-over-fourth- quarter, nominal GNP growth is 9 percent--43 percent real and 49 percent inflation If indeed the risks are on the up side, as I think they are at the moment, it seems to me quite plausible that we may be looking at a situation in 1984 where we will have to try to restrain somewhat the growth of prices and nominal GNP Now, when I look at the specifications that Steve has put together, even though one has to take the numbers with a grain of salt, alternative B growth rates for Ml, M2, and M3 basically between October and December range from 7-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent, which are still pretty robust numbers I don't think I would care too much if growth came out in that range, but I sure wouldn't want it to come out much higher than that Those considerations, in combination with my view of the economy, lead me to believe that a small move in the direction of a little precautionary restraint right now might prove to be very helpful in the longer run   For September-to-December 5 to 6 percent gets you almost up to the top of alternative A   For September-to-December 7 percent growth for M1 is higher than 9 percent--   Well, as almost everybody knows, I was never persuaded by the case for CRR to begin with and I'm still not I never thought it would make that much difference in terms of how well we could control Ml even if we decided that we wanted to control M1 and nothing else I do agree with Mr Boehne's point, however, that the logically prior decision here is what we want to do with Ml But quite apart from that, I must say that my hunch is that we're going to end up with more [interest rate] variability than Steve and Peter seem to expect That's just my hunch; I can't prove it either, but I think that's the way things are going to go--that we're going to have more noise and little or no improvement in the control of Ml So, if I really had my druthers, I'd drop the whole thing But I don't think we can do that I think it does argue, though, for what I would call a "go slow approach," particularly for the first few months I have always liked a degree of automaticity but I would be willing to compromise that in the interest of trying to get this in place in an orderly way I suspect that the full impact on data flows and on the operations of cash managers of big banks and small banks has not been fully digested in spite of the enormous amount of work that has been going on around the Federal Reserve in trying to get people up to speed on this In short, I don't think the operational impact either on us or on the banks has been fully digested up to this point That again would argue, in my way of thinking, for a go slow approach As far as our own operations are concerned, I must say that I did not walk away from reading the memo with a great deal of confidence that we know what we should do ourselves, much less that we know how the banks will respond to what we do Maybe I missed something but the bottom line is that I'm distinctly uneasy about the whole thing   Well, I'm not thinking so much of your 25 percent [suggestion] in there I'm just thinking of what lies behind all that This question of whether we have a miss because of what you call multipliers as opposed to a shift in money demand is a profoundly important question Which side of that coin one is on [is important] even on a week-to-week basis It seems to me that it's going to have very, very sizable implications for the amount of noise in the money market   I didn't know I had put my hand up, but I'll go ahead anyway I put my comments in two categories First, for the past couple of days I have had in the Bank the CEOs--and strictly the CEOs--of a good cross section of major industrial companies in the Ninth District, including some of the really Blue Chip companies up in the Minnesota area I have been getting from these people almost astonishing reports of very pronounced stretch-outs in deliveries that have materialized just in the past six months One of the big computer manufacturers, for example, said that six months ago he could pick up the phone and get anything he wanted just like that Now, six months later, he's looking at delivery delays of six months to a year on things that were simply available with a phone call a few months ago There were reports of very, very strong final sales And this seemed to be the case across the board, in everything from wood, construction materials, soft goods, computers--you name it One of the very substantial food companies indicated that their soft goods operations--not the foods in some cases--were showing unit sales in December up 40 percent from a year ago There was a--   It was Some of their soft goods-- and things like that were up 40 percent in unit terms   They own the retail outlets in some cases, so it's a mix of both their own retail outlets and their supplies to retailers I think it's fair to say that in one way or another every one of these CEOs reported building price pressures The good news is that they all at least indicated that they were holding the line on their wage cost [increases] for 1984--other than a bank, which wouldn't surprise you Other than a bank, every one of these roughly twenty or so firms reported that their plans were for compensation in 1984 [to rise by] 4 to 5 percent or less They also reported, again almost without exception, very severely depleted inventories either in their raw materials or, in the case of those in retailing, in items on the shelves Perhaps most disturbing of all to me There was a truly universal expectation among these people that we would have sharply higher inflation and interest rates by the end of 1984 Believe it or not, some of these people even spoke in terms of a "buy now" attitude creeping back into the picture for fear of the outlook toward the end of 1984 That was my rather clear impression, with the exception of the wage side, which would suggest that the risks for both the economy and inflation are very much on the up side There was deep concern, even among the people in this group whom I know to be very close to the current Administration, that the deficit situation is totally out of control--that there is no prospect whatsoever for being able to  -19-    12/19-20/83  deal with it in the near term or the long term Again, at least among this group, there was a sense that it was just very, very [important] that the Federal Reserve do what it could to hold the line  Abstracting from those comments, I still obviously feel personally that the risks are on the up side in the economy We know exports are a soft spot and there certainly is, I think, more financial vulnerability out there than meets the eye I don't think that problem is behind us by any means But the thing that gives me the greatest cause for concern right now is that I can't quite figure out for myself what really is happening with inflation In the last six months the rate of increase in the consumer price index has doubled--more than doubled It is now running at 5 percent or a little better, and I can't see that there is any great influence of special factors in there Maybe Mr Kichline knows something that I don't know, but I can't find them I don't think that the markets in general have quite caught up with the fact that the consumer price index now seems to be rising at a rate of 5 percent or a little more On the other side, we haven't seen any pickup in the deflator; and certainly wholesale prices continue to look very good One of the things that I look at myself as a barometer of price pressures is the spread between the rise in the GNP deflator and the behavior of unit labor costs in the economy as a whole Very seldom does that spread exceed 2 percent and it's unprecedented for it to exceed 2 percent in the early stages of the recovery But we're looking at a spread of something like 3-1/2 percent, which I would interpret as a great desire on the part of businesses to make themselves whole from the recession or to get themselves whole [before] the recession they think is going to come in 1985 The bottom line, from my perspective, is that we may already be seeing a build-up in price pressures in the economy that if carried forward in 1984 would be very, very disturbing That's about what I think, Mr Chairman   Well, when you consider the automobile industry alone, it's going to make $5 billion this year I suspect the profits in manufacturing are up too--just as sharply, in terms of increases in profits, as the rest of the economy   Well, Mr Chairman, I would agree that in some ways the key question before us now is 1985 rather than 1984 We could get lucky and get through 1984 in reasonably good shape, but I think the prospects of being able to keep the economy growing on a noninflationary--whatever that means--way in 1985 at this juncture will be very, very [low] for all the reasons that have been mentioned before the deficit, the likely build-up in business external financing certainly by that time, and at least in my judgment a clear risk that the inflation rate itself will have broken through the 5 percent or higher threshold by the end of 1984 In that setting I do think that if we were lucky, we could squeeze through 1984 with something that might look like the Greenbook forecast But unlike others, I would not be particularly sanguine about that result I certainly don't consider it optimal by any stretch of the imagination; indeed, I guess I would argue that if we really want to try to insure the continuation of a pattern of a growing economy in 1985, the best thing we could do to produce that result might be to introduce a  -38-    12/19-20/83  little more restraint in 1984 I'm under no illusions about the extent to which any of this can be done, or fine-tuned, but that would be the direction of my thinking  More specifically, in the context of the tentative 1984 targets, I am inclined to the view that the upper end of the Ml range is too high As best I can understand the credit aggregate, I think the upper end of that is too high as well I don't have any particular views on M2 or M3, although I certainly would not be allergic to the symmetry in M2 and M3 that I think Mr Solomon suggested There is another question that is laced in and out of all of these, and that's whether we want to do anything in terms of moving in the direction of suggesting through your oratory at least--perhaps a little more directly than we have in the past--that our primary, though by no means exclusive, objectives are more in the areas of price and financial stability I don't know if you're game for that right now but if we can begin to nudge ourselves in that direction without going overboard, I think it could serve the purpose of this Committee and the economy very well   I just have one, Steve Is it a reasonable proposition to you and Peter to say that where you think you are now in the borrowings is $650 million?   Let me just add a point that I forgot to mention earlier In terms of emphasis on the various aggregates, I too would put a little more emphasis on Ml--not restoring it to its former grandeur but nevertheless putting a little more emphasis on it Having said that, I would also add that I'm not sanguine that the market has learned its lesson The relatively dispassionate reaction to Ml that we've seen over the past few months is nothing more than a reflection of the fact that Ml isn't anywhere near the top of the target; that is, people are more tolerant of its behavior  As far as policy goes now, I am in the camp that says the bell has rung and recess is over and it's back to school I've been there for some time I do, therefore, favor a modest move now I view something along the lines of what Roger said as satisfactory; but pending developments in the intermeeting period, I probably would be willing to go as far as Governor Gramley suggested There are risks in that, certainly I think the most pronounced ones are on the international side, with the exchange rate and the implications for the financing costs of developing countries That is the single thing that gives me the most pause for concern and caution As I said yesterday, I think we're by no means out of the woods in terms of domestic financial problems in a context of rising interest rates, which is one of the reasons I'd rather try to do a little something now in hopes of not having to do more later Certainly, there are some political risks, particularly in a context in which M1 doesn't seem to be growing at a very robust rate based on our own numbers But, again, I feel rather strongly that the risks on the other side are greater at this juncture; in my view at least, the economy and  -60-    12/19-20/83  inflation may be more of a problem than others see it to be I also agree with the thrust of Ed Boehne's remarks If we do something of a modest nature now, it's pretty easy to reverse it if indeed events warrant that On the other hand, if we don't do something now, I believe it becomes harder to do it later and I also believe we run the risk that we will have to do more later rather than less So, I do my own balancing of these risks and I must say that I come out on the side of moving up now, say, to $750 million or maybe a bit more And for the intermeeting period as a whole, pending developments, I probably would be willing to go further--certainly not above 10 percent on the federal funds rate, but if we had to go to 10 percent, I'd go to 10 percent   On this point about prices If you go back and look at the 6-month period ending in April, the rise in the consumer price index with or without food and energy--any way you slice it--is something like 2 percent In the six months ending in November, any way you slice it, it's 5 percent or more Now, I admit that the wholesale price index isn't showing the same thing, but the consumer price index is what gets into social security, other pensions, cost of living adjustments, wage expectations, and the whole ball of wax I find it very, very difficult to accept the notion that there is no evidence that price increases have started to go up There is a doubling of the rate of increase--   But if the consumer price index is giving the right reading, we're already at 5 percent   I don't know if it is, either   The mere fact that that is now being widely talked about, not just in financial circles but in business circles in general, tends to reinforce the view that when it goes, it could really go    1/30-31/84   They are used to it!   I think the predicament we have has actually gotten worse even though the business statistics at the end of 1983 in some sense look a little better In the near term, and by that I mean the first half of this year, my forecast is almost identical to the staff's The problem is that I'm not sure I believe either one of them The risks continue to be on the side of a stronger economy and more inflation--not by a lot, but I think that's the direction The irony is that an economy that is better in the short run is likely to be worse in the long run And what we have been talking about on the international side brings that home very forcefully On the inflation front, for example--even aside from Governor Partee's point--the staff's forecast basically assumes that profit margins are exactly flat As I detect things out there, I still see a lot of pressure on the part of businessmen trying to widen those margins in any way they can And that's one of the reasons why I just wonder whether the kind of assumptions that historically are reasonable about the implications of a declining dollar for the inflation rate are really in the ballpark It seems to me that we may have a situation right now where the indirect effects of the exchange rate and the import issue on domestic inflation are greater than the direct effects In other words, it's not just the question of the price level of an imported good coming into this country as much as it is the way in which those imported goods are affecting the behavior of domestic manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers in terms of what kinds of pricing they think they can get away with So, I'm inclined to think that if the dollar did in fact come off--whether by 17 or 25 percent or whatever-- the impact on the domestic price level could be larger than that contemplated by Mr Truman's exercise, even though it's a quite reasonable expectation from an historical perspective  On the whole credit flow question, I see the complication at this point growing out of the international side and the deficit in combination That seems to me problematic and then some I find it difficult to conceive that we can easily get $45 billion in capital inflows in 1984 I don't know what we would ever do if we had a negative statistical discrepancy That's another story More generally, even if we could get those capital inflows, I have a very difficult time squaring the circle as it were in terms of the overall credit flow analysis that Mr Prell went through in the context of the kind of interest rate outlook that's associated with the staff forecast, absent a reduction in the deficit in 1984 Personally, I  -16-    1/30-31/84  don't think the so-called crowding out issue in the context of the current international situation is an '85 problem; I think it's an '84 problem and then some So, again, while one can feel a little better looking at the very recent statistics--as I do and I think we all do-- the overall situation that we face has become a little more problematic, if anything, from my perspective   Just a question to Steve Did you make any allowance in M3 in particular for those net capital flows at the banks?    1/30-31/84   Basically all in M3?   In general, I think the case for trying to preserve as much flexibility as we can in 1984 is overwhelming Therefore, regardless of what we do with the targets themselves, I hope that we as a Committee would be even more willing to look through them to the GNP, the inflation rate, exchange rates, and so on, even though we probably don't want to do that in any more direct way publicly On the question of M1 as a target or a monitoring range, I'd want to keep it as a monitoring range Look at the revisions Forget about velocity, just look at the numbers themselves Steve, if I read the appendix right, the growth rate for the second half of the year was revised up from 5-1/2 percent by 1-1/2 percentage points In five of the last six months I think the revisions have raised the monthly growth rate in M1 by 3 percentage points or more I just have a great deal of trouble hanging my hat on a statistical series with those kinds of properties, particularly since it's my hunch that at least for the first half of 1984, M1 is going to be more noisy because of contemporaneous reserve accounting and the [trickiness] involved, if nothing else, in applying seasonal factors for weeks that end on Monday when they used to end on Wednesday   The ones I'm talking about here are a combination of benchmarks and seasonals, but most of the changes come from seasonals But when we go into 1984, looking prospectively with CRR, I think it's going to be a noisier series anyway In addition to that, seasonal factors are going to have to be different in nature because they reflect a week that ends on a different day So, I would keep M1 as a monitoring range Generally, I'd be comfortable with the alternative II specifications, although I do have a preference even with M1 as a monitoring range for going to 4 to 7 percent or 3 to 7 percent--it wouldn't matter to me either way--just because I think the lower range might give us a little more flexibility in the event we were faced with a situation in which we thought we had to firm up a bit So, I could go with alternative II for M2, M3, and debt And I'd favor alternative I for M1 and would keep M1 in a monitoring status for at least the foreseeable future   That's the problem that I have with this language about velocity The same argument that we're making about the velocity of M1 could easily be applied to M2 as well I agree with the need to hedge M1 more, for the same reasons I think Tony is suggesting that But I think logically we have a little problem here in that the hedge that we're creating could easily be said to apply to M2 As a matter of fact, if interest rates are rising, it might apply more to M2   But we still have the problem that it applies to M2   There's a wild card in that, though, Lyle, as to how banks would respond   My hunch is that in [an environment of] climbing and rising interest rates banks are going to price Super NOWs and MMDAs very, very aggressively And if they do that, heck, we could have a positive interest elasticity of M2   Well, I don't know what the procedural requirements are   Yes, but even if the Reserve Banks are prepared, the problems with the commercial banks are a great unknown There are very, very, conflicting views and opinions I must say I am a lot more concerned than I think you are or Steve is   That's about where I am But I could use--   It's easier to do [unintelligible] short term   You're talking about putting 8, 8, and 7 percent in with Governor Partee's language?   But the asymmetry goes even beyond that because we would be saying less restraint subject only to the condition of a shortfall in money and credit growth Whereas on the other side, it's not just the "might," it's more rapid growth of money and stronger business and--   I certainly want to be at least evenhanded The problem I have is that if events work in a direction where we want to ease between now and the next meeting--which is an unusually long time--it's a pretty easy thing to do, but the opposite is not easy to do To me, that in itself argues for trying to keep it symmetrical I don't know what is going to happen, but I personally don't think an asymmetrical approach is the prudent thing to do I still think that the risks are on the other side   I don't have any problems with Mr Boehne's suggestion at all It's the written word we have to worry about   Again, the way I look at this is that part of the problem is that the better we are in the short run, the worse we are in the long run I wouldn't mind necessarily if we had a first quarter and a second quarter that were even a shade lower than the staff projection because I think the possibility of being able to keep the expansion going throughout the balance of the year into 1985 actually is enhanced by that From my vantage point that is the primary reason why I would favor being evenhanded If we ended up with a really robust first quarter and robust money growth in the first quarter, that just complicates the heck out of the task in the second quarter   I don't think there is anything we are going to do here that's going to influence the Argentineans   If we have to ease, that's easy to do I don't have any problem with that side of it at all It's the other side that I worry about   It's our check couriers   Yes   It goes out of Richmond; it doesn't go out of or come in to Washington Everything that goes by pouch in and out of Washington goes through Richmond   There may be a better solution to this Last Saturday we tested for the first time this new high speed facsimile transmission among all 13 of us, the Federal Reserve Board and the 12 Federal Reserve offices This thing really works fast and produces a very good copy, and it may be that we can use that That would eliminate the carrier and it would also eliminate the security problem upon receiving it at the Reserve Banks   I don't know where the machines are in most other Fed offices, but at least in my Bank--and for precisely that reason--it's right next to my office and it's very tightly controlled   Yes   It really makes good copies   It's more secure than Cannonball!   Not with this new one   It really is good   Let me just add a few comments on this agricultural situation I too am a recipient of a lot of war stories flowing in from directors and other people with whom I come in contact But it's very, very hard to pin down whether this is just what Mr Keehn has called a "hot stove league" or something more than that My conclusion is that it is more than that, but I can't be certain how much more To give you a couple of insights into the crosscurrents of information one gets We too have a quarterly survey of agricultural credit conditions In the fourth quarter of 1982, 74 percent of the survey respondents indicated that collections were much slower than normal In the fourth quarter of 1983, 37 percent said collections were slower than normal, which makes it sound like things are getting better If you look at the year-end Call Report data--and we did this just for state member banks for the December 31, 1983 report--only 13 percent of the loans listed as past due 30 days or more are agricultural loans whereas in that same population of banks about 24 percent of the total loans were agricultural loans Again, that doesn't sound all that bad We then looked at 76 state member banks that we examined in 1983, and roughly 50 percent of those showed particular problems with agricultural credits but the other 50 percent showed no particular problems with agricultural credits We talked to a dozen or so former directors and other people we know who are  -43-    3/26-27/84  presidents of agricultural banks, and 50 percent of them said things were soft but not serious The other 50 percent said it was very serious I got some data having to do with national agricultural lenders, mainly insurance companies Ironically, it's almost exactly the same story about 50 percent of them reported improvement in delinquency rates and 50 percent reported serious deterioration I got hold of some data from the Farmers Home Administration covering case loads of 422,000 agricultural loans of which 236,000 are delinquent, which of course is a very substantial percentage Two- thirds of the delinquent total and two-thirds of the dollars are in emergency disaster loans of one kind or another essentially growing out of some kind of weather-related phenomenon during 1983  So, it looks as though it's a situation where it's either pretty good or it's very bad In our District we tried to look at it in terms of geographic pockets, classes of farms, and particular types of businesses, and we could find no patterns whatsoever geographically or by particular crops or products We do see more of a credit problem with Main Street businesses than we see with farms, if that is possible We do see that land prices on average are probably still falling, although at a slower rate Somewhat consistent with the hot stove league philosophy The glow of the PIK program has come off, and as the realization of that has sunk in it has made people feel worse Certainly, the widespread expectation of a year ago or six months ago of generalized strengthening in agricultural prices--grains in particular--has not materialized So, while people thought things were going to get better they are not getting better If there is a common denominator, I think it's the one that Mr Keehn indirectly referred to earlier These problems, if they are concentrated in any one area, do seem to be concentrated in situations where there was a lot of debt taken out in the late '70s and early '80s either in connection with acquisitions of land or substantial acquisitions of very, very expensive capital machinery associated with farm operations  I have just a couple of other anecdotal comments from the District While the Ninth District is certainly not a major energy operation, there is a belt of oil and gas activity in North Dakota and Montana which is about one fourth the size that Mr Guffey spoke of in the Kansas City District But in that Williston Basin area drilling activity is now about 80 percent back to where it was at the peaks of 1980 and 1981, although it does appear that a fair amount of that resurgence is being undertaken simply because rigs are available at such favorable prices People are going out and seeing what they can find If they find something, they cap it and move on down the road and stick another hole in the ground But, certainly, the pace of activity has picked up very significantly from a year ago  On the office space situation, I don't pretend to understand this at all but in Minneapolis as well there is a tremendous amount of commercial office construction going on I don't have the foggiest idea who is going to fill all these buildings, particularly when Northwest Bank and Oxford Development start this massive project that they are going to build in place of the building that burned down a year ago or so But certainly, given the size of the Twin Cities, there is a tremendous amount of commercial construction activity going on in the area I continue to get some reports of delivery stretch outs, particularly in the high-tech industries On the retail side,  -44-    3/26-27/84  the encouraging thing that I hear from and others is that despite the fact that sales have been very, very strong they say they are going to stick with the very rigorous types of inventory control policies they put in place over the last couple of years  In terms of the overall national business situation, I still look at the [unintelligible] situation as being strong to very strong even if consumer spending does recede a bit in the second quarter, as it seems to me it must simply because the car sales and the car capacity situation is going to produce that result But even allowing for that, I still think that in the next quarter or two anyway the risks are that the economy will be stronger than projected And unfortunately--and Frank this may help your speech--I personally think the implications of that are that the following quarter may well be weaker than projected It is interesting to note that both the unemployment rate and the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing are now at the points where we began to see the building of price pressures in the 1976-77 recovery period The big difference between now and then is that we've had some rise in interest rates earlier in this cycle than we had then and certainly the wage situation, as has been pointed out, looks better now than it did then Unfortunately, the other side of that coin is that at least to date the productivity side is weaker this time than it was in that earlier episode I think this wage situation is very, very important I don't know what is going to happen in autos but I think that's key, as is the dollar, as it pertains to domestic price level pressures It's also unfortunate but true that we now have a situation in which there is some anticipatory buying taking place in the expectation of either higher prices or higher interest rates or both, and I think that makes our problem a little more difficult I am very troubled at the prospect in Jim's forecast of an inflation rate of 6 percent in the second half of 1985 Once it gets into that range it's going to be very difficult to hold the inflation rate anywhere near that level I would just conclude by saying that, at least as I view it, money and credit are growing pretty rapidly and velocity is growing I'm not sure what the policy implications are right now because I'm not sure where policy is Mr Axilrod will tell us that later   You also have this big [unintelligible] in these old, maturing 30-month certificates   This is a real predicament, to put it mildly I guess I would come out supporting alternative B, with the borrowing number and so on that go with it in the Bluebook, even though I must confess that I like the aggregate profile in "C" better than that in "B" But at this point "C" scares me a little in that it could actually make things worse in the short run That is what I see as the great dilemma If we went with "B" and that meant that the federal federal funds rate had to get up to 10-1/2 percent or so, like John, I would say "So be it" But in the context of "B," I would favor the directive variant 2 that Steve has in the Bluebook Personally, I would favor an asymmetrical directive that would say that we would strongly resist money and credit growth above the specifications of "B" and be tolerant of shortfalls in the growth of money and credit below "B"   I think I said "strongly" I'm not sure what that means, though, Chuck I won't try and define that I am very troubled by this credit growth, in particular Those numbers are really very, very strong I certainly would favor an asymmetrical directive, one that would--   I don't know the right adjustment for the mergers, but if you look at bank credit or total credit--   And it's partly for that reason Also, when we set these targets for 1984 we seemed to say that if velocity was growing, the Committee was thinking in terms of M1 in particular being about at the middle of the range So, I certainly would not resist any shortfall in the growth of money and credit during the second quarter relative to the specifications of alternative B   The way this directive is written, Mr Chairman--   I'd join that   In terms of the numbers, could I ask my question now? Do you interpret the third sentence as a symmetrical or asymmetrical sentence?   This is the area where I have the greatest worry Whether we use Mr Boykin's numbers or those in alternative B doesn't matter all that much to me because I don't have the same problems with the numbers that everybody else has But I must say that I would really get scared if the outcome for money and credit growth in the second quarter were in any material way above the alternative B numbers In other words, I really think of those "B" numbers as a ceiling And if we got too far beyond them, I think we'd have a very, very difficult problem on our hands--more difficult than the problem we have on our hands today   Well, as I've said many times, Nancy, I think the economy is likely to be stronger rather than weaker in the very near term Unfortunately, I also think if that's true, that the longer-run implication is that the economy is going to be softer because we're going to get more interest rate pressure coming from the demand side of the economy So, by implication I am suggesting that I think the velocity factor in the second quarter could be larger than what is implicitly built in here   I don't want to do that, Governor Teeters   That's correct   Again, I'm such an agnostic about these numbers that I don't get visibly moved by 1/2 point differences in the numbers The question that I'm concerned about, regardless of whether we use your numbers or the "B" numbers, is What happens if we get into the quarter and we're running ahead of them?   Yes   I don't want the automaticity either But I don't want to be sitting here in June looking at a second quarter in which money, the economy, and everything else are stronger than we think they are going to be--stronger than we know they should be   I think we can try to minimize the risk of it We would really be in the soup then   Well, the fourth quarter M3 has been--  -79-    3/26-27/84   I don't care about the numbers, but I surely care about having a clear understanding--whether it's in the directive or not--of a willingness to move in that direction if we have to move   The only problem I see, Tony, with staying with the 7 to 11 percent is that if we run into the [situation] where we have to move and operate above 11 percent persistently, then we're left with the decision of having to change it   No, but we suspended it   You may see some on Friday   I agree with Governor Gramley I still think that when the decision of last week to suspend the federal funds rate range is publicized this Friday, that in itself is going to be seen by the market as--   --symptomatic of the kind of thing they're looking for   I'm very sensitive, Tony, to your concerns about--   I'd just as soon take it out   It gives us more flexibility without it   Could we change the parenthetical statement to read "should take account of" rather than "be consistent with"? It says "initially the reserve path and the associated ranges should be consistent with" Instead of that say "would take account of"   Well, I'm concerned with the way the sentence reads now It's subject to the interpretation, indeed the meaning, that all we are doing and are prepared to do is ratify what has already happened And I understand this discussion to say something more than that   I think it's a little more than that It's a billion dollar borrowing assumption in which we go to $400 to $500 million of net borrowed reserves   I don't want it to be symmetrical   If there is a difference, any more substantial credit growth from where we are now is different from even--   I have just a couple of comments, Mr Chairman I share the view--it's just a hunch--that the edge may be coming off the speed of the recovery at this point I'm compelled to that conclusion even though I'm not sure that it can be backed up by statistics as yet On the farm sector that has been mentioned, obviously, in a substantive way the situation is a mess The only point I would add is that I think it is at or near the point where the political implications of it, broadly defined, could get very testy For example, I hear, as I'm sure others do, stories of people saying Well, if you're going to cap foreign loans, you better cap farm loans Certainly, in my District we have had a couple of situations involving the closing of small banks because of bum agricultural loans in the context in which the treatment of depositors is different than in the case of Continental And I think that is just another manifestation of how this problem could really start to close in on us I continue to get very frequent reports of sharply different--or what is perceived to be sharply different--treatment of farm credits by various regulators, which reinforces the view that the process is in some sense discriminatory toward that particular class of credits or that particular class of banking organizations   I hear this directly The feeling is that right now the FDIC examiners in particular are really playing hardball on these [agricultural] credits, and in a way that comes back to you as being unreasonable I'm not sure whether it's true or not, but certainly that attitude is there   When they talk to somebody else, they probably say the same about the Federal Reserve!   It really has picked up Mr Forrestal made the point that the PCAs--the Production Credit Associations or whatever they are called--for whatever reasons clearly have a liquidity problem in their own right I don't fully understand it, Bob, and maybe you do And because of the rate of foreclosures growing out of that, one hears--and I've never heard this before-- concerns that the PCAs and the banks will be forced to dump land on the marketplace to such an extent that the price of land could really be driven down sharply It's awfully hard, particularly with farmers and agricultural bankers, to read through all the static they throw out But my sense of it is, Tony, that once you cut through all the static it's quite real in terms of the degree of concern   Wheat prices have a long, long way to go before it could make any real difference in terms of profitability It certainly will help cash flow But the price has a long way to go before even middle-of-the-road operators reach the point where they can grow wheat profitability   I want to make two other quick comments On the wage side, I don't disagree with anything that has been said But I would note that from an employer point of view in the Twin Cities in the first quarter of this year we have seen a very perceptible bidding up of salaries in the technical area for the first time in I guess three years I don't know what to make of that at this point, but it certainly is there as a new development, at least in that very particular marketplace   No, I'm not talking about union stuff yet, Pres I'm talking about white-collar technical people--computer people and so forth The only other point I want to make goes back to Karen Horn's observation about financial practices because I think anecdotally she put her finger right on what is at least a very, very pressing problem quite apart from stability and quite apart from the Continental situation Implicit in what Karen was talking about is that these are practices that probably can only be validated by inflation And in some ways that's the most troubling aspect of all about those practices I would simply observe that quite apart from any particular situation, including Continental, what we are seeing in terms of practices and instruments--interest rate swaps and other  -21-    5/21-22/84  things--is a situation in which the kinds of exposure and the kinds of contingent liabilities that are sitting out there in size may not be totally understood even by those who are playing in the markets And worse than that, they may not even be fully understood by us Needless to say, this is not a point in time when we can afford to be blindsided I don't know what we do about it But I certainly think that we have to sharpen our focus on these developments and make sure that we at least understand what is going on   I too am in favor of alternative B as is My preference is not to have language in the directive that talks about "while taking account of [un]usual financial strains" We do that anyway, and my personal feeling is that having that explicitly in the directive would perhaps elevate even further the concerns that Tony and someone else spoke of before--that the basic course of monetary policy is going to be undone by these developments The only other point I would make is that we have eight weeks until the next Committee meeting and we are at a point where it seems to me that over that eight week period something of consequence [might occur]   Yes I think it's eight weeks   In any event, whether it's seven or eight, my hunch is that we're at a point where something of consequence is likely to happen in the intermeeting period I don't know whether it will be on the up side, down side, back side, or front side, but it seems to me that something is going to happen here and that without altering the directive in any way we may have to be more sensitive to the need for consultation between now and the 10th of July   I don't think so I'd leave it the way you have it   Which is fine   I'd like to leave it understood As far as this consultation issue, under the circumstances it's not difficult to think of a dozen circumstances in which we might want to consult that have nothing to do with the federal funds rate band and that should be understood too   I certainly don't have any problem with the substance of what we're talking about because I think it's the only thing we can do But again in the context of possible contingencies I certainly don't want to rule out the possibility--which we're not-- that we might have to firm a bit sometime between now and July 10th   I understand that But the point I wanted to make was more that the basic purpose of this directive, as I see it, is that it's a framework for a continuity and a discipline in the policy process I don't want to diminish all the current problems but I don't want to see that lost with an endless string of adjectives and qualifiers either   I'm saying [this is] fine, but let's not lose sight of what this really is   I don't have a problem with it because I think I know exactly what it means   Not absent the mergers per se It's absent the stock [unintelligible] regardless of whether they came from mergers or something else Then the number would have been 13 percent    7/16-17/84   In terms of the task of sitting down and doing one of these forecasts twice a year, as Mr Kichline knows, it is never very easy From my perspective right now it's harder than it has been because on the one hand we have an economy that on the surface--by most indicators, statistical and otherwise--looks absolutely terrific But underneath that gloss we have some very serious problems that seem to me on balance to be getting worse rather than better, and that colors my thinking about a forecast For example, as Jim indicated, the Federal budget deficit in a structural sense continues to deteriorate in a very significant way and with nothing in sight that I know of that is going to change that And Jim's estimate of the structural budget deficit next year of $172 billion is literally off the scale of experience Similarly, and again notwithstanding the spectacular performance of the aggregate economy, high interest rates are clearly placing very serious strains on selected classes of domestic and international debtors The banking system, to put it mildly, is fragile The conditions are affecting all sizes of banks and thrifts which, as Jim indicated, are now right back on the edge, if not worse As for external trade, the financial position of the United States, which is helpful in some respects for us and for others, now leaves us highly vulnerable to the sudden and sharp fall of the dollar Whether that will materialize, of course, is another question From my perspective, looking at the first six months of this year, it seems to me that what we have on our hands is a good old fashioned credit binge--almost irrespective of which set of numbers we look at They all say the same thing; and some of them relative to GNP or relative to inflation or relative to something are outside the spectrum of experience Against that    7/16-17/84  background, as I said, I find it very hard to make a forecast For what it's worth the forecast that I've come up with is one that shows the real economy a little stronger, by 1/2 point or so, than the staff has I have no real good reason for that other than my sense of the sheer momentum that the economy has right now, notwithstanding the high interest rates  In the inflation area, which I really think is the swing variable for 1985, I also found it very tough [to make a forecast] In July of last year and February of this year, I had an inflation forecast that was very much at the bottom of the range of Committee members' forecasts And I had it that way for two fundamental reasons One was that I thought the economy was going to be stronger and at that phase of the cycle a stronger economy implied stronger productivity in a context in which wage restraint was still very much in evidence Clearly, in retrospect, inflation was better than even I had thought and I attribute that almost exclusively to the dollar Looking at 1985, unlike 1984, I have an inflation forecast of almost 6 percent on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, which is on the high side of the Committee members' forecasts I ended up there with considerable reluctance But fundamentally the reason I ended up there was that I did have in mind an acceleration, however modest, in compensation, very much like the staff's Strangely enough I had in mind stronger productivity growth than the staff, at around 1-1/2 percent But the difference in my case is that my forecast basically assumes that we will continue to have a positive spread, on the order of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, between the deflator and the rise in unit labor costs in the economy I arrived at that for three reasons First, it is certainly not without a precedent at this stage of the recovery Second, we are moving into ranges of capacity utilization and unemployment that seem to me to imply at least some further pressures in those areas Last, but certainly not least and perhaps most importantly, I continue to think that the point will come when the dollar will have to come off; and if it does come off, my view is that the potential effects of that on domestic inflation coming from the direct effect on imported prices and also the indirect effect on the kind of restraint that these imports are producing could be even greater than the 1 percent that Mr Truman spoke of I am, of course, mindful of the fact that not only wage statistics but commodity prices and other things right now could very well lead to a different view on inflation But even in terms of commodity prices, I assume at the moment that an awful lot of that also is a direct and indirect reflection of the international situation I am not yet ready to conclude that its effects will be permanent over the forecast cycle   I would agree with that As I said, there is no question in my own thinking that precisely those circumstances you have described are one of the reasons why I end up with a higher rate  -10-    7/16-17/84  of inflation I think at some point in the cycle the dollar will come off and the effect of that on domestic prices will be greater than the average effect one picks up by looking at models The reverse is clearly true, in a context in which the dollar were to stay even within, say, 5 or 10 percent of where it is now over the whole forecast period To me that would easily translate into a percentage point, if not more, of better price performance   Actually, the only way I can see something like that in the time frame we're talking about here is if we really had some kind of financial blowout--not that we haven't had some already I don't know how to define that, but there is very little question in my mind that if something of that nature happens in the near term on top of everything else that already has happened, that could precipitate a pretty nasty situation   That's even worse; you're right   I'd go one step further even than Tony I'd be troubled by raising that credit range, particularly on the grounds of raising it because of mergers and leveraged buyouts It seems to me that that's tantamount to sanctioning a pattern of financial behavior that is going to get us in trouble sooner or later If we're going to raise it, raise it But I would not say that we're going to raise it because we have all these damned leveraged buyouts That seems to me to be just bad policy   Coal miners   Personally, an 8 percent nominal GNP as a goal--as distinct from a forecast--is very appealing to me because I think the optimum that one could reasonably think about for 1985 is something like 4 percent [real] and 4 percent [on prices] In my mind, to the extent that nominal GNP grows faster than that, it would increase the likelihood that more of it would be prices and less of it would be real So, primarily for that reason, if I think about '85 from a policy viewpoint and what we should be shooting for, I come out with around 8 percent nominal In terms of the targets I am more than a little attracted to Tony's thought, but my initial thought had been 4 to 7 percent for M1 But as I said, Tony's point has some merit Personally, I would go with 4 to 7 percent, 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent, leave M3 where it is, and use 8 to 10-1/2 percent on credit The bottom of the credit range doesn't matter at all, but I do think that shaving a half point off the top of that has some value As I've said before, I am really troubled by this explosion of credit that we are seeing That consumer credit number yesterday is another indication of this Gosh--a 30 percent annual rate of increase in consumer credit! That's where I would be   Tony, that's not what I--   I think you've misunderstood what I was saying I was not suggesting anything like what you just said; I was making a different point A forecast is one thing But part of the objective of policy isn't to accept the forecast; part of the objective of policy is to try to influence the way in which the economy behaves I am simply saying that   You start off with the policy too, but in the latter context of trying to have policy influence the economy in the most constructive way--   It's kind of like a hippopotamus, Henry!   In terms of the M1 target, as I said before, I would prefer the 4 to 7 percent That's what I keep coming back to in thinking about it Again, I could probably live with something like  -49-    7/16-17/84  Tony suggested What really is at stake here is not just trying to have a policy that will produce a result that will look something like the staff forecast in 1985 It's beyond that I don't think it's inevitable that 1985 has to be the last year of the recovery But my view is rather strongly that if it's not going to be the last year of recovery, it has to be a year in which we have the kind of more moderate growth that we're all talking about So, personally, I think policy should lean on the side of the result that not only enhances the possibility of growth and modest inflation in 1985, but being able to sustain it beyond that And I think the risks are very clearly that the more we deviate from that on the up side, the more it increases the likelihood that it will be the last year of the recovery   Second   I'll stick with the Solomon/Gramley version of alternative B   I think you have to have a margin of protection in that direction It would be almost calamitous to end up with a situation in which interest rates went down in the third quarter and had to go up in the fourth quarter That, to me, would be the worst of all worlds   I still like that, but I think 8 to 11 percent is all right I assume you will be saying something about this horrendous pace of credit and debt growth  -73-    7/16-17/84   Well, we can try to live with 4 to 7-1/2 percent, but with some explicit statement that a further reduction to 7 percent might well be forthcoming   But that last sentence you were talking about before provides for that   There is somewhat of an inevitability here too in the context of the ballpark range of numbers that we are looking at for unemployment and capacity utilization for 1985 We could be lucky and get the kind of inflation picture that people are talking about But it is also true, inevitably true, that we're getting near the point in both capacity utilization and unemployment rates where it wouldn't take a heck of a lot to get a worse result And with all the good things that are going on--and there are a lot of them--if we hit those points, whatever they are, in capacity and unemployment, we will start to get price pressure It's as certain as the day is long   I too would like to stay where we are in terms of the borrowing level, money market conditions, and so on I'd like to take the shortfall in M1 and to some extent the other Ms in July and put it in the bank and save it for a rainy day I like the idea of not changing the darn aggregate specifications at the mid-quarter meeting I don't know exactly how to get this directive language to satisfy that objective while satisfying the larger objective of staying where we are But I assume we could figure out a way to do that   You lost me on the last loop  -33-    8/21/84   That was the second point I understood that On the one after that you lost me   I think there's a husbanding of federal funds going on   Peter, do you think there still is a precautionary premium affecting the federal funds rate right now?   It doesn't work for the exchange rate, but I keep coming away with the feeling that the only plausible explanation in terms of the domestic market is that perhaps way beneath the surface this precautionary [motive] is still quite operative It's the only thing I can figure out   No, not so much on borrowing but that there is just a much more conservative attitude on the part of medium and large size banks in terms on their whole approach to funding and money management, with some implication, obviously, for their willingness to borrow But I don't know It's the only thing that makes any sense to me   In general, Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy for what Mr Boehne said At the same time, there is no question that the tone of things has changed From my own perspective, two months ago I would have put about a zero probability on a fourth quarter of zero or something worse than that I'm not sure where my own mental calculus would take me right now--maybe to the 25 percent the model has, or maybe a little less than that But I still think the best bet, by a comfortable margin, is that we will see a pattern of economic growth emerge in the fourth quarter and in early 1985 along the broad lines suggested in the staff forecast Having said that, there is no question that right now it's darn hard to read through the numbers Clearly, for example, the way that imports are working their way into the economy is just off the charts in terms of our appreciation of what it means for domestic income, employment, and all the rest of it On the other side, it's awfully hard to know what the underlying demand for automobiles is We get reports through our directors and otherwise suggesting that the supply constraints in the automobile industry are very real and that the cars that people want simply are not available The inventory situation is a very, very tough call It could go either way Again, the general attitude we seem to run into everyplace among business people is that they are being very aggressive and they are not terribly uncomfortable with their inventory situations even right now On the housing sector, I think the general view that it's going to stand still is probably right But there's one potential little problem there I get the sense that these adjustable rate mortgages that were put out in such enormous quantities earlier in the year and late last year could be a potential problem in their own right that could possibly have some unsettling influences on the mortgage market, leaving aside the  -16-    10/2/84  problems of the thrifts The inflation outlook, I think, is clearly a plus, both in terms of attitudes and psychology as well as reality While we may be a little surprised by the business numbers, in some way the biggest surprise is the continued very, very satisfactory showing on the inflation side, which is reflected in recent [wage] settlements as well  Just a word on the agricultural situation The credit side is no better than it was in May; it's probably worse notwithstanding the fact that production yields are going to be pretty good On balance, I think the credit side is probably worse But all in all, as I said, I think the best bet by a comfortable margin is a rebound along the lines of the staff forecast The biggest wild card by far is the financial situation, despite the progress that was made with some of the LDC debt problems and so forth I think the real wild card is the possibility of some more uncertainties or unsettling events in the financial situation quickly spilling over into a question of confidence about dollar-denominated assets in general It could have very adverse implications for the dollar That would be the worst of all worlds   I would take the specifications of "B" as is, with borrowing at $750 million That view is partly conditioned on my view of the economy and partly conditioned on my thought that the trajectory we are facing going into 1985 with money growth is important It's also based on a belief that if incoming developments did warrant some further easing, we could get a pretty quick response in the real economy On that I happen to agree with Frank Morris But it's also based on not very scientific observations that suggest that the law of averages with regard to the money supply is now working against us We have gotten surprised on the down side for several months running and I have this fear that one of these months, for no necessarily obvious reason, we could have a big surprise on the up side And, in that kind of circumstance, I think there is a very great risk of interest rates moving down much too fast--the risk of the whipsaw effect I'd hate like the devil to find ourselves in a position later this year or early next year, for whatever reasons--the economy, money supply, the exchange rate--where we had to reverse quickly Indeed, I would argue that that might be more damaging to the thrifts than staying where we are in the intervening weeks and  -30-    10/2/84  months So, I do see a real risk of a whipsaw effect that could be very damaging if we get too far out in front of this thing  I'd like to think that there was something that could be done with open market operations to facilitate a soft landing of the dollar, but I guess I don't I do have an open mind as to what kind of contingent language, symmetrical or otherwise, might be in the directive that would permit some further reduction in the borrowing level if the economy and so forth warranted it But I would be very much on the side of a gingerly response rather than any very aggressive probing I would draw that distinction   There is one thing I'm very uncomfortable about As you stated, when you start out at $750 million, you're willing to go to $650 million and if the funds rate comes down a little more in the circumstance that you described, I think that's probably all right My hunch is that, absent this precautionary premium or whatever we want to call it, the funds rate probably would move down by itself in the fourth quarter in the context in which we had money growth around 6 percent and borrowings around $750 million But my real concern is the other contingency that events could very well precipitate an increase in that precautionary premium Then, we would end up with a situation in which at any borrowing level, the federal funds rate would tend to be higher And then we would be left with a Catch-22 situation where money growth, wherever it may be, could be in some structural sense out of line with what is observed in the federal funds market and what is observed with the level of borrowing And I just don't know what to do about that   Now, that would be the worst I'm saying that the contingency I'm concerned about would be if this precautionary atmosphere that we see in the way banks are managing their money is intensified   Yes, but my concern is that we might get that in a context in which money growth is strong   Then we have a real problem   I think there's a good chance we may be confronted with that   In the context of what I thought you were saying before, Mr Chairman, in terms of borrowings that could get down to, say, $600 to $650 million and a federal funds rate that could get down to 10 percent or 10-1/2 percent or something like that, I think that contingency could be covered easily in a directive that tilts rather than falls Again, I must say that the danger that really bothers me is this whipsaw phenomenon I spoke of before If we went through a period where we had, say, a 150 basis points swing up and down in short-term interest rates in a period of three months or so, I think that would be very, very damaging to the real economy and for the thrifts, for the banks, and for everybody else  -41-    10/2/84   I would say the reason why is that if we start to move in that direction in a context in which it's perceived that there is a potential for a rather large move, the markets will respond very aggressively We'll get another surge of all this crazy activity in the mortgage markets and then it will just get stopped dead in its tracks if interest rates have to turn around   I don't have any problem--   I don't have any trouble with the substance of what I think you're saying I don't even have any trouble with the suggestion that it would take some considerable set of circumstances to envision a tightening move in the next five weeks But what I do have trouble with is creating a perception that what we have in mind is more than what I think you're saying Most people are saying--   I may be   Well, in those circumstances, if the borrowing level goes down in this five-week period, or even early in the five- week period, to this $650 or $600 million--    10/2/84   I could easily support that   My own view is that the staff forecast is probably about on the mark In fact, I still very much lean to the view that in the next two or three quarters as a whole, there is a good chance that the economy will be stronger than the staff forecast rather than weaker I may be a little less certain about that now than I was six weeks ago, as are other people; nevertheless, that's still where I'd put the probabilities The uncertainty factor clearly does reflect the very, very near-term outlook What is this mishmash of statistics and anecdotes really telling us? On the retail sales side, we had meetings last week with the CEOs of all the big companies in Minneapolis--and there are two very sizable retailers headquartered there--and they,  -11-    11/7/84  remain extremely bullish about the outlook for retail sales in the near term notwithstanding this pronounced slowing in the last two weeks of October  On the other side of the picture, a couple of the companies in the Twin Cities that are major manufacturers and suppliers of electronic gear and happen to be thought of as computer companies--in fact, they make lots of components that go into both commercial and residential construction--reported a surge in industrial bookings in October That was the word that they used Insofar as the equipment that they manufacture and sell is associated with housing, they don't know whether it's related to new housing or renovation, of course But in October, or I should say the 30 days ending last Thursday, they had an all-time record 30-day pace of activity for bookings and shipments of electronic components that go into residential units Maybe that's consistent with the view that the decline in interest rates that we've seen is beginning to take hold a little While the housing sales figures in the last set of numbers were somewhat mixed geographically, there was some spark at least for one month evident in those statistics as well When I put it together, again, I would agree with many of the comments that the immediate situation is harder than usual to read I personally do not see a recession in sight or anything that would remotely qualify as a recession  I have two quick comments on imports and agriculture This import phenomenon, as I think I said once before, is really off the chart There is no doubt that that makes it extremely difficult to figure out where the driving forces are, but I will just try to put that in perspective with a couple of concrete examples For example, one of these companies told me that just in the past six or seven months they have started buying disk drives for floppy disks for smaller computers from a Taiwanese supplier They are delivered in Minneapolis for $60 a unit whereas the cheapest they can make them with no markup--the cheapest they can-manufacture them themselves anyplace in the United States--is $140 a unit Another very large high-tech company reported to me that within the time frame of this year they started buying transformers for their medium size main frame computers from Far Eastern sources Again, the price delivered to them in the United States is one-third of the cheapest price they can manufacture that type of component Indeed, one of these companies reported to me that the situation has reached a point where, no matter what one assumes about exchange rates or anything else, from the point of view of their corporate long-term strategic planning they have now found themselves forced for the first time to consider seriously going into off-shore supply in a major way through their own facilities They find that very distasteful but the economics of it are such that they find themselves compelled to think in those terms  On the agricultural situation, I would just echo what Si Keehn has said It is not pretty And I think it is now starting to back up in a way that you can see the implications of it on the small banks--all these darn small one-bank holding companies that are sitting out there and are leveraged to the hilt It could be very troubling  -12-    11/7/84   They'll [unintelligible] one way or the other here   From my perspective what we have seen here over the past several weeks, and indeed months, has been something that I would consider an orderly adjustment in policy and interest rates and so on There was at least a fleeting moment when I thought it might become a little messy but that did not materialize In the broad context of the situation that we are looking at, I would not be troubled if interest rates went down a bit more in a context not unlike what Tony spoke about earlier But let me turn to that in a minute My view of the economy is a little different from many others That is a factor in my thinking But I would also caution    11/7/84  against too much of a reaction to M1 We have been through M1 problems and we are going to go through them again It seems to me that all of these fine arguments that Mr Axilrod and others make about M1 really come down to the question of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin I don't know how many I do know that seasonal adjustment factors alone can make a big difference We have looked at these data using a seasonal adjustment technique that's very respectable--I don't think it's any better than any others but it's very respectable--and it produces almost a $7 billion increase in the money supply from the first week of June to the second week of October rather than a decline   The point isn't that any one is better than any other The point is that this series is notoriously noisy and we don't really understand it in the short run, and I think to pretend that we do is a mistake The only thing we can be sure about in terms of M1 is that if it's surprising us on the down side right now, it's going to be surprising us on the up side at some point in the not too distant future So, while I recognize the very special psychological if not political significance of M1, I must say I would be very cautious about going too far too fast in response to it even in the context of everything else that is going on My thoughts on specifics would be somewhere between "A" and "B" I have no great concern about the money specifications themselves Borrowing of $550 to $600 million wouldn't bother me I would prefer, at least for now, to leave the federal funds range at 8 to 12 percent   --particularly at the beginning of the period It could at the end of the period   I personally think that whatever we do the market is at a point where it is likely to try to run beyond it, which is another reason I would favor a more conservative approach I think the market psychology is a big factor here  -49-    11/7/84   [It's not] the difference between $550 and $600 million I think the only thing that matters is the extent to which there is an implicit automatic assumption that you'd go down further to $500 or even $400 million   It has been a factor, hasn't it, Steve?  -50-    11/7/84   It's the one we had the last time   Well, I don't think I really want to change anything, and I guess I have a couple of reasons First of all, I think that this whole debate about automaticity and targeting procedures and everything else is very germane as is this reliability question that Steve talks about in his memorandum And on the reliability of M1, I must confess that I'm more skeptical, not less In my judgment, these various equations under the best of conditions don't leave one very comfortable; and I would emphasize that those equations by definition are the best of conditions because among other things they incorporate all the historical data revisions Apropos of that, even as we sit here today questioning what happened in the first half and the second half of this year, I think there's at least a 50- 50 chance that by the time the jury is in and all the revisions are made M1 is going to look a lot different for the year 1984 than it looks right now   Yes, the pattern within the year In other words, the second half will be a good deal stronger and the first half will be a good deal weaker I don't know that for certain but, as I say, there is at least a 50-50 chance of that and that's just the first revision There will be several others down the road So, I think the question of the reliability of M1 just in the narrow and empirical sense of the numbers themselves is a very, very important aspect of this question of automaticity Partly for that reason but for many others, as Tony and others have touched on, I think it would be a mistake to make any move in the direction of a more automatic response no matter how marginal it may seem Having said that, I too have my frustrations--not so much with the apparatus, but in some very real ways with the environment within which it works Clearly, at least in my judgment, during this year and last year the Committee has moved in the direction of looking through reserves, M1, and all the Ms and looking more--perhaps not in a systematic way but in a fairly deliberate way--at the economy, exchange rates, prices, industrial production, and all the rest of it And part of what we're seeing, in my judgment, is nothing more than the fact that the economy on both sides has surprised us in a significant way throughout this period And because the economy has surprised us, we have found ourselves in the position where the need to make these flexible adjustments has seemed to the Committee as a whole to be a pressing need I think the fact that those adjustments were made and the way that they were made over the period as a whole basically constituted a pretty solid approach to policy, recognizing that we're never going to be able to    12/17-18/84  fine-tune this; that's just not in the cards Some of the frustration that we all feel at times I think has to do with the fact that these adjustments are made in intermeeting periods and we all have our personal subjective biases as to which are most important and which are least important in the laundry list of things that we put into the directive--whether it's the exchange rate, or M2, or M22, or the GNP, or whatever And because our personal biases may differ a little in terms of where the priorities lie, there may be differing degrees of frustration in terms of whether and how much of an adjustment is made in the borrowings target, particularly against the background of the appropriate inhibition against treating any of those intermeeting consultations as a meeting [requiring] a vote on all the rest of the apparatus that could go with it My bottom line, Mr Chairman, is that I think the apparatus works pretty well, particularly against the background of my personal skepticism about M1, and I think the frustrations that we all feel at times are almost inevitable But compared to the alternative, I think those frustrations are quite manageable   Let me just clarify [my comment] I think you misunderstood me What I was saying was that when all is said and  -16-    12/17-18/84  done the slowdown in M1 that everybody is so concerned about right now might not even be there in the final figures   What would have happened if the federal funds rate went all over the place? Then the money supply would have been all over the place too   Well, in the abstract that might be right But on the basis of experience I see nothing that suggests that one can disentangle the behavior of the federal funds rate from these other short- and long-term rates Now, in theory, they should be able to be disentangled   That's what we tried And look at the behavior of the money market and the bond market and the mortgage market and everything else   Barely   There's another point, too, on this business of chasing M1 around Don't forget that since the experience between [October] '79 and early '82 we've had a heck of a lot more deposit deregulation in the banking system and there's a potential implication in terms of the behavior of the real economy The credit quality of banks and thrifts in the kind of interest rate environment the depository institutions are operating in is, if anything, worse than it was in that earlier period I don't claim to--   Do you people have any feel at all as to how much of housing starts and residential construction outlays in recent quarters is for what would be considered second houses?   I think the dollar figure would be even more important because if one looks at all these recreational areas around the country, one sees very, very expensive houses and condos and so forth They seem to be springing up all over the place   What's your best guess now for that number for the month as a whole?   Well, Mr Chairman, let me respond to the questions to us in the order you raised them First of all, in terms of the tentative ranges for 1985 They look fine to me; I don't see any particular reason at this point to change them On the question of relative weights and operating techniques As I mentioned yesterday, I'm not dissatisfied with our operating techniques In fact, despite the surprises we've had in the economy, I think the performance of monetary policy, as best I can judge it over the past year or maybe two years, probably has been as good as you can get it Despite the fact that M1 growth has popped around, 1984 is the first year that I can remember, Steve, where we've never actually gone outside the cone; we've been in the cone for the whole year You raised the question yesterday, Mr Chairman, about primary emphasis on M1 Part of the problem is that nobody knows quite what that means I do think that in the fullness of time and over long enough periods of time the behavior of M1 should get a relatively heavy amount of weight, which I think it gets But I don't think it should get primary weight if that means chasing it around in the short run Again, looked at in the fullness of time, the behavior of M1 even for 1984 at 5 percent or so doesn't seem to me to be very far from something that I would consider quite acceptable  On the question of the forecast In general, I'm pretty close to Frank I certainly have been quite wrong in terms of my near-term expectations for the last couple of months But as best I can weed through everything, I still think that the prospects for 1985 are on the stronger side of the staff's forecast, which is fine to me If I were to try and articulate an optimal--I shouldn't say optimal but rather acceptable--set of goals for 1985, something in the area of 4 percent real growth with an inflation rate holding about where it is looks like a pretty result from my point of view One thing I would stress, though, is that by a lot of standards inflation, even if it were to stay at 4 percent, is still high Indeed, when you look at what has happened this year, there is still a question as to why inflation is as high as it is, not why it's as low as it is I think that has to remain a consideration in our minds, particularly going out into 1985 As Jim pointed out yesterday, the pressures from profit margins are going to increase at least in a behavioral way Whether they can reflect themselves in higher prices is another subject I think the two wild cards of note, in terms of the economic outlook, are the trade situation and the tax policy questions The staff forecast and most other forecasts basically are saying that the trade position will stay about where it is right now I don't know if that's a safe bet or not Certainly, as a general proposition, that situation continues to be a source of great uncertainty in my mind And I don't know how to judge the uncertainties coming out of all these tax policy questions My hunch is that they will hurt rather than help The one other point I would make is that I now have the sense that--reflecting the relatively good performance of wages and prices and maybe especially wages--we may in this period have achieved something of a more permanent downward shift in inflationary expectations and in the yield curve That, again, I think can be a positive development in terms of the real economy in 1985   When the borrowing was $400 million, what did we think was the steady state of federal funds?   I don't have any problems with the monetary specifications of alternative B I think shading to the 6-1/2 percent rather than the 7 percent for the reasons Chuck described may serve our interests better I have just one other technical comment You mentioned in your clarifying sentence for the directive, Mr Chairman, a reference to the economy and the exchange rate I personally would prefer not to make an explicit reference to the exchange rate because the kind of scenario where there is some suspicion in the marketplace that the Federal Reserve is trying to engineer the exchange rate really scares me in terms of a precipitous drop in the exchange rate, with all that means So, I would prefer not to put that in the directive explicitly but leave it understood Now, on the money market side--   The way he was suggesting putting it in the operative sentence was different I thought you were saying, Mr Chairman, put it in the sentence that is in capital letters on page 12   That strikes me as a little different than an explicit reference to the exchange rate   I perceive that situation as maybe being more tentative than others, but I would be concerned about how the market might react to that On the substance of the money market part of this, I'm not allergic to tapping the ease button but I have a little concern about pushing the panic button And principally for those reasons, I would favor a more gradual approach, along the lines that Tony has suggested I do, of course, view the economy as being at least a little stronger than many others here I could be right or I could be wrong On the other hand, if we can sneak in a further reduction in interest rates in a context in which I now believe there has been some kind of downward step-shift in inflationary expectations, I think that's fine But I would prefer to be a little more gentle about the package and I would lean toward Tony's suggestion of sneaking up on it rather than going for the brass ring at one shot  -65-    12/17-18/84   No, I would see it as a more than $50 million   I don't think it's a question of a $50 million difference If you go back to when the borrowing level was put at $400 million, the thought then was that the steady state fed funds rate was 8-3/4 percent If we were to go immediately to $250 million, I think the discount rate would have to go with it and it seems to me quite plausible that the fed funds rate could settle in at less than 8 percent So, you're talking basically about a 75 to 100 basis point move in terms of the operative implications of the fed funds rate And that to me is just a very, very big step I'd love to think that we could end up there, but I think it is a very big step   I would agree with that Any of these things in a behavioral way postulates very substantial increases in reserves  -66-    12/17-18/84   I don't know; it could work that way Yes, it could   What does the "somewhat more rapid" sentence say now?   There's a historical and understandable bias against answering this question, but within the context of either of those levels of borrowing is it the general expectation of the Committee that the steady state level of interest rates would fall out at below 8 percent? That's in some way the thing that I'm stuck on   That kind of thing is fine with me too in most circumstances   I assumed we were voting for 7, 9, and 9   Where have you been, Sam?   I second that   On the other side of the coin, though, Henry, if nothing happens to the exchange rate, I think it is pretty clear that there's likely to be more pressure on interest rates in a number of those countries   If there were any systematic effort, as opposed to these issues of finesse, to place more direct    2/12-13/85  significance, say, to the exchange rate in terms of Peter's day-to-day operations, I think that's the Committee's decision, not Peter's--with all due respect to Peter I think there is room for the finesse factor from time to time, and I think he uses it But I interpret your question as being a little more fundamental than that I think if it's a more fundamental question like that, that's a decision we have to make, not him   My own interpretation of the price forecasts, looking at the range of forecasts as well as my own, is    2/12-13/85  that I consider them basically unchanged If you look at the deflator on a fixed-weight basis, excluding food and energy, for the four quarters ending in 1984 and the four quarters ending in 1985, it's basically 4 percent in both years And when you look at 1985 as opposed to 1984, ending up with the same rate of inflation is better in some sense because, if the economy behaves like the forecast, I think we're going to have at least some pressures from commodity prices over the next year The dollar certainly isn't going to continue to go up; it probably will go down But even if it stays the same, people are not going to buy as much and we will get some further pressure on a year-over-year basis from unit labor costs But I personally don't interpret the forecast as saying that inflation is worse in 1985 than in 1984 It is either about the same or maybe a little better   Are you ready for more general comments?   Let me make a couple of more general comments Our own view of the economy for 1985 is one that has real GNP growing about 4 percent, with the deflator a shade lower than that And at this juncture, that has the characteristics of a good forecast from my perspective In the short run it could actually be a bit stronger The impression I get from talking to business people and others over the past month or so is that most of them have been marking up their projection of real growth and marking down their inflation projection for the year But I think there probably is a consensus somewhere in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range for both real GNP and prices  On the point that was just brought up, the feeling comes out very, very forcefully in comments from directors and business leaders that we have crossed the Rubicon on this external stuff and that it may already be taking a bigger bite than even those numbers suggest For example, who represents a very, very large multinational firm heavy in capital goods, thinks that in recent quarters 100 percent of the increase in spending on equipment is coming from abroad Just within the past week he made some comments to the effect that he had seen his order book affected in a very sizable way just in the past month because of the international trade situation So, that continues to be a wild card and it's getting wilder by the minute I have some of the same concerns that Pres had  -14-    2/12-13/85  about the housing sector It should be a good year, but there are some things in there that I find troubling as well  Extracting from the traditional sectoral questions of what the risks are to a forecast, it seems to me that there are two or three more generic risks that are particularly important in the current setting One of those is What happens if interest rates go up in any appreciable way? Let me just define appreciable as more than a percentage point in the short run Obviously, that would be a very difficult situation And then you ask yourself What could produce that? If the budget deficit is not reduced, that could produce it; and if the dollar declines in any appreciable way, that could produce it even though the cushion for a dollar decline is somewhat larger now than it was before That result could also come from the economy growing too fast because, from my perspective at least, the balance in our credit markets is so precarious, as indicated in one of Mike's charts, that it doesn't take much to push us into a situation in which the economy is growing too fast Even though that might not reflect itself in price pressures, it could easily be reflected in interest rate pressures Then, of course, there is always the possibility--perhaps remote at the moment--that the market could conclude that money growth in some broad sense is getting away from us So, there is a whole collection of things, any one of which I think could produce pressures on interest rates And I think it goes without saying that any appreciable pressures in that direction would throw any forecast to the wind  Another thing that I am somewhat concerned about in terms of risks is the burden of all this debt we're accumulating I'm not as sanguine as I thought you seemed to be, Mike, in terms of the cumulative effect of that debt burden--particularly in the context of what I think is still some fragility in the financial system And I don't think all of these crazy new markets and instruments that are coming along almost daily are helping that situation Just to put that debt situation in one perspective Since 1982, the ratio of nonfinancial debt to nominal GNP has risen by 17 [hundredths] It's almost a vertical line, and the level of that debt right now is so far out of line with anything we've ever experienced That's just another way of looking at it that is troubling  The last thing I would mention on the risk side is the oil price; that has been talked about a little I was surprised the other day when a point was made to me in a conversation with someone I regard as a fairly credible source The nature of the comment was that among a group of people thought to be experts, a third of them now thought there was at least some possibility that the oil price could fall, say, to the $16 range No one was predicting that as a hard prediction, but there was at least the recognition of that as a possibility by a fairly knowledgeable and sizable group of so-called experts I must say when I stop and try to think about the implications of that, I'm not sure what they are They probably, or most certainly, are not good So, in general, I come out with [the view that] everybody is feeling good about the situation right now but getting a little more worried about what the situation implies down the road   No, because if it were 8 percent nominal GNP growth, particularly in a more mature stage of the business recovery, normally the deficit financing this percentage of GNP would be down I think that's why the predicament of this overall credit market situation is so hard to--   No, I'm saying--   Yes And even in 1975, on that chart we had earlier, the big spike in government borrowing was accompanied by a corresponding downward spike in private borrowing   Well, I would prefer the ranges actually adopted in mid-1984, although I'm a little agnostic on some shading of those targets insofar as they pertain to M3 and total credit But, in particular, I would not want to see the M1 range for 1985 different from the 4 to 7 percent If M1 were at the top of that range, at 7 percent, that would permit an 8 percent rise in nominal GNP with only a 1 percent increase in velocity And that's not unusual, even for the third year of economic expansion On the other hand, if inflation could actually be lower than 4 percent or so--as some people suggest--then that kind of a result could occur with even less than a 1 percent increase in velocity More importantly, if it worked out during the year that velocity wasn't growing at all but was declining, I think it would be a heck of a lot easier to adjust in that direction--even if it meant being above the range, which I think is unlikely--than to have to adjust the other way [By other way, I mean] having money growth at 7-1/2 or 8 percent, which would still be in the target range but in a context in which it turns out that velocity is increasing and nominal GNP is growing too fast So, I feel somewhat strongly about that one in particular In general, I  -36-    2/12-13/85  prefer something like alternative II or the ranges we adopted tentatively in July--again with some agnosticism on credit and M3   I have a strong preference for the first   Are people talking about 9 to 12 percent?   Were you suggesting raising that?   I wouldn't be bothered by 1/2 point [higher] on that just because I'm not sure what's going to happen to it   The problem is that if you allow for real growth of more than 4 percent, I think you have to forget about the targets in one sense and ask yourself the question What's likely to be going on in the economy over some period of time? I'm not talking about a quarter, but if over a period of time the economy is growing by more than 4 percent, it seems to me that in the circumstances we're faced with right now--leaving aside the magic of these targets--the outcome may well be one that is going to put more pressure on financial markets and interest rates And it's going to subvert our effort to try and create a policy environment in which we can keep the economy growing at 4 percent for a long time That's one of the things that worries me, Chuck   Again, that's another possibility The problem I have is that the higher we set the targets the more difficult it will be to react in some coherent way if things break on the up side   So do I   The only word I stumble over a bit is "limited" Could that be made "gradual" or "moderate" or--  -53-    2/12-13/85   I think it is "some"   Maybe it's a matter of semantics ["Limited" sounds as] if there is a predetermined point beyond which we would not go in any circumstance It's partly the semantics of it that I'm reacting to I am not talking about being aggressive or anything like that, but I think a word like "gradual" or "some" is just more in [tune] with the kind of approach we take to these things   It's conveying that sense of fluidity, even if we don't--   The reverse is also true, though If, as John says, we had double-digit M1 growth for several more months running, you can draw your lines any way you want and you have one heck of a problem   Yes, we did both   We rebased and raised [the M1 range]   While the staff is looking that up, I would just note that one of the things that could really help the price outlook is some relaxation in these Japanese automobiles quotas because one of the troubling things about prices even now is the way the auto manufacturers are sneaking in all these price increases   That's probably true   I think we could guarantee that what they would call expensive would be different from what you'd call expensive   We're talking about short-term velocity rather than long-term   "Developments" is a better word   Page 5   Or whatever it--   You got a little overanxious over there!   As is   I could live with your (b)   Why don't you see who could accept your (b) but not necessarily prefer it   8 percent   Keep in mind that that moment is 1150 am By 1200 noon it may be something else!   Somewhat reluctantly?   Move it   So moved  -2-    3/26/85   I think you have to look at the foreign exchange market right now in broader terms than just the dollars representing the current account deficit The magnitude of traffic in the churning and trading that are taking place in that market--both in the cash market and all these derivative markets--is just mind boggling at this point I don't know how to measure it, but my hunch is that if we measured this particular episode of intervention against the size of the market in a trading sense--the $10 billion dollars spent over this period relative to what $10 billion dollars would have been in, say, 1978--my hunch is that it would be a pittance Now, ultimately, the stocks should have something to do with the price response But that market is just so enormous Frankly, it's so enormous that to me it's very troubling just by nature of the flows and the changing structure and character Sam and I were talking a little about that at breakfast this morning   There were a couple of dealers involved, but they were able--    3/26/85   As far as the economy is concerned, I too have a pretty murky crystal ball at this time We have a forecast that actually is a couple tenths stronger than the Greenbook forecast in terms of real GNP I don't see any particular reason to change that right now, although I would concede that the balance of risks at this point seems to be on the down side rather than the up side I do think that business attitudes, and perhaps consumer attitudes as well, have soured a bit even since we met last As has already been said, part of that reflects the now broad-based--verging on universal--concerns about imports and the way in which they are affecting the domestic economy I myself also sense a renewed sense of skepticism, notwithstanding Mr Domenici's efforts, on the budget At this point I think that skepticism, at least as it reaches me, is bordering on cynicism Obviously, the Ohio situation and related problems have taken some toll; I'll get back to that in a minute  On the price side, I don't pay any attention to the GNP deflator but I must confess in dissecting the producer and consumer price indexes for the last couple of months, I do see a couple of things there that bother me I can't imagine why they are there For example, in the wholesale area for finished goods--or producer goods or whatever we call them now--there was a detectable uptick in the rate of increase in both January and February, which gets sloughed off as being used cars one month and something else another month I see a little of the same thing, again hardly detectable, in the consumer area Neither of those things in and of themselves is of great concern; but they are of concern in the sense that I can't imagine why they are there at all under the current circumstances  I certainly would associate myself with those who say that in some ways the greatest concern right now is this financial fragility But I end up a little differently than some who have spoken I must say I am very hard pressed, notwithstanding the efforts of the Comptroller and others, to see any renewed burst of conservatism or discipline in lending policies and financial market practices in general If you look at just the growth of total credit, you don't see it If you look at the ways in which activities are being financed off balance sheets and so forth, you don't see it To the contrary, you can still find--without looking very hard--instances in which banking organizations are moving in the direction of more liberal lending policies in a very deliberate sense So I would have, if anything, more concern there in that I do not see any real hard  -16-    3/26/85  pervasive evidence of the kind of discipline in the financial sector that I think we ultimately are going to need So far as the Ohio situation is concerned, I think the jury is still out Karen probably knows more than I do about this, but it seems to me a distinct possibility that we still are facing a situation in which small depositors may end up losing money If indeed that is the case, I would suggest that the jury may still be out in terms of the psychology of that and how that plays out over time I'm not sure what to do about these financial soft spots On the one hand, you might argue that a more accommodative policy would help; but to the extent that underlying discipline isn't there in the first place, I suppose you could argue that a more accommodative policy could hurt them I'm not sure that we can solve that problem by the conventional kind of wiggles in monetary policy But I think it is a very, very significant overhang on the overall situation right now   I think it's not even Canadian; they are importing timber even from places far more distant than Canada   I too would generally associate myself with alternative B but, for the reasons Mr Stern mentioned and one other, I would favor having the M1 target at 6 percent--6, 7, and 8 percent [respectively for M1, M2, and M3] In addition to the reasons that Gary stated, I think we have potentially a bit of a public relations problem in that 6-1/2 percent--and this really is splitting hairs--puts the target for the quarter above the parallel line Against the background in which you and others of us have been saying that if there's a "change in policy" we would communicate it, I think that aiming at something that would be a hair above the parallel line at this point is susceptible to interpretation as a change in policy So, I would like to see the 6 percent for the substantive reasons mentioned but also because it would just about kiss the parallel line   Well, the market also runs ahead of itself If you look at this whole period since the last Committee meeting, some of the increase in the funds rate, and I think some of the marginal pressure on the borrowings, just reflected the change in market psychology that took place early on in the period There's no  -38-    3/26/85  way in the world that you can try and wash that out The market seems to do a pretty good job these days of getting ahead of this thing   Yes, I could associate with that view I think there may well be a case here for some bias in the direction of early consultation But I would not want to see the formal band in the directive changed   Taking account of all the noise, particularly that one two-week period where we had that $1-1/2 billion borrowing [by one] institution, I don't think the markets would sense that we're very far away from $400 million right now would they, Peter?   I can associate with that too   We usually have one single point   [Unintelligible] percent   Second   Little does he know!   In the old days, the guy at the New York Fed who wrote the report could never read it   Though less so in the first quarter compared to last year   To me it's astonishing, given what has been going on in this market, that somebody hasn't taken one great big loss in foreign exchange operations It's a miracle   The logic of that can only take you so far Somebody somewhere is absorbing the price risk associated with this volatility   Everybody can't be hedged; that's clear enough   Mr Chairman, looking at the economy first and taking a little longer perspective on it, I think the  -12-    5/21/85  numbers would suggest that domestic final demand really has been performing more or less as expected for the third year of the recovery and maybe even a little better than expected But the wild card, as has been amply reflected so far in the discussion, insofar as the GNP and production, etc, is the external side Against that backdrop, I still lean to the view that for the balance of the year real GNP is likely to be growing in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range And I think that this recent rather pronounced decline in interest rates provides a little further measure of insurance in that direction At the same time, that kind of forecast is one that assumes a much smaller drag coming from the external sector over the balance of the year While economists seem pretty comfortable as a group with that, I will be darned if I can find a businessman--whether in small or large business--who agrees with that I think that remains, therefore, the wild card  I agree with those who say that the nonresidential sector-- the construction sector in particular--looks very vulnerable at this point On this question of financial shocks and disturbances, the point has to be made--whatever else one might want to say about them-- that to the extent that they are being managed and contained, they are being managed and contained with a very high degree of government involvement Whether it is front page news or not, that has been the case Indeed, what I see almost daily is the situation where "free markets will take care of things" is a slogan only until people think they are on the hook And then that slogan goes out the window in one heck of a hurry I would like to say that I can see some reemergence of discipline growing out of this cumulation of problems, but I don't see it The leaders in banking and investment banking institutions, foreign and domestic, have reached the point where I think they want discipline But in a setting in which all of the institutional sand has been taken out of the wheels, they don't seem to know how to get it I think that those vulnerabilities in that setting are something to be concerned about  On the inflation side, I keep coming out on the side of being uneasy I look at the numbers and I listen to what everybody says and I am tempted to reach the same conclusion that Governor Rice just stated that these are all temporary things But I can't quite get myself comfortable with that Even if these things are temporary, the rate of inflation that we are seeing right now, against the backdrop of the exchange rate that we are seeing right now, still strikes me as high I am concerned that if the inflation rate were to start to creep up from where it is now, even by a percentage point or so, and produce the situation in which we felt at some point we had to move against that, it would be a very, very difficult thing to engineer, to put it mildly But more importantly, I think some of this financial market situation that we are seeing still reflects a kind of residual point of view that says somewhere down the road inflation is going to bail this situation out So, I can't bring myself to be sanguine about the inflationary situation, even though I certainly don't think it is something that has to be the number one priority for policy But I think it has to be watched very, very closely   While Mr Axilrod is looking, I will give you a sample of one   As long as we know where they are I will make a suggestion which really does involve keeping reserve pressures about where they are In terms of the monetary aggregate  -24-    5/21/85  specifications, I can easily live with those specified in alternative B I personally would shade the borrowings level a bit higher than the staff's suggestion of $300 to $350 million This is really splitting [hairs], but I would rather see it $350 to $375 million because I think that is compatible with existing money market conditions, as I understand them   The thrifts are out as described by Mr Axilrod in his [briefing] a few minutes ago   Again, I would take alternative B with borrowings of $350 to $375 million We have this awkward problem of having set monetary growth paths for the quarter in March that, especially in the case of M2 and M3, just are now so far out of line with what we were talking about then that I think we have to consider --although no one likes it--finessing the language of the directive to acknowledge that situation at least as it pertains to M2 and M3 I think M1 we can finesse without any great problems That's about where I am   Yes   I do not   I'd just make one quick technical comment on M2 In March and especially in April there has been a very substantial runoff of RPs, which we think is associated with the anomaly of the Treasury balance and the refund problem That itself is a major factor in terms of abnormally slow growth of M2 in this period   I agree But the runoff of RPs, Peter, was how much in April?   It was big dollars   We can't really say "taking account of progress against inflation" anymore either   That's another reason why it's disturbing that the general price level is rising as much as it is   Car prices   In the latest consumer [price report]? I haven't seen that   I think that's a good idea   I think the neatest thing to do is to say April to June rates of 6 to 7 percent for all of them and just wink at that 7-1/2 percent on M3  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I think that--   It's fine with me   I don't like to get in a position of splitting hairs about this borrowing But it seems to me that $350 million taken by itself is kind of a threshold because if it goes down and stays down at $350 million or falls below that, there is a real danger I think we'd find ourselves again in a situation where it would start pushing on the current level of the discount rate And at this juncture, I at least would not want us to fall into a situation where the behavior of the federal funds rate starts to give rise to market expectations of a further discount rate reduction I had mentioned $350 to $375 million, but I think the $350 million number at this point is more than symbolically significant because I think it does get you into that range where I would start to get very uncomfortable   But that would take place in the normal course [of events], and I wouldn't want to kind of fall into that independent of the economy   We ended up with "would" and "might" on the second page?   I think at this point you can make a pretty good case that that could happen, even to the extent of neutralizing a small 8 percent change in the exchange rate completely on domestic prices   The forecast that I put in--I have to say it was my own and not my staff's--   Like Governor Partee's, it is very much on the high side in terms of what I see as the consensus for 1986   In looking at the six quarters ahead, my forecast is on the high side Arithmetically, it has that result because of a bunch of small differences in net exports and government purchases But the big difference is in housing where I have basically gone with about 2 million units in housing starts, and that accounts for about 3/4 to almost a full percentage point difference in real growth I came to that view with some considerable hesitation; nevertheless, I do think that there is something to the view that pent-up demand for conventional owner-occupied housing--not second residences such as Vail, Colorado condominiums--is still pretty strong in a framework within which financing opportunities look distinctly better  On the investment side, I don't have any real insight except to say that in recent weeks I have spoken to three CEOs of major  -10-    7/9-10/85  computer electronics companies about this question Do we see a real turnaround in high-tech investment or some kind of short-run glitch? Their opinion is that it is more likely a short-run glitch than any kind of real weakness of a permanent nature that is setting in I don't think it is going to make a great upside difference, but I think it does say something about the relative downside risks to the investment sector itself  I am influenced in the outlook also by the fall in interest rates that we have seen; and while I am certainly by no stretch of the imagination a monetarist, we sure as heck have a lot of liquidity in the economy by any definition that I can think of Having said all that, I would have to say in terms of my own forecast that I would quickly recognize that the risks are on the down side I think the financial sector presents its own risks; the commercial real estate sector that Chuck mentioned is one that worries me enormously at this point Indeed, when you really look through the problem of the dynamics in trying to reverse the trade balance in any significant way, it is really tough sledding We did a little exercise that probably isn't much better than the little exercises other people do-- this is not built into the forecast--but even if we quickly got something as large as a 15 percent one-time downward change in the exchange rate, the implications of that for the trade balance over this six-quarter period are really quite modest, to put it mildly So, while one can perhaps argue with some conviction that the rate of deterioration in the trade balance should moderate and might even come close to stabilizing, producing any meaningful reversal--particularly in the face of these very, very large profit margins of foreign suppliers--is going to be enormously difficult The long-run implications of that in terms of the current account, in terms of the capital flows from abroad, and in terms of the ultimate vulnerability to a big shock in the exchange rate, seem to be that it will get a lot worse as time goes on I certainly don't have an answer as to what to do; but I am more impressed with how difficult it is to get ourselves out of the quagmire  On the price side, my own forecast is somewhere around the middle or a shade on the low side I basically have not assumed that a modest decline in the dollar will produce any further price pressures In the face of that, the reason I have a somewhat higher forecast of price increases relative to, say, unit labor costs, is that I do have a larger spread between unit labor costs and prices built into my own mental arithmetic than the Board staff does And that simply is a recognition of my own view that the pressure on domestic producers to seize every little opportunity, every little crack in the window, to pass along cost increases in the form of price increases, even in the current labor market capacity utilization setting, is just so powerful That is about where I am, Mr Chairman   Well, the down side of my own forecast   Steve said a minute ago that these models don't explain everything I think of that as an understatement of some proportion! I am not sure that they explain anything to me anymore But looking at M1 right now, it seems to me, abstracting at least a little from all the models, that one can draw one of several conclusions One is that history is history and down the road we're going to get more nominal GNP or more inflation or both; but none of us seems to see that The second conclusion is one that Pres just mentioned that what we are seeing is an adjustment taking place, reflecting fundamentally the shift going on in the economy to lower nominal interest rates and lower rates of inflation, which could quite conceivably be very plausible in the context that it leads to some lower secular growth of velocity That, in turn, would mean that whatever we thought to be an optimal growth in M1 is now higher in some permanent way than it once was The third explanation is that there is something to these technical shifts, whether due to innovation, or to changes in spread relationships, or even to something like this EF Hutton situation I personally do not rule out the possibility that the Hutton situation has had an impact I won't say that other firms' practices are exactly parallel to Hutton, but anyone who thinks that those types of cash management practices as a general thing are limited to one or two firms is being quite naive And anybody who thinks that those firms who might have been doing the same general kind of thing are going to tell you about it is very naive But I think that one has to allow for those types of  -21-    7/9-10/85  possibilities, whether due to financial innovation or other types of phenomena Of course, the difficulty with those things, if they are there, is that we can't quantify them; we can never be sure what they mean And in the short run they certainly do mean that velocity and demand for money, neither of which is quite the same thing, are going to bounce around And at the extreme, the conclusion that you have to draw is that this velocity or money demand relationship is just shot and money is no longer any good as a policy variable As a practical matter, I don't think we can afford that conclusion even though some of us may like it Because if you don't like money, you have to find something else to use as a policy variable Where I come out is that both for practical and what I at least would consider to be theoretically attractive reasons we have to work with some combination of the second and third things that I mentioned And within that framework I agree with Tom that it may be more difficult today than it was in 1983 to make the case for jiggling around ranges or bases or something But as a practical matter, I come out to the view that we don't have any choice but to be thinking in that broad direction, without prejudging exactly how that should be done   You don't like to talk about these things, but in some ways the best of all worlds would be to find an opportunity to lower the discount rate and then raise the borrowing up a little   I wouldn't do it quite as boldly as I just stated it   That's right   No   Well, there's still the question of how much weight to give it   Steve, I want to make sure that I understand I know these numbers are very slippery, but in light of your best estimate for July--   If you were thinking in terms of changing the ranges and not rebasing, what kind of growth would you  -35-    7/9-10/85  have in M1 over the balance of the year, taking account of July as best you know it? Would it come in, say, within 9 percent or 8 percent?   The second half of the year   In June and July you are using something like 7 percent?   In the end, I might be agnostic; but I guess I have some sympathy for changing the ranges rather than rebasing   I blow a little hot and cold too, Henry But the other side of it is that rebasing carries with it this implication that the problem is behind us  -36-    7/9-10/85   That scares me a little   And what would growth over the second half of the year be?   I would associate myself, at least in part, with Tom Melzer's remarks that the frequency with which these problems come up--no matter how we deal with them--inevitably will raise questions about the philosophy and the practical approach to policy that we are taking Somewhere out in the future--I don't think that we are there now--there will be at least a perception, or maybe even a danger, that we could kind of slide into a degree of indifference about the speed of money and credit growth, however defined There could be that danger Primarily for that reason, I don't want to end up in a position of altogether disregarding M1, which I think, Roger, is the logical conclusion of your position Then, looking between rebasing and raising the range, I would have a modest preference for raising the range; I'd put it at 4 to 8 percent or something like that, with some language about probation, as opposed to rebasing But in the end, [Mr Chairman,] you are the one who is going to have explain it I wouldn't go to war over one or the other, but I do think the integrity of the process, in a context in which the importance of M1 for the time being is reduced, is preserved a little better by raising the range rather than rebasing   Arithmetically, obviously you can make them come out to the same thing But to my way of thinking-- again, this is a highly judgmental thing--[there is a difference] Raising the range and accompanying that with some verbiage along the line that several people, including Mr Stern, have suggested says We don't know what has happened; we don't know if it's over; we still think over time this variable matters; and we still have a view over time as to what we would like to do, but we are not going to-- particularly in these current circumstances--let that view get carved in stone Now, rebasing seems to say something that in my judgment is a little different than that The way that it is different is that to me it does not carry the same conviction in terms of what we are trying to do over time   It doesn't express great conviction I just don't think we can go on in the situation that we have in terms of rebasing when we don't have a good explanation as to why we are rebasing   Because I don't know   I think you can count it either way All I'm saying is that in my judgment it strikes me a little better, and that's all, to do it that way But I could live with it the other way   As a practical matter, I'm not sure how Peter and Steve would go about constructing a framework to operate in, literally, if we just throw it out   We didn't throw it out   I don't know how you can have a strong feeling about M1 at all right now But, again, I would have a preference--not a strong feeling--for the specifications of alternative I That's against the background of what I think is one of the stronger economic forecasts for next year And I think there is a very plausible case developing that the velocity of M1 may be moving lower Maybe in the current institutional, inflation, and interest rate environment the kind of trend or expected behavior of M1 velocity is more like 1 percent instead of 3 percent That's what I [tend to factor] into my own thinking   No,--   I certainly don't have any illusions about that judgment, but I think the M1 specifications of alternative I are quite compatible with growth in the real economy of 4 percent next year, which is basically what is in my forecast anyway So, that's where I come out   Right   Right   No argument here   Me too   I'm confused   Oh, I know I'm confused because you've lost me on the numbers   Let's do that Rebased   I can live with 8 percent   It depends on what they want to say!   We don't have a tie   That's a landslide!   Yes, I have a preference  SPEAKER(?) Yes   Could be good reason for that!  -69-    7/9-10/85   It cuts the other way   Yes, but we're not really collapsing it The backdrop of even a tentative range for 1986 is going to be very, very rapid growth in 1985 I do think that in a context in which we emphasize uncertainty, the direction of the M1 range and the time to [unintelligible] should be set a notch lower   I agree   3 to 7 percent   4 to 7 percent, then   One way is to say that it could become one but it is not   Better leave well enough alone   If it gets to 10 percent, Chuck, you won't need the telephone!   That's a ways off too   Mr Kichline, have you heard anything about these normal GNP revisions--the historical revisions that come up later in the year--pointing in the direction of a substantial downward revision in the deflator over the past several years?   Right   Well, I feel as comfortable with the forecast in the Greenbook as I can feel, and I don't at the moment see a recession looming immediately in front of us In terms of developments in the last 6 or 8 weeks, the thing in the economy that probably has surprised me most is housing I certainly did expect that we would see a little more spark there than we have seen, which led me to believe that maybe this rise in delinquency rates that we have seen in the home mortgage sector was telling us something But even that doesn't seem to hold up because, for example, on closer inspection we find that the delinquency rates are higher in the Northeast than they are in the South and the West, even though the reverse pattern seems to apply in terms of where the housing shortages are versus the surpluses So I am at a complete loss to rationalize that More generally, I sense a much more acute dilemma growing out of the dollar situation than a number of the comments around the table would seem to imply For one thing, barring a recession in the United States, which would obviously raise havoc with the LDC situation, I see more risk in the possibility of some kind of sudden tumble in the exchange rate, notwithstanding all that the exchange rate implies in the current situation for the trade account But more importantly, when you look through the exchange rate situation and the trade account, barring that precipitous drop in the exchange rate that would create its own problems, it seems to me that we are looking at a quite real possibility for at least a couple--or maybe even three, four, or five--years of having trade and current account deficits of $100 billion, which in turn--   I think that's probably right  As a matter of fact, we did an exercise that suggested that even if the exchange rate fell 25 percent over the next two years from where it is now, the current account and trade deficit would tend only to stabilize at around $100 billion I might add that that was with faster growth in the industrialized countries than is now being projected But regardless of what number you put on it, the fact of the matter is that any kind of scenario like that implies clearly a willingness on the part of foreigners to continue to accumulate dollar-denominated assets at a pretty rapid rate And as far out in the future as we considered, it also implies that foreigners are going to be continuing to finance a big chunk of our budgetary deficit So that situation in itself has worked itself into a classic Catch-22 problem that, in my judgment, aggravates the policy dilemma to a very considerable degree  Now, I would associate myself with the comments that Martha and Chuck made on the financial situation I too cannot quite shake the feeling that something, someplace there could pop in an unfortunate way at any moment But there too what to do about that from a policy perspective is not at all clear One could make an argument that the whole situation, notwithstanding the problems in the economy and the problems on the international side, could point more easily in the opposite direction from a policy perspective than what the economy itself would say  You raised a question, Mr Chairman, about this energy situation Just by way of a quick anecdote  told me the other day that when they had to bail out that energy bank up in this spring, in the process they acquired some oil rigs which at that time they valued at about 35 cents on a dollar They now think they are worth a nickel to a dime on a dollar Now, is not the universe, but I think that is symptomatic of the general situation So I can't find much to celebrate about here, to put it mildly But the policy dilemmas implicit in all of this, I think, are as acute as they have been perhaps for a while   For reasons I stated before, I'm in the "B" camp with a little tilt toward the "C" camp as well I think there is something at least at the margin to this credibility question right now, so that reinforces my own thinking As far as the specifics are concerned, I would have borrowing of $400 to $450 million going perhaps as high as $500 million if we got into trouble on the exchange rate But barring that, I think $400 to $450 million should do it I would have a very modest preference--certainly nothing I would go to war about--for specifying the aggregates at 8-1/2 and 6- 1/2 percent But that's symbolic   For the quarter, anyway  -33-    8/20/85   The problem is that there is a threshold level in there someplace   Long before we got any of the benefits on the trade side we would get the financial effects of that kind of sudden drop It would be very messy   You get stories even from the Japanese people who theoretically are in longer-term Treasury securities that they have this calibrated down to the tee in terms of what set of expectational circumstances with regard to the decline in the dollar would make them move and move fast   And never sell them   Well, it would have to be more than that because you would have to compensate for the oil imports; you wouldn't be able to stop those   I had suggested--   I had suggested 6-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent   That is fine with me   You could have lucked out   I'd want to put 8-1/2 percent   Let me make the case for this 8-1/2 percent I don't feel that strongly about it, but the only reason I'm attracted to it is that I think it does lend a little to the point of view that suggests we are not totally indifferent about being outside the tunnel, or whatever the heck we call it, for the second half of the year that we just adopted 6 weeks ago That's the only thing that leads me to that number as opposed to the 9 percent But I--   Yes, but I am somewhat agnostic   We need a decline in September to get 7 percent   That's fine   Yes   I prefer "would"   Yes, the "although"--  SPEAKER(?) I would support that   Well, if we really wanted to change it, we could put the reference to the foreign exchange markets in the "somewhat greater restraint" sentence "somewhat greater restraint would be sought in the event of substantially higher growth of the monetary aggregates in the context of exchange rate developments" or something like that   We may not be able to do it now, but I'll tell you The more I think about it, it makes a heck of a lot of  -46-    8/20/85  sense because it also allows us in that context to get back to this damn budget deficit question That thing is just going out the window on us and, ultimately, that's what is driving the whole conundrum   "Patterns"   So moved   That was 40 percent you said, Ted?   Just a brief comment on the business situation My own view is similar to Mr Forrestal's in that I do draw more encouragement from the collection of latest statistics--not that they lead to anything different than the staff forecast, but I think that they raise the chances that that, or maybe a tad better, in fact is what will happen But I must say that in and around New York City anyway, the people associated with the very large multinational companies [unintelligible], notwithstanding the recent business statistics, are still very distinctly on the bearish side of things I am not quite sure whether that's just a further manifestation of the way in which those companies are being affected by the external side  -12-    10/1/85  There may be some of that, but I detect in the time frame of the past six weeks or so a higher level of concern in that community about the underlying policy situation There is even, as I said before, some whispering to the effect that sooner or later that underlying policy situation is going to lead to more inflation--not that anybody sees it right now, but that there's a sense of inevitability about it   I think that's true But again, I think the combination of things, including realization of a budget resolution and all of the rest, has given rise to a renewed sense of cynicism if not outright hopelessness in terms of the budget situation And in terms of monetary policy, there is a sense that the constraints are growing--constraints in terms of financial fragility, of the M1 problem that everybody wants to pretend isn't there but can't quite get themselves to pretend that it's not there, and more recently a net feeling that this G-5 [agreement] works in the direction, at least in the short run, of more of a constraint on policy As I said, it's hard to judge that; but I think more attention has been paid to the policy dilemma in that segment of the business community in the recent past than I, at least, had detected earlier Now strangely enough, attitudes outside of that community of the Fortune 500, including even places like Buffalo and Rochester, are distinctly better I can't quite figure out why that's true, but we have had a couple of meetings upstate recently and I was really struck by the very sharp difference in perceptions about the business situation, even in the Buffalo area We have  an auto worker, and he's dancing in the aisles He is not buying this notion that all of this [improvement in the] auto situation recently is just financing-related He seems to think that they are really getting back into a groove That's strange, but true   I don't know if it has quite progressed to that point It wasn't just either I was amazed at the attitude among a group of about 25 business people up there two weeks ago It floored me I thought I was back in Minneapolis, Gary Anyway, extracting from the vagaries of the business situation, however one judges it, my own view on policy is that we should stay where we are, which means alternative B pretty much as sketched out in the Bluebook In the immediate here-and-now situation, on top of all of vulnerabilities that have been there all along, I must say that I personally think the major vulnerability is a downside break in the dollar in the near term I am not predicting that, but I think the risks are there I am not sure what one does about it, but I would be prepared to tilt the thrust of policy in the context of alternative B in the direction of trying to mitigate against that vulnerability in any little way that we can   That's fine with me   It says you're going for them   That's fine   Yes   He's on variant I   Yes   It will be all right or all wrong  -30-    10/1/85   "Acceptable"   It applies to Ml?   I kind of like that, if the word "acceptable" were put in place of "appropriate"   Yes   I like it   I'm indifferent   That's out   Oh, that's right Yes, that is in   But if we have that sentence that says "a marked slowing in M1 growth to a 6 percent annual rate is anticipated" with the clause that says "somewhat more of a slowdown would be acceptable," technically that finesses not having to announce abandoning the ranges here either because it leaves open that possibility So I think that we need both the sentence and the semicolon phrase or else we're really cheating on not saying anything about the paragraph that we already agreed [not to consider] until five weeks from now   This is subject to the interpretation of--   Long term, we've advanced from pragmatic monetarism to full-blown eclecticism   I've observed it myself once or twice, Governor Partee   But you have to understand that the staff spent all day Thursday and Friday making these variants look different!   Sure Yes, I think it does   But you have that phrase in there that says that "slower growth of M1 is acceptable"?   Right   Yes   Second   We did a calculation on that point that is kind of interesting It is not an entirely valid calculation because you can't hold everything else equal, but with that limitation it is a valid calculation If you use a benchmark of, say, 5 to 6 percent as the average for the preceding quarters and work off that, the combination of two things--the reduction in farm income and higher net interest payments by consumers--appears to be worth a little more than a percentage point on the saving rate itself   Net   The combination of both of those things Again, given the limitation of the way you do your    11/4-5/85 -5-  arithmetic, farm income and interest payments are about a half a point each   I myself just can't see anything out there that is going to get growth up into the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range as opposed to the 2 to 3 percent range For a long time I thought housing could make the difference in terms of that marginal contribution, but I can't see that now either Looking across the sectors of the economy at this point, it is just awfully hard to find sources of marginal growth that would get us to a bit more respectable range on a forecast basis On top of that, the anecdotal reports that I, at least, am getting from business people and directors and so on-- for what they are worth--are distinctly on the sour side   I got the answer to that the other day, Frank We had the chairman of one of the largest commercial construction companies in the world into the bank for lunch and I asked him that same question I said "How come you're still building all these buildings in Dallas and so on?" He said; "It is very easy; the banks keep giving us the money As long as they give us the money we will keep building"   John, I don't know whether I should ask you or Bob Forrestal, but do you know if Boeing is expecting great things, particularly in the export side, from this new model 747 that they are beginning to market?   No, they have a new model, a very highly fuel efficient 747   No, no, it's a new generation of--   Do you know anything about it, Jim?  -13-    11/4-5/85   I am attracted to the idea of trying to do a little something in the coupon end--not because I think it's going to have any great effect on relative rates--but just because the thought runs through my head every now and then that at some point down the road we may feel that we have to do something in coupons for    11/4-5/85  other reasons, and if we get so removed from that segment of the market the mere fact of doing something for a particular reason has much more signal effect to it than we might otherwise want   Well, I am not sure of that   We may need something   I don't know what the precise circumstances might be I think preserving some flexibility--   --in our market presence is desirable   Chuck, I agree with your point about the primacy of the economy, but I come out a little differently in terms of emphasis at the margin With that primacy in mind I say to myself What are the things that are on the table in the very near term that could really louse up the situation with the domestic economy in a major way? And the one that just leaps out at me is the risk--and everybody puts his own arithmetic on this--of the dollar breaking out on the down side If that happens, the one thing we're sure of--or at least I'm sure of--is that that would do considerable damage to the domestic economy and the world economy   Again, go back to that chart nine in yesterday's presentation We sit here and we have a situation, which we have had for a long time, where we have a simply lousy fiscal policy Monetary policy is trying to out-muscle and out-maneuver that, and there is a point here where it just can't be done   Then they all take the rap   As far as policy itself is concerned, I'd be quite comfortable with alternative B as in the Bluebook That had borrowing of $450 to $550 million, but I could go with the $350 to $550 million range that Governor Martin suggested   I'm somewhat agnostic on that I think the [unintelligible] to me at this point isn't so much whether it's 5 to 6 percent or 6 percent, it's the framework that we described that given the domestic economy, if the opportunity were there to try and nudge things down a bit we would grab it I don't know how you can articulate that in a very precise way So, I would lean toward the 5 to 6 percent   I don't think we can quite say that We might be able to jiggle "woulds" and "mights"   I think it is generally about unchanged and it will be generally about unchanged   Yes   Was it in the minutes or did we do that in this business of--   There is another way of looking at it, too, just in terms of institutional sources of demand for dollars A lot of that demand has come from Japan, of course, and in Japan there are two sets of institutional factors that tend to cut the other way One is that most of the pension funds [and] insurance companies have a 10 percent limit on the percent of their portfolio that can be in any non-yen currency, and almost without exception they are crowding up against the 10 ten percent Now, that won't keep them from buying dollars completely, but it means that they can only buy dollars prospectively to the extent that their overall asset base grows Secondly--and I think this is particularly relevant in the case of Japan--according to the reports that we get, through much of the second and third quarters Japanese corporations, of course, were spinning off a tremendous amount of excess cash and were making very short-term dollar investments in very large quantities And the reports that we get have begun to suggest that, partly because of the changed economic situation, that very large supply of short-term demand for dollar-denominated assets may not be there prospectively in anything like [the way] it was retrospectively I don't know how all that fits in, but it is one of the factors that tend to work on the other side of the equation    12/16-17/85   Either way, it doesn't take all that much of a shift in terms of the very short run I think part of what is going on here is people putting a great deal of emphasis on these psychological threshold levels of 200 yen and 250 marks If it moves away from those on the up side, I think people are prepared to do something about it If it moves away on the down side, that is pretty hard to deal with   I think the limit does apply even if it is covered Doesn't it, Sam?   Yes   There are a couple of straws in the wind, but not much more One thing that I think is true that bears on all of this is that today even compared, say, to 1980, the public at large is much more sensitive to interest rates and relative interest rates in managing their financial asset portfolios That's just a hunch, but it does look that way to me The second thing that may be true is that in terms of general liquidity characteristics of financial assets held by the public that are not bank-issued--in other words institutionalized savings such as thrift-plan type savings, pensions, IRAs and so on--a good deal more of the nonbank-related financial asset holdings of the public may be perceived by the public to be less liquid than bank-issued financial assets Again, I don't know this to be true, but my hunch is that it is And if both of those things are true, that also may help to explain why the public, including the business sector, does seem to be on the one hand more aggressive in shifting among classes of bank-issued financial assets, while at the same time increasing their holdings of nonbank-issued financial assets The problem with that, if it is true, is that it brings into sharp focus in my mind the point that Dave mentioned in terms of what it implies about the interest sensitivity even of M2 but especially of M1 If you argue that M2 in some sense is less interest sensitive and, therefore, is a better "indicator" than it used to be or even better than M1 is, but you also accept the point that Dave made that it really isn't the quantity that matters, it's the price that matters, then it seems to me that you can get yourself into a real box, if it turns out that M2 is less sensitive but yet the economy itself is in some sense more sensitive That to me makes this question of what you look at more difficult in one sense but maybe easier in another sense That's because if the public is more sensitive and if there is anything at all to this question of liquidity of bank-related instruments versus nonbank instruments, it's another reason to believe that money growth relative to GNP is going to be permanently higher than it was in the past and velocity growth is going to be smaller at least than it was in the past  The other point that has been made about drawing some consolation from the fact that the broad aggregates, M2 and M3, look more respectable and can help us interpret, or at least roll with M1 in this recent period, I am not very sure about For example, in the case of M3, I cannot help but think that M3 is as weak as it has been at least in part because of the way banks are financing things these days They are issuing standbys and all these other off-balance-sheet instruments Somebody else is doing the financing and the bank itself no longer has to issue the large CD until something goes wrong and the borrower comes to the bank to execute a standby I think if you make any allowance for the tremendous explosion of off-balance-sheet contingent financing by the banks, as opposed to the traditional bank financing of business credit through issuance of large CDs, one at least has to question whether in fact M3 is telling us the same things it used to tell us insofar as that broad measure of bank liabilities is concerned   Well, it reinforces the view that credit growth is telling us something other than that the number is big I think it is telling us that the growth of credit is not some  -14-    12/16-17/85  kind of statistical aberration This widening out of the spread between both--   What it tells me is that we probably are putting a lot of bad debt on the economy I don't know   I don't see any burst in the economy What worries me is that if the economy doesn't expand--   I think it is telling you that in the course of a not spectacular economy you are seeing a further deterioration of balance sheets in the economy   No, it doesn't Not anymore   For example, yes   There is another point one can make about M2 If you take small time deposits out of M2 and put them in M3 on the grounds that they do not have overnight liquidity, and you take the remaining institutional money funds out of M3 and put them in M2, then M2 grows by 14 percent rather than 7 percent That's the idea   Which is the point I was trying to make If you look at these things all these different ways, you can make at least a plausible case that the "moderate" growth of M2 and M3 maybe isn't so moderate in its own way   That was the thrust of my first set of comments I said they were straws in the wind But it gets to this point about whether there is a difference--in addition to what we know about inflation having come down and all the other things--that would traditionally point to velocity growth being slower Given that, is there any plausibility to the argument that financial assets issued by banks and held by households are now perceived to be that much more liquid than financial assets not issued by banks? In the current circumstances that would mean that the public would want to hold more of those relative to the less liquid nonbank issued financial assets   That doesn't really help because a lot are held by pension funds Plenty of cash deposits as far as the households are concerned--   That's because of the stock market, though, isn't it?  -16-    12/16-17/85   At market value But it's not just the holding of the stock too The point I am trying to get at is that the way that the public holds stock I would guess that much more of the household sector's holdings of stock equity is now through things like savings plan and pension plans They are institutionalized as opposed to John Doe calling up his broker and saying that he wants to buy 50 shares of whatever I assume that must be true   That's the problem I have I think one can make a case that all of these aggregates are way off   I'd use them all We've got to play one against the other I think if we scrap one or two of them we would really have a problem At least if we keep the traditional framework, with perhaps a variation on a definition of a monitoring range, I think we are in a better position If we scrap one or two of them, I think we could get into a terrible box   That's what I have in mind   It seems to me that what we really need to do in the short run is to lean a little further in Governor Partee's direction of nominal GNP   I am just saying that in the context of having aggregates in more or less traditional form you just make more general noises about looking through the aggregates at the GNP   I'm just grasping for straws   Just looking at forecasts--for what they are worth, which is probably not a lot--our forecast for 1986 is one that has GNP in real terms growing at about 3 percent or a shade more In that sense, it looks more like the consensus of private forecasts than it does the Board staff's forecast There is another important difference in that our forecast basically assumes that short-term interest rates are unchanged from roughly where they are today rather than having a decline already built in But like Governor Rice, I don't have a lot of conviction about that forecast because when you go through sector by sector it's hard to find concrete evidence that would suggest that there is any real marginal growth on the up side, and there are the risks on the down side We are at a point, in my judgment, where we have 3 or 4 very, very major factors that transcend the sectors I am not sure anybody has really digested these factors, and I am not sure one can One is the decline we have seen in the foreign exchange rate itself I think we had some surprises on the up side of that phenomenon and I think one could argue that we may get more bang out of that than is being allowed for in the conventional kind of forecast Just as one example If the so- called Baker plan works as designed, that in itself could end up financing a very [robust] increase in import growth in the developing countries and Latin America, and we would be presumably the major beneficiaries of it But leaving aside that particular aspect of it, I think that one at least has to allow for the possibility that we may get a little more help there than we are counting on  The second area that seems to me to transcend individual sectors is this recent run-up in stock and bond prices I can make a case that if those gains are roughly sustainable, they could very easily provide more of a kick to the economy than the quarter point that Jim mentioned, particularly when you recognize how late in this year a major part of that gain, particularly in the stock market, has occurred Of course, the big question is sustainability I think one could argue that there is some danger, especially in the stock market, that it already has overshot the mark in some fundamental sense, in which case what looks like it could be a plus for the economy right now could turn out to be a minus I also think that there is at least  -37-    12/16-17/85  a good chance that we do not really know how to build the oil price, and more generally commodity prices, into an economic forecast-- especially the oil price implications We don't know what will happen to the oil price That too strikes me as a variable that could have a larger effect than is being allowed for now, simply because nobody has a way to take account of it I think the fiscal situation now presents some real uncertainties the combination of Gramm-Rudman, whatever it turns out to be, and the tax bill Again, if you look at them in a rather conventional way, I think one is powerfully drawn to the conclusion that if they play out as scheduled, their effects on the economy--at least in the timeframe of 1986-1987--are going to be to reduce growth, net, and possibly even to increase prices a little But, again, I don't think we know enough about what in fact will happen; we certainly don't have a good fix on the kinds of anticipatory behavior, both in the market and in spending decisions, that have already been built into the equations so to speak  And finally, there is this whole money and credit problem that we talked about yesterday As I mentioned yesterday, when you make what seem to me to be some reasonable assumptions about definitions and so on, I think you have to come to the conclusion that money and credit, however defined, have been growing very, very rapidly--whether you look at that in terms of debt accumulation or any way you slice it up Now what does that mean? As a number of people, including myself, suggested yesterday, you can argue that velocity trends have changed Nevertheless, even if you make that argument, that phenomenon still sits there and it has to be something of a concern So, back to the question of a forecast As I said, ours is 3 percent or so; but I don't think we can quite capture the dynamics of this situation we face simply by looking sector by sector, because I think these four of five things I have mentioned transcend that And it's not clear to me how they're going to play out   I think that's asking a lot As I said, we have gone through the numbers and if everything panned out reasonably well over the three-year period as a whole, it could support a very, very robust increase in imports   We won't get that much, but we could get some And when you take into account Mr Keehn's comments about some of the anecdotal responses he picked up in terms of changes in the foreign exchange rate, there may be a little more there I'm not projecting a humongous swing in the trade account in the first quarter, but there could be a little more there than the conventional wisdom is allowing for    12/16-17/85   It may even be negative outside manufacturing   Or input   Well, I have a rather strong preference to work within the framework of alternative B I certainly am not as sanguine as some are on this foreign exchange rate situation I think we've done very, very well to date I'm not uncomfortable with where we are, but I must say that as I read the situation I think the downside risks are still very much there One could quibble about whether they're a shade less or more than they were a month or six weeks ago, but I certainly feel that they are there Also, as I said yesterday, when I look at these financial aggregates and make some rough adjustments for what I think is really happening with M2 and M3, I come to the conclusion that in an underlying sense they all are growing very, very rapidly And if I can take a little poetic license, when we talk about easing policy what in some sense we are saying is that we want people to go out and borrow some more And when I look at what's already there, I'm just not quite sure that that's the right response I think Karen has a point You can almost, at least somewhat more abstractly, raise the question of whether given what is already there we should in some sense be looking at policy from a different vantage point altogether But I don't think that's in the cards In sum, I would want to work in the framework of alternative B I think the nicest outcome that I could imagine would be one in which we could lower the discount rate in concert with other countries doing the same thing and end up with the borrowing sticking around the $400 million level Now, I don't have the authority on either side of the coin to say whether that reduction in the discount rate should be 25 basis points or 50 basis points, but I think the question of 25 basis points is one that is at least worth serious consideration On the question of what I would do if there were no prospect for some kind of a parallel movement in policy elsewhere--and, of course, that we won't know today--I think my druthers would be to stick more or less with the framework of "B" as is But, again, if there were some opportunity for movement elsewhere in tandem with something by us, I think that would be fine That would be the best of all possible outcomes, from my perspective   Small--   Well, the base is lower now than it was then   A 1/4 point move might also be perceived as saying that we want to keep some order in the bar   [Unintelligible] Order in the bar   Use November to March   Really "seeks to increase somewhat the reliability of the computers!"   How does the sentence read as you  -63-    12/16-17/85   How about a sentence that said that the Committee expects the action to be consistent with growth of all of the monetary aggregates at rates of 6 to 8 percent and then a phrase something like "recognizing that there continues to be especially large uncertainty about M1"   It already has December was--   But December was at 15 percent for purposes of the Bluebook, wasn't it?   What's wrong with that? "The action is expected to be consistent with growth in the three aggregates in the range of 6 to 8 (or 6 to 8-1/2) percent keeping in mind that Ml in particular still is subject to great uncertainties" Have a single range for all 3 aggregates rather than having a specific number for any one of the three    12/16-17/85   Again, it's in a framework where I am assuming that the borrowing arrangements are as you described before   I don't care if it's 8 or 8-1/2 percent [as the top]   10 percent isn't even on the charts   Things aren't that bad   Now what do you have?   I wouldn't change it from that structure   No   This is all in a framework in which the initial borrowing is $350 million   Remember that man from Mars!   Steve, or Sam, or Ted--somebody Where are the exchange rates today?   Where oil was yesterday could easily have given you a negative--a small outright decline in consumer prices in Germany and Japan   Jim, on chart 21 where you talked about the impact of lower oil prices, it seems to me that the pattern of effects is a little puzzling Wouldn't one expect, for example, that the impact of lower oil prices on real GNP would be felt more in 1987 than 1986--that it takes time for these oil prices to work their way through in terms of increased income for people to spend and lower costs for corporations to increase their spending? I would say the same thing, but maybe with not quite the same lag, about the deflator It isn't only the direct effect of lower oil prices on inflation; there are many indirect impacts that probably would show up more in 1987 than in 1986   As far as the forecast goes, my own forecast is a shade stronger in real terms than the staff's forecast-- 34 percent versus their 3 percent As best as I can recall, there is no one difference that accounts for that--just a bit here and there across the board My inflation number is also a little stronger, although I might be inclined to shade that down at least a little, simply because the oil price has fallen further--and I think is likely to [move down] further--than I would have guessed 10 days ago or whenever that forecast was made  As I said a month or six weeks ago, we can play around with these forecasts until the cows come home but I think there is a variety of factors that transcend the forecast, which Mike and Jim and Ted referred to in various parts of their commentaries On the exchange rate side, for example, we have seen something that smells to me like a basic change in market attitudes towards the dollar, partly because of some of the official announcements and all the rest I think that has been reinforced by the combination of the oil price situation and perceptions as to how that will affect the LDCs, and in turn how that in combination with some of the other problems that are perceived at least to be there in the banking system will affect [the situation] I think those considerations, at least at the margin, do have a decided influence on the attitudes toward the dollar right now So, I view the dollar as not only lower by 5 to 7 percent from when we last met but I guess I consider it a good deal more vulnerable on the down side than it was six weeks or so ago What will happen to the oil price is anybody's guess It could stabilize in the $18 to $20 range; it could go down further; or, if the Saudis are able to reach a meeting of the minds with the British or somebody else, the problem is that it could go up--particularly if it got down to, say, the $15 or $13 range In some ways the worst of all worlds is to have the oil price go down that low only to come back up, even if it only came back up to $22 or so I don't think one can rule that possibility out How that will play out is an enormous uncertainty; but almost regardless of how it will play out, I think it has caused the LDC  -10-    2/11-12/86  situation to deteriorate significantly Mexico's problems are clear; to me the great danger is if Mexico gets so out of control that it forces other things to become unglued a bit So, I think that situation is also a good deal more tender, to put it mildly  I remain concerned about this whole debt issue, which again, Jim and Mike touched on I don't see it getting much better If I look at Mike's flow-of-funds forecast for 1986--and I know how hard it is to forecast the flow of funds--in an underlying sense I don't see anything that constitutes a real improvement there, particularly when you take account of the special blip in state and local borrowing at the end of this past year growing out of tax considerations  On the inflation side, I guess I am a little more concerned I think the probabilities lie on the side of an inflation rate that looks like the ones that are more or less represented in the forecast in front of us But it is not hard for me to see how the inflation picture could be worse, notwithstanding the oil prices Productivity is lousy I don't see that getting any better The exchange rate has already come down 20 to 25 percent I don't see any hard evidence of any feedthrough on prices coming from that, though I don't rule it out I don't know what the natural unemployment rate is either Some people say 6 percent; it might be higher than that The fact of the matter is that, looked at it in that light, the unemployment rate isn't all that far from the point where it could put some pressure on the price level Beyond that, just in a behavioral sense, the kind of unit labor cost/price behavior relationships that are in the staff's forecast and my own basically have profit margins sitting still in a context in which it is very clear to me that businesses are going to grasp at every straw they can find to try and raise prices So while I agree with the price forecasts that are on the table, especially in the context of the oil price situation, I must say that I do have some concern that by the latter part of the year we could get an unfortunate surprise on inflation   You are kidding?   As soon as I left!   Si, if I just could ask What does Detroit think their effective production capacity on automobiles is these days?   I approached the question of the annual targets in terms of the likely contingencies that we might have to face and what they mean I don't think we can anticipate everything but, for example, if the economy is weaker or if velocity continues to run badly astray, I agree with Mr Melzer that policy can respond to either of those two developments without a great deal of difficulty I don't want to say regardless of the targets, but policy can respond within a fairly broad framework  On another front, if something goes wrong on the LDC side or in the financial sector, the response inevitably is going to be dictated by circumstances, and I don't think we could build that kind of thinking into the targets themselves even though situations could arise that might require some response So, I don't think we can deal with that directly On the other side of the ledger, if the dollar falls further--and especially if it falls significantly further in the face of what surely will be the very sizable, persistent, savings gap    2/11-12/86  that we have--it seems to me that interest rates will tend to rise on their own But in those circumstances, we might be faced with a need to tighten, even though it would be very, very difficult to explain that when the dollar is seen by so many people from a trade perspective as the boogie man That would be a much more difficult situation to deal with from [a policy] perspective than either of the first two examples  If the economy is stronger--or even worse, if inflationary pressures do begin to materialize--the policy response would be even more difficult, keeping in mind that over the long run I think the thing that would be the most difficult, both for policy and the economy, and for the LDCs and the financial system, would be a build- up in inflation and the inevitable response that would have to come to that no matter how delayed the response might be So, I find that from a policy perspective, either a fall in the dollar or a rise in inflation or a very strong economy are much more difficult to deal with than the other sets of circumstances I mentioned  Now, as I said yesterday, I don't see that a rise in inflation especially is inevitable But I think that we have to be careful, so I approached the question of long-run targets with the need for an insurance policy, if I can put it that way, in mind To me that means keeping M1 as a target because I think it does serve a useful purpose I think one can plausibly argue also that there is a possibility that velocity will be at least more normal, given the fact that the sizable declines in interest rates that have produced part of this aberrant behavior in velocity are probably behind us and that the institutional factors should not be as big So, I would keep Ml I would have a preference for 4 to 7 percent but I could live with 3 to 8 percent But if we're going to raise the upper end, I would also favor dropping the lower end and ending up with something like what we had for the second half of last year I think that sends two signals It says that we know M1 is still a little funny looking, but that there might well be circumstances in which we would be comfortable with Ml growing at quite a modest rate, even though we don't perceive those circumstances right now I am happy with M2, M3; I am not happy with debt at 8 to 11 percent, but I don't think that we can do anything about it So, I would keep M1 as a target; I have a slight preference for 4 to 7 percent but could live with, and in some ways I guess favor, 3 to 8 percent  The only other point I would make, Mr Chairman, is that I would at least raise the question of whether somewhere in the verbiage that goes with the policy statement about the long-range targets, it might not be a good idea to have a phrase in there saying that we would indeed be prepared to resist any build-up in inflationary pressures, even though we don't see them on the horizon right now It's not formally in the record; it's on page 16 or 17 in the Bluebook There is a long, long set of words that we have used in the past in the operational part of establishing the '86 ranges, all or most of which has been crossed out Somewhere in that I wouldn't mind seeing a phrase that would indicate that in the unlikely event that inflationary pressures do in fact begin to materialize we would be prepared to resist them   When I spoke about this earlier and said that I had a slight preference for keeping 4 to 7 percent, it was partly for the reason that you mentioned To me it's a question of these contingencies If the economy is soft and so forth, I think we can deal with that much more easily than the opposite I don't think it is just a question of the signal of the upper limit of 8 percent versus the upper limit of 7 percent That is why I think the language is very important   This is really a small point, but there is this tremendous concern about debt in the economy I don't care what adjustments you make for advance refundings or anything else, it is a tremendous concern The numbers don't mean a darn thing, but we have a published target on the record of a monitoring range of 8 to 11 percent Given all the concern in the marketplace about debt and given the concern abroad about debt accumulating in the United States, what signals does it send to raise it from the tentative target of 8 to 11 percent to 9 to 12 or something like that? I'm not going to go to war over it, but I think it is sending the wrong signals   That is beside the point I'm thinking of it in this benchmark sense   If in May or June or something like that, M1 is growing at 9 percent and the economy is lousy and velocity is either empirically or otherwise declining, I don't think the market is going to worry at all As a matter of fact, I was amused reading a  -42-    2/11-12/86  memorandum that one of Mr Sternlight's people gave me yesterday, by some fellow--I don't know who it was--who said that [at his firm] they don't even stay around on Thursday afternoon until 430 any more to get the money numbers so that they can trade on them; they go home at 4 o'clock The problem is on the other side If we get out there in 1986 some time and, just to take an example, money has grown at 8 percent and velocity is increasing and nominal GNP is rising by 10 or 11 percent, you are darn right the market is going to worry about that The question is going to be how we respond to that That is the tough one   How about if in that last part we said "in light of its consistency with the monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the need to resist any buildup in inflationary pressures" or something like that?   Yes   No, the first thing is developments in the economy   Well, the point is it's contingent It doesn't say that it is going to happen   I envision it as symmetrical That's why I would put "the developments in the economy" first   "It intended to evaluate the growth of M1 in light of its consistency with the other monetary aggregates, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the need to"-- maybe "resist" is too strong a word--"be mindful of any buildup in inflationary pressures that might materialize over the course of the year"   That is fine because, as I said, I had in mind to be symmetrical about it    2/11-12/86   Do you have in mind that they are of roughly equal weight? You don't have in mind a monitoring range?   Good; it shouldn't have equal weight That is all right with me if we can avoid specifically denoting it as a monitoring range   I would    2/11-12/86  SEVERAL Yes   I think at least for now we pretty much have to stay with "B" as is--$300 to $400 million borrowing I don't know what the future holds either, but trying to push it too hard now could back up on us   What did you say the two main factors were that you had in mind?   I would just make one point It gets me into the zone of nervousness, I'll tell you that! The point I would make is this I think there is a danger that even if the Japanese, for example, were to lower their discount rate again and through a process of events we were to end up lowering ours, the net result of that could very well be greater pressure on the dollar, even though the spread in some sense wouldn't be any different than it is today And that, in the short run, is the principal focus of my being in the zone of nervousness But I can--   No, no The discussion, as I heard it--I don't know what the numbers will end up being--was in the context that we were talking about a borrowing target of $200 to $400 million or $250 to $350 million with an initial level of $300 million   Well,--   I guess I will accept that But I'm on the nervous side because my druthers would have been to tilt a little the other way, but I can't make a federal case out of it In other words, I would try to aim more toward hitting the borrowing target that has been in the path all along   So moved   Yes, there was some suggestion that the problems that occurred on Thursday may have been related to the caps, but that was not true One of the big banks had a CHIPS problem that kept us up late again, but it had nothing whatever to do with caps   I'll move it   One thing that it would clearly do, if it did nothing else, is change the bond market psychology in one heck of a hurry   They are sitting next to the copper mines   I, too, am in what I'd call the Boehne camp in the sense that I think the combination of oil prices, interest rates, exchange rates, and stock prices have to give some real boost to the economy in the second half of the year Ironically, at least for me, I am not quite so sure about the very near-term outlook I say that because I am not sure that we have fully factored in the adverse short-run effects of the oil situation In talking to some of the major oil companies that are headquartered in the New York area, I did get the sense that the short-run cutbacks that they are making are very, very substantial I don't know how you factor those into business fixed investment numbers and so on, but something in my gut tells me that the net effect of that in the very short run could be larger than is built into the consensus-type forecast--and I think the staff forecast is pretty close to a consensus forecast these days  There are a couple of anecdotal things to report Like Frank, I am now getting some suggestion that the computer business may be firming, following a pretty soft period of three or four quarters There is nothing hard and fast but, anecdotally, there is some evidence along those lines The capital goods side is aggravated by this short-run oil situation and is on the lousy side Interestingly enough, the suburban New York area is going through a housing boom Housing prices are rising, at least on an anecdotal basis, very, very rapidly in the suburban New York area Some of the stories I hear strike me as unbelievable in terms of the rate of price increase on existing homes But all in all, I think the outlook is respectable Peter Sternlight and his people take these market pulse beats all of the time, and I was a little surprised in reading some of the material they put together in the last couple of days about more than a couple of market types who apparently are taking a longer view of things and expressing some concern that the underlying inflation situation, despite all of these great numbers we are looking at, really might not be all that good Presumably, that reflects concern about productivity--General Motors sneaking in 3 percent price increases and things like that--but I was a little surprised It would not be a surprise for me to say that; I was surprised that other people were saying that   In the context of a consensus view of the economy that we talked about earlier, ironically, I find this a tough setting for monetary policy I myself am in the somewhat    4/1/86  uncharacteristic position of thinking that in the very short term--the next couple of months--the economy could be on the weaker side simply because I have a bigger allowance for short-run negative oil [effects] than others do Then again, the point has been made that there are other things in the short run that can be troubling debt burdens, overbuilding, financial problems, slow growth in the other OECD countries But when I think about that agenda of things, it is not at all clear to me that any of them is going to be helped very much by easier monetary policy; I could almost agree in a couple of cases that they might be affected adversely by an easier monetary policy-- especially if one thinks that the second half of the year is going to be distinctly stronger That is the rock and the hard place an economy that could be weaker in the short run and stronger in the second part of the year I think the only thing to do in that situation is nothing; so I'd be squarely in camp "B"   Are we in a period where seasonal borrowing will start to pick up now?   In that sense even $300 million is less than $300 million   When do we meet again?   Well, my instincts tell me that sentence probably should be symmetrical even though 7 weeks is a long time I don't think we can rule out the possibility, even though I don't see it, that the economy could pick up even faster than most people are assuming   I don't want to shoot at it; I'd like to do it   A slightly different form of fallout!   Yes These measures aren't worth much, but if you use any kind of conventional measure of real interest rates, the United States right now is probably very much on the low side of real interest rate countries around the world If you use an ex-post measure of inflation, who knows what real interest rates are?   So moved   There are too many people going into these areas of Alaska and northern Minnesota now They're going to take all the fish out of there!   Just a couple of brief comments On the general outlook, I find myself in the same ballpark as the staff forecast I look at the situation right now using that forecast as a benchmark and I guess it's one in which I see some downside risks and some upside risks; I think they are fairly well balanced The big downside risk is the one that Governor Johnson pointed to the trade side I've looked at those forecasts for the trade accounts by product, by country, and any other way I can look at them, and I am a little skeptical that we can see the kind of improvement that I think is built into most forecasts The other side of the coin is that if indeed we begin to see the kind of recovery take hold that is built into most forecasts--not just Jim's--I think we've got to keep in mind that it's a forecast in which on balance the growth in consumer spending is modest in real terms, business fixed investment is sluggish in real terms, and inventories generally are rather modest And the question, of course, is if things start to roll will those rather modest increases in consumer spending, fixed investment and inventories all begin to gain their own momentum? So, there are risks on both sides and I wouldn't want to try to choose which are the greater risks  As a matter of perspective, we either just passed or are about to pass the 3-1/2-year mark in this expansion Over the past year I think we've been a little lucky, in a somewhat curious way, in that different sectors of the economy have carried the load at various points and for various periods of time Right now there's no question that housing is carrying the load I think we've been lucky in some sense in the way that things have phased in and out and kept the overall momentum distinctly on the plus side, though not as robust as perhaps some would wish  Looking at the situation more from a Second District perspective, I think a couple of things stand out Outside of New York City itself we really do get the sense that the medium-size    5/20/86  a severe labor shortage situation because we have a number of new plants under construction, mostly in the defense/electronics area, that will have to be manned If capital spending rises or the computer industry bounces back and if our exports in this country rise, we would gain strength from that as well because we export more of our manufactured products than any other part of the country So, as I see the New England situation, we are heading toward a hyper fully employed situation There is a lot of diversity in this country at the moment, particularly between Mr Boykin's District and mine   Like Mr Parry, I am not so sanguine about M2 and M3; and I guess the greatest concern that I have is really even more with M3, where for Bob it was M2 The concern that I have about M3 relates to this question that Frank raised about liquid assets or whatever you call it We have a situation right now where there has been a tremendous burst in longer-term financing; but we also have a situation in which there has been a tremendous burst in both intermediate- and short-term financing as well as the long-term, through which the banks' role in that process is one of a contingent source of liquidity through standbys and guarantees and [unintelligible] and all of these other things So, one of the reasons M3 looks so sanguine and indeed why liquid assets, or whatever that is called, look so sanguine is because the nature of the relationship of the banking system to this process is different What is there now is a very substantial and very rapidly growing contingent liquidity [unintelligible] on the banking system And I think that is something that bears on the way in which some of these broader  -33-    5/20/86  measures of liquidity and financial expansion look So, I put that on top of Bob Parry's earlier argument I for one am not so sanguine about what M2 and M3 are telling us, and I am of the view that when we take account of conventional liquidity plus what I would loosely call contingent liquidity that we have kind of a paradox in that the contingent liquidity--what [financing] could have to be produced-- doesn't show up in a lot of the conventional measures we are used to  Another quick point Though none of us may be very impressed with Ml, and I am not either, I think it's worth noting that for the first time in months and months and months, people in the market are looking at Ml both in the United States and abroad Nobody is getting alarmed or anything like that, but there is a change in that people are looking at it again They are not reacting to it but they are looking at it, and I don't think we should kid ourselves about that either  As far as policy is concerned, I would certainly very much put myself in the "B" camp I also have a little bias in the direction of the need to be more sensitive to the possibility of "B" with a bit of a bias toward greater restraint, or "C" I don't know what is going to happen between now and the next meeting either, but I certainly could envision a set of circumstances in which even in that intermeeting period we might feel the need to snug a bit Because I feel that way, I favor directive III I think directive III, with a couple of modest word changes, can be made compatible with the point that Governor Johnson made, which I think has some validity, by making the first conditional sentence something like "If such a slowing does not develop, somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or might, be acceptable in the context of a pickup in economic growth" and putting a reference to the monetary aggregates in there But the part that is more important to me is the somewhat lesser reserve restraint sentence The only thing that would move me in the direction of somewhat lesser restraint that I really can think of right now would be if the balance of the quarter materialized in a way in which the economy itself were distinctly sluggish So, I would either want to get rid of the lesser restraint sentence altogether or just have that sentence limited simply to a distinctly more sluggish economy rather than all of this other stuff   We can put in anything we want with the numbers What matters to me is the kind of contingent operational approach between now and the next meeting   Alternative B would say 10 percent and 8 percent   8 to 10 percent   M2 and M3 are expected to expand at rates in a range of 8 to 10 percent   The broader aggregates are expected to expand   Even with those numbers, I don't see it as symmetrical   I'd only want it in if it is limited to more sluggish economic [activity] or something like that I would prefer it out, but if it were limited to "lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the face of a distinct slowing in the economy," then I could live with it   Money growth could be zero and it wouldn't hurt my feelings   In a six-week period, what is going to make you want to ease?   There is another historical aspect of this that should be mentioned that the Chairman didn't mention  -44-    5/20/86  There is more than one person in this room who at some point in his career had the responsibility of drafting the weekly report What is interesting about that is that after having drafted it, no one was permitted to read it   I'm not sure about that, as a matter of fact If you take it to that extreme where you've got to have statements and all the rest of it, then it certainly only would work once I think there probably are very narrow windows of opportunity  -48-    5/20/86  when Mr Cross can sneak in and out of the markets, maybe with some help from the Japanese or something without having to go through that tribal rite, that can at least create a pause at a time that's right And we're not going to have--   The recent past   Well, I agree with Sam If you think about the last six weeks or so--maybe the last two weeks in particular--there may well have been a point or two in that time frame of the last six or eight weeks where we might have been able to sneak in there with the Japanese or with the Germans, or both, and get some stuff done without having to go through--   Also, there is continuing diversification into non-Treasury [securities], presumably in a search for high yields    7/8-9/86   Accidents will happen!   Don, in the first paragraph in the Bluebook, you talk about the combination of factors that may be influencing Ml lower interest rates on the one hand, and then a kind of potpourri of other things I don't want to hear a model answer; I want a judgmental answer How much weight would you give to the interest rate factor in and of itself as opposed to the potpourri of everything else?   As far as the balance of 1986 is concerned, I would couch M1 in terms of a monitoring range as we have used that term in the past In that setting, I would probably have a mild disposition to have what I would call a realistic range for the year, not rebasing it But I could leave it at 3 to 8 percent too I prefer a monitoring range with a realistic range I come out rather differently in terms of 1987 I would prefer to have a target for 1987 and I would couch the language for the M1 target for 1987 in terms of suggesting that that range is based on the assumption of a return to a more normal velocity relationship And if that were not to materialize, I would demote it in February back to a monitoring range I have no strong theoretical persuasions about Ml or any M, but I am inclined to the view that, as sure as we sit here, the day will come when we are going to want to have Ml And if we completely discredit it to the point where nobody pays any attention to it, it is simply not going to be possible to resurrect it when it suits our purpose So, I think we need some continuity there, but I would be quite flexible as to how to achieve it; certainly, for the balance of this year a monitoring range is fine   That is not what monitoring ranges have meant in the past   But we would have a number, just--   Just to pick up on what you did say The logic of what you are saying is that if we don't have a monitoring range, at least in an historical context, M1 is less important than debt because with debt we have always had a range   I am not sure I quite follow that "relative"--   But in the historical context that we use these things, wouldn't you say it's also true that--   So treat them equally and have a range for both   Well, it makes me feel more comfortable only in the sense that we might run into the situation that you yourself described, where the economic situation was different from the one we are looking at right now and Ml was growing at 15 percent and M3 and M2 were at 9 percent If we didn't have any kind of a quantitative range for M1, I don't see how we could bring it to bear in a policy context But at least if we had some kind of a quantitative range, it seems to me more credible that it would manifest itself in those circumstances   Yes, for any period I don't think it matters in a literal sense in the near term--certainly not the [next] 12 months or so But I just have this nagging feeling--   That would bother me   We can't deal with every contingency with one set of numbers All I am saying is that I think there is a danger of getting into a position where we have no quantitative hook whatsoever   Sounds reasonable  [Meeting recessed]    7/8-9/86  July 9, 1986--Morning Session  [Secretary's Note Chairman Volcker called for a discussion of the economic outlook]   Just a couple of quick words about the District situation, which I think is a lot like others have described in that small and medium-sized firms, even in manufacturing, are doing quite well to very well Nonresidential construction and the housing markets are very, very strong, especially in the New York metropolitan area The service sector--and of course there's a special premium on financial services--is in a state of near frenzy But there's a great question in my mind as to how sustainable that is The large firms, especially large manufacturing firms--both those that [operate] there and those that are headquartered there--are by and large pretty dismal in terms of their outlook Even in the case of IBM, which earlier in the year seemed to think that things were about to take a turn for the better, certainly doesn't have any conviction behind that outlook at this juncture  In terms of the national economy, my own forecast is very similar, and almost identical, to the staff forecast in both the aggregate sense and in most of the details But I must say, I have perhaps as little conviction about a forecast at this point as I've ever had I could easily put together a forecast that's stronger and I could easily put together one that's weaker Some of the factors that have been mentioned--energy, commercial construction, and agriculture--are the obvious things that would point in the latter direction But abstracting from those particular areas of concern, I have two overriding concerns the first is this financial sector dichotomy that Frank Morris referred to I too find it very hard to rationalize the patterns of behavior that we see in financial markets --not just in the United States but around the world--with what seems to be going on in the real economy And I have a nagging feeling that we may be a little more accident prone there than we would like to    7/8-9/86  admit I say that not with a view on nonperforming loans at banks, as much of a problem as that can be in its own right, but more that when I look at the sheer volume and volatility that we see in the financial markets these days, I can't help but think that when we have a 62 or 63 point change in the Dow-Jones average in one day, that in itself feeds on this sense of uneasiness that a number of people have been referring to around the table It makes you scratch your head a little and say What the heck is going on here?  The other area of great concern that I have that transcends these particular sectoral concerns is the continuing economic, financial, and indeed political, implications of the trade and current account situation I read all the books about J-curves and all the rest of the [hype] but I must say I still have, and perhaps increasingly, a great deal of difficulty seeing how we will work ourselves out of that situation in an orderly way short of a recession-induced correction, which would obviously be very, very messy  As a number of people have suggested, I too sense that maybe confidence levels have ebbed a bit I think the reason for that may well be associated to some extent with these financial market goings on But I also think that there's a little phenomenon taking place now where for a variety of reasons--including, for example, the court ruling on Gramm-Rudman--the imbalances that have been there all along are maybe showing through in a more transparent way than has been the case Again, I think we've got to keep some perspective on those imbalances The staff forecast, for example, is going to produce an unemployment rate in 1986 of 71 percent Now, the last time we had an unemployment rate of 71 percent was in 1980 When you look at what has happened since 1980, there have been some very good things the inflation rate has come down from 10 to 2-1/2 percent and we are now in one of the longest economic recoveries on record, despite this enormous trade deficit But when you look beneath that, in 1980 we had a trade surplus in real terms in excess of $50 billion We now have a trade deficit in real terms of $140 billion In 1980, the budget deficit was $50 billion or $60 billion; it's now $200 billion plus In 1980, the personal saving rate was 7 percent; now it's 4 percent And those fundamentals are not going to change very easily To some extent, I think what we're seeing right now is a renewed appreciation that those fundamentals are there And the final irony, of course, is that if indeed the economy were slipping badly, one of the things one thinks about doing is trying to provide some fiscal stimulus But as a practical matter, we're not exactly in the ideal position to be able to do that It all comes back to saying that the whole ball game seems unfortunately to rest on monetary policy It's a very difficult outlook; and I guess I would be in the camp with those who are more worried rather than less worried   No   1986   Do a "could live with"--   Well, from my perspective, the Chairman's suggestion accommodates the concern that I had   Well, we can finesse it, but the thrust of this proposal is acceptable to me   I think of it simply as an insurance policy, that's all There could be a set of circumstances some time between now and the end of 1987 in which we'd be darn happy to have M1 in the ball game And if we retire it now, it's going to be hard to--   Look out!   There is a little danger in that argument because the same could be said of M2 and M3   Just as an aside, Mr Kohn, I thought the work that the staff did on debt was really quite good   It depends on whether you did that Monday or Tuesday   Do you really think [we need] a disclaimer for debt? How far over do you think it's going to be?   That's harder to explain   Just say "With respect to Ml"   "Carried forward" is kind of a passive [wording]   Wonderful  SPEAKER(?) A winner; that's pretty fancy  -55-    7/8-9/86   I would support that   I think the market--or at least a good part of the market--also thinks that a half point would be more coordinated than what we are talking about right now   I think the market probably expects that, if we come down a half point, at least one of the other two major countries would do the same   So would I   The first sentence is still a problem because, as always, it says "maintain" or "increase" or "decrease" That is the--   Let's say "The Committee seeks one way or another to decrease reserve pressures"   We are only off by $15 million   We could even just say "taking account of the level of the discount rate" That covers the possibility that the Board, in its wisdom, doesn't want to lower the discount rate   What was your language again? It was the best idea   How about saying "The growth of M1 is expected to moderate from its extraordinary pace in the second quarter Its behavior will be evaluated in the light of" I don't think we want to leave the message that a 20 percent growth rate or something--   I would make both "might"   I would leave it the way it is, but I really don't care There are three possibilities 4 to 8 percent, 5 to 8 percent, or 5 to 9 percent   I move it   I sent out to the Reserve Bank Presidents on Friday--you probably didn't get it yet--all of the publicly available documents laying out the details of the overall financing plans who's in for what and the rest of it The other issue that comes up is this supervisory question, of course Your senior supervisory people have a piece of paper that was agreed upon by the federal regulatory agencies that sets forth the policy statement as to the collective attitudes of the federal supervisory agencies on this whole reserve question That piece of paper is not    8/19/86  to be shared with the banks; it essentially says there's a lot of [unintelligible] but we look at these things on a case-by-case basis   No   It's not really a new policy, but it gets on paper a philosophy that had been agreed to by Messrs Clark and Seidman and our people   It basically says all the customary things the decisions are your own; the examiners by the nature of their work, of course, have a responsibility to look at these loans; they're going to focus primarily on your system's procedures, controls, etc; and there is no automatic linkage between decisions, especially when they're in the context of an internationally supported program They will be looked at case-by-case, taking account of the overall condition of the bank   So moved   In order to be able to do that I think you'd have to get to the point where you're pretty active    8/19/86   Well, I look at this thing rather simplistically It is arbitrary, but I kind of like what we're doing and that is maintaining what I at least envision as something close to a minimal level of presence in the coupon market From my perspective, that's fine I don't think we can reasonably embark upon any ambitious program of working on both sides of that market without some very, very basic changes in the whole approach to open market operations But both for contingency reasons of a slightly different nature and just to maintain that point of contact with the market, I think showing ourselves--even if it's only on the buy side a couple times a year--makes some sense   [Unintelligible] a heck of a contingency to it Just as you can envision a set of circumstances where you might think it desirable for some policy reasons to be selling bonds, it's hard to conjure up when to do it I think it's a little easier from a policy perspective to conjure up a situation where it might make sense to be buying   But if you want to have policy flexibility, it does seem to me to be marginally advantageous to maintain some presence in the market so that when you want to do that you don't produce the very splash effect that prevents you right now from selling   Maybe; in which case the argument is moot But it may not be that clear that you want to make a splash   I was going to say partly what Bob just said If we don't get an improvement in the trade balance along the general lines of the forecast the outlook [for the domestic economy] does go from something that is marginally acceptable to something that's pretty anemic Having said that, the further irony of the situation, though, is that to the extent that you try and fix that up--at least through monetary policy--you run the risk of aggravating the trade side of it in the short run, aggravating the very problem that you're trying to solve It's very hard when you go through the numbers--by country, by product, by anything you can think of--to see exactly where the improvement is going to come Frank, I too looked at that '77, '78, '79 experience in terms of the dollar And that says to me, if anything, that the lags will be longer, not shorter, for two reasons (1) the level of the dollar was much higher to begin with so that there's more profit margin cushion on the part of the foreign exporters; and (2) the patterns of economic growth in that period from late '77 to early '79 were generally more robust on a world-wide basis The difference between the growth in domestic demand in the United States vis-a-vis the other industrialized countries today versus then is really very sharp That too says, if anything, that the lags probably will be longer  I find this discussion about autos fascinating because I have a great deal of difficulty understanding how we're going to solve even the auto problem when, in the face of very sharp rises in import prices, domestic producers now are slipping in what strike me as very substantial increases in domestic automobile prices This latest    8/19/86  round of Chrysler price increases of 6-1/2 to 7 percent across the model line strikes me as astonishing in the current environment The other point I would make, simply because it has been raised, is that I think the implications of this tax bill are a crap-shoot in terms of the near-term implications for the economy I don't know, Jim, if you have any views on that, but it just strikes me as so incredibly complex that I am very hard pressed to have a judgment as to the net effect of it over the next 5 or 6 quarters   I can't quite shake myself from believing, even though people tell me not to believe it, that at least the near-term effects of it could very well be inflationary I don't see how you can shift as much tax burden to the business side without expecting that some, or perhaps a lot, of that is going to be fed through on the price side And those higher prices are going to be financed by the personal tax cuts   I don't know   You kind of stretch out the J-curve in the process   I support alternative B with borrowing at $300 million But along with all the other worries that I have I must say that I also have the worry that there is at least some danger that we could be sowing the seeds for a greater inflationary problem down the road It appears to me that at least in terms of the price effects, the beneficial effects of the oil situation may already be behind us Import prices are rising and are certainly going to rise more Indeed, if they don't rise more the chances of getting a correction in the trade balance are diminished The service sector doesn't look all that hot from a price and wage performance [perspective] And like Frank, I am not very slavish on any of the Ms but I can't completely disregard the pace at which all of them seem to be growing, at least at the moment Partly for that reason, I am not so keen at this precise moment on the discount rate part of the package either I certainly would be keen on it in a context in which I felt some greater assurance that we might get some support abroad Even aside from that, I guess I am not quite sure what a discount rate cut does now Clearly, it reduces debt service burdens--not just for LDCs, but for everybody That is good, if it doesn't have the perverse effect of encouraging still more debt But the effects of lower interest rates in the short run in terms of the exchange rate, in terms of the trade account, and in terms of stalling the prospects for growth in Japan and elsewhere, are really big question marks to me It is just not clear, aside from that debt servicing aspect of it, what a lower discount rate is going to do And ironically, I suppose, I see some danger that it could have some perverse effects Now, I think those perverse effects would be greatly minimized in the context in which there was some greater prospect for movements elsewhere Unfortunately, that doesn't look so good In that setting, if the discount rate has to come down, I  -46-    8/19/86  probably would be inclined to tilt open market operations and borrowings on the up side We have been rather systematically tilting operations on the side of ease and tilting borrowings on the low side In a setting in which the discount rate were reduced, absent moves abroad, I would be inclined to reverse the tilts   Without getting into a great [debate on] semantics here, when you talk about your formulation I interpret your shadings on the sides of $300 million as what I would think of as tilt It's hard to capture what you are really saying here   You are putting them in a context in which both are obviously conditional on a matrix of other things   I'd lean on the side of borrowing being higher rather than lower   The alternative "around $200 to $400 million," just hang around--   In some ways I would   I'll second it   A corollary argument to that is that if you completely stop doing it except in extraordinary circumstances, that too involves an announcement effect At some point you're going to have to answer the question Why aren't you buying long-term securities anymore?   That's the concern that I have If you withdraw from the market completely, do you create a situation where you're so inhibited about going into the market that in precisely the circumstance that you might want to go in you are just scared to death to do so because the announcement effect would be bigger then? I don't know   Just to take your example and make it a little more pointed My personal instinct is that if that very touchy interval a week ago, last Thursday-Friday, also had been one of those intervals when the market in the normal course might have expected us to be doing something, I think it would have been easier to do something   I don't think they are that remote at all   In terms of the general outlook, I'd piggy-back on a comment Mr Stern made earlier my GNP forecast on balance looks a lot like the staff's but it looks that way notwithstanding the fact that we have a smaller improvement in the trade deficit than is in the Greenbook On the trade deficit question, I have been on the skeptical side in terms of the rate at which that could turn around, and I still am But for what it is worth, our people did a little informal survey this past week of a cross section of a couple dozen firms, major and minor; and for the first time that survey does suggest some things that are consistent with at least a stabilization, if not some improvement, on the trade side It comes through both in terms of export opportunities being there in ways that they were not there before and in terms of import price pressures beginning to work their way in One of the surprising things we found in the process of doing this survey--at least surprising to me--was the emphasis that people on both sides put on commitments and long lags in orders and processing One example of that was even in soft goods--clothing and that type of thing The lags are a year or more, growing out of commitments and contractual obligations that are standing in the way of adjustments being made even in the face of more favorable conditions Now, there is nothing spectacular there--no hard evidence--but at least it is a bit of an indication that maybe the tide is turning, notwithstanding the horrible July number and the prospect for the third quarter as a whole still probably being pretty lousy  On the inflation side, I have some of the same concerns that Bob Parry and Tom Melzer talked about Our forecast is one in which we have the inflation rate roughly a half percentage point higher than what is in the Greenbook In some sense that is not altogether alarming, but what bothers me is that it wouldn't take a whole heck of a lot to make me want to mark up that price forecast Looking around, one of the things that really has disturbed me of late is this pattern that we see in domestic automobile prices--Ford, I guess it was, last week announcing price increases on domestic models of up to 9 percent In the context of the anecdotal reports that people have referred to, I think that is, to some extent, a matter of concern In the staff forecast, by the end of next year they have the CPI, excluding energy, at 4-1/2 percent I don't know what the threshold is but my hunch is that if that were above 5 percent, or if the deflator were above 4  -25-    9/23/86  percent, we would have a very, very difficult situation on our hands by the end of next year In that setting I, too, don't think that what we are seeing in the financial markets is completely irrational There is some basis for concern there, notwithstanding the fact that, as Emmett Rice and others have said, there are some downside risks in the economy itself It goes without saying that these patterns that we have seen in the last couple of weeks in the financial markets serve as a reminder of the vulnerabilities that are there--whether in terms of just volatility or these very, very sharp changes in financial asset prices over periods of weeks and months That in itself has the potential to undermine confidence in ways that could be quite counterproductive in terms of economic performance So, I can't disregard what the financial markets are doing at all, and I think what they are saying is that you better be careful here boys   That was a [generic] term   As far as a lot of the markets are concerned the smoke and mirrors, to use Governor Johnson's term, just reinforce the out-year problem I think that's what nagging at--   I will go for "B" but I have a nuance It's a little more than a nuance I think at this juncture that we have to be prepared to pave the way for the possibility that we might have to tighten Paving the way doesn't mean that we have to go down that road; but to be positioned to do that if the need arises strikes me as important So, I would lean a little in that direction The question of what we would do over the balance of the year if M2 and M3 burst out on the upside of those ranges is a question that has to be faced We don't have to face it decisively right now, but I think we have to have that possibility in mind I, for one, think that we'll be faced with that situation; we are not going to be able to sweep it under the rug   It means "B" with a little bias in the direction of snugger rather than easier   More emphasis on what?    9/23/86   The anatomy of an ooze    9/23/86   [It could] go the other way first [Unintelligible] what we care about   9 percent is above--   I don't think this is decisive, but if you say 7 to 9 percent for the balance of the year, you are saying that you are prepared to tolerate growth outside the boundaries for the year for both M2 and M3, though not by a lot If we had 9 percent growth in M2 and M3 for this period, we would end up about where "A" is, and on the charts "A" is outside the cone It's a trivial amount   On the merits, the best outcome would be that they lowered their rates and we didn't   That would be where I would start; that's for darn sure   You're in a position to give a lot of advice on that subject   I would move it   [The way] the SAT scores work, [there are] negatives and positives   As far as the general economic outlook is concerned I would associate myself with the broad profile of the staff forecast I think the risks are pretty well balanced I would add that I would consider an outcome over the next five quarters like the staff forecast quite acceptable, considering where we are in the business cycle and considering the range of structural problems that are out there that really don't have a heck of a lot to do with monetary policy in the short run One thing that bothers me is that I can't for the life of me figure out what to make of this tax bill It's so complex I think we're just going to have to wait and see how that shakes out But it is a major uncertainty as far as I'm concerned On the trade side, we too encounter many, many anecdotal comments along the lines that Frank Morris and Gary Stern have mentioned And at this point I think they're more broadly based by industry groupings A few months ago we heard some of that in chemicals and paper and that was about it But now there is some in other industry groups as well An interesting little side light to that on the other side of the equation--the import side--came up in a discussion Sam Cross and I had with some Swiss people yesterday Now, Switzerland is not a great exporter to the United States; but nevertheless they indicated to us that just in the past several weeks there had been a very sharp decline in orders at Swiss companies for exports to the United States, presumably concentrated in so-called high-tech and electronic types of products Again, not that Switzerland is a big exporter to the United States, but it was rather a dramatic report just because it seemed to be so sharp and so sudden in terms of their experience I have a couple of other anecdotal items I had a conversation with a fellow from one of the largest mail order houses in the United States at a business leaders meeting we had on the 22nd of October He told me that in the first three weeks of October--which is kind of the beginning of the Christmas buying season for a mail order firm--they had set records across the board in terms of their mail order business The other development, which is regional in character or is maybe just in the New York metropolitan area, is that the housing market and the labor market in the New York metropolitan area continue to really be booming Prices of houses are just out of sight On the labor market side I'll provide a great vignette I noticed Saturday when I was out doing a couple of errands that the help wanted signs for part-time workers in service-type establishments seemed to abound That, of course, is a very local phenomenon, but nevertheless-- Overall, as I said, I think the staff forecast is a reasonable one and an outcome that I would find quite acceptable   I'd like to take an initiative not to take an initiative   Is this in the nature of an "ooze" or what?   I can go along with symmetry   "Might" is consistent with "slightly"   Mr Cross was so clear   Move it   But that too is opportunity cost   That's the question I want to ask I am not sure about that Within the framework of this revised model that you are working with Don, is it plausible--this is not, obviously, an operative question for 1987--that you could get a pattern of pricing behavior by banks that would produce a real credit crunch in the old fashioned sense of the word? Is it plausible to get pricing by banks that becomes so aggressive that you are not even sure of the algebraic signs?   It depends on what kind of market they want to--   I realize this is a highly implausible circumstance, but in that circumstance if the banks decide that what they really have to do to protect themselves, or to keep away from hot money positions themselves, is not just maintain their deposit base but increase their "stable deposit base" they could get very aggressive in pricing retail deposits in a crunch type environment   I think it says that they are not more volatile, but that in order to keep them the competitive pressures get so intense that banks have to respond by pricing those deposits more aggressively   The idea that I am fooling with is a variation on several themes here First of all, I do want to keep M1 in the ball game, even if it is on the bench, partly because when I look at the behavior of M2 and M3 it seems that they basically grow within a 6 to 9 percent range, regardless of what's going on in the economy, inflation, interest rates, or anything else There's a certain amount of comfort that you can draw from that, in that you have a good chance of hitting the targets but not much comfort in terms of what hitting the targets may mean The thought I had would be to keep the M2 target, and presentationally--   Keep M2, M3, and maybe a monitoring range for debt like we have had in the past Presentationally, what I had in mind is that they would be prominently displayed in the box that is always part of the testimony Also in that box in a prominent place we could have a brief paragraph that would say something like "While the Committee has not adopted a formal target for M1 for 1987, it will continue to monitor its behavior closely Consistent with that, the Committee expects that in the context of GNP growth of, say, 6 percent and relatively stable interest rates, Ml growth should be in a range of 4 to 8 percent" And then add something along these lines "However, in the unlikely event that income is growing rapidly and velocity is increasing the Committee might be prepared to re-establish a target [for Ml]" You could maybe combine that idea with Governor Heller's suggestion and broaden it to say something to the effect that in the intervening period the Committee is restudying these relationships and definitions and so on Some notion like that has some appeal to me, both presentationally and substantively, even if it does mean that Ml in some sense is on the bench rather than in the ball game    12/15-16/86   It's a little more than a footnote I'd have it in a prominent place in that box that is always the focal point   I added in close physical proximity to the part that lays out the quantitative targets for M2 and M3   An off-balance-sheet item   What I am talking about does not contemplate a range in that sense   I didn't mean literally within the box All I meant to say is that I thought it should not be buried on page 28 of the testimony--that it should get some prominence   You know what I mean!   That is kind of the thought that I would mention at the end of what I suggested that the range we have isn't really a monitoring range in the sense that we have used that term historically; it's just a statement of what we would expect to happen in somewhat normal conditions But we could add on to that the thought that, in a context in which GNP, velocity, and inflation were rising, the Committee would be prepared to reconsider Ml as a target-- or something like that without being specific about a quarterly target   I would just make the observation that for every one of those financial assets there is a financial liability, too One of our problems, looking a little beyond M2 and 8-1/2 or 9 percent is the liability structure of the economy as a whole In some ways it is what's driving the increase in some of these asset-based measures And I think that is still a major concern over the long haul That's one of the things that creates a preference on my part to try and shave off that half point, even though I am under no illusions about it   No, just shave the half point because in the long run--   Yes   I clearly want "B" I get confused on the symmetries and asymmetries here, though In listening to the conversation, I think we might want to keep the language symmetrical; but even if the language were symmetrical I don't think that would necessarily preclude some easing--to go back to two months ago--if things really got "oozy" But I think the point about having the language symmetrical in the context of the testimony is a good point   However accurate   That's good, yes  SPEAKER(?) I think that's the one    12/15-16/86   Now you're getting into major changes here!   If the economy is weaker in such a way that the asymmetry was operational, it seems to me this language would be operational anyway That's the point I was thinking of   If everybody's right about the likelihood that the fourth quarter is strong--and we're not going to know a lot about the first quarter by the time of your testimony--what was going through my head is that if we have an asymmetrical directive but have decided not to use the asymmetry, then the questions are harder, I think On the other hand, if circumstances are such that we decide we want to ease a bit, nothing here would prevent us from doing that   Well, I think it's easier to tell the difference between that than it is between "might" and "would"   I have a great compromise   I think the "slightly greater" is not really operational in a borrowing [unintelligible] So what about leaving it "slightly greater, slightly lesser" and have the "would" apply to both? It's still symmetrical but "would" is a little more purposeful than might    12/15-16/86   I don't have a strong feeling about this The two things I'm worried about are the testimony and the year-end thing too We are going to have crazy money markets here for the next--   But what I was thinking of is that if events work in a direction that we would choose not to [move] and we have an asymmetrical directive, then you have to answer questions that seem to me a little difficult such as "Why did you say you were going to change and you didn't?"   I don't feel that strongly about it either way   It is to me   There is a question as to whether you always want to keep up with it   Just from my own perspective--and this is obviously one person's view and one person's alone--I frankly regarded that whole year-end thing as pretty darn wild And there is a question that arises in my mind--not that I have an alternative idea To find ourselves in a position where we have to throw $20 billion dollars into the market for individual banks, between open market operations and the discount window, seems to me to raise a question as to how far we should go in sanctioning the kind of behavior that we were seeing in that time frame    2/10-11/87   I guess   In no circumstances would it be the end of the world if the funds rate did go to whatever level I don't know; I am just saying that from my perspective the whole thing was pretty wild   To say nothing of the increase in reserves   The big banks seldom, if ever, borrowed other than on a Wednesday anyway, though    2/10-11/87   One thing that is probably at work is that they have more surprises now than they used to have Just in recent weeks the speed at which the turnover is taking place is continuing to grow I am sure that they have more surprises that have nothing whatever to do with the discount window They just don't know where they are going to end the day   It would also be consistent with their being more reluctant to come to the window They want to save that for when they really need it I think that is part of the explanation   There is another way of looking at that Chart 10, I think, is kind of interesting Roughly speaking, if you take the three years 1983, 1984, and 1985, the cumulative current account deficits for those three years are something like $280 billion; but the cumulative current account deficits for 1986, 1987, and 1988 are something like $410 billion So we are looking at a situation where in the three years that we are in now, we have to finance 50 percent more than we financed in the three earlier years-- but in a context in which interest rate differentials and exchange rate relationships are very, very different than they were in the three-year period when we were only financing $280 billion as opposed to the $410 billion or whatever it's going to be It could get a lot tougher The conclusion one draws is that it could very well be tougher--especially in the kind of interest rate/exchange rate environment we have right now--to finance what lies ahead than to finance what came before us   That's already built into those numbers   You are not stuck with it I think it just says that the potential risks of that adverse scenario are probably greater prospectively than they were retrospectively   My forecast is again almost identical with the staff's forecast It probably means that we are both wrong As a number of people said, the trade sector is obviously crucial And frankly, I blow hot and cold on that Sometimes I think we have a good shot at doing better than the forecast and other times I say "no way" I guess right now I am, to some extent, in the cold camp as opposed to the hot camp And that came about in part from listening to President Poehl and Governor Sumita over the weekend in Basle, both of whom were really distinctly more cautious about economic prospects in Germany and Japan Clearly, in terms of the favorable world economic situation--   Well, they start with the government forecast which is 3 percent plus--say, 3-1/2 to 4 percent Then they talk a little about the Bank of Japan forecast and shave a half point off that Then they start wriggling in terms of their own forecasts, so with the body english, I ended up with 2 percent or less   And some worry, especially in the Japanese case, that they are really taking a terrible beating in their manufacturing sector now So, as I said, I guess today I am a little influenced by that   By their standards On the import side, the question I keep asking myself is If we have a shortfall    2/10-11/87  from this kind of consensus forecast on the export side, is there any good possibility that we can make up the difference on the import side? That to me is a tough one Indeed, it's a "Catch-22" because when I look at the nature of the import situation here in the United States now, with the infrastructure that goes with it in so many product lines, it just seems to me that to break out of that mold that Ted has in his forecast, we are probably going to have to have pretty sharp price increases for imports That's something we haven't seen yet; and if we start to see it, it's just going to add that much more pressure on the domestic inflation side So, I am not sure we can make up any shortfall on the export side But if we do, I am afraid that we are going to make it up at the cost of higher inflation So, as I said, right now I am a bit on the cold side of the trade situation, but that will change next week, I suspect  On the purely domestic side, like Mr Stern and a couple of others, I've got to say I am impressed with not just the January employment numbers, but the collection of numbers over the past three or four months which, net, have been stronger than I would have expected, especially in the circumstances of the tax change Those developments will probably lead me to be marking up my forecast a little Putting it all together, I would say that the risks are about symmetric at this point I have a little of that nagging sense of unease that Ed Boehne spoke about in terms of the inflation situation, although I can't pin it down either If you go through unit labor costs and productivity exercises, you still get numbers that look respectable, at least in terms of deflators But there is at least that nagging feeling that this tremendous amount of liquidity that we put into the economy ought to do something at some point And right now all it seems to be doing, in some sense, is feeding the financial sector That in itself constitutes a risk because I continue to see a rather sharp--and in some ways an ever sharper--dichotomy between the financial sector of the economy and the real sector of the economy And I just don't see how that is sustainable I think there are risks right there in terms of something going astray which, in turn, could impair confidence in the world in a detrimental way   Just remember what you did to them the last time you were there!   Alternative II is for me for M2 and M3   Yes   I'll try And this is going to muddy the waters right off the bat, so I apologize   Just looking at it in terms of variant I and variant II, predictably, I come out somewhere between the two I don't think I have to restate the reasons why that's where I am But I would like to suggest that at least we start out with something like the first sentence in variant I   No, the first sentence And then put in something like this "Looking to 1987, in the context of moderate economic growth, continued moderation in inflationary forces, and absent major changes in interest rates and exchange rates, the behavior of M1 relative to income and prices might return to more normal relationships In those circumstances, growth of M1 in a range of 4 to 8 percent--or 3 to 8 percent or 3 to 9 percent-- would be appropriate" Then I would say "Because of the continuing uncertainties, the Committee decided not to establish such a target at this time, but would be prepared in appropriate circumstances to reestablish such a target range" Now it stops short; clearly, it's not a target I don't even really think of it quite as a monitoring range Nevertheless, we have a couple of numbers there in a context of an economic scenario And we're saying that, in that context, those numbers mean something So I think of it as a combination of "I" and "II"   Well, we'd have all that other stuff   Some flavor of the language at the bottom of Don's current variant I In other words, put in some of this language here that would deal with what we would do--meaning probably nothing--if one of those assumptions were widely off the mark Clearly, if the exchange rate fell out of bed, signals would be off If the economy were very sluggish, signals would be off I said it would muddy the waters   As I hear this, I think the difference between what you're saying and what I said is a fairly narrow difference, because all I was trying to say is use a number to indicate where we thought M1 might be if everything were, in a sense, working right In other words, if the economy were growing at a reasonable rate and nothing was happening on inflation, exchange rates, or interest rates, this is a kind of central tendency where we think M1 will come out But if any one of those conditions is not present, M1 could come out way above or way below it   To put this in a slightly different context If you took the sentence in variant I that people are focusing on and the Committee decided not to establish a range--not a target, not a monitoring range, nothing--it's as though we're putting M1 lower on the ladder than debt That's the danger   I agree with that, but that's the danger   Let me see I think I've got five points You have four, you're saying?  -43-    2/10-11/87   No, no I think I've got it You're saying first, there's no target as such; second, there is some broad expectation that M1 will be slower this year than last year; third, you loosely specify some conditions under which it could be very high and loosely specify conditions under which it could be very low; and then--   Then you have some language that would suggest there are also conditions in which we would react to it   The way you could present--   Couldn't you preserve your position by just saying 6 to 7 percent over the balance of the quarter? That's right where all the numbers are anyway   Use two months   We are only talking about M2 and M3, so theoretically, the weekly numbers don't matter   That's the problem with M2 and M3 in general   January to March, 6 to 7 percent   Which way would that work?   Somewhat greater than an [unintelligible]   Right   It can't make much difference in terms of growth in the Japanese economy   I should hope   We could say "the appropriateness of"   This doesn't tie [together] How about if we said "The Committee during the course of the year will evaluate the appropriate role and growth"   No I was thinking of the option   It already says that "The Committee hasn't reached any operational decisions"   You don't know which way it will work What are you trying to guard against?   Could I just raise a quick non-M1 point about the long-run part? In terms of what we are saying about monetary policy, I am getting more and more concerned about that debt variable, even though nobody pays any attention to it We are sitting here again this year saying we are going to monitor it, which implies a kind of quasi-sanction We monitor a growth in debt up to 11 percent with GNP growing [2 or 3] percent I know we can't do a darn thing about the variable, but for four or five years now running we have been monitoring it while it's behaving in a way that just does not make sense for the long term   I wouldn't suggest that But I do think that when you look at the way growth in debt has departed from the growth in GNP over a period now of five years or so, there is simply a point where those chickens are going to come home to roost   Whether it is sustainable or not is the question  -67-    2/10-11/87   The only other choice is to drop it all together as something we in some sense monitor   That's precisely the reason why I have this concern--because there is [impairment in] the ability to pay at some point That is why in balance-sheet terms this is dangerous to the economy and I think there is a point where the chickens could come home to roost Then the question for the Federal Reserve is going to be What were you doing here?   I did not say we should tighten I said that, at the very least, we ought to express some sensitivity to this I think there is a danger in just letting that sit out there in a way that at least subtly carries the implication that we are prepared to sanction or underwrite that kind of behavior indefinitely   I am not trying to make it a target variable I am just concerned that we have had it in there, in effect, as a target variable And it has been behaving in ways that I think over the long run raise some very difficult questions   I am suggesting simply that we be prepared in some appropriate words to acknowledge that there is a potential problem here  -68-    2/10-11/87   Look at the nonfinancial corporate sector since the end of 1984, $230 billion in equity and $480 billion in debt has been retired Now, some of that is the retiring of short- term debt with long-term debt I know all the circumstances But you just can't have that kind of thing indefinitely, in my judgment   That should mean that debt growth should be--   It is not I feel better having made it   I am not sure you can back that up  SPEAKER(?) I so move   Second   That's right Silver lining behind a cloud   Clearly, though, if the bottom fell out in the context of the conversation that was taking place earlier between Mr Cross and--I forget who it was--Si Keehn, maybe, the markets would do [unintelligible] in a very decisive way no matter what we did   I move it   Do you mean of a more general nature?   Let me make a couple of more general comments I don't feel that there is any fundamental difference in the economic outlook today as compared to what we have been talking about for the past couple of months As I said before, I tend to go hot and cold on this trade improvement situation and right now I guess I am cold, partly for the reason that has just been talked about and that the performance in some of the industrialized countries looks pretty sour But even beyond that, I still am a little skeptical  -16-    3/31/87  about the extent to which there have been broad-based opportunities on the import or the export side to see the kind of breakthroughs that would seem to be implied in the current forecast Although one can be surprised, I am a little more skeptical on that front  I can't quite shake a question in my mind, too, about the inventory situation, even though I understand the auto part, and the CCC part, and all the rest of it I sense, when I look at the production side of the economy against the backdrop of the inventory situation, that one of two things should be true that aren't showing up in the numbers One would be that export growth is stronger than the numbers suggest The other is that there is some demand in the economy someplace that isn't showing through Again, I don't think there is anything decisive there, but it does continue to raise a bit of a question in my mind on the inventory side In the context of the external situation--this point has already been made--the escalation of the tensions on the trade side is a new and troubling development which, in my mind's eye, simply reinforces the view that the greatest risk by far at this point lies with the dollar Any material further depreciation in the dollar is going to exacerbate the situation in countries like Japan by extending the J-curve It seems to me that you can make an argument that in relative terms Japan is already in a recession, although not in the statistical sense that we define recessions But on top of that risk on the dollar side, the other risk that I think is closer at hand than we would like it to be is that a further dollar depreciation will trigger at least a mini chain reaction on the financial side that could be very, very destabilizing in the short run So the net is probably a somewhat higher level of apprehension about the economy, which is Kentucky windage in nature But I have a significantly heightened concern about the dollar situation in the immediate circumstances that we face right now   Kentucky windage means I don't have any numbers to back up those hunches, just a bit of a feel in the air You throw a piece of grass up and you see which way it blows   You could associate it a little if you thought--   Tide capsizes all the ships   I will if no one wants to As I look at the situation now, in my judgment, we would have to be prepared to let interest rates go up a little for a little while in order to avoid a situation where they had to go up a lot for a long while In the context of the alternatives in the Bluebook, following them in a conventional sense, that would lean me toward the alternative C side of things But I don't think the alternatives in the Bluebook are really the best way to think about the situation at the moment   That's partly what I was just trying to say I don't think it is very easy to think about policy in terms of conventional alternatives A, B, or C The way I would state it is that I would be prepared, in the face of continued weakness in the exchange market, to see the borrowings level go up--in the extreme maybe even as high as $500 million, say--in the hope and the expectation that that would be temporary The idea is to avoid having to permanently increase interest rates But I do worry; I am not at all sure that we have seen the real test in this exchange market If we were to see the kinds of pressures, or even more pressures than we have seen in the last few days, materialize in the very near term I don't think we could head that off just through intervention And in those circumstances, I think we would have to be prepared to show our hand a little in the hope that that could get us over the hump  -30-    3/31/87   And I would be prepared to go up to at least $500 million in those circumstances   Oh, the best of all possible worlds would be that As I have tried to describe this, I would not view this as a fundamental change in policy; I would view it as almost a tactical change that says we are prepared [to move] at least for a transitory period To some extent we have been finessing that a little, as someone said earlier, just in terms of the way we have been conducting our open market operations from day-to-day All I am saying is that I would be prepared to go a little further than simply finessing open market operations from day-to-day in the face of renewed downward pressure   Depending upon what's going on in the market I think it means do nothing today   I know   It [unintelligible] for you   I certainly agree, Bob, with what you are saying Heaven knows what the "right exchange rate" is vis-a- vis the yen or anything else I don't know that either But we're in a period now where, as best I can judge, the market risks are very asymmetric Because they're asymmetric and because of the interdependencies, at least as I see them, between the exchange market, the domestic bond market, the stock market, and so forth, strategically we're in a position right now where a stitch in time can save nine That's all I'm trying to say If I had to take my chances in terms of snugging or [unintelligible] or whatever word we want to use to try to provide some protection against having to draw the line the hard way--to use your term--I'd rather take that chance I'd rather err in that direction now in the hopes that it could forestall what I could easily conceive of as a much more difficult situation   Well, that's not going to be an issue in six to seven weeks   But by the same token, it doesn't say that if the economy just died next week--although to me that is highly unlikely--that we wouldn't ease either   6 percent or less   We could say growth of M2 and M3 of around 6 percent, but the Committee would--   Why couldn't the sentence on the Ms say that the Committee expects growth in M2 and M3 in the period from March to June at rates of about 6 percent and then add some language to say that we would be tolerant of slower growth rates than that, given the circumstances of the very rapid earlier growth   We can say 6 percent or less; let me try that again   The way it's structured, I don't really care what we put in the second sentence about the aggregates   We better settle on something; we have to live with each other for the next two-and-a-half days   As a practical matter, we have stuck every conceivable number in the book into these directives in the past, including ones that don't even appear in the Bluebook   For M2 or M3 in seven weeks, I would have a stroke M2 and M3 don't [unintelligible]   Put 6 percent or somewhat less   What were the others 6 percent or somewhat less?   My preference is 6 percent or somewhat less   I would, too   Move it   There is nothing wrong with weak industrial capacity where we need it   Take autos as the classic case in point   Yes They don't   I can be relatively brief I am about where Mr Boehne was an hour ago As a matter of fact, Mr Boehne captured my assessment rather well I think there are risks in the real economy, here and abroad, but basically the way things have unfolded so far this year is pretty much in line both with what was expected and, indeed, with what I think constitutes a fairly satisfactory performance, given where we are I do think that there has been a change in the past six weeks on the inflation front, and I think it goes well beyond Wall Street I think six, eight, ten weeks  -19-    5/19/87  ago, there was a whiff of inflation--that was the phrase--and that may have been more concentrated on Wall Street But at this point I think there is more to it than that Si Keehn's comment puts it in very good perspective If you have a sector of the economy where you had price decreases and now you have small increases, and everything else stays the same elsewhere in the economy, the cumulative weight on the inflation side is obviously greater As I look at the indices, I certainly would agree that some of the forces working in the direction of higher measured rates of inflation were predictable--energy prices, and to some extent, agricultural prices, and certainly import prices But even if they were predictable, it seems to me one of two things, or both, may be operative first, that the amounts of those increases may be larger than most people thought they were going to be; and second--I am by no means saying that--that there isn't any such thing as one-time price increases I think there is a tendency for these things to cumulate So, whether it's in terms of forecasts--and not Wall Street forecasts, but forecasts from any number of sources around the country--or what is in the actual statistics themselves, I come away with the view that either actual or forecast rates of inflation have stepped up by something in the area of a half point and maybe even as much as a point We are looking now at consumer price increases, excluding food and energy, probably on the up side of 4-1/2 percent It doesn't take a lot to get to 5 percent; and once you get to 5 percent, I think the argument that it will wash out becomes that much more questionable So, I think there is a change on the inflation side   I would be for "C" too As far as the Boehne/Melzer/Angell twist, that is something I have some considerable sympathy for--trying to get out ahead of this a little I think a discount rate change now would give us the kind of maneuvering room that Manley mentioned, as well I might be a bit more skittish about the discount rate this morning than I was yesterday, just because the market has gotten pretty jumpy in the context of this Citibank development But the right policy, in my judgment, is the Boehne/Melzer/Angell twist on this, which affects the timing, as far as I'm concerned   Peter, is that how you and Don think about it?   It raises a question in my mind as to what we're thinking of   Doesn't over the quarter usually convey December to March?   I'm indifferent   Oh, those studies are a lot of [unintelligible] They average everything   Move it   So move it   Well, that's usually the case   But if we got to a lower level of borrowings that would probably aggravate the problem you were just talking about before In other words, there would be less cushion   In terms of the overall mechanism   To an extent   I react to this along the following lines The whole thing, as a matter of perspective, represents a series of technical relationships that are the first step in a long,    7/7/87  long, linkage between what we do and prices and all the things we really care about Looked at in that light, I walk away somewhat amazed that it works as well as it does Indeed, when you look at the net deviations as summarized either on chart 2 or chart 5, I'm hard pressed to conclude that any of them is likely to have any net effect on real economic variables or prices or anything else Indeed, the deviations are in that sense, I think, astonishingly small So, it's reassuring to me in that sense But what is a little troubling about it to me is that it comes pretty darn close to saying that, despite all our protestations to the contrary, we're really operating on the federal funds rate   I find that troubling because we've been down that path before; and to the extent we seduce ourselves back into that I think it could come back to haunt us in the long run   That's one thing In that case, the funds rate is being used appropriately, in my judgment, as an information variable   It's telling you something Indeed, some of those deviations--which, again, I regard as small in net terms--ultimately reflect a willingness to let the federal funds rate at times tell us something But that's a little different   That's always what I thought we were doing   But when I got through reading this I got a little nervous on the other side of the ledger   What happens, Mike, to the net domestic savings gap in 1988? In other words, what happens to the financing requirements of the government plus the private sector relative to net domestic savings?   As a percent of GNP or in absolute terms?   So the net is slightly worse off in 1988 than in 1987   But for financing purposes the real--   The New York Bank's Research Department forecast has basically the same bottom line as the Board staff's forecast but there are a couple of very important differences in the assumptions In the forecast of the New York Research Department--I distinguish that from my own forecast, because sometimes they're not the same--they basically have no further change in the exchange rate over the forecast period from about the levels of the past month or so Vis-a-vis the Board staff's forecast that really constitutes a very large difference because it reflects not just the 9 or 10 percent [decline that is forecast] for next year but also what happens over the balance of this year So, the net difference is more like 13 or 14 percent from where we are right now Now, because we don't have that further decline in the dollar we get some spurious feedbacks from that For example, in nominal terms, our current account number for next year is actually better than the staff's number even though in real terms the opposite might be the case; it's hard to tell there precisely But by not getting that further 13 or 14 percent of J-curve effects we actually end up with the spurious result, at least in the near term, of a better current account situation in 1988  The other thing that is true by assumption is that while we have some build up in interest rates I don't think it is quite as sharp, by implication, as maybe what you're talking about, Mike But we get a different mix we pick up a little more in terms of domestic spending and a little less perhaps in real terms on the net export side It washes out in terms of GNP to about the same although, as I said, the current account--which for financial purposes is important-- is actually better in 1988 The other thing that is troublesome is that, notwithstanding the fact that we have by assumption no change in the dollar, our price numbers are higher, if anything, than the staff numbers--not by a whole heck of a lot, but they are higher Indeed, it seems to me that when you look at all the price forecasts that are around, certainly the overwhelming consensus of the forecasts, though not all of them, is for a situation for 1988 in which the deflator either bumps or passes through 4 percent and the consumer price index either bumps or passes through 5 percent And in some cases the consumer price index gets up into the 5-1/2 percent range Without being too precise, I am just thinking of those thresholds of 4 percent and 5 percent I'm hard pressed at this point to see what, short of a recession or some major slowdown in economic growth, will prevent that from happening In other words, given labor market conditions, import prices, and all the rest, that kind of result seems to me to be almost baked in already To the extent that developments either in oil prices or other things work the wrong way, so much the worse So, I find it troubling that--and I'm referring to my personal forecast on this--I end up with such a price outlook, again just focusing on those 4 and 5 percent thresholds, despite a different assumption about the dollar exchange rate When looked at it in terms of a growth pattern of say, 2-3/4 percent, just to pick a number out of the air, that's telling us that we're at the point where we've got to pay for some of our past sins If we have faster growth we're going to have more inflation and we're going to have less external adjustment And when  -26-    7/7/87  I look at that growth pattern for next year of, say, 2-3/4 percent, I think it's about the best we can possibly hope for   It's really quite modest, Bob I don't have the numbers   Yes That's partly because by assumption the exchange rate is unchanged   This is kind of a mechanical exercise; not in any material way, no   I'd keep the range, too What I would be prepared to say is that, in a context in which velocity was continuing to [rise], I would be willing to tolerate a shortfall   5 to 8 percent is alternative II, isn't it?   My preference is alternative II as is But if there was something of a consensus to go 5 to 8 percent on M2, then I would make a formal suggestion that we make the ranges for both M2 and M3 4 to 8 percent   My preference is alternative II as is What I said is, if there was a consensus to make the M2 range 5 to 8 percent, I would then suggest that we make both M2 and M3 4 to 8 percent   I suggest "be prepared to tolerate" I think that is a little different from saying we expect We would be prepared to tolerate it coming in somewhat below   I would start with velocity If velocity of M2 continues to [rise], as in the first half of the year--   "Tolerate" leaves you open to hit the target   We had shift-adjusted M1; that was the NOW account year with all the controversy The measured M1 was actually below the range, but the measure we were using adjusted for NOW accounts and was within the range as I recall   Again, what's wrong with linking it to velocity?   We could say "The Committee expects that M2 will come in at or slightly below the bottom of the range However, if velocity were to continue to [rise], the Committee also recognizes that it might tolerate somewhat slower growth"   I don't believe this   In making the suggestion earlier, I was thinking of the analysis   Well, if I take the arguments that Mr Kohn and his colleagues are making about the interest elasticity of M2 seriously--and I am not sure that I do--but if I did, and if I had an economic outlook that very much parallels Mr Prell's economic outlook, it is not at all difficult for me to envision circumstances in 1988 in which M2 could be growing at quite a low rate and I would be very happy The real economy could be doing just what they are talking about--growing at 2-3/4 percent   Now, I don't think that that is the likely outcome; but certainly it is quite plausible   I don't think so, Bob Again, I think part of the question to consider is how you judge the outlook in the first place   I'm precisely with Mr Boehne "B" and symmetrical   No, reverse it   7-1/2 is a nice fraction, though; it's not like--   Well, this is a resource--   Where are you reading from?   I kind of like it the way it is  SPEAKER(?) Yes   When it comes in, if one falls out [of the range] we did exactly what we said we were going to do   We've run out of some other things, too   I would be--   You can get a vote from Mr Boehne now   I prefer to have one on why we are not ratcheting it down enough  -64-    7/7/87   I think that operational language has always been that stark It has been in the other part of the policy record and in the testimony that we had all the verbiage and the hallelujahs and hosannas   I'd like for the record to show, if I may, that of the other occasions to [unintelligible] us, in this particular case I think we have to acknowledge, at least I would do so, that this will be the Chairman's last Open Market Committee meeting, hopefully   Hopefully But it has been, I think, 12 years and something like 119 or 120 consecutive--I don't think he's ever missed one--meetings of the Committee as a member and as Chairman We've all come to learn the subtleties of "mights" and "woulds" and "snugs" and "oozes" But I think we've learned a lot more sensible things and I think that we should acknowledge this particular occasion   So move   So move   I move on that   I think I can make it $12 billion [Laughter]   Is it because banks and thrifts are getting super conservative? Is that the idea?   Well, Mr Chairman, I think we'll probably get a little better sense of things when we get back to work in earnest in September and businesses start doing their planning for 1988 But, as I look at things right now, first, I think that the outlook for the economy is better--not that I thought that it was all that bad to begin with And second, I have to conclude that the inflation risks have risen In terms of the "body english" that can  -19-    8/18/87  be put on that, some can say--as I think Mike Prell did a long time ago--that one way to look at it is simply with a higher degree of confidence that something approaching 3 percent real growth could be realized I would simply add that, in the current circumstances, I do think we have to keep in mind that something like the staff forecast for real growth isn't far from what is optimal, considering the need to effect the external adjustments that we have all been talking about and to maintain some hope that the inflationary process does not get away from us, as a number of people have suggested  On this all-important question of the external adjustment, for what it's worth, the New York staff forecast is a little stronger overall in real GNP Interestingly enough, it is also one in which there is no assumption of further dollar depreciation in 1988, but despite that, we get a better showing in the trade account and the current account in nominal terms and end up at about the same place in real terms Now, the reasons for those differences, I think, are important One is that we do have slightly stronger growth--not a gangbuster pace by any means--but marginally stronger growth in the non-US industrialized world than is in the staff forecast A second factor, of course, is that without the second or third J-curve effect, the nominal effects work in the right direction And finally, we do have US export prices going up more rapidly than the staff forecast does Each one of those, obviously, is a big "if" and, taken together, they are a lot of "ifs" But the key point is that they do suggest at least the possibility that you could get an outcome that is better in nominal terms and about the same in real terms, without having to rely on a further depreciation of the dollar, with its inflationary implications and the risk, of course, that further depreciation of the dollar could get away from us I think that is important for another reason I tend to look a lot at what I call "a domestic savings gap" in trying to figure out where we are in terms of capital and savings requirements As things stand right now, and assuming a Federal budget deficit in 1988 somewhere in the $150 to $160 billion range, the fact of the matter is that we have made precious little progress in reducing the so-called domestic savings gap If the budget deficit next year is in that $150-$160 billion range, and if total net private investment is only about 5 percent of the GNP, which is darn small, the savings gap relative to GNP is still going to be 2-1/2 percent or more of GNP It is still going to be $145 or $150 billion in absolute terms--not down at all from its peak in 1985 or 1986 So, that fundamental disequilibrium is still there In fact, it has not improved much at all, despite the reductions that we have seen in the budget deficit, because the saving rate for the economy as a whole has slipped off its peaks of 1985 and 1986--not decisively, but enough so that the problem, both in relative and absolute terms, is still very much with us throughout the forecast period That in itself says to me that we have to be especially cautious, because one way or another that residual is going to have to be filled from abroad, if interest rates and exchange rates are going to remain consistent with the kind of economic profile that the forecasts are talking about  On the inflation question, I can be very brief and simply say that a number of us, including myself, have fretted in the past about crossing that threshold of 4 percent in the deflator and 5 percent in the consumer price index; and it seems to me that the consensus view, though not the universal view, among private economists and others is  -20-    8/18/87  that we are there That, I think, is the reality As things stand right now, I can postulate conditions that would produce a result better than that, but I certainly don't think that those are the likely outcome Indeed, I guess I'd be on the side that says that I could also postulate conditions in which, heaven forbid, we could find ourselves looking at 5 percent on the deflator and 6 percent in the consumer price index If we get to that point, then we are looking at a situation that inevitably carries with it the risks of highly destabilizing consequences for the real economy here and around the world Indeed, I think the lessons of the past are clear if you wait to see that kind of problem staring you in the face, the costs of unwinding it are going to be exponentially greater than the costs of checking it in the first place   Thank you, Mr Chairman I can be rather brief As I said earlier, in the totality of circumstances that we face, I view something like the staff forecast as about as close to optimal as we can get right now But I also regard the risks in that forecast as being strongly asymmetrical on the side of the economy being stronger and the inflation rate being higher Because I have that view as to the asymmetries of the situation, and because I regard the risks of that type of an outcome to be potentially so severe, I would favor, at this point, a modest move in policy that would take the borrowing level to $600 million--in other words, something between "B" and "C" It's not that I think that kind of a move in and of itself is going to be decisive; but I do think that it will be enough of a move to show through in the marketplace, and to convey a sense of concern on the part of this Committee as to the potential for things working in an adverse way I see that kind of an approach as relatively risk-free in that the initial change that it would carry, whether in terms of interest rates or things like that, is inconsequential as far as the forecast for the economy is concerned I do not regard signal value as being inconsequential So, on the theory that a stitch in time may indeed be worth nine, I would proceed along those lines   I wouldn't object I would just offer a historical caution, for what it's worth I think we have to be a little bit careful about jiggling around these quarterly objectives at mid-quarterly meetings, especially when we are so near the end of the quarter It can convey something more than I think we had in mind   I think it's better to leave them close to where they were at mid-quarter  -34-    8/18/87    The convention, I think, Mr Chairman, is that you do not average that   The majority is--   I think it is hard to average it One other thing that is done, in terms of trying to sense where the critical mass is, if I could put it that way, or where the Committee might stand, is that the Chairman has been known from time to time to ask people what their preferences are as opposed to what they could live with In this particular case, you may have some shadings of opinion around those borrowing numbers, for example, based on the question of symmetry or tilt that would go with them--in other words, the "woulds" and the "mights" I, myself, certainly would not dissent, at this meeting, over the difference between $600 million and $500 million in the context in which there was some tilt along the lines that Governor Johnson has suggested So, you do have some play; but I don't think that most members of the Committee would be comfortable with averaging the borrowings I think that can get to be quite awkward when there are larger differences, as there may be, than the difference between $500 million and $600 million   Second   In general, based on a number of these periodic surveys that have been done, the thinking is that the percentage of transactions that will in some sense be related to the underlying exchange of goods is very, very small   So move it   In terms of the forecast, it has been true for some time, and it's still true, that our staff work in New York has the same overall result as the Greenbook forecast but with an unchanged dollar and a slightly smaller adjustment in real net exports because we have a scattering of stronger elements of domestic demand, including inventories So, while the aggregate numbers look very'much the same, what lies beneath them is quite different insofar as the dollar and real net exports Our inflation outlook, despite the fact that we have the dollar stable, is about the same, or maybe a shade worse than the Greenbook  Mr Boehne raised a question earlier in the discussion about this overall adjustment process that I'd like to comment on just briefly, and then turn back I think, Ed, your question was can it work? Or is the scale of the problem so big that you can't get from here to there? When you look at the big three countries--the United States, Germany, and Japan--the fact of the matter is that by conventional standards the adjustment is well underway in the sense that for both 1986 and 1987, and in our forecast for 1988, the growth in domestic demand in both Germany and Japan is stronger to significantly stronger than is the growth in their own GNP In the case of the United States, we still had domestic demand stronger than GNP in 1986; but in 1987, and in our forecast and yours as well-- although there are some differences there--you get a widening out such that GNP growth in the United States is something like a percentage point greater than growth in domestic demand It is true that overall growth in Germany and Japan is perhaps lower than one would like to see But, the dynamics of the adjustment have set in, in what I think is not an inconsequential way Again, the evidence in all three of the major countries is basically working the way the textbook says it should The problem, to some extent, is what Ed touched on earlier, and that is the scale of the adjustment that we are talking about and the scale of adjustment that is needed When you look at it in terms of the behavior of exports--and this is all relevant to the outlook, I'm just getting there in a roundabout way--we all know these numbers are lousy, but the numbers for July 1987 versus July 1986 indicate that US export growth really has been, I think we can say, almost spectacular And it's not confined any more to a handful of products or a handful of countries; it's pretty much across the board, including very sharp increases in exports even to Japan The strength of those export numbers in the context of the overall dynamics of the adjustment raises a couple of questions in my mind What's offsetting it in part, of course, is imports Our own imports are still very, very strong, across the board, with few exceptions--perhaps lumber But, by and large, those imports are still humming and a lot of that is price Then again, how many J curves do we have to see in terms of import prices? That's one of the reasons why I like our forecast--at least right now--better than I like the Board staff's forecast But, when you put it together, it leads me to one or two possible conclusions One is that there really is something systematically wrong with the trade numbers, at least as we see them month to month The second is that the domestic economy is, in fact, stronger than we think it is, or at least than the conventional measures are telling us My hunch is that probably both of those things are true that the trade numbers are messed up and that the domestic economy, if anything, is actually a bit stronger than we think it is  -17-    9/22/87  Partly for the reasons I've just noted, I would certainly join those who have already said that, in looking at the outlook at this point in time, the risks are decidedly on the upside I find it hard at this point to ignore the galaxy of numbers in the business fixed investment areas, industrial production, orders, and labor markets They all seem to be to pointing in that direction, in a context in which I really do believe that the margin of upside error, if you will, is really quite slim I think you can now make a pretty good case that actual GNP is brushing up against potential GNP; labor markets, no matter how you look at them, have to be at least near the danger zone; and I think it's not hard to visualize at least some selective bottlenecks beginning to develop, for example, in nondurable goods areas where we already see that raw and intermediate material prices are rising Now, we could get a little help There is a faint chance, at least in the near term, that the oil price pressures could be downward rather than upward That would be temporary, but that's possibly a favorable straw in the wind But when I put it all together, it seems to me that both the global picture as well as what we can derive from our own situation statistically lead me to view that the risks are on the upside  Now, on your question about the long-term Treasury rate, Mr Chairman, I thought we were framing the question a little differently than maybe you were I was prepared to answer this question what do I think is driving the rate up? Is that what you are asking? I'm not sure it is the same   Well, the breakdown of the components to the increment and the breakdown of the components to the level may not be the same, though But, let me try to answer   If it were the increment in the nominal rate, which is the question I thought you were asking, I would put virtually none of that on volatility, which was the middle factor you raised I would put the greater weight on inflation-related considerations, including the exchange rate of the dollar But, I do think there is something real there too; I can't be very precise as to what But I'd give zero weight on volatility, certainly   Yes   Yes, but I would say that while I think the bulk of the increment has been driven by these inflation- related things, I also would say that the level of the real interest rate does come out higher Maybe, just maybe, that's because there is something happening in terms of the marginal productivity of capital It's possible  -18-    9/22/87   No, I agree   These are both [unintelligible] integrated plants?   I'd be completely satisfied with that formulation--that is, staying with $600 million borrowing and using symmetric language In a nutshell, I think that is where policy should be   In a nutshell, I genuinely think that is precisely where policy should be   Yes   Mr Chairman, Jerry Corrigan here Can I just make two quick comments? [Unintelligible] you may have covered this before I came in the room, but I would want to say that just because we have not seen hard evidence of any sizable or troubling losses, obviously that doesn't mean that they may not be there It's quite clear that a lot of people are not entirely sure where they are It's also worth keeping in mind the margin calls for the funds The New York Stock Exchange for the big clients may start to [unintelligible] I'm not sure what was being said before about monetary policy over the near term, but the second point I would make is that certainly, we've got to have maximum flexibility, at least for the days ahead But I'm not willing to prejudge at all the question of where borrowing should or should not be in a more permanent fashion at this point   I'm not so sure of that   I don't think it's just the money supply question I think that President Poehl, in particular, believes that if push comes to shove, the Germans and the German economy can handle a somewhat stronger mark and weaker dollar And he quite firmly believes, whether anyone happens to agree or not, that the risks are squarely on the side of the United States--that the risks of a weaker dollar are greater risks to the United States than they are for Germany and--   I think it is correct I was just going to say that I find it hard to violently disagree with that The question that I think Ed Boehne is raising goes beyond the technical mechanism of the Louvre or anything else and that is What are the risks? At least that's how I think of it What are the risks of one set of policies, however broadly defined, versus another set of policies? I ask myself this question What event of a foreseeable nature could really get us in the soup again? And I'm thinking, in part, of the events of the past couple of weeks I must say that I think the dollar is still high on that list If the dollar were to fall out of bed--however one might choose to define that--first of all, whether we like to admit it or not, I think the dollar/domestic interest rate linkage is still there I'm not quite sure it is--or ever was--as precise as some people thought, but I certainly think that linkage is still there I think the danger is clear; I can't assign probabilities to it but the danger is clear that you can end up with the worst of both worlds a lower dollar and higher interest rates The collapse of the exchange markets could easily trigger a renewed outburst of chaos in the financial markets There is one particular thing that we have to keep in mind, and that is that a decidedly weaker dollar could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, especially for the Japanese stock market I think that is a very real danger   What could they do? What they should have done was do something several years ago But what should they do right now?   Well, that may be; but we can't be indifferent to it   I don't think it's quite that black and white I think there is something of a workable middle ground and we have to try to find it   Manley, when you're talking about a brave new world, the thing that is most new and most brave about this world right now is that we have no policies We have no fiscal policies; we have no exchange rate policies,   I don't know about the demand for BMWs and Mercedes, but that shouldn't affect the productivity numbers too much Actually, they should go up   In the very near term, Mr Chairman, I don't think there's much doubt that the stock market and related developments do work in the direction of weaker spending and lower inflation But I am not at all sure as to amounts and I am not at all sure what one should infer for the longer term There are probably several dozen scenarios that anybody could think of Unlike Mr Prell, I don't have to put one on paper but, in my thinking, there are two more likely scenarios in the near term One is that the financial markets, and by that I mean all of them--exchange markets, bond markets, stock markets--kind of settle in more or less where they have been in the last couple of days I don't know where they are right now, so I have to qualify that But suppose the Dow settles in at the 1900-2000 range, the long bond settles in at 9 percent or a little more or a little less, and the exchange markets are roughly in line with [the levels of] recent days Now, in that scenario, my hunch is that economic performance will be respectable but not spectacular over the intermediate term--probably something like what I heard Mr Parry describe, which I don't consider to be all bad, by the way The other scenario, which I think has to be thought about along with that one, isn't so pretty And that's a scenario in which for whatever reason-- because the exchange markets go south or the budget negotiations rupture--there's a sudden hit to the system Who knows what the exact trigger might be, but we could find ourselves confronted with another very, very difficult and turbulent set of conditions in the financial markets Obviously, I can't put a probability on that But if I were to just think of the two broad scenarios that would warrant the closest attention from a policy point of view, I guess those are the two that stick out in my mind Interestingly enough, at least from my perspective, they both seem to me to have the same immediate policy implications in that they both imply the need for a great deal of caution in policy, and a very measured and disciplined approach to policy in which we maintain maximum flexibility for the future    11/3/87  I would also, if I may Mr Chairman, like to make a comment or two about the longer-term situation as I see it, because I think it's extremely germane both to where we are and to policy options for the future There is, of course, a great deal of discussion in all circles about imbalances in the US and the world economy, whether in terms of trade or payments or whatever But, we should not lose sight of a couple of powerful forces on the domestic side that I think are germane One is the dramatic increase in debt, in leveraging, that we have had in recent years the ratio of overall nonfinancial debt to GNP--and I understand all the limits in the data--has risen from something like 141 in the early 1980s to almost 181 early this year It may be coincidence--it probably is--but the fact of the matter is that the last time we saw that ratio in a range that high was in the late 1920s And it's not all government debt, although government debt has a lot to do with it Since the first quarter of 1984, the net issuance of equity is down $270 billion and corporate debt is up $600 billion Again, if you look at this problem of government deficits and savings, it's really quite dramatic In the late 1970s, the general US government budget deficit as a percent of net private savings averaged about 10 percent It has risen sharply throughout the 1980s, peaking at 66 percent in 1986 Indeed, in 1986 the federal budget deficit itself absorbed more than 90 percent of net private savings And even in 1987, that absorption rate relative to domestic savings will fall only to the mid-50 percent range I stress that because in the context of all this discussion about budget packages and all the rest, I think we have to keep in mind that, even under the best of circumstances, the kinds of things that are talked about in the area of budget reform are really quite small Indeed, there is a great likelihood that the budget deficit in 1988 in absolute terms will be larger than in 1987 It is in that context, I think, that a lot of these acute dilemmas and very, very sharp risks have to be evaluated and considered   Let me just make a couple of comments about policy generally, and then I may have some language here that can encompass a lot of what is being said First of all, to return briefly to this exchange rate question, I don't approach the exchange rate as a matter of theology; I approach it as a matter of trying to balance the risks And my principal point on the exchange rate is that I do see very real risks of a further substantial depreciation in the value of the dollar I know certain things that it will do it will add to inflationary pressures at home; it will work in the direction of putting greater pressure rather than lesser pressure on interest rates at home I don't know how it works; but I know the algebraic signs And I also know that, at least in the short run, it raises more questions about growth prospects abroad, in part, because of another elongation in the J curve Now, I have to balance those risks against the hope that it will somehow accelerate the turnaround in the US trade deficit, in a context in which there are a host of uncertainties--such as growth prospects abroad--that I think are more important than the exact level of the exchange rate So again, it's not a matter of theology for me; it's a matter of where are the risks and what are the greater risks Then, there is this question of debt deficits and debtor nations The point that I was trying to get at in bringing that up before is that whether we like it or not, history tells us in rather unmistakable terms that a country that finds itself in the position that we find ourselves in right now is going to have higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case There may be an example someplace, somewhere in history that's contrary to that, but I don't know of it   I don't think it exists The only other point I'd make is on this question of a measured approach to what we are trying to do here I favor alternative "B" as Governor Johnson defined it a moment ago But let me, if it's agreeable to you, Mr Chairman, suggest some language here   This is built on Variant I, and I think it gets at a lot of the things that you have been saying The first sentence, without prejudging decreasing or maintain or whatever would read "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to [decrease somewhat/maintain/increase slightly] the degree of pressures on reserve positions sought in recent days" Tom, I think that gets at your point And I would remove the next sentence after the semicolon completely Go down to the next sentence "The Committee "   Take out all that stuff after the semicolon I'm at Variant I The first sentence reads "In the  -38-    11/3/87  implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to [decrease somewhat/maintain/increase slightly] the degree of pressures on reserve positions" and I would insert "sought in recent days"   Yes, I think they do   Well, either way; we can come back to that   Well, let me come to that in a minute because what I was going to suggest in the next sentence, Si, deals with that, I think "The Committee recognizes that the volatile conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may call for a special degree of flexibility in open market operations" and then insert "depending, in particular, on demands for liquidity growing out of recent or prospective developments in the financial markets"   But the idea, Si, is to get that all into one sentence so it's not too overburdening Then the next sentence--and in my mind this is crucial--would start "Apart from such considerations", in other words apart from the providing liquidity, etc Then you would have your regular sentence with the somewhat or slightly lesser or greater reserve restraint In other words, that next sentence would stay as it is Others may not agree with this, but contrary to what somebody said, I personally would take out the sentence on the next page about relatively frequent consultations We certainly can do that and may do that, but I think we ought to be trying to project not business as usual but not that we are ready to jump out the window ourselves So, as I see it, Mr Chairman, a directive couched more or less in those terms would allow us to do what you certainly want to do and I gather what a lot of other people want to do But it would stop short of a directive that becomes a federal funds rate directive And at least in my judgment, it provides a bridge to go from these extraordinary conditions right now to a more "normal" environment, if circumstances permit   I'm agnostic on that; I would have a broad range there--5 to 9 percent or 4 to 8 percent; I wouldn't worry too much about that  -39-    11/3/87   I'm not sure what it says right now because it was sent out to be typed about 10 minutes ago; it hasn't come back yet   Let me see it   Let me just take a look at it   Right; that's right   I guess so   The sentence I think should read "Apart from such considerations slightly lesser reserve restraint would or slightly greater might"   Somewhat lesser reserve restraint--   Okay   And the economy, strength of the business expansion, etc   [Unintelligible] around 6 to 7 percent   So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   On the question that Governor Johnson raised before, it does follow that if you use borrowings as the operational target, you will see more variability in the funds rate than you would see, obviously, if you target the funds rate But from my perspective, that's a desirable result for two reasons One reason is that the short-run variability in the funds rate often has very valuable informational content It may be telling you something that you don't know or can't find out if you literally have the funds rate pegged The second reason I think it's desirable is something of an extension of Ed Boehne's point not only does pegging the federal funds rate tend to result in people being more inhibited about moving it than they perhaps otherwise would be, but neither borrowings nor the funds rate is what we are ultimately concerned with What we are ultimately concerned with is the economy The experience of the 1970s--a period that was much more tranquil in many respects than the 1980s--leaves me at least with a very bitter taste in my mouth, because the implication of an approach to policy that seeks to peg interest rates is that, in fact, we can do that with great precision But we end up with an economic result that is far, far removed from what we are after   Well, I think it's more than being politicized First of all, as I said, I think there is an inhibition to changing the federal funds rate, quite apart from the political side of it, but there shouldn't be And Peter touched on this once the market knows that that's what you are doing that's what the federal funds rate is going to be It simply loses--    12/15-16/87   Well--   It can be off for a lot of reasons   I don't think so   Higher interest rates   It seems to me that nobody in the marketplace would expect the Federal Reserve literally to seek to  -13-    12/15-16/87  target the federal funds rate on an hour-by-hour basis over this year- end period I think that would be a terrible mistake I felt that we did too much even last year, in terms of the situation So I would associate myself very strongly with Tom Melzer's suggestion that, given that people expect some movement in this period, we should take advantage of it As I've mentioned to you before, it seems to me that one way or another we are probably going to have to remind people, no matter what we do with policy, that we are coming into a period in which we could see rather extraordinary amounts of churning and volatility in the money market I don't think we should ever get ourselves to the point where we literally are going to run policy so as to avoid that kind of working of the marketplace, which I consider healthy   Well, if you say you're going to continue literally day-in and day-out to target the federal funds rate over the next three weeks that's what you're saying   Well, my point is--   It doesn't seem to me that we would want to overreact in those circumstances either There is at least a 50/50 chance that at some point over this interval, one way or the other, a very large aberration will set in I don't know which side it will be on, but regardless, I don't think that the operating policy of the Federal Reserve should be to try to offset it literally dollar- for-dollar But if we say that the funds rate is going to be at 6-3/4 percent, period, that's what we are saying, in effect   I'd like to speak to Mr Melzer's suggestion I would have great difficulty with anything even remotely resembling a monetary base operating procedure in the immediate time frame   I'm saying, Roger, that in the immediate time frame I would have great difficulty with anything even approaching a monetary base operating target I say that for several reasons First of all, I have never understood the base to begin with I have read all the great work that has been done in St Louis and every place else But, to me, the thing itself is kind of a pig- in-a-poke And since I don't really know what it is, I'm not about to put too much reliance on it as a steering mechanism for monetary policy More importantly, in the current circumstances, I'm very skeptical that the market reaction would be the one that you are suggesting Having said that, I certainly share the frustrations associated with the current approaches to policy But, given all that has happened in the last few years, especially with any formulation of monetarism that I'm familiar with, including a base formulation, I think the reaction of the marketplace to a policy approach like that would be, "Oh no! This ensures a renewed and high degree of instability in interest rates" And I suspect that people would take to the hills rather than raise the flag, because of fears of a great deal of instability and volatility in interest rates that we haven't seen in many years  Finally--I keep coming back to this--I, too, am frustrated by the lack of a nice firm handle for monetary policy But let's not lose sight of the fact that despite all the limitations, the performance of the economy over the past several years has hardly been something we need to apologize for I think economic performance, all things considered, has probably been as good as it reasonably could have been Again, that does not mean that I am insensitive to the frustration that you're speaking from, Tom; I share that completely But I'm very dubious that the base is a way out   But that's, in part, because you have an identification problem One of the reasons you see that commonality in inflection points, of course, is that when you look at the base, or at least part of the base, you are looking at the same things that people were looking at anyway--reservable deposits, as they have changed over time I could almost argue that what you  -30-    12/15-16/87  really should do is go to the opposite extreme I don't really believe this, but to overstate it a bit, I could make a respectable argument that something like debt--to go the Frank Morris or Ben Friedman route--actually has been more useful in many respects than any of the other money or credit aggregates in recent years I don't really believe that, but certainly I could make a point of argument out of that In other words, if anything--forget about debt--it should be going in the direction of something broader rather than something narrower As I said, the big worry I have is the market reaction I really do think that if we went out and told the markets tomorrow, "Guys, come hell or high water, we're going to make the base grow by 5 to 7 percent, or 3 to 5 percent, or 4 to 6 percent" the marketplace would batten down the hatches   First of all, in the notable case of Germany, it's different; it's not the same thing Second, if you take Germany as a case in point, right now of course, they are missing the target in a very systematic way That is part of their problem   That's what we're doing right now with the monetary aggregate targets   If you could rationalize--and this is a big if--the whole structure of reserve requirements and all the rest of it, that would make a base measure at least more understandable In other words,--   Well, it's partly the currency, but it's also the crazy quilt pattern of the relationship between reserves and other things because of a crazy tiering of reserve requirements, and the reserves on nonpersonal deposits and certain Euro-liabilities, and all the rest If you had a clean, plain-vanilla kind of structure of reserve requirements that would help a bit, because one problem you get into here that complicates it further--beyond the currency  -33-    12/15-16/87  problem--is the so-called multiplier between the reserve component of the base and "money"   That's what I mean by the crazy quilt structure of reserve requirements   That wasn't my point, though, in the first place   That's only one part of my point My point simply is that the relationship between the reserve component of the monetary base and anything else, whether it's an M, or GNP, or whatever, is itself subject to a lot of distortion because of what I call the overall crazy quilt--not necessarily irrational--pattern of the structure of reserve requirements   It sounds like M1   Of course, a lot of those manufacturing and export companies, up until recently, were making up for their income losses in exports by their activities in the financial sector There's no question that--   There's no question about that That works in the same direction, of course--and land  -39-    12/15-16/87   That's the crucial point   So moved   I will move it   I move it   Mr Chairman, I don't have any particular new insights on the immediate outlook, but I have become more and more preoccupied with the longer-term question of how to deal with these fundamental imbalances in the world economy What I've done, for a change, is ask myself the longer-term question rather than what's going to happen next quarter And the way I went about that with my colleagues was to say, let's take the 1988 forecast as is--and there's no great difference between the Board staff and the New York staff forecast--but then superimpose on that by assumption, different patterns of behavior over the 1988 through 1991 period to see what kinds of conditions in that overall period can get us out of the box we're in And there are really four questions that seem to me important (1) Can we get out of that box without a recession? I think the answer is yes (2) Can we get there without entailing very, very clear risks on the inflation side? I think the answer there is no I'll explain these answers in a minute (3) Can we get there with the current exchange rate structure? And the answer to that is yes (4) Can we get there without a long period of subpar growth in domestic demand in the US economy, and by implication, a slower rise in the standard of living than we've been used to? Unfortunately, the answer to that question I think is unambiguously no, we can't No matter what you do, all scenarios that I can visualize involve, among other things, a large increase in US market share abroad and also a large increase in our external financing requirement over the period With my colleagues, the way I tried to get a fix on the dynamics of the long-term problem was to just take a couple of simple arithmetic examples and work back The first is one that simply postulated a trade deficit of $50 billion in 1991 and then asked what it takes to get there given a 1988 forecast like that in the Greenbook What it takes is something like this growth in US domestic demand of about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent over the entire period; growth in US GNP of about 2-3/4 percent, growth in foreign domestic demand of about 3-1/2 percent and growth in foreign GNP of about 3 percent And by implication, it will require, over the entire period, US manufacturing output increasing by 4 percent and growth in capacity of plant and equipment in the United States from year-end 1988 levels of something like 3-1/2 percent   Yes Achieving either one, in the context of the kinds of things that have been going on, is a long shot But to put up an argument, even if all of those things worked right, the end-of-period situation, by assumption, would still leave a trade deficit of $50 billion and using very conservative interest rate assumptions, a current account deficit of $77 billion, or 13 percent of GNP Our net foreign indebtedness at the end of the period would be $900 billion, or 15 percent of GNP, and a country with a net foreign indebtedness of 15 percent of GNP--other than in war time or in the early stages of development--is quite unusual indeed That's the kind of gradual adjustment scenario Incidentally, that case also assumed no change in the real exchange rate from current levels  Another way to think about it is to impose a constraint on our current account balance by the end of 1991, again assuming no change in the standard of living which means, among other things, no  -53-    12/15-16/87  change in the real exchange rate In that case, US domestic demand kind of by assumption is 2-1/2 percent but real GNP would have to be 4 percent Now, here's the killer foreign domestic demand would have to be 66 percent and foreign GNP would have to be 6 percent The point, of course, is that I don't see any conceivable way to get from here to there under those kinds of assumptions--that is, maintaining domestic demand growth and expecting that the whole adjustment, in effect, is going to take place externally That kind of scenario would require growth in US manufacturing output of about 5-1/2 to 6 percent and growth in physical capacity of about 5-1/2 percent Again, I just don't see how that could happen But it would result in a trade surplus at the end of 1991, a $25 billion current account balance, and our net external debt would be about $785 billion, or 12- 1/2 percent of GNP  The third approach that one can think of is something that combines a little of both to superimpose on case 1, if you will, a 10 percent further devaluation [of the dollar] that is front-end loaded-- in other words, it comes mostly in the early part of next year Then again, if the constraint is a current account balance in 1991, in order to get there, US domestic demand growth would have to be something like 12 percent; GNP growth, 25 to 26 percent; foreign demand growth, 35 percent; and foreign GNP growth, 29 percent or so That would require manufacturing output growth in the US of about 4- 1/4 to 4-1/2 percent and capacity growth again of about 4 percent That would also get you a current account balance in 1991 These estimates are obviously nothing more than an exercise in arithmetic and there's no suggestion that they are anything more than that Obviously, one could quibble with any one of them, or all of them, but I think the broad profile that emerges from that kind of an exercise is right That broad profile says to me that any way you cut it, we have a situation involving a huge unfunded external liability sitting out there that is going to have to be attended to It says to me that domestic spending, at least by historical standards, is going to have to be restrained and that there is considerable force to the argument to stabilize exchange rates sooner rather than later I can see very little to be gained by further instability in the exchange markets and further downward pressure on the dollar As a matter of fact, it seems to me that the risks of further downward pressure on the dollar are rather asymmetrically on the side of making things worse, not better   If things started to rupture, that's right There's a lot of risk, and I should say that right now, at this precise point in time, I think the risks are on the financial side I regard those risks as a matter of particular concern What I am trying to say is that, as great as those concerns are right now, I think the longer-term problem remains; and, in order to try to deal with the problems today, we need to do it in a way that recognizes what we are up against over a long period of time  -54-    12/15-16/87   I didn't quite say that But the question is what kind of policy would produce that result? I don't think that is totally within our control I think it has a lot to do with the attitudes of the US government as a whole But if I had no constraints, and you asked me if my preference would be a policy that puts heavy weight on stabilizing the dollar, my answer is yes--not exclusive, but heavy--yes   No In my mind, that's the value of doing this kind of exercise, because it does tell me that we can avoid a recession It tells me that we have a very thin line to walk and very little maneuvering room But the comforting thing is that it does say to me that there is a conceivable set of circumstances over a period of time that can produce a desired result without a recession If we make too many mistakes, one of the biggest risks in this long term is that it involves a lot of inflationary pressures over a long period of time Obviously, if those inflationary pressures escape us, that is one of the things that increases the risks of a recession But the comfort I draw from this is that it does suggest you can get through this without a recession   Well, part of it is what's already built in But when you have growth, say, in manufacturing output, in the ranges that are implied even in the gradual adjustment scenario, and the need to increase plant and equipment spending in sufficient magnitudes--   That's true, but we're talking about a pattern of behavior over a number of years with a starting point of an unemployment rate of 6 percent, when the starting point in terms of capacity utilization--and in this scenario we use the rate forecast for the end of 1988--is 82-1/2 percent The overall rate is [projected to be] up to 82-1/2 percent, but there are about 8 or 9 two-digit SIC industry groups that are big exporters where those capacity utilization rates are already pushing de facto full utilization So, it does take a not inconsequential amount of hard investment to be able to sustain that kind of export-driven output in manufacturing   What it implies is that the budget deficit comes down in proportion to the reduction in the current account, in rough order of magnitude, so that in the so-called gradual adjustment case the budget deficit in 1991 is down around 1 percent of  -55-    12/15-16/87  GNP But it also implies that the saving rate comes up more in line with early to mid-1980s experience as opposed to the experience of last year Of course, if either or both of those things don't happen, then you have problems because if the saving rate doesn't come up, and then you superimpose a higher level of consumption spending than what it is already, then your domestic demand --   That's right   In this? The inflation rate in this is basically held stable at 4-1/2 percent by assumption That's one of the things that permits an orderly interest rate outlook here Again, I want to emphasize this is just arithmetic; it's not a model or anything like that   Oh, yes   Excuse me, the overall saving rate--   That's right   It's not without risks But, Bob, to answer your question, it's not all that precise The overall saving rate goes up, almost by assumption; it's the only way you can get that result   That is right   It has to go up  -56-    12/15-16/87   Well, as Alan said before, in this scenario--assuming there's no generalized outburst of inflation driving up wages--presumably the profitability in manufacturing would be fairly robust in these circumstances   But, there's a whole bunch of things that have to work right As Mr Truman said, even this gradual adjustment case assumes foreign domestic demand growth of 3-1/2 percent and foreign GNP growth of 3 percent   It sounds like we didn't go quite as far as we apparently went, either   I have a multitude of problems My first problem is that, going back to the last meeting, I frankly did not realize, or did not fully appreciate at the time of the meeting, how far we seem to have gone in terms of an operating strategy that so narrowly pegs the federal funds rate, as indeed emerged over the period It may be that I missed the nuances of the discussion, but I certainly didn't view policy quite in that strict light of literally resisting even one-eighth of a percentage point wiggles in the federal funds rate As I said yesterday, that approach to policy, even on a very short-term basis, is one that I find very, very troubling So, on the strategy question, I would favor going back to (4) as fast as  -77-    12/15-16/87  possible I don't think I would condition that on a stable relationship because there has never been one and never will be one The whole idea is that part of what we're providing is room for the market itself to play a role in the process So, moving back to (4) promptly is something that I put some importance on I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but it seems to me that doing so at year-end is the perfect way to do it The Chairman could say in testimony or in the question and answer [session] at the end of this week that we expect, as always, some volatility or churning in the markets at year- end, so don't read any policy significance into it, because there's none there In my judgment, that provides the easiest way to get back to (4), but I think that is your call, Mr Chairman If you prefer to do it otherwise, I could live with (3) over the next couple of weeks But getting stuck on something like what current policy has turned out to be would be a very big mistake, I think  As far as the basic thrust of policy is concerned, were it not for the proximity to October 19th, I would actually favor tightening policy right now on the grounds that I regard the current exchange market situation as perilous I recognize that there are risks on both sides The exchange market could trigger a blowout in the stock market; or, the other way around, a blowout in the stock market could trigger a blowout in the exchange market But what lies beneath both of those concerns, at least in my judgment, is a great deal of agnosticism or skepticism or cynicism about the thrust of US economic policy in general And I don't think that is going to go away very easily However, I can't ignore October 19th, and I don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water, so I could live with an alternative "B" that would have borrowings, depending upon what we want to do with the strategy question, at $400 million, at least after the year-end I would associate that with a federal funds rate roughly in the range of recent experience, but I would define recent experience in somewhat broader terms than an eighth-of-a-point spread On the language of the directive, I have no trouble with a directive that is asymmetric toward easing in a context in which the pattern of economic statistics is distinctly weak On the other hand, I would strongly favor a directive that is at least potentially asymmetric to tighten if we run into another rout in the exchange market   Well, it's not because if the circumstances are not significant--   The difference is that the only condition under which I would be willing to ease would be because of the economy itself The ideal order [in the directive language is a problem] In other words, I wouldn't be persuaded by--  -78-    12/15-16/87   No The condition under which I would tilt to ease is only one and that is decisive weakness and evident weakness--   No, that's not what this says   I've always interpreted that to mean you'd ease depending upon any one of those   That's my point   I get hung up on the language, so let me stress the point that I'm trying to make Under what conditions would I be willing to tighten? There are several conditions under which I would be willing to tighten the exchange market or strong economic numbers or a buildup in inflation or--   But only one where I would be willing to ease That's the distinction I'm trying to make That's a long-winded "B"  -79-    12/15-16/87   Well, we'll see what the language says   It's hard to answer that question without knowing what else is going to be in I guess I'd say out   Leaving that aside for a minute, I interpret the combination of a consensus for number (3) and the consensus to leave in that second sentence on still sensitive conditions in the context of your remarks still to be consistent with an operating strategy (3) and a prompt move to (4) That, in turn, means that before we get to $400 million on borrowing we are not, even in the next couple of days or weeks, slavishly seeking a federal funds rate of 6-3/4 or 6-7/8 percent   Pardon me?   Okay   If it worked the way we thought it would work, that would not be the result   Good   Can I just ask one other question?   I want to come back to this dollar business--not that it's necessarily directly relevant to the vote, but let me raise the question anyway In the circumstances that we face right now we literally have risks all over the table And everybody is talking about this There are very few things that we can influence directly, but I continue to be deeply concerned about our ability to have any constructive influence on any of this so long as it is perceived to be the policy of the Federal Reserve on the one hand and the United States Government on the other hand to be indifferent, to the point of embarrassment almost, about the exchange rate in the circumstances that we face right now If there is anything that can be done--through G-7, G-5, G-10, or any other mechanism available--to try to stabilize that situation, that is something I want to be strongly associated with   Do you mean if I had my druthers?   That's correct   That was the point I was making before That's implicit here under certain circumstances, but I don't think that's enough I think what is needed is going to have to go beyond that   No   I'm also saying that I do think there are things that can be done in the G-7 context that would be compatible with that objective And unless, or until, there is some movement in that direction, the risks that we are running in terms of these massive unfunded liabilities constitute, in my view, the largest single risk of the many risks that are in front of us right now And if push comes to shove, whether it's monetary policy or not, the answer is going to come in the form of higher interest rates with or  -86-    12/15-16/87  without monetary policy What I'm trying to avoid is getting there the hard way There's no choice here   Prospectively, they're unfunded   It's relevant to my reservations about the vote, yes Even though I have to vote--   No, I'm--   I don't care about the minutes   Fine   Well, as I see it, we're on a tightrope and I'm at the point where I think that a real effort should be made to try to stabilize the exchange market By that I mean that the dollar has gone down enough What policy tools are available to do that? The problem is damn few We're not going to get anything more on the fiscal side or elsewhere We could tighten monetary  -87-    12/15-16/87  policy, including raising the discount rate, but that entails all these risks in terms of both the real and the financial sides of the economy Or we could try to paste together some kind of a Louvre II agreement backed up perhaps by using swaps or some foreign currency borrowings But I'm dubious that that by itself, without some kind of policy initiative, would be convincing On the other side of the coin, if the skepticism about policy continues and if we have a renewed run on the dollar, it seems to me that that's going to produce precisely the kinds of things that we're all so afraid of, including a further break in the stock market And that's the dilemma But in order to solve that dilemma, there has to be some movement someplace And I ask where? And this is the thrust of my argument that at this point some of that movement has to come from the United States As I said, there are several ways to do it; but with the vulnerabilities that I see right now, it is a very high-risk approach and I don't like it I think it's very dangerous   Mr Chairman, this is Jerry [Corrigan] in New York I certainly would support a change And with respect to Governor Kelley's point, I would throw out the idea that the sentence could read "the Committee agreed that with the passing of time and the year-end", or something like that, but--   As far as the forecast goes, our forecast again is virtually identical with the staff forecast, so there's nothing to talk about there On the anecdotal side, the commentary that we hear--whether it's from people on our small business advisory council or on our board of directors or people in between--is generally, with some exceptions, along the lines of the kind of thing Ed Boehne was talking about before But even at this last meeting of the small business group, I guess it was two weeks ago, I was amazed These guys were talking about their steel shipments being on quotas in upstate New York And that's--   Well, that's true I'll come back to that in a minute But again, the broad thrust is in the direction of the kind of comments that Ed Boehne referred to earlier That has  -23-    2/9-10/88  influenced my own thinking, at least at the margin, in the direction of not being overly preoccupied about the prospect of a weak first quarter or a weak first half I should add that, on I guess it was Thursday or Friday, I took a poll of a couple dozen economists in the Bank, and I asked them whether any of them foresaw a recession And every one of them said no; and that's when I got worried   They haven't been around long enough!   That was a tongue-in-cheek remark, Martha I even said that myself "That's when I got worried" But what I'm really worried about is not the first quarter or first half What I'm worried about, as I've said before, is the intermediate-term problem we have in terms of winding down the external deficits, with all that that implies, without ending up with a serious inflationary problem on our hands I think all the risks in the intermediate term are on the side of more inflation, not less And I can't find a way to approximate a transition out of those external deficits that does not leave me with that conviction--that the risks over the intermediate term are on the side of more, rather than less, inflation To complicate the problem, from where we stand right now, in order to achieve that transition, under the very best of circumstances we have the equivalent of $4 to $5 billion of unfunded external liabilities in the form of the cumulative changes in the current account deficit that are going to occur, almost without a doubt So, that's where my concerns are I think the risks of a recession in the near term are there; and we have to guard prudently against that But I think we have to keep our eye on the longer-term problem and the longer-term adjustment, because I don't know of any surer way to end up with a really nasty recession than to make the mistake on the side of ending up with more inflation and not less So, I'm powerfully influenced by those longer-term considerations   I'm talking even longer than that-- perhaps a period of as much as two or three years   That's because I got the earlier flight   Are you ready to have some comments now?   As I look at the 1988 policy horizon, it seems to me that the most important thing is to do all we can to try to satisfy ourselves that the economy is on the right trajectory that will work in the direction of resolving some of those longer-term problems of an external nature that I spoke of yesterday When I look at the staff's forecast or the central tendency of the FOMC Committee members' forecasts, it seems to me that both have the virtue of being on the right trajectory, in the broader sense of the word trajectory And in that sense, I don't have great difficulty at all with an outcome that would resemble either the central tendency or the staff forecast  But as Don Kohn said, we ought to think then about the risks to that kind of an outcome On the downside, there are two or three things that pop into my mind One is the saving rate that was talked about yesterday In that area, again, consistent with this trajectory argument, I think that we should not resist--indeed, we should welcome--a mild and modest updrift in the saving rate That is one of the things that has to happen as a part of this larger adjustment process On the other hand, clearly, if the saving rate were to take a leap up, that, in turn, would imply a pattern of consumption spending that could well be associated with a recession But I ask myself what could produce a leap in the saving rate rather than a drift And the generic answer I get is something that shakes confidence And of the things that enter my mind that can shake confidence, the one that still rings loudly is the financial sector-- not necessarily the stock market in the first instance but some kind of further disruption on the financial side Clearly, there is a risk there  Another risk is that the trade deficit may not come down We could be confronting that situation as early as Friday if we get a bad trade number in these next series of numbers Obviously, in that case, the likely chain of events is the dollar, interest rates, and then stock prices You've got the same kind of Catch-22 The irony, of course, is that if the trade deficit is going to come down it's going to have to come down in the context in which we have at least slower-than-typical rates of increase in consumer spending So, there is a clear risk there  There's another kind of financial risk, and that is some kind of a shock--whether its origins are in Latin America or the unexpected demise of a major financial house or something of that nature So there clearly are risks And the common denominator of them, at least as I think about it, is not that I see great potential structural weaknesses in spending, but these risks one way or another end up on  -31-    2/9-10/88  the financial side The initial event might vary from one case to another but somehow you always end up there  But I also see risks, and I may be an outlier on this, on the other side altogether--risks that the economy could be stronger than the central tendency or the staff forecast It doesn't take much in terms of stronger, and not a lot stronger, consumer spending, and certainly not much in terms of stronger business fixed investment spending, to alter that outlook on the other side In that context, I believe that there is virtually no margin on the upside, because we are that close, in my judgment, to a situation in which the inflationary implications of all of that could be very distasteful, very quickly  Now in some sense, the policy dilemma that is most acute to me is in the immediate context When I try to balance those risks, I come to the conclusion, Mr Chairman, that in the very near term--and by that I mean next week, I suppose--that the balance of the risks is probably on the downside But out over the year as a whole, I think they're on the upside And that makes for a very difficult set of policy choices It certainly means that, while we have to be sensitive to those risks, we can't overreact either way Indeed, I think from a financial market point of view, if we were to act in a way that led the markets to conclude that we were on vacation, we'd have the various financial disruptions that we are trying to avoid in the first place Where that brings me, in terms of policy for 1988, is to a comment that Governor Kelley made at the end of the discussion yesterday I think he said he'd like to freeze dry, or something to that effect, the staff forecast--a forecast that, in round numbers, implies something like 6 percent growth in nominal GNP--and I agree with that In that context, my preference on the aggregates is alternative III I have a small preference, very small, for a monitoring range for M1 But the key thing about alternative III is that the midpoint is 6 percent on M2 and M3 That, in turn, implies 0 velocity growth for the year as a whole It seems to me that from the point of view of your testimony, and the body english that gets put on policy for the year as a whole, that by saying we are assuming 0 velocity, in effect, that casts the right kinds of vibes and it also leaves the Committee with some flexibility over the year I think that gives us some latitude to respond to any velocity other than 0 But again, I think it also has the added cosmetic value of being good grist for the testimony So, I'm for alternative III   So far it is   The Kohn cone too   I'll move   I will second   I just want to pick up on what I thought was a very important comment Peter made in the middle of his remarks about the search for this elusive mechanism in relationship that's going to make everybody happy every day That's just not going to happen Just to take a piece of it On a slow day, the federal funds market turns over $400 or $500 billion The list of various things that could introduce slippage and errors into those relationships is vast   But you can't have a monetary policy that is so fine-tuned that it attempts to overcome every one of those dozens of things that can take place in the market   I don't think you can overcome them no matter what your objective is   The range of what?   I don't care what your objective is   If your objective is the federal funds rate--   Mine isn't   I don't   Again, those were different days Just take the computer problems and the frequency with which they occur I guarantee you that that alone is an important source of day- to-day variability in the federal funds rate   It depends what time the computers go down   That means--  -49-    2/9-10/88   I don't think you can do it   That's about what it is, too   I really don't think it is desirable or possible to build that kind of precision into the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy   You spoke earlier, Mr Chairman, about the need to try to come out of this with a point of view that could command some support I'm tempted to say, looking at this little score card here, that you were clairvoyant in anticipating that that might not be the easiest thing to do Let me first say what is my preference and then what I guess I would regard as acceptable My preference on the short run is a straight plain vanilla alternative B; and on the long run, a straight plain vanilla alternative III In the short run, I could associate myself with Gary Stern's approach, which would have "B" with a little tilt toward "A"--$200 million borrowing but with the expectation that on the borrowing we'd work toward--I'll come back to that in a minute  On the long term, again, I could accept 4 to 8 percent I have three kinds of problems here One is a little uneasiness about the thrust of policy, let's say, that I can accept Two is, that if the conduct of policy in the days and weeks ahead were strongly to prejudice the discount rate question--in a context in which the economic outlook, or the exchange market, or whatever, is not different in a material way from what it is right now--I would have real trouble at that point Even so, we have to go carefully here, at least until we get the trade number If that trade number turns out to be a real bummer, even the kind of finessing we're trying to do here is going to backfire   I think it is extremely important, at least for the foreseeable future and barring some material change, to try to conduct operations in a way that is not prejudicial to the discount rate My third point--calling a spade a spade--is that now we are running policy off the federal funds rate and I think that's a mistake   We did!   7 to 11 percent is fine   Could I just say a further word on this, but hopefully without getting into a debate or a long discussion? I don't think the question of the operating tactics of monetary policy on a day-to-day basis comes down to what will work or what won't work I think it's true you can make almost anything work The question that I think is important is preserving for the Committee, and for you as Chairman, an appropriate degree of flexibility We are not clairvoyant; we cannot anticipate every situation that arises We have to have the kind of flexibility to do things that need to be done So, from my point of view, it's not so much a technical question as to what produces the best statistical result and the highest R square It's a question of what preserves the maximum flexibility for the Committee as a whole, and for you as Chairman, to be able to guide policy in a manner that's consistent with the thrust of the Committee's wishes but incorporates the kinds of flexibility that are often needed So, Mr Chairman, that's how I see the issue   Right   Yes, especially if Don thinks that the numbers are coming in a little higher anyway   If you took Ed's language and put 6 to 7 percent in for the aggregates that--   Yes   You're calling a spade a spade   That's right The Chairman is talking about a major international event we have coming up in June We have a challenge of a softball game between the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  SPEAKER(?) We better beat them   Much is at stake  SPEAKER(?) You're going to have a hard time   You can wait for the outcome to see   Move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   Can I raise a point of order, Mr Chairman?   Going back to the organizational meeting schedule, I wonder if it might not be well for the Committee to consider changing the organizational meeting from March to February The rationale I have in mind is that it always strikes me as anomalous that the presidents who vote for the annual targets at the February meetings cease being the presidents who vote for the balance of the year I just wonder if in the interest of consistency--   Okay   I think that that is right in terms of the real question, but I'm not so sure that the question is unanswerable, in the ultimate sense of the word I find it compelling to ask myself a question What are the implications of a significant further decline in the dollar from where we are now? I think you have to think it through on the trade side and on the financial side In my view, the problem on the trade side is that the current forecast may embody a speed of adjustment that is about as fast as we can hope to achieve; indeed, it seems to me that it may border on the edge of being dangerously fast, in the context of being inflationary So, I don't see that there is a whole lot to be gained in the foreseeable future on the trade side from a further decline in the dollar Then, I ask myself the question What does it imply on the financial side? And by financial side, of course, I mean our capacity to finance a $140 billion current account deficit this year And that question, it seems to me, is more difficult I can't quantify how much more difficult, but I think the algebraic sign is clear enough So, where I come out, without being able to be precise, is that I see a clear risk on the side of a further depreciation of the dollar and I see    3/29/88  very little to be gained by a further depreciation of the dollar I don't know what it gets us   I think that's a big part of the problem You don't have that wholesale deposit problem in this case We have it to some extent, but it's very small compared to what you    3/29/88  had in Continental I think that in terms of the market's sharp reaction, that put a very different coloration on Continental as opposed to this  SPEAKER(?) I do think that it might be a bit of a mistake to assume that it's only a regional problem   I so move   I move that, too   Let me make a couple of general comments I think that Ann-Marie Meulendyke's memorandum that is attached to Peter's and Don's memorandum is very revealing, because what it says to me is that there's nothing new under the sun--that the same frustrations and the same debate has been going on since time immemorial   Okay I'm sorry   As I started to say, I think Ann- Marie's memorandum is interesting because what it says is that there's nothing new under the sun--that this debate, in various forms, has been going on since time immemorial One of the more revealing things in her memorandum, it seems to me, is that in 1968, as I recall, we established a system of lagged reserve accounting to help us hit a free reserve target; and as soon as we went through all the pain and expense of doing that, we abandoned free reserve targets What she didn't say, of course, is that in the early 1980s we went to incredible pain and expense to institute a system of contemporaneous reserve accounting to help us set the money supply; and no sooner had we gone through the pain and expense of that we abandoned the money supply targets Now, if that isn't coming full circle, I don't know what is  -18-    3/29/88  But I think what is at issue here are two things that are inescapable One is that it's a lot easier to ease monetary policy than it is to tighten I don't care what indicators you're using; I don't care what your philosophy is; it's a lot easier to go one way than it is the other And I think that the history of monetary policy around the world is ultimately tied up in that question I think it's also true, as Manley said, that the borrowings number is obviously a proxy for a bunch of things But so is the federal funds rate Indeed, there's nothing particularly appealing about the federal funds rate in itself You can pick federal funds rates, which at different points in time have been associated with wildly different patterns of economic activity, inflation, and all the rest of it There is absolutely no magic in the federal funds rate and its relationship to the things that we really care about The funds rate in its own sense is merely symbolic of a bunch of things So, whether you're talking borrowings or the funds rate, I think, in some sense, you're talking about a proxy for a collection of things  And that's partly the answer to Governor Heller's question as to why, if the procedure is so lousy, the results are so good I think the answer to that is, in part, because we all look through the procedures In other words, we do not focus simply on the transmission variables or the proxy variables; we look through those things and we make judgments about them based on what we see in the economy, in inflation, and all the rest Indeed, it seems to me that that's why there are conditional elements in the directive language That reinforces the view, in my judgment, that the things we are focusing on are imperfect proxies for the things we really care about  I don't fully agree with the argument that the move away from the federal funds rate was simply a politically driven decision, especially one that was motivated by obfuscation I think it was more fundamental than that I think it did reflect the earlier experience And the experience was, as Frank said, that we were staring a roaring inflation in the face And we chose [not] to, or were unwilling to, recognize it and respond to it So, I think there's more to that than politics and obfuscation I also think that there's more to it in another sense It seems to me that, regardless of what we use as the proxy for policy, a very crucial question is What constitutes a change in policy? We are always the ones who will have to answer that question So, of the decisions that we make, which do we regard as a change in policy? I think we have a responsibility to inform the world when we make a change in policy, as opposed to a little give here and there based on markets and developments and all the rest of that That's the question that I think is on the table At the extreme, if you have money supply targets and they're annual and you literally view them as targets, you very seldom change policy But if you're talking a federal funds rate that is a discrete number--that has a point estimate attached to it--and you really want to say that that's your policy instrument, it seems to me that you are looking at a situation in which you're going to have to be saying with great frequency, Mr St Germain, we changed policy yesterday   But again, I think there's a reason for that And the reason is that they are construed in a way in which  -19-    3/29/88  lowering your borrowing target is not viewed as a change in policy It is viewed as consistent with an ongoing policy   But what are you going to announce?   Again, I just caution you, you get to the point where you still have to answer the question What is a change in policy? That I think--   A change of policy, in the context of existing directives, is an increase or a decrease in the amount of pressure on reserves And it seems to me--   It's not the same   It absolutely is not the same in terms of--   It differs in the very sense that we're stuck on this problem right now Now, when you go back to October, you're trying to hit a federal funds rate target to the second decimal point And if you're going to do that, it seems to me that that carries with it the implication that policy defined in those terms is going to take on a short-run orientation that is going to be disruptive to markets, more difficult to communicate If we were to change policy right now, what would you say in your testimony? I saw it on C-Span; you were asked two or three times Has there been a change in the approach to policy? You said no in your recent testimony If we literally take the step of saying that we're going to target the federal funds rate, I don't think you can answer that question by saying no   I'm talk--   What would you do, I guess is the question?   But that's a change in the approach to policy   That's what helps us   But neither does the federal funds rate   Oh, sure   Every change in the borrowings level is on that solid line   But not the other--no, that's where I think there's a difference of opinion   Well, that's the question   Now, when you look at the rate of [unintelligible]--I think that is the crucial question   That, I think, is the crucial question I was trying to get at before What is a policy change? I have never felt that every change in the borrowings number in that path has to be considered a policy change If a change in borrowing is made that is consistent with the way the directive was structured by the Committee, it doesn't follow to me that that is a change in policy Indeed, that's why I think that it's quite appropriate that that be done by the Chairman   But, again, it seems to me that's the--   And I think it's crucial for you, Mr Chairman, because as I tried to say before, ultimately the question that is on the table here--aside from the substantive question--is under what conditions do the procedures create a situation in which you are, in effect, required to make a public statement--through a testimony, a speech, or one way or another--that Fed policy has changed And I don't want to get into a situation in which you have to do that every two months or every two weeks   Okay; then, many of these things here would not be policy changes   That's part of it Regardless of what you use as your indicators or your proxies, I think that one way or another we have to try to project an underlying forward looking consistency in policy that ultimately overrides all this noise Again, as I said before, I think part of the problem is that each of us, in our own way, looks through the noise anyway Obviously, our judgments about the noise are conditioned by what we see and feel about the economy, inflation and the stuff that really matters And it's not easy to capture that in the directive either   Do it in December   Sure   Right   I lost the tail end of your remarks, Ted You cited a rule of thumb--and I think you said 10 percent--   Goods output in the context you are using it here--that's something I could roughly associate with industrial production as well?   No   I don't have much to add Our forecast is virtually identical to the staff's forecast I think that the amount of room on the upside is just about zero In other words, any acceleration of growth from these forecasts carries with it rapidly escalating risks that the inflation problem will begin to show through again The problem with inflation is that if it starts to show through, it could build quite rapidly On the other hand, if GNP growth were even a percentage point or so slower than forecasted for a quarter or two, especially if that slower growth were in domestic demand, I have to say that it isn't going to hurt my feelings terribly As I said earlier, I do view the exchange rate situation with some renewed anxiety It's not that I care about one exchange rate versus another, but right now I see clear risks on the downside with very little to be gained To me, it's a question of risks versus rewards and I don't see much there on the reward side at all  I also have a lot of sympathy with the point that Tom Melzer made about the return of the wild, wild West to the financial scene I, too, find it frankly astonishing that some of the things have reappeared as fast as they have, coming off the events of October I don't know what we do about that I guess the answer probably is, nothing But it clearly does bring with it some long-term problems of a potentially serious nature Hopefully, we won't have a recession in the foreseeable future, but we will at some point I don't know if it  -50-    3/29/88  will be 1999 or 1989, but there will be a recession And when that recession comes, the potential consequences of it--in a context in which the system is progressively more and more leveraged and basic tenets of financial discipline don't seem able to stick--are very, very distressing I don't think there is anything we can do about that at the moment, but it is a big concern   Do what?   Well, my instincts probably are the same, but I think that for financial market reasons, if nothing else, I'd be willing to sneak up on it To me, that would mean do the $100 million now with asymmetric language, although I could live with an arrangement in which you and Peter have some flexibility in terms of edging that $100 million in But, certainly, I feel very strongly that we should get that first $100 million in promptly I think that the two changes in policy that have been made in the last several weeks or so clearly have been viewed favorably by the markets as an indication that we are indeed prepared to respond to these conditions But I agree with Bob Parry that, insofar as the economy is concerned, I doubt that they've done much of anything I think that Don Kohn made that point in a way, earlier on, when he pointed out that nominal and real interest rates--even after those moves--are precious little different from what they were a year ago And in the intervening year, the economy has grown at a rate that simply won't work prospectively I also have a nagging fear here--I don't know what the staff's views on this are--that because of these highly mobile money and capital markets on a worldwide basis, that it may take a higher level of interest rates to achieve a given degree of restraint in the real world And if that were the case, our problems that lie ahead, especially in the context of Governor Seger's comments about thrifts and a lot of other things, would be all the more difficult and all the more damaging It is precisely for that reason that I feel so strongly that moving now is the right thing to do I agree with comments made by Governor Johnson, I think before the coffee break, and by Lee Hoskins a few minutes ago that we've got to avoid fine tuning here; the broad thrust of developments over the next six or seven quarters is what we have to keep in mind And that, too, says to me that we ought to move now I also agree with Governor Johnson on the discount rate question In the situation that we have right now--where we're on the upside of the cycle and where we don't have to worry about frictional levels of borrowings--I don't see that there is the same kind of prejudice for a discount rate [increase] that there was on the downside, where we run into that frictional borrowings problem So, I don't see that there is any presumption whatsoever, at least in my judgment, that if we moved--perhaps even as far as a full- blown "C"--that that would create a strong bias toward having to move    5/17/88  the discount rate Indeed, at the phase of things that we're in, like Governor Johnson, I personally--not that I have a final say on the discount rate--would try to keep our powder dry on the discount rate and work through the market as much as possible I think that does two things One, it minimizes the dangers of market disruptions; and secondly, it leaves us in a stronger position if something really adverse develops in the next month or two, or whatever To summarize, Mr Chairman, I would do the $100 million now, with an asymmetric directive That's it   I have trouble with it   I would have the first sentence say the Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserves   I understand that, but you asked me what I would prefer That's what I prefer   You don't know what May is yet   Well, I probably have more sympathy for this, at this point, than I did the last time we talked but--   [Unintelligible] a storm going on here because my thinking is probably conditioned by my worries that we  -25-    5/17/88  could be making a horrible mistake in monetary policy here I do have trouble, as I said before, with the base on a kind of intellectual level A number of comments have been made on technical issues But leaving those somewhat technical issues aside, I think what Tom is suggesting here is that there ought to be something--whether or not it has to be precisely this--something that makes us say "Hey, wait a minute" in a very, very deliberate, aggressive, forceful way And that's what I have more and more sympathy with, even though I must confess I can't really warm up to this particular proposal, for somewhat technical reasons There are two systematic periods, using the numbers that Tom has picked, in which this thing went astray One was in the early 1980s, and the other one, which Governor Angell was just talking about, was in 1986 Now, as Frank Morris pointed out, the Committee was aware that everything, including the base, was in the one case growing very slowly, and in the other case, growing very rapidly But the Committee made a conscious decision--not focusing on the base itself, but on other things that in some sense are symptomatic of the base--to ignore those Why did they make that decision? I think the answer is, in a sense, quite simple In the early 1980s, despite the fact that we were in what turns out to have been a hell of a recession, we also still had very high inflation rates In other words, the adjustment in the inflation process, while underway, was by no means finished and by no means locked in There was still some concern that the inflationary momentum of the late 1970s, 1980 and 1981, was still a demon that didn't have to just be wounded, but had to be stomped out And so there was, I think, a conscious decision to be tolerant of those shortfalls The same was more or less true in 1986, in that the very rapid growth in the base and the other aggregates was in some sense tolerated because, among other things, the inflation rate, while certainly not zero, was low, partly for oil price reasons, and certainly not rising And that leads me to the view that if a procedure like this were to have some functional utility, that utility might arise in a context in which there was some kind of a relationship between it and what, in fact, was going on with regard to inflation Now, I don't want to get into the rules game, either way But it's clearly one thing if the monetary base, or some other monetary measure, is outside of some range and the inflation rate is high and/or rising, as opposed to a situation where it's outside and the inflation rate is low and/or falling At least in my mind's eye, if something like this were to have some utility in a policy framework, either implicitly or otherwise, somehow or other you would need to take it one step further   I will move it   Just a further comment From my own perspective, in this period of the last week or 10 days or so--leaving aside any particular exchange rate question--I regret that we have not taken greater opportunity in these circumstances to accumulate balances in yen or marks or both If you take a long view, it's awfully hard to see that the fundamentals have changed in any material way The trade deficit is still there; the current account deficit is still there We still are going to have to finance, over the next 4 years or 5 years, cumulative current account deficits of $400 or $500 billion And to the extent there are risks over time, I think they still lie elsewhere I personally regret that we have not taken the opportunity--even if we choose not to use them--to accumulate some balances in this period   Second   Mr Chairman, in terms of the kind of anecdotal and impressionistic points of view that reach us, I would say they are essentially unchanged in that the main thrust of what we hear is still decidedly upbeat and [unintelligible] in terms of orders, especially in the manufacturing sector We took an informal survey just in the past 2 weeks of about 8 or 10 very major companies on a particular point of capital goods imports and substitution of domestic sources for capital goods imports And while the results of that survey were not decisive, they certainly were suggestive of the fact that there is now some evidence that even in the capital goods sector there is some substitution going on in terms of domestic versus foreign sources, although that's mainly in components There clearly are important instahces of, say, heavy machinery, in which foreign sources are for all practical purposes the only source Nevertheless, at the margin, there are some signs of a better [unintelligible], especially in components, in the capital goods sector The two other things that are a bit different impressionistically--and this is a bit surprising--are that some of the commentary coming out of upstate New York, even the Buffalo area, is more upbeat than it has been, and that there's a bit more commentary here and there about labor market tightness and scattered signs of pressures on wages  But insofar as the forecasts themselves are concerned, I think that one thing is pretty clear--they have to be approached with some humility If you go back 6 months ago, for example, and look at what has happened, compared with what was being talked about, then that humility is well earned in the sense that the performance over the first half of the year--regardless of exactly where the second quarter comes out--clearly is going to have been a great deal stronger than was widely expected at the turn of the year I still remember your own comment at the time, Mr Chairman, when you said [of the  -14-    6/29-30/88  forecast] that it might be an interesting thought but something was going to be wrong with it What was wrong with it, of course, was that the economy was stronger rather than weaker So, I think we have to take any forecast as kind of a broad-brush profile of what might emerge rather than with a great deal of precision  Again, the question is Where are the risks and what are the consequences of the risks in those forecasts? As I look at it in that light, I think the risks are decidedly asymmetric on the side of an upward drift, or worse, in the inflation rate over the next 6 quarters, given current policy Without making a big deal out of this, if you look, for example, at the New York staff's forecast, unlike the Board staff's forecast, it essentially assumes current interest rates over the period as a whole Our staff forecast shows a real growth rate over the next 6 quarters in a range of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent But--and this is a very big "but"--that result emerges in a context in which the New York staff's forecast has a smaller gain in net exports and has inventories declining in every quarter of the forecast period   Yes Hence, the implied growth in final domestic demand in our forecast is, in fact, a good deal stronger than the Board staff's forecast Not surprisingly in that setting, the inflation numbers that fall out of our forecast are significantly different in that we end up with a fixed-weight deflator in the 5 percent plus range and a CPI in the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent range Again, I take those numbers with a grain of salt, but what I do not take with a grain of salt is that if the inflation rate, however measured, were to get in the area of 5 percent or more, just getting it back to 4 percent--much less price stability, whatever that means--is going to involve enormous costs to the economy So, I think that is where the greatest risk lies  I ask myself the question Well, how do those risks translate in terms of where we are now? And, particularly, what weight should be given to the changes that have already been made in policy insofar as that broad sweep of an outlook is concerned? I certainly agree with the thrust of the staff's Greenbook and Bluebook commentary to the effect that domestic demand growth is going to have to be further curbed over this period I myself am not sure how much weight to give to the rise in interest rates that we've seen over the last couple of months, because in fact, that rise is rather modest, I think Indeed, if you look at real interest rates in Ted's chart 8 in the book yesterday--or in any other formulation of real short-term or long-term interest rates--I think you can make a case that not a whole lot has changed Certainly, the level of real interest rates now is not wildly different than it has been for the last 3 years So there is a question in my mind as to how much difference the current policy posture makes versus where we were, say, 8 or 10 weeks ago  The bottom line as I see it, is that if--for policy reasons, or faith, or whatever--it turns out that growth is somewhat weaker for a quarter or two or three, I certainly don't view that as the end of the world In fact, I think it's not altogether bad It works in the direction of prolonging the expansion in general and it actually helps the external adjustment process On the other hand, if inflation  -15-    6/29-30/88  crosses whatever threshold one chooses to worry about--I pick the 5 percent threshold--I think the costs of that are going to be very, very great indeed And that's how I essentially come to the conclusion that the risks, at least in my judgment, are decidedly asymmetric   Well, I guess I'd make two points First, I think that if you take all wage and related data as a whole, you can make a case that there may be a bit of an upward tilt already evident there   As I said, I was going to make two comments One is that I do think you could make a case that there is a bit of an upward tilt already there in the wage data taken as a whole In terms of the anecdotal stuff, again it's quite common for businessmen, small and large, these days to talk about the difficulties they're having in terms of attracting and retaining good quality workers at all levels You hear comments, for example, that they have had to selectively bid up starting salaries And at least in New York State, both upstate and downstate, for example, we have had in the recent past a couple of very, very large wage settlements in the public sector This is the type of thing, school teachers and the like, which in a macroeconomic sense is literally a pimple But they are very, very high profile and high visibility types of things So again, I think Si is right when he says that it's something that is in the air; but I think it's here, at least a little, in the numbers, too   Reaffirm the '88 ranges; alternative III for '89   I think that's right   If you took the case that Governor Johnson cited, where something happened between now and February such that you had lower rather than higher interest rates, in those circumstances, I'd have no trouble at all myself with changing the targets in February  -43-    6/29-30/88   In listening to the conversation, I must confess that I was a little struck with the comments that Wayne Angell, Bob Heller, Frank Morris, Manley Johnson, and Martha Seger were making about the year-forward targets, as we are required under the law to stipulate in July The thought that I mentioned to the Chairman was that, in connection with his testimony, he would obviously state that the Committee established the 1989 targets as they were just voted He would then go through his usual song and dance about uncertainties, but he would take that song and dance one step further and specifically say that, indeed, the Committee was impressed with how much these uncertainties have increased, if anything, over time Consistent with that, in the future the Committee may well show a strong tendency in July to merely restate the current year's targets for the following year That would not necessarily always be the case, but there would be a strong tendency in that direction, simply as a further manifestation of the uncertainties that arise in trying to state the targets that far in advance  SPEAKER(?) Very good   Well, that's the end of that  -54-    6/29-30/88   Since I'd be between "B" and "C" anyway, I'm quite comfortable with the formulation that you put on the table, Mr Chairman   Well, I feel sorry for that ball!   Backing up just a bit, my own assessment of the economic data that have become available since the last FOMC meeting is that--even with all the twists and turns that can be put on them--on balance, they are stronger than I think was being implicitly contemplated at the time And I also viewed with some concern the PPI numbers, even though I think the Chairman's comments about the dynamics of what's going at the PPI level are probably quite accurate at this point in time Now on the basis of the economic information, taken at face value, I think that the case for a further    7/19/88  increase in the borrowings level at this time is absolutely compelling But I do recognize that the fly in the ointment at the moment is the dollar Left to my own druthers, I might say ignore the dollar and go ahead and increase the borrowings anyway But that is a bit of a high risk strategy, at least in the context of, say, the next week or two  Now, insofar as the dollar is concerned, I remain of the view that, over time, the greater probability is a dollar that is weak rather than a dollar that is strong And I think that in the current setting we do have some elements of a speculative move here, as Sam Cross has said Certainly, there is a widespread view, reflected in the newspapers and conversations and so on, that a rising dollar is incompatible with the international adjustment process that still lies ahead So, I wouldn't be surprised to see the dollar cool off, as it may be doing a bit now But if we're going to condition the near-term tactics of monetary policy on the dollar, I for one would be willing to be--and indeed would urge that we be--a little more forthcoming in terms of what we do and what we say about the dollar in an effort to try to get over this hump as quickly as possible; because with or without a strong dollar, I think that a greater degree of monetary restraint is needed Indeed, as I said, I think it's needed rather badly I could live with leaving borrowings where they are for another week or two in the hopes that the dollar situation would rectify itself with a continuing nudge from us and others But even in that context, I would hope, if that were the view of the Committee, that we would have a decided tilt to day-to-day operations so as not to permit backsliding in the funds rate that would end up giving, I think, potentially very misleading signals to the markets--and, indeed, to the exchange markets--as to where we are And the chances of getting the dollar to cool off if the market thinks that we're letting interest rates come down are very slim indeed It's fundamentally incompatible with what we're trying to do on both scores So, I think we have to be very, very careful about that   The problem with that is we haven't really done all that much If you look at nominal or real interest rates, and if you look at what's going on in the economy, I'm just not persuaded that we've done all that much at all   I agree with that completely, Mr Chairman  [Secretary's note The transcript ends at this point and does not include Mr Truman's report on the Mexican swap proposal and the ensuing Committee discussion, if any Subsequent to this conference call, on July 27, Chairman Greenspan sent a memorandum to FOMC members recommending action with respect to a Bank of Mexico request for a drawing on its swap line with the System That memorandum is appended]       Second   Could I, Mr Chairman, just make a comment rather than raise a question? Sam Cross mentioned in the course of his remarks that he thought that intervention on the part of the major central banks in this intermeeting period had helped curtail, if you will, the rise of the dollar I think that's a fair statement I want to actually make a more general, albeit a brief statement, about intervention because I think it has gotten a bit of a bad name It's not that I have any illusions about the ability of intervention to be decisive in terms of the position of a currency either short term or long term--but I do think there is a characteristic of the foreign exchange market, at least as I see it, that we have to keep in mind And the characteristic is the equivalent of these very sophisticated and very aggressive forms of program trading in the foreign exchange markets whereby individual institutions and individual traders take very, very large positions And they're willing to push those positions to the very limit One of the things that those trading strategies do is reinforce, in my judgment, the tendency toward one-way markets--in a context in which the perception is that you can make a quick buck by pushing that as far as possible And as long as those trading strategies are as dominant as I think they are, the dangers that can be associated with one-way markets become all the greater, and the tendencies for the exchange market to overshoot all the greater  My point in those circumstances is this I think that intervention does play a useful role in reaffirming the fact that there are two-way markets And I think that in and of itself is of value even if one can not argue persuasively that a particular exchange rate could or should emerge from the process But I do think that the presence of the central banks does create something of a conviction toward two-way markets If there's any doubt about that, all you have to do is talk to traders They will say that they tend to be much more cautious when they feel that the central banks may be on the scene So, I do think that these trading strategies--and the way at least I think they manifest themselves in the market--provide to me a fairly convincing case that there is merit or wisdom in the central banks showing their hand from time-to-time in the market even if one is agnostic about the effects in terms of a particular exchange rate at a particular point in time    8/16/88   I think the character of the market has changed in the last several years All you have to do, in one sense, is just look at the sheer volume of transactions If you use CHIPS transactions as a proxy--an imperfect proxy, but one which still is a pretty good way to do it because our survey suggests that something like 90 percent of the CHIPS traffic is foreign exchange transactions--they're up And if you look at what has happened in the development of the derivative markets in foreign exchange, perhaps especially the options [market], it's very clear that the sheer size of the market and the amount of turnover has grown enormously Look at the profits that all the major banks and investment banks are generating quarterly from foreign exchange trading I still can't fully understand that myself But every single quarter, with an exception here or there, all of these major firms are generating very sizable profits from foreign exchange trading If you look at some of the individual trading strategies, at least in some cases, they are a very elaborate form of program trading applied in a different area  I think all of those things taken together do constitute a change--admittedly over time--but a change in the character, the structure, the fabric of the market And I wouldn't argue with any conviction that the totality of those things is decisive, in any sense of the word, in producing these tendencies to overshoot that we see in the markets But I do think that they can be tempered a bit Indeed, as I said, the foreign exchange traders say they behave differently when they sense the central banks are on the scene Again, I'm not trying to make an argument that necessarily would dispute any of these earlier reports--finding point estimates and being able to say that this pattern of central bank intervention produced this result I'm agnostic myself about that   It should be   We've got a lot of that   Well, in some ways, Mike Prell gave my report I think I agree very much with how Mike characterized the economy Getting to the anecdotal stuff, I really haven't much to add There is more talk about scarcities in the labor market, even in terms of part-time jobs and things like that In terms of anecdotes, I think we'll get a better fix on things in early September I think most of these major companies come back after Labor Day and sit down    8/16/88  and really begin the process of thinking in earnest about 1989 and so on I think that some of the feedback that should begin to flow out of that will probably give us a better and fresher picture of what the situation is But at least for now, virtually every comment I hear is very much on the bullish side  In the context of the outlook and the forecast, I have just a couple of comments Looking at the external side of the Board staff forecast and, for what it's worth, the New York Fed staff forecast, both have real net exports in GNP terms in the fourth quarter of 1989 below -$50 billion And I think that is quite a remarkable result in one sense But I think it belies something else that gets kind of lost in the dust here--and that is, that both also have for the year 1989 a current account deficit that's still $125 billion And those current account deficits are going to have to be financed I mention that because, while there's a certain element of euphoria in markets and elsewhere about adjustments taking place, the fact of the matter is that in financial terms, as measured by the current account, we still have very, very large external imbalances And for that matter, the budget deficit is still sitting there stuck somewhere around $150 billion So, I don't see that a lot has been achieved in terms of significant progress on both the internal and external financial imbalances that are the root cause of many of our problems  On the inflation side, I guess my biggest concern by far at this point, Mr Chairman, is that I think there is at least a 50/50 chance that the inflation genie is already out of the bottle I don't take any forecast very seriously, but if we look, for example, at our own forecast--which by the way has a very modest increase in interest rates with orders of magnitudes about half of what Mike is talking about--it has a GNP deflator toward the middle and the end of next year at rates of increase of 4-1/2 percent and higher It has a fixed-weight deflator of 5 percent and higher; it has a CPI of 5-1/2 percent and higher; it has compensation per man-hour at 5 to 5-1/4 percent and higher By each one of those measures, the acceleration in the rate of inflation is somewhere in the area of 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points over what has been the experience for the past several years  That to me is very problematic in its own right But what is particularly problematic is that it just doesn't take much at all for those price forecasts to end up a threshhold level higher In other words, instead of pushing and penetrating 5 percent on some measures you could easily get results that break through the 6 percent level It takes very little to go wrong, at least in the context of our price numbers, to produce that result  As I said, our forecast differs from the staff only in the sense that I think the interest rate assumptions or, if you will, the policy assumptions may be somewhat different But when I look at the situation in that light, it does produce that fear on my part that we may already have an accelerating inflation problem on our hands that is going to be very costly to deal with   Like some others, there is at least a crisp debate in my own mind as to whether you could make a case that we should proceed promptly with a further move in the direction of tightening But I am persuaded that the interest of orderly procedure, if nothing else, suggests that there is something to be  -45-    8/16/88  said for what I will call a short period of gestation here So in that setting, I would support the formulation that you suggested Mr Chairman  I don't want to muddy the waters, but I would myself at least prefer the form of asymmetry that eliminates any reference to lesser reserve restraint whatsoever in the directive I am absolutely convinced at this juncture that we are going to have to firm up policy further and I think the sooner we get on with that test the better That's because, fundamentally, I agree with much of what Frank Morris says I am afraid that even as we speak the inflation problem may be on top of us And I agree with much of what John LaWare said about the financial risks But the other side of that is that the one thing we know will get us those killer interest rates is a killer inflation rate So I am very sensitive to those financial risks, but I'm also, as I say, very sympathetic with what Frank said   I'll just say for the record--I'm not going to make a fuss about it--I would prefer that it stayed fourth in line, but--   You caught it; I figured that   Second   Move it   Mr Chairman, our forecast at the Bank is one that I think is close to the other side of Mike's coin We do not have a significant increase in interest rates built into our forecast; we have a bit of an upward drift But for that reason and for others, it's a forecast that ends up, on balance, with a phenomenal GNP growth rate--a percentage point and a half or so above what's in the Greenbook And because of where we are relative to potential, a good part of that excess shows through in terms of higher inflation Indeed, by the end of the forecast period, our forecast would have a very significantly higher inflation rate than what's in the Greenbook  That is not a testimony to any one forecast, but I think it's very vivid testimony to how much of a razor's edge we are on, in terms of what does or does not happen in the economy I don't have a great deal of conviction per se about any one forecast, but I must say my instincts continue to be very similar to Bob Parry's I'll just briefly share [some comments] with the Committee, Mr Chairman, partly because this is such a very difficult period to read  In the first two weeks of September, we talked to a couple of dozen firms to try to get a more systematic anecdotal appreciation of what's going on Now, a systematic approach to anecdotal reports is in no way a survey for purposes of OMB or anybody else   With that in mind, I'd like to touch on just a couple of the highlights The firms that we talked to  -14-    9/20/88  included about a dozen or so very prominent manufacturing firms with headquarters in the Second District, some smaller manufacturing firms, and some very prominent retail firms As of right now, what comes through is that the export sector is literally still booming Export sales were very strong indeed, with increases in volume terms typically well into double digits There was only one case where that was not true, and that particular firm didn't seem very concerned about it because they have a very large backlog of orders--orders that haven't even formally been booked yet for jet engines that are ultimately destined for overseas markets  On the question of the current level of the dollar, none of the firms expressed any concern about the current level Indeed, the impression was that even at current exchange rates, US firms were quite competitive except in apparel and clothing categories There were two small firms that did say that a yen/dollar of 140 was kind of a threshhold for them But generally speaking, there was no concern expressed in terms of current exchange rates and the ability of this strong export performance to continue But perhaps even more interesting is that we see here for the first time, in anecdotal terms, a number of clear cases of capital goods shifting away from foreign suppliers to US suppliers I don't want to suggest that that was the universal pattern, but of the major firms, about an equal number reported that positive shifting was taking place None said it was getting worse, with the exception of one company that was doing more sourcing from Mexico--which in some ways is a good thing, of course In addition, quite apart from capital goods, there were also a number of firms--and we haven't heard this for a long time either-- that were also reporting gains in domestic market shares in general, relative to imports In other words, they are actually now displacing imports in the domestic marketplace Again, the major exception to that is all of the clothing and textile firms--apparel-related things That area is still lousy throughout, both at production and retail levels But in other areas there are some distinct changes In terms of domestic sales performance, with only one or two exceptions, these firms reported current trends I think that were really quite strong, often in double digits  On the output, wage, and capacity side--again, none of this is very scientific and I don't want to put the wrong cast on it But it's really interesting because about half of the big firms--and these are the manufacturers, of course--reported no capacity constraints to speak of or nothing they couldn't cope with Whereas another half reported some problems--and these were typically in the areas that we would expect When it got to the particular question of input problems, in terms of price, delivery delays, etc, again it was about half-and-half About half did report that they were having input problems defined either as rapidly rising prices or delivery lags Those patterns were clear in steel, plastics, computer chips, aluminum, paper, and surprisingly, in some Japanese component parts But the other side of it is that about half of them didn't report particular problems of that nature  On the labor question--and this is very interesting--the responses broke almost straight down the line based on size The large firms did not report any particular problems in terms of labor shortages; the small firms did The same was more or less true in terms of wages in general The overall impression that I get, not  -15-    9/20/88  just from this but from listening to our directors and others, is that there is some upward movement on the wage side but it's not significant yet That's defined in terms of maybe a 1/2 percentage point type of thing But the conclusion that I draw from all this impressionistic data is consistent or compatible at least with my own thoughts and instincts--that the risks are rather asymmetric in the direction of greater pressures on domestic output and resources, at least over the near term On the other hand, it may also be consistent with the view that while the inflation genie isn't perhaps out of the bottle, it's by no means clear that the cork is firmly in place   I think you can tranship them to Dallas   I, too, agree with the prescription you've put on the table I guess I would be more in the Bob Parry camp in terms of what I think the likely pressure points are going to be in the intermeeting period If I could, I'd just like to add a quick comment on the point Governor Kelley and Governor Heller made about the dangers of a recession-induced rise in the budget deficit in the intermediate term That really is pretty ugly in terms of a setting, not just for monetary policy, but more generally But I think that of the things that could produce that result, one of them clearly is a rise in the inflation rate in the shorter term If added inflationary pressure does begin to show through more than it has to date, to be certain that is a recession in the making So if we're really concerned about a recession-induced rise in the budget deficit, that's just double reason why we should be especially sensitive about any further upward movement in the inflation rate   Play your cards right, you can set an all-time record here   Frank Morris would know Can you judge in terms of the time, Frank? I can't remember any better than quarter of 12   Mr Chairman, I'd like to pick up on that point that Mike Bradfield just made, because there are always questions in these things, and there are always uncertainties But it seems to me that the case for the United States--the Treasury and the Federal Reserve--is that this is a powerful way to support Mexico at this point That's just beyond question I certainly would enthusiastically support the thrust of your comment recommending the terms of this program It's very, very important at this juncture There are always questions or uncertainties on these things, but most things get worked out   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   I think of the issue as quasi- housekeeping but with some substance The point I raised, of course, was that under current arrangements the four rotating Reserve Bank presidents on the Committee who are responsible for the vote to establish the targets for each calendar year at the February meeting rotate off the Committee a couple of weeks later It seemed to me that as a matter of good procedure there was something to be said for changing those dates so that the four rotating Reserve Bank presidents who vote for the annual targets remain on the Committee throughout the calendar year [to which those targets apply] The Committee's General Counsel [Mr Bradfield] has advised that he thinks that such a change can be made within the framework of the statute, and it seems to me, Mr Chairman, that simply as a quasi-housekeeping matter--or to put it differently, a matter of good procedure--that there is some logic to trying to structure things to have that consistency over the calendar year and with the establishment of the annual targets   Well, that is the argument   There is a way you can do that, of course, and that is make it effective a year from now and just mention it almost in passing in your testimony in February that beginning next year we're going to have this procedural change I don't think it matters all that much in terms of--   Sure   Right   Well, it seems to me that this approach, in contrast to what I will call a naive monetarist model, does say something that is both very intuitive and very important What it says is that some given M2 target has different inflationary implications depending upon the amount of slack in the economy, and that is both important and intuitive What's good about this is that it does confirm that intuitive notion in a fairly robust way, to use your term In that sense, it has a great deal of appeal, and it also says something I think rather compelling about what's wrong with the naive monetarist perception of things Now having said that, I guess my judgment as to its utility in a policy context is somewhere along the following lines I would not be willing to go so far as to adopt what I think you're calling a rigid M2 targeting approach simply on the basis of what we see here On the other hand, I do think that it can be useful to the Committee internally in terms of trying to frame our thinking more systematically as to what might constitute reasonable targets over time In that sense, it has some real utility because I'm not ready to jump on the M2 bandwagon to the exclusion of everything else, which will come as no surprise to you   It works   Well, it's not so much necessarily that they expect a change after November 8th   But I do think that there has been a large gut feeling in the market for months that authorities would go to rather extraordinary lengths to prevent the dollar from falling on its face   But also there are comments you get from [unintelligible] that suggest that at least in the market there has been a somewhat marked shift in diversifying assets without [unintelligible] at this point   It's precisely for those reasons that you've got a mess in these circumstances and huge balances out there that have got to be financed [Unintelligible]   Second   So moved   Let me respond to that, Manley   I think, first of all, the two things shouldn't be written together To some extent, the flexible limit of 50 is a straight-forward business decision in terms of how many people the Desk can with some efficiency do business with There's simply no need from a straight-forward business point of view for a group even as large as 50 So, to some extent the 50, flexible 50 if you will, is dictated on straight-forward business grounds rather than any other grounds   Now, the problem is that you will have situations, I think, in which unless you had some notion of some kind of a cap where there is no conceivable set of criteria that wouldn't end up looking overtly discriminatory toward somebody I don't see how you can get from here to there And this point on geographic concentration is not new We have articulated that in various [unintelligible] or another some time ago And what we're really trying to say, at least what I'm trying to say, is that we have a situation right now where in round numbers 15 percent of the market is in effect controlled by foreign firms I have no problem with that In other words, I do think that there is a special point--I don't know where it is and I hope we never get to the point where we have to worry seriously about it--but I think there is a threshold point in the market for US government securities within which one would have problems in substance  And I think that all we're trying to do is to send a signal that says conditions could arise in which we might well conclude that enough is enough As I just said, I don't think we're anywhere near that, but having that principle established is I think a very cautious approach But it's one that we should do because again I can't think of a series of criteria that could be administered even-handedly that could in and of themselves guarantee that that condition might not arise in the future   You still have to worry about acquisitions, though   So move   In terms of the national economy, our guesstimate for the next five quarters really is not materially different from the outlook contained in the Greenbook, although there are some differences in individual sectors The big difference that we continue to have is on the inflation side in that by the end of 1989 our inflation forecast is about 1-1/4 points higher than the Greenbook forecast Now, analytically there are two factors that account for that One is that we have a higher oil price--we have an effective oil price of $15 whereas I think Mike has $13 for the year as a whole And that's about 4/10ths of a percent in our arithmetic; I don't know what it would be in yours But the big, big difference is in the fact that we have the unemployment rate drifting down and you've got it drifting up From where we are, in terms of labor markets, the difference in the algebraic sign makes quite a difference Indeed, if you look through the numbers, by the end of next year with essentially the same productivity numbers we end up with compensation rates and inflation rates that are in underlying terms 8 to 9/10ths of a percent faster than what is in the Greenbook I don't know what to make of that Our year-end unemployment rate is 51 percent; the [Greenbook] staff's is 56 percent One would like to think that a half point couldn't make that much difference, but I think it's quite conceivable that it could Indeed, I think I could even make a case that it could be worse than that  In terms of the question you raised earlier, Mr Chairman, about why hasn't more shown through on the wage side given where we are right now, we were looking at some numbers that really fascinated me yesterday I'm sure, Mike, that you look at these I've just never seen them before But the breakdown it shows for the collective bargaining agreements was--for example, in 1988 if I remember these numbers correctly--that for still 40 percent of individuals covered by agreements reached in 1988, the agreement provided for some kind of a lump sum payment in lieu of, or partially in lieu of, a wage increase And even more astonishingly, 20 percent of the population in 1988 still had no wage increase, but a wage reduction In both cases--if my memory is correct on the numbers, but I think it's close enough-- those numbers of 40 percent and 20 percent respectively are down significantly from where they were in 1984, 1985, and 1986 But I found it surprising they were still as large as they are And I think that in a symbolic way that is part of the answer to your question as to why we don't see more pressure than we've already seen on the wage side Now, how much further that kind of thing could work in our system, I don't know I personally think that the point Frank Morris made about foreign competition is a very big part of it And maybe we'll get lucky in 1989 as well But I would agree with Frank that any way I would cut it that the risks are distinctly on the side of an inflation outcome that is somewhere north of the numbers that are in the Greenbook  -40-    11/1/88  As far as the economy itself is concerned, again the anecdotal comments that we're picking up from directors and others are broadly consistent with the commentary around the table--that things have slowed down a bit from the almost breakneck pace of the late spring and summer But the economy nevertheless is still being characterized as very solid looking into the future I think we are still getting anecdotal comments to the effect that export performance outlook still looks good, although I must say in looking at the economic forecast the one place where I still am a little bit nervous on the downside is in terms of net exports We've got a slower improvement which is understandable, but I don't think that's by any means baked in the cake But all in all, I think that we're pretty lucky in one sense to be where we are And, Mr Boehne, I think that one can look at all of this and easily envision things that could have been a lot, lot more difficult   I support your recommendation   Is the microphone covered up?   Second   So moved   So moved   Well, I hesitate to put this in these terms, Wayne, but every time I listen to this discussion I think it does to come down to how many angels can we put on the head of a pin   But it is a little more complicated than that Bob Heller, taking your point regarding problems in other countries--I just glanced at this paper--my sense of it is that virtually every central bank in a major country in one way or another is having exactly the same kind of discussions we are having here, because the fact of the matter is that for a variety of reasons there is no mechanism that is wholly satisfactory from all points of view We see what's happened in other countries in recent years just in terms of disparities and money growth rates versus money targets and so on I think we are all frustrated and searching for the brass ring, and I don't think it's there  Two or so months ago Ed Boehne put this is a useful context If I remember, Ed, you suggested that if we thought of a scale of 1 to 10 and on that 10 was a pure money target or reserve target and 1 was a firm, even more firm perhaps than the 1970's version, federal funds rate target, I think that you were suggesting at the time that you thought we were somewhere around 3 on that scale, and I think that's about right as to where we are Frankly, I too am rather comfortable with that I continue to have very grave reservations about going from 3 to 2 to 1 on that scale And I say that from several points of view There has been some discussion here about the inertia factor; it is simply the inability of this Committee or any committee to move the interest rate target enough I think there's more to it than that because I at least think there are some major league questions in the economics of the relationship between an interest rate target and money target and other things And again, I think Gary made a good point; there's a tendency to think, gee, we'll try that and all our problems are going to go away; quite the contrary, they won't We will have a whole new bushel basket full of problems And I guess it's partly in that spirit [that we find ourselves] today  Going back to Ed Boehne's comments, I actually think that this procedure has worked pretty darn well I think it was Governor Johnson who made the point that if anything we probably have gotten a bit more flexible, maybe a lot more flexible, and that's all right with me, too But the great advantage over and above those that have been cited by Governor Angell, and Ed, and Gary and others about the current procedures is that it has a valuable form of give to it; it breathes; it's not rigid I think that that character of it is awfully good from a market point of view, and I think it's awfully good from our point of view I think that in some ways that is what distinguishes it from the extreme form of a federal funds rate target It's the extreme form only that involves the question of inertia, but I think it inevitably can put you on a slippery slope into a regime of fine tuning that I would find very, very difficult to support So, I kind of like what we are doing and I think we've got to be flexible  -14-    12/13-14/88  when we need to be I think there is a demonstrated capacity for that flexibility to be brought to bear either with small things, where Peter and Don and Chairman Greenspan do it, or for big things done through the Committee But I sure wouldn't want to change it very much   That is kind of what happened, of course, if you look at it over a sweep of 30 years   It's not just the econometrics; the economics worry me   I'll just take the other side of that for a minute If you look out at 1990, I think the 'Catch-22' can be even sharper in the following sense It is not at all difficult to stipulate a set of conditions involving a stable exchange rate at current levels, rather than a modest decline and a combination of relative US and foreign economic growth That would yield a situation in which the external adjustment not only stops, but it reverses by the end of 1990 I don't necessarily believe that, but if you went through a conventional exercise using conventional, and historical, estimates of the various elasticities, and so on, it's not implausible   It's not at all implausible to end up with a result in which, as I said, by the second half of 1990 you have the current account and the trade account deficits actually increasing I have a great deal of difficulty accepting that view for a variety of reasons, but if you really want a Catch-22 to contemplate, that's it   I'm a little skeptical that the kind of historic relationships--which we implicitly assume--are going to be valid for 1989 and 1990 And as a result, I look upon that type of scenario with a lot of skepticism But the fact remains that there are a lot of serious people who look at it as a quite realistic possibility  -24-    12/13-14/88   It gets pretty ugly   If they are right   I'll put it in its most graphic terms If Marty Feldstein is right, what would ultimately happen under those circumstances is that even with relatively high [interest rates, there] would be a major and possibly highly disruptive fall out of bed of the exchange rates   That I imagine   Partly because our meeting cycles are a little out of synch, I don't have a lot to add on the anecdotal side at this point My own general impressions in terms of the economy are that it is strong In fact, I think it's too strong Some of the very recent numbers, especially the labor market numbers,  -45-    12/13-14/88  conjure up at least in my mind some of my worst fears as a matter of fact Insofar as the outlook is concerned, I think it is very illustrative to look at the Board staff's forecast versus the New York staff's forecast because as I've mentioned before by the end of next year those respective forecasts have a difference in the inflation rate of 13 percentage points or 14 percentage points That is a very, very dramatic difference As usual, Mike Prell touched on a critical point concerning that result, or outcome, yesterday when he said that in the process of putting his own forecast together he was continuing to resist the temptation to build into his own price forecast some of the types of behavior or results that might come out of historical experience And indeed when you look at the New York staff's forecast versus the Board staff's forecast what you have in the Board staff's forecast by the end of next year is a rather distinct negative spread between unit labor costs and the deflator In the case of the New York forecast, you have a positive spread between unit labor costs and the deflator At least in an arithmetic way, that is what produces the sharp difference in the net result of inflation at the end of the period Both have a rather significant further buildup in the rate of increase in compensation per annum I think in the eyes of the people that do these forecasts in New York, what they essentially or implicitly are saying is that the overall economic conditions, market conditions, and so on are such that you will still maintain at least a small, positive spread between those two variables My own hunch, if I had to pick a point, which I try to avoid doing, I guess I'd pick a point somewhere between the staff forecast here and the staff forecast in New York But as I see it, the risks, as I have said before, are really very asymmetric When I ask myself, what if Mike is right--Mike being collective for the Board staff--I'd say that's pretty good; it's not ideal in that he's got some things in that forecast that give you a little chill, but certainly I'd say "terrific" Then I say to myself, what if the New York staff is right? I'd say, holy mackerel, we've really got trouble, big trouble It's in that sense that I think the risks really are quite asymmetric  Now, like a lot of other people, at this juncture I continue to draw some consolation as we were talking yesterday from what things like the long bond rate are telling us Again, that's probably one of the reasons why I would be inclined to split the difference between those two forecasts But I would tend to be pretty cautious even about that I reminded myself last night, and I think this is illustrated in one of these charts that I guess Don is going to talk about later, if you go back to 1978 and despite the fact that there had been several increases in the discount rate as well as a firming of monetary policy over the course of 1978, by the end of the year we had a federal funds rate in the area of 9-1/2 to 10 percent; one-year Treasury notes at 1060 percent; and the 30-year bond at 880 percent because we had a sharply inverted yield curve We all know what happened after that Now, 1988 is not 1978 for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the energy shock that came in 1979 But at least to me it does illustrate that we have to be cautious in terms of what we read into these things And again, it just reinforces my view that the risks as I see them at the moment are asymmetric on the side of the inflation rate being higher than the staff forecast   In terms of the Bluebook alternatives I would favor alternative "C," but I certainly would not wildly object to the approach you suggested, Mr Chairman, which essentially involves sneaking up a little bit on alternative "C" There is an interesting question that I think we can now call the "gong show," a variety of both strategic and tactical questions here that arise in the context of a discount rate change Indeed, I guess if I step back from everything, which one never has the liberty of doing, and I said to myself that I thought it was unlikely that there would be an increase in interest rates in Europe and I made a variety of other assumptions, I could easily talk myself into the view that the absolutely ideal policy would be the combination of a discount rate increase and, say, $500 million in borrowings That probably would mean that federal funds rates would end up somewhere on the north side of 9 percent rather than the south side of 9 percent Then, I'd bring myself back a little bit from the ideal and start to superimpose on the way things are in terms of the gong show And I guess where I would come out is to do alternative "C," but--and this may surprise some people--I probably would leave the discount rate on the bench for at least a moment or two I worry as does Governor Johnson about the symbolism of getting caught up in what appears to be a worldwide ratcheting up of interest rates especially if there is the appearance that we are in effect getting forced into that posture to stay in lock step with the Germans What I'm not sure about as a practical matter is whether there is a way to avoid that at this point, since the expectation is widespread in the marketplace that they are going to raise their rates in the very near term anyway I don't like that at all And that does influence my thinking in terms of the tactics of the situation The other thing that keeps rolling around in my mind is the question that Bob Parry raised rather directly and I guess I flirted with in my earlier comments Suppose that despite the varying degrees of comfort that we draw from long- term interest rates that we are wrong or the markets are wrong or both? What is the kind of thing that will most graphically signal that to us in the near term? And I think there are two [unintelligible] the inflation statistics themselves start to show through And the second is that, for example, we could get another huge increase in employment in December Now, Gary was talking before about a 200,000 increase; that sounds high to me If anything, I think that employment increases may have to be smaller than that But suppose we get another 350,000 or 400,000 increase in employment right now, which I don't rule out as a possibility That kind of contingency is another reason why I have a slight preference to keep the discount rate in abeyance at this moment But I certainly think that at the very least we should get to something as described in the Bluebook as alternative "C" and I think as you've described it as quickly as possible   I'll move it   So move   So move   My general view of the economy, Mr Chairman, hasn't changed at all from what it has been at recent meetings in that I still think the risks are distinctly asymmetric on the side of too much growth and too much inflation I still don't see any compelling evidence--as a matter of fact I don't see much evidence at all, at least at this moment--of the much needed moderation in the rate of growth in the domestic economy in particular In terms of the outlook for 1989, our forecast is very similar to the Greenbook forecast, even in most of the details, insofar as real GNP growth is concerned Our inflation rate is higher and indeed is a tad outside the central tendency as listed in the charts [Our forecast for] 1990 is a very different story, which I'll come back to in a minute But leaving aside 1990, when I look at the situation right now I guess my anxiety level is up a bit It is up a bit really for two reasons, and they both relate to things that one could say about the economy and so on in public and other forums For example, I got very used to saying, when asked--and I thought I could say it without my nose growing--that the underlying inflation rate was in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range I don't think I can say that anymore without my nose growing When I look at all of the wage and price data, especially  -16-    2/7-8/89  from the fourth quarter, I think we now have to say that the inflation rate is, at best, in the 4-1/2 percent range But certainly you'd have to drop that 4 to 4-1/2 percent out of that statement to have any credibility, much less--at least by my standards--intellectual honesty with yourself Indeed, I think the range of the conpensation-type statistics, again with some emphasis on the fourth quarter, are particularly [alarming] in that regard The other thing that I think we all parroted with some frequency in the recent past is a sense of comfort with respect to the external adjustment process, both in terms of what has happened and what lies out there in the future And this is where 1990 is looming very large in my thinking  I don't consider that there's any such thing as a true forecast for 1990, with all due respect, Mike I think we can all go through some arithmetic; and I think of it more as arithmetic than a forecast But if you look at the arithmetic that was done in New York versus the arithmetic that was done here for 1990 you get a very, very dramatic difference While we have an economy that's growing at a somewhat stronger rate than the Greenbook, we have the trade account and the current account adjustment process not only stopping but reversing the trade deficit actually increases and the current account deficit actually increases Now, in an approximate sense, the arithmetic reasons for that--I emphasize the arithmetic as opposed to the forecasting--are fundamentally due to two things Our foreign growth assumptions are almost identical We do have a relatively small difference in the exchange rate we have the real exchange rate unchanged whereas Ted, I think, has something like an 8 percent real depreciation But that's not what really drives the thing The big difference is that in Ted's and Mike's numbers for 1990 they have a very significant slowdown in the US economy When you look at their numbers versus our numbers, it's not the exchange rate and it's not the foreign growth that really makes the decisive difference in terms of whether that external adjustment process can continue with at least the right algebraic sign in 1990 That to me raises an even larger question, which Tom Melzer touched on a bit when he made reference to policy And the question is With anything roughly resembling the kind of exchange rates that are in either of those sets of arithmetic, can you get material progress over the next several years on an external adjustment process without a significant slowing in the rate of growth of the domestic economy? And if you can't, what does that imply in terms of the risks of a significant accident of one kind or another developing over that time frame? I really think that the horns of that dilemma are getting sharper and sharper, because if you think of it in terms of the exchange rate it's quite clear what it seems to imply But the implications of that implication can be pretty nasty in their own right in terms of domestic interest rates and domestic financial market conditions You can put it in the context of financing requirements; even with Mike's and Ted's combined 1989-90 current account deficits of $240 billion, we end up 1990 with net external liabilities in balance sheet terms of something like 13 percent of GNP Those numbers are getting very, very large So, Mr Chairman, I don't know the way out of this box but when I think out beyond 1989 in the context of the kinds of issues that I just raised I must say that I'm not as optimistic as others about the inflation outlook As I said, my anxiety level is getting pretty high   I would support the original formulation that you put on the table, Mr Chairman, with one caveat In round numbers--and Don you can help me with this--the midpoint of the range for M2 implies an absolute growth of M2 of something like $140 billion Is it something like that?   The caveat gets to this thrift industry issue The great bulk of money that was going to be disintermediated out of the thrifts as a result of the Bush plan was going to be brokered deposits In fact, in the short run almost all of it would be brokered deposits If those deposits are all in M2 because they're all under $100,000 but they all come from Wall Street, I think it's quite likely that a very significant fraction of the money that comes out of the thrifts due to the shrinkage of deposits will not find its way back into depositories, or perhaps even into M2 instruments And I think that somehow or other, Don, we're going to have to try to figure out a way to keep track of that because it does seem to me possible that if you think in terms of the absolute growth of M2 of whatever it is, $140 billion--   Pardon me?  SPEAKER(?) $161 billion   --$161 billion, whatever It's quite possible, as I think about it, that that phenomenon could have a significant effect on the dollar change that's implied here I don't  -38-    2/7-8/89  know quite what that means but if we saw $30 or $40 or $50 billion that's now in M2 through brokered deposits--   Yes   I don't like to be difficult, Wayne, but I think we've got to do something   Yes But, Don, I think we ought to try to figure out some way that we could try to keep track of that because it's conceivable to me that--   It's a big part of the implied M2 growth   Some money deposits are and some aren't   Yes, but it kind of--   That's why this brokered money facet of it, I think, is so important I'm not sure that it's--   A lot of this stuff is not household money It's broken up into $100,000 pieces, but it isn't household money; it's hot money   I didn't mean to discombobulate this discussion, Mr Chairman   I have no problem dropping the M1 reference but I think the last sentence is still important  SPEAKER(?) Yes   Having watched the Chairman on [TV] the other night, I'm quite confident that he'll be able to--   That's an easy one   Well, this is a tough one I think part of this question of Federal Reserve credibility that has been talked about an awful lot here is related, at least as I see it, to  -50-    2/7-8/89  what I'd like to call institutional harmony In the interest of institutional harmony I don't want to rock the boat unduly and I think I can support the spirit of what you've suggested My druthers would be rather distinctly to firm policy right now But as I said, for reasons of institutional harmony, I am prepared to try to support the spirit of what you've said But, for purposes of my conscience if nothing else, let me just elaborate a bit further on my underlying position As I've said in the past, I try to view the process of making policy here as a matter of balancing risks That's the only way you can do it Now, I think it is possible, for example, that the economy could slow down kind of on its own to a path that, even with current policy, would be broadly consistent with Mike's forecast If it did that I think it would signify that we are lucky as well as good, because in my judgment it would take a clear stroke of luck to produce that result--in the sense that I think the risks are on the other side  The second point that I feel I must emphasize is the following there has been a great deal of discussion around this table about price stability and moving toward price stability But as we sit here the algebraic sign on the inflation rate is unambiguous--it's plus It's not neutral, it's not minus, it's plus The inflation rate is going up And Mike's forecast, which is undoubtedly the most rigorous that is available to any of us, is saying that as best they can judge, with current policy the inflation rate is going to go up more That's what the forecast says We can all, and we do, have our differences of judgment about it But that's what it says Now, I have a bit of trouble reconciling the algebraic sign on the current inflation rate as being plus Mike's forecast is on the side of rising inflation I look at the financial variables and my problems get more severe Take the exchange rate It seems to me that if you either want or you have a strong dollar, given where we are right now, then something else has to give at some point, because in my judgment the external position that we have and that we have prospectively is unsustainable If it's not the dollar something else has to give Now what is that other thing going to be? It's going to be the economy Indeed as I said yesterday, taking the long view, I have a real question in my mind as to whether we can make sustainable progress on the external adjustment side given any broadly acceptable pattern of exchange rates without a significant and sustained slowdown in the rate of growth in the economy Now, we don't have to answer that question today; but I think it's out there and it's going to have to be dealt with sooner or later So the exchange rate, at least as I see it, creates quite a conundrum for us right now  Then I turn to the yield curve And I, like everybody else, take an enormous amount of comfort from the yield curve and for what it seems to imply about Fed credibility--both on Wall Street and Main Street, in my judgment, Martha But the crucial question about the yield curve is What does it tell us prospectively? What does it tell us about the future? And I'm just not sure of that I've looked at yield curves over a period of time in the United States and in all the other industrial countries and I'm just not sure But I think the crucial question that arises, whether it's based on experience in the United States or elsewhere, is Are recessions typically inflation induced? In other words, does the responsive pattern of recession that we've seen here and in other countries presage the recession? Are they inflation induced in that it's the rise in the inflation rate  -51-    2/7-8/89  that gives rise to the tightening of monetary policy, etc? And is that what ultimately trips the economy into recession?   That is correct But the crucial question in my judgment--if that is correct which I think it is--is does the yield curve in any reasonably satisfactory way tell us anything about future inflation? And I think the answer is no it doesn't The yield curve either in the United States or elsewhere has not been a reliable indicator of future inflation Indeed, the evidence seems to cut the other way And if it has not been a reliable indicator of future inflation and most recessions are inflation-induced I am not prepared to bet the mortgage on the signals that the yield curve are giving off right now, even though obviously they are very welcomed, at least as we see them So, I'm sure the yield curve is telling us a lot of important things I'm sure we can and should both benefit from [unintelligible] but I don't think it's reliable enough historically or intellectually to give me, at least, enough confidence in terms of [extrapolating] from it to the inflation rate and to other variables  Now, the one variable on the financial side that I do have some confidence in is the money supply, however defined It is intellectually not easy to look at the pattern of money growth that we have had for basically two years now--I guess it's more than two years--and say to yourself Is that a pattern of money growth over a long period of time that is likely to be associated with some further dramatic escalation in the inflation rate? I think that is what is giving me some pause But as I said, Mr Chairman, overall I can support your position But my assessment of the risks is that they are a bit asymmetric in that direction; that, I think, is clear   That was the apology   I will   I think I would move it   But to change the $12 billion would take specific action of the Committee?   So moved   So moved   So moved   So move   [Unintelligible] on a hedge   So move   So move   Let me start with a couple of impressionistic or anecdotal comments My sense is that most people in the business community that I talk to associate themselves with the view that there are these straws in the wind that the economy may be settling down a bit But I think it's almost universally true that they would tend to be in the soft landing camp in that I have absolutely no suggestions [from them] of any accumulating downturn or anything even remotely resembling recession or remotely indicative of that There is, I think, especially among major industrial companies, far less conviction today than there was three months ago about the prospective strength of exports Some of that is exchange-rate related but, seemingly, a lot of it is not simply a reflection of exchange rates; there's a combination of capacity constraints and other considerations as well But certainly there is less conviction about the near-term strength of exports than has been the case Even  has changed his tune, Alan, quite perceptibly  The anecdotal material on the inflation side is, frankly, a bit sour right now Virtually all companies--small and large--that we've talked to in the recent past do point to both labor and nonlabor cost pressures And consistent with Gary's comment [they report] less difficulty in passing costs through I don't think I would characterize these impressions as symptomatic of a 1979-80 type outburst of inflation Nevertheless, I think the perception is there that the pressure is greater One little tiny vignette that's germane our small business and agricultural advisory committee members were talking last week--and this really shocked all of us, I think--about wage increases as high as 9 and 10 percent Presumably, because these are small companies these are not wage increases as much as they are increases in hiring rates In other words, when they lose employees they have to go out into the marketplace and replace them And I think the thrust of their comment was that, in at least some cases, replacement rates are now 9 or 10 percent above prevailing rates for existing employees So it's not a wage increase in the usual sense of the term but I think it is symptomatic of quite tight labor markets throughout the District, including most of upstate New York at this point  The other impression that I pick up an awful lot lately--and I think it's just worth repeating--is an almost universal skepticism, bordering on cynicism, about the outlook for budget deficit reduction plans, as they may or may not emerge over the weeks ahead Again, it doesn't matter whether you're talking to small businesses, big businesses, upstate, or downstate There really is a growing concern that nothing seems to be happening Whether the Administration's quiet diplomacy will produce something is another question But I think it is a matter of increasing concern  As far as the forecasts are concerned, the New York staff forecast for 1989 in terms of GNP, real GNP, and indeed almost all the components of GNP, is virtually identical with the Board staff's forecast The only major difference we continue to have is on the inflation side Depending upon which index you look at, our inflation rates are a half--   I'm sorry The only material difference in our staff forecast versus the Board staff's forecast is on inflation That has narrowed a bit but we still have inflation rates in 1989--depending upon which index you look at--that are 1/2 to 3/4 of a point above the Board staff's forecast That still seems to reflect, primarily, a different view on markups Mike's forecast still has a small negative spread between, say, the deflator and unit labor costs and ours continues to have a small positive spread But when you add the two of them together it comes out to 3/4 of a point difference on the high side in our forecast In 1990, for whatever weight one wants to put on a 1990 forecast, there's a fairly sharp difference between the Board staff's forecast and ours We don't have as much of a slowdown in domestic demand as they do And we have the external adjustment process essentially flattening out and indeed deteriorating a little So there's a quite a sharp difference in 1990 I don't put any more weight on those forecasts than Ted Truman does, but to get back to the point the Chairman raised earlier-- whether you take the staff's forecast or our forecast for '89 and '90 on the external side--both imply an increase in US net external liabilities in balance sheet terms of about $275 billion for the two years combined And I must say as an intermediate- or medium-term policy problem I am getting more and more concerned about the implications of anything even resembling that kind of a result for the two years running  With regard to the near-term growth prospects in the economy, my sense of things, Mr Chairman, is that under the best of circumstances the near-term inflation numbers are going to be bad And if the economy is simply pausing rather than trending down they could be terrible So an awful lot does ride on the question of how much weight one should give to these signs, however tentative or firm one may think they are, as to the near-term course of the economy Just one last point on the price side Mike and Ted talked a fair bit about oil prices and Governor Angell will probably talk a bit about commodity prices But one thing I did notice in looking at commodities is that stocks of a very wide range of agricultural and industrial crude materials are at quite low levels right now I'd simply observe that if we don't get some rain in some parts of the country pretty soon that could further complicate the near-term outlook on the price front   Well, as you know Mr Chairman, I blow hot and cold on this, to put it mildly I probably have changed my mind about what is the right thing to do about once every hour for the past two weeks I clearly think that we've got to maintain a tilt toward firmness; indeed, I think my preference would actually be to come out somewhere between "B" and "C" right now Let me just elaborate on two basic reasons as to why that's where my preference lies The first is, as I've said before, that it seems to me we have a period immediately in front of us just about baked in the cake in which the price statistics are going to tend to be on the bad side I think that's kind of locked in By "bad" I don't mean anything like those January-February PPI numbers but something in the range of 5 percent or higher Again, if our forecast and our hunches about soft landings prove to be right then we could get lucky On the other hand, if our forecast and hunches about soft landings are wrong and we have a pause rather than a slowdown then I think we have real trouble, which is another way of saying that I still think the risks are distinctly asymmetric  I have another concern that reinforces my tilt [preference] And that is, notwithstanding Don Kohn's Chart 7--which I agree is pretty impressive to look at--I still worry that the changes in the financial system and structure may well have produced a situation in which it takes a higher level of both nominal and real interest rates to get the same degree of restraint that might have been associated with that nice neat relationship in Chart 7 And that leads me to a couple of things First of all, as we look around right now there is no evidence that I can see of any credit availability problems There's plenty of credit there That shouldn't surprise us, given all the structural changes in the financial system and so on But what it means, of course--and Ted Truman touched on this--is that one way or another restraint has to come through price effects Price effects either mean the exchange rate--and if they are the exchange rate that complicates immensely that medium-term problem I spoke of earlier this morning--or they have to be one way or another through interest rates But what I'm not so sure about is how much we know today about the way the interest mechanism itself works For example, take the consumer sector it's unambiguously clear that rising interest rates have a net positive impact on personal income even after you take account of floating rate mortgages and home equity loans Now, that itself doesn't tell you too much; you then have to make a lot of judgments about relative propensities to consume But it's unambiguous in terms of its cash flow effect on the consumer sector as a whole  -36-    3/28/89   That's true That's what they are right now But on the other hand, the business sector clearly is hurt more in cash flow terms by rising interest rates than it once was And we get the anomalous effect that at least in cash flow terms the effects of rising interest rates are more of a problem in the place where we need spending activity rather than in the consumer sector where it should go the other way Just as another illustration of this financial engineering, we're now all familiar with the swap market but we now have emerging markets in interest rate caps, collars, and floors And this market, which is only a couple of years old, we know to be $300 billion in size and we think it is probably $500 billion in size This market didn't even exist three years ago! And as a reflection of the way that market has been working in recent months, the open interest in Euro-dollar futures contracts in Chicago is now up to $760 billion Now, I just don't know myself how all these things interact in terms of the way monetary restraint works itself into the system by interest rate channels But my hunch is that, if anything, it probably works to slow it down rather than speed it up And that's the second reason why I have that tilt Having said that my preference would lie between "B" and "C" right now, I guess I can go along with your formulation in the spirit of Bob Parry's earlier comments   That's for sure   As in M1A?   I'll second   Second   Second   Yes   I had a brief postscript, Mr Chairman I didn't want to confuse the discussion further I just  the    5/16/89  wanted to say, after Bob Heller's comments, that we're sitting here today discussing this in the context of concern about a strong dollar I still fear the day will come when we'll be sitting here looking at this question from a very different perspective I would simply like to add that quickly to the discussion   Well, Mr Chairman, I am encouraged by recent business statistics and recent business developments in that they suggest the kind of adjustment that I thought was needed It's also true that, broadly speaking, the statistics and the anecdotal comments we get from business people are more or less compatible with each other, which isn't always the case The one exception to that may be a bit more concern on the anecdotal side about near-term inflationary prospects But like Ed Boehne, when I look out at the profile over the next six or seven quarters, in some ways I conclude that it is indeed about as good as one could hope for On the question of risks, I'm still impressed on balance with the resiliency of the economy Far more often than not the surprises tend to be on the plus side rather than on the negative side And I guess that's where I would hedge my bets  Having said that the outlook in Mike's forecast in some ways is about as good as one can hope for, I think it's worthwhile to then ask Where does that leave us? What does it look like out there at the end of 1990--keeping in mind that these point estimates are not worth a darn? Nevertheless, where are we by the end of 1990? Well, even in Mike's forecast the underlying inflation rate is still 5 percent, maybe a shade higher The external situation is terrible In the staff forecast the current account deficit in the fourth quarter of 1990 is $135 billion; in our forecast it's more like $155 billion I would stipulate that if that combination of numbers is anything near right the economy at the end of 1990, if not sooner, will be a good deal more vulnerable in many respects than it is right now In addition to the kind of recession--financial and other types of things--one thing I'm quite sure of is that the protectionist problem will be a heck of a lot greater if we get out that far and we're still looking at external imbalances of the type that are built into the forecast  Then I start to ask myself the questions What's going to change that? What might produce a better result than those 1990 point estimates? And I start to go down the list US fiscal policy, not likely; US monetary policy, well, which way? Do we want to ease monetary policy? That might help stimulate domestic demand a bit but that's going to hurt on the trade side It might help net exports a little but that will be offset partly in terms of domestic demand And both are going to be inflationary So, I don't see much help there We could tighten US monetary policy, but that's going to make the dollar go up, among other things, and I don't see much help there If you look to foreigners, there's very little excess capacity abroad for the industrialized countries, so we're not going to see much there Indeed, while they may tighten monetary policy for domestic price inflation reasons, that in turn is going to restrict the growth in their own domestic demand, which in turn is going to hurt in terms of the adjustment in trade and exports from the US point of view In short, I don't think you can fix it either way with the exchange rate And I think there are great risks on both sides of that, especially in a context in which the protectionist problem is likely to get worse, not better That's a long-winded way of saying that I don't mind at all running the risk prospectively that the economy will slow; indeed, I wouldn't even care if it slowed a bit more than Mike's forecast as long as I do not see signs of a recession, which I do not see right now    5/16/89   "B;" $600 million; symmetric I wouldn't dare try to add to the nuances of this   I'm not sure about that, because I have a potential real problem here   No My definition of unchanged policy from a market perspective is that the market views that policy as the funds rate in the 9-3/4 to 9-7/8 percent area   Yes, but there has been some effort to try to define that at 9-3/4 percent I promised not to get into the semantics of this but at that point it's more than semantics to me   That I can--   That can be dealt with and finessed But that's not--okay   6 to 12 percent   Mr Chairman, I'd like to make a procedural point that I think is important In terms of continuity of the monetary policy process, I think we have to preserve the flexibility of the Chairman to have some discretion within the directive on both sides I'm not particularly fond of using that discretion right now, but I really do think the principle of maintaining an element of flexibility in the policy process is important notwithstanding my view on the substance of the matter   Are you going to be here on Monday?   I thought you would already be gone to Madrid    5/31/89   Mr Chairman, I view the staff forecast as basically a reasonable one My own forecast is probably a bit stronger in real GNP growth terms, as has been the case for a long, long time We have an inflation rate both this year and next that is still running 1/2 percentage point or more above what is in the staff forecast I look at the forecast today versus, say, 12 or 6 months ago, and I think there is an important difference in that 12 or 6 months ago I, at least, viewed the situation as being distinctly asymmetric on the side of too much growth and too much accelerating inflation I would view the staff forecast now as reasonably well balanced But by definition the forecast that in those circumstances    7/5-6/89  is reasonably well balanced today is one that does have somewhat greater downside risks than it did before But that's in the nature of things That to me says that we've either been lucky or good Now, on the question of lucky or good--   I was about to say I think where I come out is both I say that because I am hard pressed to convince myself that the rise in interest rates over the past year or so, going back to March last year, has been decisive in causing the slowdown in spending we have seen, except in housing In other areas in which we have seen a slowdown I think I can convince myself that the slowdown may have as much, if not more, to do with other things than it does with interest rates Certainly, I think that's true in autos where saturation alone, coupled with the bunching up of purchases of fleets of automobiles by auto rental agencies and others, is producing some anomalies--as reflected in the widening spread between used car prices and new car prices In the area of nonresidential construction, I think the slowdown is at least as much, if not more, the result of the excesses that took place earlier, in terms of commercial real estate development and shopping centers and other things Energy I don't think is interest-rate driven And the slowdowns that we're seeing in both state and local and in Federal government purchases of goods and services clearly are not interest-rate driven So, I think there has been a combination of some fortuitous developments, rather than luck, and some good policy that has produced the kind of result that I think many of us wanted to see  Although I agree with much of what John LaWare said about all these financial problems, the only problem is that I could make a case that they are an argument for tighter monetary policy rather than easier policy Be that as it may, on the anecdotal side there is clearly a sense that one picks up, as several others have talked about, of things having slowed down further--especially in May and June As I mentioned to you earlier today, Mr Chairman, periodically we have been talking to a group of firms--we can't call it a survey because OMB would get mad at us, but it has certain characteristics in that direction--and I'd like to share with the Committee several features that came out of our talks with these firms in the period of June 19th to June 23rd We have done this enough so that it has its own little history to it and we can get a sense of what the dynamics are First of all, in terms of export orders and export growth the [unintelligible] pattern now is that most of them are still seeing export orders running in a range of 10 to 15 percent increases, which is down from 20 to 25 percent last year But that seems to be largely a kind of a saturation thing None of the firms, with the exception of one small manufacturer, said that the exchange rate appreciation that we've had in recent months has yet had any impact on their export orders, although several did say that if the exchange rate stayed above 2 marks or 140 yen that they would expect that to begin to show But it has not shown to date They also are suggesting that their backlogs of export orders are still high and rising I'm not going to go through all of this but just on the question that you specifically raised, Mr Chairman, the second interesting part is on the inventory side What we see is that the clear majority of firms, especially the big firms, are reporting inventories as quite normal But again, in sharp contrast with earlier discussions with these people, we now have  -27-    7/5-6/89  something like a third of them expressing a little uneasiness about inventory developments and a couple saying that inventory developments may well prove to require some production slowdowns Again, it's not precisely [the information] in and of itself; it is that there is a change in the kinds of things that these same firms had been saying to us in the past The price forecasts are basically, except for certain sensitive commodity price tables of intermediate materials, in the 5 percent range Capacity investment plans are holding up; there are no major changes And in some cases these companies are talking about very major investments The paper company is talking about two new plants coming on stream in the early '90s, and this is big stuff There is no sign of any retrenchment at all There is one interesting development A large chemical company tells us that they are getting ready to build a new plant that won't come on stream until 1991--Mr Truman, you'll be interested in this--and they went out and hired  to assure them that the dollar would come down before they made their decision   They volunteered that The last thing that I think is very telling is in their anticipated wage bill increases for 1989 And here, there is an unmistakable virtually across-the-board acceleration About a third of the firms are now talking 3 to 4 percent; they were talking 2 to 3 percent Another third are at 5 percent; they were talking more 3 to 4 percent And another third had increases ranging as high as 10 percent, but most of them were within the 5 or 6 or 7 percent range What should one make of this? I'm not sure But clearly, there are three or four areas-- export orders, inventories, investment, and wages--where [discussions with] this handful of very representative firms do suggest some important changes from what they were telling us a year or two ago  There is one last point I would make at this juncture I want to say a little more on the inflation issue in the context of the policy discussion tomorrow If I go to Mr Truman's chart 17, the external side of our economy still stinks; there's no other way to put it Nobody else seems to worry about it too much, but I sure do I don't know what the right exchange rate assumption is, heaven knows But if you take our forecast--this is a minor thing at the margin--we get back in 1990 to a situation in the United States where domestic demand is growing faster than GNP again It's not by a lot but that's where we end up That's not a forecast as much as it is an observation But if you look at those numbers, you can put whatever margin of error you want around them and they are lousy That net investment position in 1990 ends up at minus 14 percent of GNP That is trouble looking for a place to happen; and it's going to come home to roost on us sooner or later And partly for that reason, that reinforces my own view that I'm quite prepared to accept running some risk of the kind of slow growth that is built into the staff forecast and maybe even growth that is a little slower than that   Second   [Since the Chairman is out of the room], you're about to witness the first official act of the Vice Chairman of the FOMC in 25 years [Secretary's note Chairman Greenspan returned] Mr Chairman, I just told the Committee they were about to observe the first official act of the Vice Chairman of the FOMC in 25 years I was about to call on Mr Stern   Mr Stern   Where I come out is very close to where Gary Stern was--and for the reasons he gave, which are as good as any That would be the '89 ranges for '90   Yes Having said that, let me just add a comment or two I have to say that I have become increasingly skeptical, bordering on cynical, about the usefulness or reliability of these money supply measures as targets or indicators of monetary policy, notwithstanding the wonders of P* In this specific and immediate context I'm not nearly as concerned as I think some are about the slow growth of M whatever over the recent past or, indeed, over several years I don't want to get into a big discussion of that but I would simply say that one of the reasons I'm not as concerned is that when I look at the very broad measures of credit availability-- credit growth, debt growth, and L growth--all of those things are behaving in quite a satisfactory way In my mind, at least, all this financial innovation does play a significant role in accounting for the abnormal gap between M growth, however measured, and these broader measures of debt or credit or overall liquid assets, including nonbank liquid assets So I'm just not quite as concerned  Also, let me make a brief point in the context of Mr Boehne's comment about a means to an end I ask myself the question in the context of current policy Is it possible, first, that the rise in the inflation rate has stabilized--that it's not going up anymore? There's a reasonable chance that that's true, but I don't think it's baked in the cake But even if you assume it is baked in the cake, then the next question I have to ask myself, which is very relevant to this 18-month period, is What would it take to buy back the acceleration in the inflation rate that we have had over the past 18 months? Forget about long-term price stability for the moment; just ask yourself what it would take to get back to where we were Is there any plausible set of reasons to believe that we could recapture what we've lost without a fair amount of slack having to develop in the economy?   That's right Maybe there are some things working in that direction; certainly, international competition is one But history seems fairly compelling on this point it's awfully hard to see how you can get a deceleration of the inflation rate, even by a percentage point or so, without some slack in the economy And I think that is another aspect of this goal of price stability It's nice to talk about it, but I am very skeptical that we can even achieve that intermediate goal of buying back what we've already lost without having to incur some real costs, much less get back to genuine price stability of 1950's vintage or something like that So, I think Mr Boehne's point is right on the mark, and we have to be realistic about what is feasible and what is not Anyway, I can certainly live with the '89 [ranges] for '90  -42-    7/5-6/89   I can support the formulation that you put on the table, Mr Chairman But I do think that the body English on it is important I completely support your suggestion that we've got to be careful here Therefore, I think the symmetric language is also important for the reasons that you've stated In terms of the more cautious approach I would simply add (1) that it still, as I said earlier, is not clear to me that the inflation rate necessarily has stopped rising--and even if it has, I think we still could get a couple of months of lousy numbers; and (2) as an extension of that, and for external reasons as well, I at least am prepared to run some risk of an economy that is on the slow side for some period But I think the thrust of your prescription is precisely right   I have trouble with it because I really have been concerned that we may be projecting this notion to the public and to the Congress--and I hope you're right with your commodity prices, Wayne--that there's a free lunch, or that we can get from here to there without having to incur some real difficulty in the economy And I think that's very dangerous   I don't have any trouble putting some words like that in the Chairman's testimony or even in the body of the directive itself I don't know; maybe I misunderstood   What I object to is that I think we are running a risk of creating an impression in the Congress and elsewhere that we are going to get to price stability in some easy, painless way I just am very, very skeptical that that is possible I'm skeptical that we can even get the inflation rate back down to 4 percent without having to incur some hardship   We probably should look at these--   What if we say "taking account of progress in resisting inflationary pressures"?   I would not personally object, Mr Chairman, if you choose to incorporate the gravamen of what Governor Kelley is saying even in your testimony where you're not as bound--   We can leave these words where they are but try and get some--   Yes, I'm here  [Secretary's note The reports of Vice Chairman Corrigan and Mr Truman on the Mexican negotiations were not transcribed]  END OF SESSION     No   I think a lot would depend upon why the market thought interest rates were going down Just to take two contrasting possibilities If the market really thought that the underlying rate of inflation was coming down, and interest rates were coming down in response to that, that would be one thing On the other hand, if the market felt the economy was ready to fall out of bed and interest rates were coming down because of that, I think you'd get quite a different [slide] It really does depend very much on perceptions as to why   Probably not  SPEAKER(?) Give us two years   Si, this is still an important lever in the overall process We had a meeting--about 10 days ago, Ted?-- when most of the ducks were in a row in terms of this deal being done But there are about 4 or 5 categories of things that have to be locked up, several of which are very difficult, by August 30th There will be another meeting--the "lock-up meeting" either next week or the day after Labor Day, I'm not sure which yet What we have said to both parties is that the official bridge will be activated and disbursed only when these other things are done, mainly that all of the detail is agreed to by both parties I think the issue here is trying to keep as much pressure [as possible] on the process And I think Ted's suggestion, the Chairman's suggestion, and Governor Angell's are all compatible with that, in that you authorize it but you don't give the impression that it's an absolute done deal You keep the trump card in the Chairman's pocket That's the rationale   Then we will have looked good not to have disbursed it, anyway   Second   In my judgment, if we have external debt of 40 percent of GNP we're in real trouble   It's transferred   Well, I guess I start out where a lot of other people do but I'm not sure I end up where others do Certainly, I would agree that if one could take a snapshot of the first half of this year, especially after the revisions are all in, one would be very tempted to declare a victory and go home One might even be tempted to do that looking at the staff forecast Obviously, most forecasts that are being talked about are within striking distance of that one But that forecast is for real GNP growth of 2 percent or so stretching out as far as the eye can see and an underlying inflation forecast of 5 percent or so stretching out as far as the eye can see Even when Mike gets around to [forecasting] 1991, I think we'll probably still have something that looks like that When I think about that kind of an outlook I have to say that it's probably as good as we can do So it doesn't trouble me But on the other hand, I say to myself Well, how reasonable is it to think that things can just roll on in that fashion in perpetuity? I guess that's where I get into trouble I just don't think we can either be that good or that lucky Indeed, even right now I would say that the risks in the forecast are reasonably well balanced to the symmetric, but I don't draw as much comfort from that as I think some do There is one  -32-    8/22/89  risk that could be quite transitory but quite troubling and that is that we might get a spurt in consumer spending in the second half of the year over and above the little spurt that Mike has I don't think that's at all beyond the realm of possibility But if that did happen, I think it could really throw some other things out of kilter  On the other side, I can at this point see signs of potential weakness in the economy that are more troubling to me We've talked about exports a lot Another area is construction In part, the closer we are to the reality of the thrift industry liquidations and the tremendous overhang that will produce in real estate markets--not just in the Southeast or Southwest, but nationally--that seems to me more of a concern than it has been in the past I hear comments around the table and I see in New York City commercial construction going ahead pell mell in a context in which vacancy rates, at least in Manhattan, are now higher than they have been in 25 years I suspect, Si, that Chicago must be about in the same position by this point, though maybe not quite that bad In the Northeast, housing prices still are rising like gangbusters But the stock of unsold new and used homes is rising very rapidly too And those two things are just obviously incompatible with one another The irony of it is that in this construction area--whether it's commercial, the thrift overhang, or even residential in the Northeast--the problem ultimately is not that interest rates have been too high; if anything, the problem is that they have been too low A lot of this construction really is excessive overbuilding, speculation--all the seeds of real problems down the road Martha, I think, mentioned this corporate cash flow problem If you look at the profile of corporate cash flow out to late 1990 into early 1991 there is a profound change there in terms of the relative capacity of the corporate sector to finance itself internally versus externally My hunch is that even the numbers we have don't really yet take account of all the implications of these highly leveraged transactions, which are starting to look worse too There again, the problem is excesses rather than interest rates being in any sense too high So, there are a lot of things that bother me in terms of the real economy, even though on balance I would regard the risks as reasonably well balanced in the context of that steady- state 2 percent--except that I don't think it's going to happen  Now, on inflation--and this is where I guess I differ with a lot of the views around the table--I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel I would agree that the data through the first half of the year are compatible with the notion that the inflation rate probably has stopped rising But I'm not even sure of that When I look at the inflation outlook I tend to focus very heavily on the [unintelligible] compensation, the productivity mixes, and what can go wrong there I think the risks are quite asymmetric there; the risk is that, if anything, the compensation numbers may tend to be on the high side and the productivity numbers on the low side, in a context in which the staff forecast continues to have a negative spread between unit labor costs and the GNP deflator On wages, just as one example If you look at the data on collective bargaining agreements where there have been either freezes or declines in wages in the first year or concessions on COLAs and other fringe benefits, there is a huge, huge change in terms of what we've seen in the first half of this year versus what we were seeing in the mid-1980s In the mid- 1980s up through 1987 the percentage of workers that either had frozen wages, declining wages, or givebacks of one kind or another were  -33-    8/22/89  running [unintelligible] Based on the first half of this year they are running somewhere in the range of 6 to 10 percent Now, that too may turn out to be an aberration; but it does say to me that it is premature to declare victory in terms of the wage and compensation situation So, I'm really in an uncomfortable position, despite the fact that I think the first half looks terrific and the forecast looks great I think the probabilities are rising that we're not going to get that nice, neat outcome And it's easier for me today to see some things that might develop--whether it's next year or even 1991--that are quite troubling But right at this precise moment it looks great   I'm sorry, Roger, I didn't hear the beginning Where did you come out on the symmetry?   I prefer "B" symmetric, as well, although I accept the fact that we will do what we have to do in any event I'm not terribly worried about that But I guess I'm just not as confident as the majority of the Committee seems to be about the very near-term outlook I think there is a possibility--not a likelihood but a possibility--that over the next couple of months the economy could be stronger rather than weaker And what I really worry about is that therein lies the problem for 1990 That's really why I would prefer to be symmetric   Well, I accept that But of all the ugly things that we could think about that one gets pretty ugly   As I say, I don't think it's the likely case  -45-    8/22/89   It worries me   Well, I can accept that   It's a long way off  END OF MEETING  -48-       Second   You're shooting the messenger here, Governor Johnson! [Laughter]   A couple of points first of all, there's absolutely no question that a perception--whether it's reality or not--that the central bank is trying to beat down the dollar is a very, very dangerous thing; we would all agree with that What may not be agreed to or perhaps understood is the amount of effort that has gone into trying to minimize the kinds of problems that could arise in the current circumstances both with our own Treasury and elsewhere Maybe that hasn't been pristine pure or perfect in its execution but I think the thrust of the effort has been in that vein But, again, the real question is the one that Ed Boehne started to ask and the real debate, it seems to me, should be on the threshold question of where we are Obviously, Governor Johnson says in effect there are no imbalances That isn't quite what you said but it's--   I think that is really where the debate should lie I don't think it's a question of intervention tactics per se I think the real issue is the implications over time for where we are and where we are going with regard to the global economy and our national economy In terms of some of the attitudes that go into this kind of convoluted point we're at, there are very sharp differences of opinion about the implications of the current situation and the outlook for the world economy   I don't think that's the question here   I agree that is the key issue but the question is Are those goals compatible in any reasonable sense over even a 5-year period?    10/3/89   Manley, I think what we have to try to do is what the Chairman has been trying to do at one level and Sam and Ted [have been trying to do at their levels] If you really want the worst scenario that we're all so terrified of, I'll tell you how you get it That would be to advocate this and then have our 40 percent taken away so it's nothing And then you would have your green eye shade guy running the shop   It's not   No, that's not the scenario   The point is that there is that danger; it raises the specter of what a fight will alter That is the way this plays out And if it's precisely that, that could precipitate the collapse in the dollar and the rout in the bond markets and the stock markets That's what I think we have to be so careful of   But that's a different debate   That's a different debate; that gets to the heart of the question of how do you get from here to there It seems to me that's a different issue   The problem is we don't have any coordinated policy We've got a lousy fiscal policy and a pretty good monetary policy That's at the heart of the problem   That is a different issue The question in terms of the price stability goal is How do you get from here to there? There are a lot of variables that go into that question of how you get from 4-1/2 percent inflation to 0 inflation   Well?   That's the debate; that's the right issue How do you get from here to there?   The problem there though, Roger, is that you give the Congress a choice If you really do say you are going to give the Treasury some more money or you are going to balance the budget, which way do you think they're going to go?   Can I make the last comment?   I want to come back to this price stability issue Obviously, that is the overriding goal for central banks But I think we have to be a little careful about how we articulate that goal If we articulate it in a way that creates or reinforces the perception that we can get from here to there in a costless, painless, way I think that can be very, very dangerous And it's in that context that I worry about large current account deficits I certainly don't view them as a goal, as I'm sure you know, Manley   The question--if I can just finish-- is whether the presence of current account deficits in excess of $100 billion in perpetuity are compatible with an orderly and relatively painless ability to reach that goal of price stability   That's a different question   It's not   The analogy, I think, is that any time someone dissented on monetary policy grounds they would have to dissent on Mr Sternlight's operations  SPEAKER(?) It says "ratified"   Well, in terms of the near-term outlook I'd be in the moderate but steady camp that somebody--I guess Dick Syron--mentioned As I said to you this morning, there is some evidence of a lessening in prices for some raw materials and intermediate goods and even some evidence of modest improvement in availability of deliveries But all-in-all as I look at the current situation, my bottom line is that I fear it will be weaker and my instinct is that it will be stronger Therefore, I think it's about balanced But let me take up a further [unintelligible] in terms of the intermediate-term outlook The staff has taken the forecast in the Greenbook through the end of 1991 and I think what the staff is saying is very, very revealing You may not like it, but I think it is probably the most exhaustive and professional insight that you can get What does it say? It says 2 percent growth for three years running; the unemployment rate rising to 6 percent; the saving rate falling again to 5 percent; the CPI with or without food or energy stuck in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range; compensation per man hour stuck  -33-    10/3/89  at 5 percent; the fiscal deficit still over $100 billion; and the trade and current account deficits at the end of 1991, even with some depreciation, still around $100 billion Net external liabilities at the end of '91 are going to be $1 trillion and portfolio net income flows are going to be minus $50-odd billion It seems to me that what you get out of that is an intermediate-term outlook that I consider to be in some ways as good as you can expect but in other ways very, very risky and dangerous It tells me, as we all know, that we have an absolutely lousy policy mix in this country It tells me that there are great risks of a renewal of protectionist attitudes in this country It tells me that there are risks even in terms of the ability of this country to provide leadership And it certainly tells me that there are very grave risks in the economic outlook in terms of growth, inflation, and the exchange rate I think the exchange rate risk over time is clearly on the down side That's one of the reasons why, though I may not agree with the analysis, I certainly agree with the stated concerns about the dangers of beating up on the dollar But I don't consider this three-year outlook anything but trouble looking for a place to happen somehow or other   I'm comfortable with alternative B I guess I prefer symmetric but since we have asymmetric, that's fine-- just leave it there I would come out there pretty much on the grounds of my own assessment of the domestic economy, although the exchange rate situation makes it a bit more compelling I would note, Mr Chairman, tongue somewhat in cheek, that I'm not prepared to make this argument, but much of the earlier discussion today would not be incompatible with tightening monetary policy   A whole variety of things the dollar, price stability, making room for export growth You could make a pretty good argument based on the discussion around this table that we should be tightening policy I'm not prepared to make it   Mr Chairman, could I raise another question before we formally adjourn?   I wonder what the sentiment around the table might be, looking forward to our next meeting, to ask Mr Prell and Mr Truman and Mr Kohn and others to do a special presentation for the Committee where we would take a look at this question of price stability in five years in some systematic way I'm not suggesting a forecast but alternative scenarios, problems, obstacles, and costs, so that we could really get a systematic feel of what kinds of problems would be involved in that kind of underlying policy goal I don't think--   Well, putting aside this other view, I don't want to prejudge the letter   We have to deal with that But quite apart from that, I really think that we ought to put this exercise under a microscope so we really have a--  SPEAKER(?) Well, this is something [unintelligible]   Well, I'm just trying to formalize that  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I agree   That's why I want to look at it   What you want to do--   [Even] over five years there are going to be costs   Well, I think he would say that   Mr Chairman, if I could, I'd like to add a point on those unfortunate press articles It is clear to me that they have already done some damage in terms of reducing [our] flexibility and undermining discipline in the marketplace It is absolutely essential, regardless of what the motivation for those particular articles may have been, that there is only one person who speaks for the Federal Reserve in these circumstances and that is you I regard those press reports as amateurish [Furthermore], I think they undercut the character of the Federal Reserve as I have known it for many, many years The only saving grace that I can think of is that, in a way, they are so amateurish that they probably will not be taken as seriously as they might have been The person, at least in The Washington Post, goes to the great length of having, in effect, announced policy and then turns around and says that we aren't going to make an announcement about policy I think it is very, very unfortunate And it does cut right at the very heart of the Federal Reserve, as far as I'm concerned   First of all, in terms of European stock markets, the general pattern is that stocks are down in the range of 7 to 9 percent on the major exchanges London reached a low of down 204, over 9 percent Right now it's down 175 or so, which is just a shade under 8 percent That pattern pretty well prevails through most of the other exchanges, although patterns of trade, especially in Paris, are very, very irregular The reports we are getting out of London in particular suggest that as of now and unlike 1987, there is no panic selling and there is not a widespread pattern of names of individual counterparties for transactions being questioned in the way that they were in 1987--although there, too, everyone is waiting to see how markets open here in New York We've just been told that the New York Stock Exchange opening is going to be delayed another 15 minutes I may have to pick up a call from  in just a second to see what he has to say The Tokyo markets were typically Japanese everything was very quiet, all things considered in Tokyo; stocks closed down only about 128 percent with very, very low levels of trading Apparently, the institutions stayed completely on the sidelines    10/16/89  Here, as I said, market expectations about stocks are really all over the lot I think that [most of] these people--the last time I talked to them about what they see--feel that stocks will open in New York down maybe 60, 80, or 100 points But there are speculative judgments in the marketplace that are a good deal worse than that Some people [unintelligible] are talking about stocks opening down as much as 200, but obviously those are just shots in the dark with little appreciation of what's going on  tells me that he thinks that, on balance, US stocks in London are about 3 percent below their close as of last Friday in New York The one technical condition that exists that is a bit troubling is that the Chicago futures indexes at the close were about 5 points below cash margins Now, what would normally happen in those circumstances, of course, is that the "arbs" would close them off Whether they will or not depends on a lot of things including [unintelligible] judgments Peter already mentioned the junk bond market I think it's quite obvious that that market, at least today, will be rather totally illiquid And that among other things raises the question of whether some of these mutual funds, especially those that have concentrated positions in junk issues, could come under some pressure We think there is about $40 billion of junk bonds in the funds Of course, it's not all of the funds There are a few [unintelligible] size are largely, if not exclusively junk; and of those, few are open ended So that could possibly be quite a concern But the prevailing attitude, at least at the moment, seems to me to be one in which most people do not [see] that situation as having the same character as 1987 I've got on the other phone, Alan Can I take it?   Alan, could I interrupt?   They are now open and it opened with a tick to the high side There are 62,000 orders in the system By way of contrast, the peak front load in 1987 was about 38,000 The initial ticks are slightly on the up side but there is such a large bunch of orders in the system that it will take another 10 or 15 minutes to know what they really have   Yes As I said, there are 62,000 orders in the system, and by way of contrast the peak in orders in the system at the opening in 1987 was 38,000 The first cut was slightly to the up side but it will take another 15 minutes to know what they really have  SPEAKER(?) The specialists are there   No We have been in touch with the Clearing House and, as Alan and I talked yesterday, we also called all the other Reserve Banks yesterday to make sure everybody had all their ducks in a row and all their people on board So far, everything is just fine There are no glitches anywhere that I know of We'll just keep our fingers crossed   One thing we don't want is any operating problems today   Generally, Ed, it would be along the lines of what I started to say before I had to run off a moment ago that people generally are concerned but they also seem to think that, in underlying terms, we may be a little better off than we were in '87 The major dominant concern is the spillover effects in high- yield markets; there is always the possibility that with markets as they are now, for firms that are trying to restructure an existing deal in bankruptcy it wouldn't take much for that kind of situation to get pretty ugly I do think that they know what their role is There was at least an element of confusion, if I can put it that way, growing out of some of those newspaper reports   Yes As I said, I think there is some uneasiness about those news reports But basically my sense of it is that I can't say they're comfortable, but I get no sense of a    10/16/89  really--"panicky" is a bad word, but I'll use it anyway--panicky feeling They seem okay at the moment   Obviously, there is some apprehension   The Dow is now down 16-1/2 points One other point in response to Ed Boehne's question There are a couple of situations--the bridge loans outstanding in the hands of the investment banks in particular--that are a matter of some concern The total outstandings are down distinctly from their peaks, but they are still not inconsequential And it is also true that a couple of investment banks have rather sizable portfolios of junk bonds, which of course they have to finance on a day-to-day basis One report, for example, that I had earlier this morning had to do with a house, other than the obvious one, with a portfolio into the several billion dollars Of course, that portfolio, when you have to take your haircut of 25 or 30 percent, that's not trivial in terms of net [unintelligible] or liquidity of the balance sheet So there are concerns ahead but at least at the moment I would stand by my earlier comment that the concerns are weighty but they are not overwhelming I think the crucial thing is how these markets behave over the next few hours   Yes I don't really have much to add I think there was a very measurable sigh of relief yesterday but there still is an overhang of some anxiety And the further away from trading rooms you get and the closer to board rooms, I think the anxiety level is probably higher among the more senior people On London stocks, I just saw a loss of around 33 points there, which isn't dramatic if you allow for the fact that last Friday at best was likely to have some overhang in terms of market openings here All in all, I think things did work very, very well yesterday at all levels, including mechanical levels One thing there is a lot of talk about among the more senior people is the amount of restructuring of various deals that is going to have to be done You're talking big, big money Another point that's being raised already is that Friday is a double-witching day--not a triple-witching day but a double-witching day--and Thursday is also the day when there's a very, very large prospective settlement of margins on foreign exchange contracts As I said, all in all, things have worked remarkably well, but I think there is still an overhang of unease out there   Is Mike Prell there, Alan?   Mike, is that trade number as bad as it looks?   Okay   Okay Thanks, Mike and Ted   I have nothing to add, Alan   Second   So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   What you're saying I think has to be true   So moved    11/14/89   Second   Second   Second   As far as the forecast, our bank staff forecast is still slightly stronger than Mike's forecast, as it has been for some time, but the differences are hardly statistically significant And again, as it has been for some time, our inflation forecast is slightly higher Leaving aside the technicalities of the forecast it does seem to me that the two major areas of uncertainty are capital goods and exports And, of course, they're both related; they both get right to these questions that have been raised about the manufacturing sector The point that Gary Stern made about keeping that in some perspective is very valid I am a little more agnostic than some are in terms of trying to explain to my own satisfaction what is going on in the manufacturing sector and its possible implications for the economy at large For example, I have a very, very hard time accepting the view that anything along the lines of the current level of either nominal or real interest rates should be capable of triggering a significant cumulative decline in the economy Indeed, I'm not even sure myself--and I have not been for some time-- how much of the slowing in the so-called interest sensitive sectors of the economy is really due to interest rates anyway, especially in a    11/14/89  context in which the underlying prices of things like cars and houses and so on have been going up rather sharply, at least until recently  I'm also a little perplexed by the exchange rate arguments Certainly, as Mike or Ted said earlier, it's true that the exchange rate we are seeing is one that is a good deal stronger than was built into the forecast going back, say, nine months ago or something like that But there too it seems to me that at least part of that stronger exchange rate is being offset by a stronger growth abroad than was being thought about early in this year It seems to me that in the context of this uncertainty about net exports, and exports in particular, the current exchange rate in the face of the growth patterns that we're seeing in the rest of the industrialized world should be compatible with continued quite respectable growth in exports Indeed, I'm beginning to worry that if that's not the case then something may be more seriously wrong than we think in terms of competitiveness or something I can't quite bring myself to the view that even the current exchange rate, in the face of the very strong growth abroad, should not yield quite a respectable continued growth in net exports  Now, the inflation situation I see as a Catch-22 in that I find it difficult to get too caught up in the inflationary prospects so long as the broad measures of wages and compensation are behaving the way they are Indeed, if you look at our forecast and the Board staff's forecast, both now have unit labor costs growing faster than the deflator in a context in which, as Governor Johnson has pointed out, this profit squeeze is already very sharp I don't see how you get any relief from that until you see the wage and compensation costs turn down One of the worries I have is that if you build from where we are in terms of profits and profits as a share of GNP, what a period of four or five or six or seven quarters with a negative spread between unit labor costs and the deflator implies for profits raises some pretty serious questions in my mind about the implications for stock prices The last point I would make, which is germane to these issues about manufacturing and the profits squeeze and exports, is that for the first three quarters of this year--if I remember the statistics right--the rate of net private investment for the economy as a whole is now down to 47 percent of GNP And that is a very, very low number And how we're going to get out from underneath a variety of these problems and get the productivity kicks that can really help us with this inflation problem with an investment rate of 47 percent of GNP is a real question   I know that's what it's called   Asymmetric prime   "B" asymmetric is acceptable to me But I do want to associate myself with those who are suggesting a need for great caution at this point   What's the timing going to be?   I think for the sake of the items [on the agenda] we ought to start at 1230 pm; we better start earlier than 300 pm  -34-    11/14/89   Earlier than 300 pm on Monday   That's what I mean It seems to me that we really should be prepared to devote a good solid chunk of time to these issues I would suggest starting much earlier than usual; I don't know about people's travel  SPEAKER(?) How about 100 pm?   No, have lunch at 1200 noon and start work at 100 pm  SPEAKER(?) That's good   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Let me also congratulate the staff; this really was a terrific presentation There are 3 or 4 main things that I, at least, draw from it But the first and the most important is that I think it would be very, very difficult to safely conclude that one could do a heck of a lot better than the summary on Exhibit 14, line 1 Now, that doesn't say we can't do better But to me the empirical evidence, both in the United States and in foreign countries for the time periods covered in this exercise and for other time periods not covered in this exercise, suggests that you'd be very, very hard pressed to safely conclude that you could do a heck of a lot better than line 1 on Exhibit 14 But I think it's also important to note in that regard that when you look at other countries and other times, the cases in which you have seen results that tend in some sense to be different than line 1 on Exhibit 14 have usually been accompanied by very, very sharp fiscal adjustments--not the kind of gradual adjustment that is built into the base case here  The second point I would make is that if you look at those estimates of the costs in the qualified way that I have, I think we do have to keep in mind that these are not small costs in human terms That's partly, I think, the point that Bob Forrestal was raising You start talking about a sacrifice ratio of 22 and 22 sounds like a little number But in terms of the behavior of the economy over a very long period of time it carries with it some rather profound implications One of those profound implications to me is that we have to be very, very careful not to leave the wrong impression about this And the wrong impression in my way of thinking is that this somehow or other is a "gimme putt," which it is not I think it's especially not when you look beneath some of the numbers that are even  -16-    12/18-19/89  in the base case It already has been touched on but, for example, if you maintain a current account deficit of 2-1/4 percent of GNP throughout the whole period, I don't know what that means in absolute numbers but my rough arithmetic tells me that our external debt as a percentage of GNP would end up over 30 percent We'd be sneaking up on Brazil! I don't know if that's quite right, but it's got to be in that order of magnitude, which is another way of saying that even in the base case we are talking about a long period of time in which GNP growth is quite subdued by historical standards and, even with that, the external side of our economic and financial situation gets much worse in many respects  Having said that, I come back to Governor Angell's comment earlier and that is What do you measure the cost relative to? I think it's absolutely unambiguous that if we measure the cost relative to a strategy of accelerating inflation, that's easy The cost of accelerating inflation obviously would be greater in the fullness of time But what about a slower approach to price stability? Or what about a goal that looks more like 1954 to 1965 on the chart earlier on in the presentation? I think those are legitimate and important questions, Mr Chairman From my perspective the basic thrust of what Governor Angell said early on is exactly right in terms of "relative to what?"   No   That, of course, is what I'm suggesting The last point that I would make is What do we think we can do to improve the prospects of getting a better result, whether better is defined relative to Chart 14 or something else? Here, I must say that I'm a little dubious about betting the ranch on this credibility thing, because even if you look at the countries that are thought to have very high credibility, such as Germany, you can find that for periods other than the '81 to '85 period that's on the staff's chart the costs are there and they are quite real--as I said, even where credibility is thought to be high That's not to say-- whether it's in the context of a Neal [resolution] or something else-- that [more] credibility might not get a somewhat better result But I for one would be very reluctant to bet the ranch, so to speak, on the so-called credibility argument On the other hand, if there were some prospects for complementary policy initiatives that could get at the savings/investment problem or get at the productivity problem, that's a different matter If you had a framework over this 5- or 6-year period, for example, in which productivity growth were on average 1/2 point more than it has been and more than is built into these numbers, you would be looking at a different ball game So, I do think that this line of questioning in terms of what helps is not irrelevant; and it gets back, of course, to the all important question of fiscal policy One of the things this says to me is that you've been right  -17-    12/18-19/89  all along; you usually are We don't need just a balanced budget or even a balanced full employment budget; we need a surplus And we probably need a full employment surplus in this time frame in order to make either the holes a little rounder or the pegs a little squarer Any way you cut it up, I think the costs--whatever they may be-- obviously are going to be much greater in a context in which this exercise is approached with monetary policy and monetary policy alone I think we can perhaps do better than line 1 on Exhibit 14; but I'm very hard pressed to think how we are going to do better without complementary policies coming from other areas   I didn't say there was none   I am not prepared to make that bet   No   You might get some benefits But again, even if--   Why are wage rate demands in Germany going to be 9 percent next year? Because the Bundesbank doesn't have credibility?   No I said that if you had a Neal amendment or something like that and certainly if you demonstrably had other arms of public policy--   I'm not saying it would be zero, but I'm saying I think it would be a serious mistake to assume that it is very significant   I'm not citing a limiting case where it's zero   I'm saying that if you take that cell on Exhibit 14 where the shortfall from potential GNP is 20 percent--   --that is the so-called base case model but it essentially has a [unintelligible] of expectations built into it My opening statement was that it would be very hard to conclude safely that you could do much better than that Then I went on to say that there are some things that might permit you do somewhat better than that And credibility might help But I'm saying that I don't think it's going to help all that much; experience suggests that we should be very, very cautious on how much we think it might help That's what I'm saying   Say that again   That's not what I'm saying   I'm not referring to Federal Reserve policy What I'm saying is that if we had a credible fiscal policy in this country in the first place, or if there suddenly were a sweeping budgetary agreement struck independently by the White House and the Congress, then it would help   All right   Would you repeat the first question as you stated it?   I was thinking [you meant Manley]   I have been thinking a lot about the two questions that you have raised I have a loose idea rolling around in my head, and I'm not even sure I like it, but let me throw it out anyway The idea would be that the stated policy of the Committee would be couched in terms of a goal of price behavior that would be broadly compatible with what we had, say, in the '50s and early '60s In other words, we wouldn't get hung up with one [indicator such as the] CPI or deflator, but we'd state a goal in terms of trying to return to a pattern that had the characteristics of that [earlier period] and we could say that we were going to try to achieve that in the time frame of the mid-'90s So, it would not be all that specific in terms of a particular price index and it would allow for some wiggle for shocks It certainly would not be time specific but it would be [unintelligible], Mr Chairman, as kind of an answer to both of your questions  But I do want to go back to what I was trying to say before, in part because Mr [Parry] didn't understand me but Mr [Prell] did, just so there is no misunderstanding--or hopefully, none Even if we stated a goal in a way that had some give in it but was certainly a commitment that I think would have some credibility gains to it, I still think that, based on what we know and what we have experienced, the costs of achieving even that goal are going to be large [They might not be] precisely as shown on Mike's page 14, line 1, obviously; I don't know--nobody knows But I think it's prudent to have in mind that they might be Then the question becomes What can be done that works in the direction of reducing those costs? Again, Bob, I didn't mean to suggest that credibility was worth zip But I don't think it's prudent for this institution in the political world in which we live to bet the ranch on that because if we're wrong we've got a heck  -30-    12/18-19/89  of a problem on our hands So, if we're going to do this, Mr Chairman, I think we have to be very mindful of the need one way or another to try and find--or encourage others to find--policies outside of monetary policy that would complement achieving that goal in the least costly way possible, recognizing that under the best of circumstances the costs are not immaterial   Again, I don't want to seem like I'm marketing that idea because I'm not sure I believe it myself But the fact of the matter is that there is almost this mystique about that period in the '50s and early '60s People kind of look back and think about it and they say "Hey, wow" So what you're trying to capture is not a statistical phenomenon but almost a kind of state of mind   That's the other question that the Chairman won't let us discuss until later   Yes, we have an old [unintelligible] on that stuff   Well, I think that building the political support for even my softer version of the goal is going to be very, very difficult My hunch is that if you put the Neal Bill to a vote this afternoon it would be overwhelmingly defeated in both the Senate and the House  -44-    12/18-19/89   No I think it would be overwhelmingly defeated in both the Senate and the House; I don't think it would even be close Again, that's why I'm so sensitive to this cost thing And in terms of the work that Mike and his colleagues did, you could take other very credible economic [scenarios] and get cost calculations that are much more severe than the base case If you take the DRI model or something like that, why, you're just off the charts So, you would get this process where people would start doing the arithmetic; they wouldn't do it as well as these guys [on the Board staff] do it, but you don't have to be a genius--people can do the arithmetic And if you put it in those cold hard terms, I think it's a very, very--   I could have a field day with it if I were on the other side of the debate And that, of course, is one of the reasons why I think we've got to be very careful about how we state this and we've got to be excruciatingly careful about what we claim I don't by any means want to belabor this point, but I do worry a bit that in our collective zeal, and I do mean collective, we've got to be careful not to oversell what can be done and at what cost Because if we do leave the impression of a cost that turns out to be a low-ball estimate, we're going to get fried There's just no question about that whatsoever It's precisely for that reason, Mr Chairman, that I favor an effort to move us in [the right] direction, in Governor Kelley's terms; and it has to be accompanied by what Lee calls an educational process The focus there again has to come back to the relevance of other public policy I obviously agree, Wayne, that the capability is here But I feel very strongly that the costs are influenced, for example, by fiscal policy Unfortunately, there is a growing sentiment in this country now that not only says that fiscal policy is kind of out to lunch, but even worse, that we have had all these huge deficits in the '80s and everything is fine What's the problem? What's the worry? And you don't find that just from the extremes of the economic journalistic profession That is becoming an acceptable point of view to take in many circles So, not only do I think it's a hard sell, but at least insofar as the other elements of policy are concerned, we're not--to use your phrase--ahead of the curve, we're behind the curve Wayne, on your point about our reserve currency, there's nobody that feels more strongly [than I] about the role of United States currency But can you continue to [unintelligible] reserve currency, even if you do well on inflation, when your external debt is 35 percent of your GNP? Maybe you can, but I think that's really problematical So, there are a whole lot of things here that fit into this equation about political support My sense of it is that, to the extent we can make a couple of arguments that are compatible with what we're after and that have inherent political attraction to them, it helps What are those two arguments that have inherent political attraction to them? The two that I think ring the bells are first, the internal savings/investment issue Everybody recognizes that our investment rate in this country stinks The second and related issue is our external competitiveness Now, those ring the right bells in political circles And they can be structured in a way that is quite compatible with a Kelley version or    12/18-19/89  a Boehne version--whoever's version you want to pick--of moving persistently, consistently, but decisively, in the direction of a continued reduction in the rate of inflation within the kind of soft [time] target that I stated before   [Unintelligible] I was grasping for straws, Bob   I'll just add two quick comments One is that I do think we have had a genuine measure of success in terms of the Treasury's attitudes and eagerness That's not to say, as Alan said, that it guarantees anything for the future But I think there has been some clear progress there The second thing is more fundamental and that is that I think one can make a pretty good argument that even in the past six weeks the risks have shifted in a not inconsequential way in a direction--   I was saying that I think one can make a pretty good analytical case that even in the time frame of the past six weeks or so the risks have shifted in the direction in which rather than worrying about a strong dollar we could find ourselves worrying about a weak dollar And I think that just reinforces the basic case that a number of people have stated here So quite apart from the theology of it or the politics of it, I think the substance of it is clearly on that side   We're better off in the loop than out of the loop   So move  SPEAKER(?) I'll move it   So move   Second  -64-    12/18-19/89   My sense of the situation continues to be pretty much in line with Mike's forecast Looking forward that's probably as respectable a judgment as one can have It is interesting, though, to think a bit about the situation in the context of a question that Governor Johnson raised earlier, and that is If you go back to the beginning of the year, the growth of the economy for the year 1989 as a whole will in fact have been very, very close to what we were thinking back in February I think it's true that the differences in interest rates and exchange rates relative to the outlook then pretty much do cancel each other out But the question is If that is true retrospectively, what about prospectively? And I think the signs of greater weakness in the economy right here and now are of more concern than what happened in 1989 as a whole In looking at the sources of weaknesses in the economy now, we have to try to disentangle the reasons they are there When you're talking about a difference in growth between 2-1/2 percent and 1-1/2 percent, at least at the margin 1 percent means a lot But at the margin some of these things have to be kept in context For example, in both residential and nonresidential construction, we are now paying the price for a lot of overbuilding that took place in the past; and indeed a lot of it was at interest rates a heck of a lot higher than the interest rates we're looking at today or prospectively There are serious credit problems in this area, both with developers and suppliers I have a down-home example the contractor that we've used at the Bank for years We were about to let a contract when his insurance company wouldn't post bond for him for credit reasons And this is a company we've done business with for 50 years!   We paid them on time These problems are quite real What people are saying about a profit squeeze in the corporate sector is true and it has implications for fixed investment Why is that? Well, there are a lot of reasons but one is that inflation in wage and compensation costs is still pretty strong; and a second reason is this interest cost If you look at the corporate sector as a whole and break it down into 3 or 4 digit SIC industry groups, the interest cost running out of all this leveraging clearly is contributing to that problem Again, in the [auto] sector a lot of things have worked But I think it's hard to dismiss totally this kind of saturation or structural argument even in a context, as Si Keehn says, in which sales of cars and trucks this year still are going to be over 14-1/2 million units Now, those are very, very big numbers Having said that, I do think that in the very short run, which I'll define as the next couple of quarters, the risks are asymmetric on the down side But on the other hand, if we manage to wiggle through the next couple of quarters, I think the danger is that the risks could then shift in the opposite direction at least to neutral and maybe even to the up side And that's why I think this period is so tough   Have some very cold coffee  [Coffee break]   Yes Let me--   Let me just say a quick word on this financial fragility issue I say with some confidence that I'm probably as sensitive to that as anybody in the room, but I think we've got to keep that in some perspective First, where does it come from? I think there are two basic sources one is the macroeconomic imbalances that we've been living with for a long time that fundamentally reflect the policy mix problem; and the second source of it is what we have to regard as excesses, or maybe even outright speculation, in large segments of the financial markets and in important segments in the real economy, including the nonfinancial corporate sector and the real estate sector Obviously, we have to be sensitive to that fragility even though we may not like its causes But I think we've got to be extremely careful not to sanction it because of its causes So sensitive, yes; but sanction, no  In terms of policy, I see three options and they're not "A," "B," and "C" in Bluebook terms Basically they are first, to keep an asymmetric--perhaps a strongly asymmetric--directive and do nothing right now; second, to do something like what the Chairman just said, which essentially would mean moving 1/4 point on the funds rate or $125 million on borrowing while keeping an asymmetric directive; and  -91-    12/18-19/89  third, to do the quarter point on the funds rate and the corresponding borrowing adjustment now but go back to a symmetric directive   Okay Well, I myself would come out in my own camp three In other words, I'd take the borrowings down a notch right now, take the funds rate down a notch right now, and have a symmetric directive going forward The fundamental reason why I would do that I would translate in terms of what I earlier called the wiggle factor--trying to kind of wiggle through this period But in doing that, I would not in any way want to associate myself with some other statements that have been made that might suggest coming out the same place but for different reasons I am not terribly uncomfortable with where we are and I do think that looking further out the risks could change So, I'd say get this move behind us; do it right here today at the Committee meeting and accompany it with a symmetric directive going forward Thank you   That's about 1986--   To you  SPEAKER(?) The reputation of your Bank  -95-    12/18-19/89   Bob, that was part of what I meant by my wiggle factor   Can I just make one other comment, which is consistent with parliamentary procedure here? Harking back to your comment about throwing blankets, I'm not quite sure that I would go as far as you did The way I heard the discussion here in terms of people's first preferences--   Oh, okay   This is relevant, though   In terms of people's first preferences, the way I counted it you had a 10 to 8 vote among the group as a whole   No, the 18 participants   And in terms of whether we ease policy now or don't, there were several people whose first preference was not to ease but who said they could agree with easing now So I'm not sure that the blanket is as all encompassing as your early comment would suggest   Well, that's the point I wanted to emphasize Leaving aside the specific language here, I think the staff should make sure that the policy record is consistent with that view because I would not want to associate myself with anything that had any connotation of a rush to a further easing of monetary policy   I just wanted to make sure that that's [clear]   Yes   But we've done these things many, many, times   He doesn't work here!   You guys are going to get me changing my vote the way you're going here!   You're the one who is always advocating the financial variables Which way do you want it?   I seem to remember a relevant comment the other day in that speech of yours   I will   I prefer to put it in the record of the discussion What's at issue here to me is a heck of a lot more important than the aggregates per se We have a razor thin situation that we're looking at and I think that has to be duly and adequately and accurately reflected in the proceedings of this meeting   I'm not worried about your concerns being captured, I'm worried about mine   I really don't care as long as the other matter is taken care of   Mr Chairman, in terms of the outlook, our staff forecast is virtually identical with Mike's and Ted's both for this year and next The only difference is that we have domestic demand in 1990 a shade stronger The wage/productivity/ price components are for all intents and purposes identical to the second digit As a matter of fact, in looking at the two forecasts they're so close I'm inclined to think it raises the probability that they are both wrong!  On the more anecdotal side, in talking to business people in both small and large businesses, the impression I walk away with is that if you nudge them a little or maybe twist their arm a little they'll buy into that kind of forecast But I think the nagging, if not growing, sense of unease is that things might not turn out quite that way There has been a lot of talk about autos and real estate I get the impression, reinforced by the earlier conversation about transplants, that there are a number of people who are beginning to wonder if the auto situation is simply an inventory adjustment or if there might not be something more permanent there The real estate side--and the Second District is small geographically, but there are still a lot of people and a lot of buildings there--I would say is not by any stretch of the imagination in a calamitous state As Ed said, New Jersey and I think especially maybe northern New Jersey--   --is bordering on New England-type conditions But as far as New York is concerned, including Long Island and upstate, that would not be the case at all The general impression I have is that the residential market, including the upstate market which in people terms is big, is holding up okay with the exception of the very high-end segment of the market--the $2 million condos and the $1-1/2 million houses in Rye And as far as commercial real estate is concerned, again, we have not had even in  -19-    2/6-7/90  New York City anything like the extent of the overbuilding problem that characterizes many other major cities around the country So, while there's some overhang of office space in New York City, it is modest in comparison to many other cities around the country While it's not going to be a source of strength by any stretch of the imagination, I think the real estate market, with the exception of northern New Jersey, is probably not going to be any significant drag in terms of the overall national picture of the real estate sector  I did want to mention a point that Tom Melzer mentioned There clearly is a pervasive tightening in credit standards in depository institutions of all sizes And, Tommy, whether it's valid or not, there is absolutely no question that lenders are alleging that they are being pounded upon by examiners Some of what we're seeing here may reflect that Again, I can't tell whether it's giving them a convenient excuse to say "no" when they were looking for an excuse or whether there's something to it But certainly that is what one hears more and more from institutions, large and small  There's another development that is somewhat noteworthy and that is in the retail sector, which I think has been brought more to the fore by the Campeau situation It is very clear to me from comments by both suppliers and major retailers, including  that have some debt service problems of their own but are clearly not in the camp of the Campeau group, that supplier problems and even trade finance arrangements for these major retailers are now becoming a problem While they kind of "snuck through" the Christmas season, we are beginning to hear a lot of commentary from both sides, including at the very big chains, that they're terribly worried about their ability to get inventories into the stores for the Easter buying season Easter, of course, is nowhere near as big as Christmas but it is not trivial in relation to the total amount of retail sales from soft goods stores for the entire year Now, whether that problem will begin to straighten itself out remains to be seen But the commentary that I get, in the context of the Campeau situation, is that it's going to take a long, long, long time for that to get unscrambled And as long as it is not unscrambled, notwithstanding the theoretical protections to suppliers that grow out of the bankruptcy proceeding, getting a steady flow of merchandise into these stores except [by paying] cash may not be the easiest thing over the period ahead and possibly for an extended period of time  That, of course, bears a bit on the other situation that I think accounts for some of this sense of discomfort I referred to earlier, and that is the very obvious and continued shrinkage on Wall Street Again, in one sense it's a relatively small sector of the economy, but I think it does have some psychological overhang in other sectors as well Now, if any of you have read, as I have recently, Barbarians at the Gate you might be inclined to say that that adjustment is overblown Be that as it may, I think that too contributes a bit to this sense of uneasiness I mentioned before  Having cited those factors that I think do account for that sense of unease, I myself still think that the likely outcome is something like the staff forecast One thing consistent with that is that we are getting reports that exports, especially of high value specialized goods, are holding up quite well Indeed, I draw at least a small sense of comfort in that regard from the most recent set of  -20-    2/6-7/90  business statistics So, I guess the bottom line is that I think we're okay, but it's going to be a close call   Hopefully without precipitating unnecessary debate, could I just make a quick comment on this recent rise in long-term interest rates? I may be missing something, but I don't find it all that hard to explain at all, and I think some of it is temporary But abstracting from that, it seems to me that as long as we're in a situation where we have to attract $100 billion or more a year from the rest of the world and we have been through a period in which our interest rates have been falling and interest rates in the two massive surplus countries, Germany and Japan, have risen sharply in recent weeks, either one or two things are going to happen Either we're going to see upward pressure on domestic rates here or downward pressure on the exchange rate or both   Well, that is another possibility, although I have a little trouble seeing that in the immediate term   But looking at it in that light, it seems to me that what we're seeing is a rather vivid illustration of the box we're in with respect to the interactions between domestic interest rates, foreign interest rates--in the surplus countries in particular--and the exchange rate It really illustrates how difficult the policy environment is   For 1990 I'd just keep it simple alternative II for the reasons that you and Mr Parry have stated   I second   Can I go back to a different issue in the context of M2 or M3 and debt?   I want to make a comment about debt that actually goes back to something else Governor Angell said As I think about it here, I must say that I have some sympathy with the idea of making the debt range, within the framework of the motion that's on the table, 5 to 9 percent I think Don's observation is right that it's likely to come in somewhere around 7 percent That range has some appeal to me for both the cosmetics and the substance of being able to say that we think the growth rate in debt has at last subsided--in a context in which in the minds of a lot of people the growth of debt has been symbolic of some of the excesses of the past-- and of being able to point to an adjustment in the range of debt from 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent all the way down to 5 to 9 percent   I agree with him   I'll second it   So would I   I think the edge--   I think Mr Boykin's suggestion makes good sense   Further questions for Mr Kohn? President Parry   That would follow from the crash--   "B," also symmetric This has all been said, but in this intermeeting period I think the chances are at least 50/50 that we will see some further increases in interest rates abroad There is some danger that that could result in a real watershed situation either for domestic interest rates or exchange rates or both But that really does put me squarely in the symmetric camp   Move it   One of the things that the Drexel case shows is that if there are serious problems in one part of the firm, those problems cannot be isolated from the rest of the firm In that case, even though the primary dealer that we do business with had capital in excess of regulatory guidelines and all the rest of it, once the name of the firm was so badly tarnished, people wouldn't do business with the government security firm even in a context of book entry transactions in government securities So you can't fully isolate or insulate the primary dealer from the affairs of the firm as a whole    3/27/90  But if we ever have a need to raise a concern about the affairs of a firm as a whole, we always do it in very close collaboration with the SEC We go to extraordinary lengths in all of these types of issues through the day-to-day, at times hour-to-hour, very close if not intimate, working relationship with the SEC The SEC is always center stage Again, in the case of this company, it also happens to be true that some of the most serious problems that were encountered once the chute went up happened to be in entities that were not regulated by the SEC at all So both we and the SEC had the problem of these unregulated entities being the focal point of some of the greatest sources of tension as they applied to markets generally But, Governor Seger, we do try to maintain what we loosely think of as a fit-and-proper standard that's built into the written, published guidelines for primary dealers What it essentially tries to say is that we recognize that even where, as in this case, the business entity that we're doing business with is fine--indeed, this was a good government securities dealer--if the rest of the firm gets into deep trouble, no matter how good the entity is that we're doing business with and even though it may be a business entity to itself, it will be contaminated by the problems of the rest of the firm And that, of course, is precisely what happened We try to walk that fine line, and there is no case where we would make the point about any other aspect of the firm without close consultation and collaboration with the SEC   We would never say anything about whether a firm should be doing junk bond financing or not We might make a comment, as we did in this case, about the overall liquidity of the firm--about the ability of the firm to meet its obligations in the event of adversity And we might stress, as we did, that they ought to be thinking seriously about how they would respond to problems But we would never say they should or shouldn't do this or that We would always be very, very general If we thought something specific needed to be said we would call Mr Ketchum or Mr Breeden or somebody [else at the SEC] and say "Look, you ought to be aware of this" We were the ones that first called to the attention of the SEC the fact that the excess capital was being taken out of the broker dealer We never told them what they should do about it, but we certainly informed them of it; and it was up to them what they did about it   Right   That's correct Oh, sure   Technically, I don't think we have legal authority I think it grows out of--   Oh, sure   It's a very fine line We agonized in the period after Drexel had pleaded guilty under what the US attorney [unintelligible] and had entered into this agreement with the SEC There was just no question that the government securities entity itself had nothing to do with all these problems And we agonized about the kind of point that Governor Johnson is making Should we, on the basis of general fit-and-proper standards, terminate in a public way our relationship with the firm? As I said, we talked about it at great length and finally decided that doing that in a public way, given all that was going on, probably in and of itself would have produced the immediate demise of the firm as a whole So what we did, in effect, was put them on a formal probation We put them on notice that if they failed to live up to all of the commitments they had made to the US attorney and to the SEC, we would publicly stop doing business with them But it was one of those very tough calls on an issue; I think in retrospect our instincts were right Had we just overtly, publicly, stopped doing business with them instead of privately putting them on notice and putting them on probation, it's now very clear to me that that action, had we taken it, would have caused the demise of the firm; it was that tender Now, it happened anyway I must say I would rather that it happened the way it did than as a result of some overt action on our part   It's still hard to tell   One of the problems, too, in terms of what may be left is that you have to take the common things like their leasehold obligations Their leasehold obligations, believe it or not, are in the area of $11 million a month   And there are a lot of leases   Well, you do hear it in real estate   Second   I think the tone of the business situation is better, judged at least by the decibel [level] currently of people who in preceding months were concerned that the economy was really going to go off the edge I think part of that simply is a reflection of the view that, at least statistically, both the fourth quarter and the first quarter are probably going to turn out better than a lot of people expected If you recall, it wasn't that long ago when it was quite possible to find a lot of people who were expecting a negative real GNP number in either the fourth or the first quarter or both And that is no longer the case   Yes, I know   Looking at the components, I think part of the improvement in the tone of the business situation that I detect is rightly characterized as the collective breathing of a sigh of relief Now, how much better the situation is in underlying terms is a little tougher to tell But my sense is that it probably is better in underlying terms as well Some of the comments around the table are consistent with that For example, Si Keehn talks about sales of 14-1/2 million trucks and cars, and that's not a bad year That's a lot Even before the meeting today I thought there were two sectors of the economy that at the margin could make quite a difference and those are agriculture and energy I find it  -31-    3/27/90  interesting that Roger and Si and Bob Forrestal and Bob Boykin are suggesting that conditions in those two industries, even outside of the Southwest in the energy area, show a little snip of a pickup in activity And at the margin, those two sectors of the economy can make a distinct difference So in terms of the business outlook, the staff forecast is probably a reasonable depiction of the situation It's very similar to our forecast; the difference probably is that one may have a little more confidence in it than was the case several months ago  Now, on this credit crunch issue, I think there is something to it but I'm not sure it's as pervasive and fundamental as perhaps some think I get a sense of it, for example, with banks in northern New Jersey and Long Island where we've had some excesses in real estate lending as well On the other hand, I don't get much of a sense of it at all from the money center banks; the money center banks are simply complaining about a lack of business--period There's another thing that we have to keep in mind about this silent credit crunch During much of the second half of the 1980s we had a situation in the country when private credit demands were growing very, very rapidly and private credit growth was way out of line with historical relationships relative to GNP And now what we are seeing is that a lot of that credit growth was bad credit We're seeing it in chargeoffs in the banking industry, in the thrift industry, and in markdowns of prices of junk bonds So, I'm not so sure that some margin of greater discipline in the credit origination process is something we should be terribly concerned about It's probably a good thing In terms of the small business side of it, again, I don't get the sense from our small business advisory groups and others that well-run small businesses are having any particular problem with credit availability That doesn't mean there aren't some who are having trouble, but I don't think it's a general phenomenon  On inflation, in underlying terms, I come out where Gary Stern does We've been stuck at 4-1/2 percent or something like that for a long time I think what is different right now is that if one expected that we were going to do better than that, what the recent information suggests, of course, is that that's not going to come about very easily But I myself don't think that the inflation situation has deteriorated in any significant way; it just refuses to get better, which is a problem in its own right  The biggest area of uncertainty in my mind continues to be the external side of the economy Ted has one scenario built into the forecast; he described another The fact of the matter is that you probably could put together three or four external scenarios, each of which would be strikingly different from the others and none of which could automatically be ruled out of hand There is a range of uncertainties not just because of exchange rates but because of political developments, economic developments--the whole spectrum So, I think the range of possible outcomes in the external sector out over the next six to eight quarters is really very wide indeed  The only other point I would make, Mr Chairman--I don't have to make it but maybe you do--is that the renewed discussion here about the budgetary situation is possibly interesting Rostenkowski's pronouncement, of course, has gotten shot down, as I'm sure he thought it would Nevertheless, I still find it rather surprising, and maybe  -32-    3/27/90  even a bit encouraging, that somebody like Rostenkowski was willing to put his cards on the table in the budget arena I don't know whether that's just ceremonial or if there are some straws in the wind that would suggest that something constructive might happen on the budget front As I said, I don't know if you want to comment on that later or not   I have no stomach at all for changing policy right now either, but I came here with a very, very mild preference for asymmetric language My preference is probably a bit stronger for asymmetric language, but operationally I don't think it matters a lot We can react to incoming data as needed in either  -45-    3/27/90  case I think the only real argument that can be made for asymmetric has been made; as I say, I can be reasonably comfortable with "B" [symmetric]   But the issue shouldn't swing on that question   First of all, I very much agree with Ed Boehne I think we have to be pragmatic about these matters It's quite clear that every central banker that is worth his salt, regardless of country of origin, is going to want a strong currency And that covers even [unintelligible] But against that backdrop and the immediately past history, I would go even a step further, Ed, in the distinctions that you made There are intervention activities that are aimed at countering disorderly markets in the historical context of that word There are intervention activities that may aim at trying to check what seems to be an unsustainable rise in currency x But then there are also intervention activities that are at least perceived as seeking to beat down your own currency I think in the immediate past a lot of the tension, not just between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury but between nations--including both central banks and finance ministries--really has focused on that point Indeed, I think much of the dissatisfaction around this table has been targeted at that point ie, intervention tactics or strategies that seem to have as their sole purpose stomping on our own currency So, that is a third distinction that I think is useful in trying to put these issues in perspective   I was going to get to that issue in a minute   Given the kind of institutional background that we operate in, it seems to me that with respect to the distinction I tried to draw as to the motivation for intervention in the first place, the first kind of troublesome threshold we all come  -57-    3/27/90  up against is this debate as to whether intervention works Indeed, there are very sharp differences of opinion even around this table Some people are against intervention because they say it doesn't work and other people are against it because they say it does work I don't see quite how you square that circle Then, you look at the great body of empirical analysis, some of which was summarized in Paper 11 That paper seems to say that it's pretty hard to find evidence that it does work I have to say that I'm a little agnostic on that point And I want to try to make the point that my agnosticism does not grow out of my place of origin, Liberty Street I've asked my people to look at this question for me in some detail and I was very scrupulous I asked some of the old timers like Dick Davis to look at it knowing their institutional biases; but I asked some people whose roots actually are here, like Bonnie Loopesko, to look at it And they both tell me the same thing What they say, basically, is that while maybe you can't draw a clear conclusion that intervention works, you can't draw one that it doesn't work Moreover, they make the point that there is also a non-empirical foundation that tells us what determines exchange rates in the first place--whether intervention does or doesn't [work] or whether anything does or doesn't [work] So, I think one has to have at least a healthy element of skepticism or agnosticism in terms of drawing sweeping conclusions on that threshold point  My own view is not unlike Governor Johnson's in that intuitively I think it can work at least in the short run And because it can work I think we should treat it as though it does work Now, in that setting, the questions about profits and losses, opportunity costs, size of portfolio, and amount of balances in some sense are secondary We can find ways, I think, to deal with those But it does seem to me that the threshold questions are What role should this institution play in the process, if any? And in addressing that question, it's important to keep in mind that for most of this decade we essentially have been operating with a currency that has been strong rather than weak But it wasn't that long ago--the latter part of the previous decade--when things were distinctly the other way around And we went hat in hand to the rest of the world asking them to help defend our currency Now, whether that worked or not, whether it was an expedient or not, or whether we were short- sighted or not as a nation, is beside the point That's what we did And there is no guarantee that we might not have to face those circumstances again at some point in the future So, I think that in itself is a reason not to throw the proverbial baby out with the bath water  As I see it, the biggest danger with intervention--whether it's done by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury or both--is the danger that it can ultimately co-opt monetary policy That, I think, is the ultimate risk And that has a bearing on this question of whether we should be a part of the process or not To me, the danger of co-opting monetary policy in some underlying sense is greater when we're out of the picture than when we're in the picture I think it transcends the question of whether the Chairman with his considerable persuasive powers, or Mr Cross and Mr Truman with their persuasive powers, can browbeat the Undersecretary or the Secretary of the Treasury into a more sensible position day-by-day It's much more fundamental than that And I think that alone is more than a sufficient reason why the Federal Reserve should maintain a  -58-    3/27/90  continuing, active, involved posture and presence in these matters I also think that our international relationships lead to the same conclusion We may think we'll scare the heck out of the Treasury by telling them we aren't going to play, but if the world at large-- including our sister central banks--felt that that was our attitude, it would scare the heck out of them too That in itself might produce precisely the problem that we're most interested in avoiding, and that is a weak currency rather than a strong currency   If the international community of central banks thought that the Federal Reserve was throwing in the towel and leaving this whole business to the Treasury, I don't think they'd be very happy As a matter of fact, I don't think the international financial community would be very happy   For now they might be, but I don't think that the perception that the Federal Reserve was jumping ship on the process would be well received   Well, I think he probably would   Well, I concede that we--   I concede that, especially in the case of 1978 policies in general, we probably were short-sighted But I don't think things are quite that one dimensional Again, in the immediate circumstance, would it be a good thing, unambiguously good, if the yen [fell] from 157 to 200? It's not at all clear to me that that is unambiguously good   And with those circumstances, it seems to me that we have a constructive role to play in terms of--   Well, let me just finish here I'll come back to that The point I was making was on the threshold question of whether we as an institution should maintain a meaningful presence in this arena I'm suggesting that we should And the last reason I cited as to why I thought we should was not just for fear of loss of monetary policy autonomy in a domestic context, but that it would not be well received by the world at large if they literally felt that we had jumped ship on the process Indeed, I for one could not [imagine] asking the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to go off to a G-7 meeting next Saturday with his hands tied squarely behind his back I don't think that's in the interest of the Federal Reserve; I don't think it's in the interest of the United States of America; and I don't think it's in the interest of the well being of the world economy So, the threshold question I'm trying to address is Are we in or are we out? And in my judgment we're far better off in   The threshold question is Are we in or out? You know where I come out on that Then we get to the question of procedures, the question of tactics, the question of portfolios and so on Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have some sympathy with what Ed Boehne said that there probably is room for some more systematic procedures at the Committee level to try and help members' comfort levels with what we're doing But even there, at the end of the day I think the Chairman in particular has to have an appropriate degree of flexibility And I'm not quite sure, Ed, how you square the circle in terms of what I interpreted your suggestion to be Now, whether it means there should be a more systematic review or reports after the fact of G-7 meetings and other things like that or whether--and I personally hope not--we have to go so far as having a directive that mirrors the domestic directive, I'm not sure But if you're saying, Manley, that we ought to have some better mousetraps within a context along the broad lines that I think we're all talking about, I don't have any problem with that   The problem with that is none of us can anticipate what the Chairman is going to run into at one of those meetings   You cannot anticipate that   In those circumstances, you're painting a picture not unlike what was true in the United States here in the late 1970s We were unable or unwilling to face up to our problems Now, that's going to break at some point But in those precise circumstances that you described, if you asked me whether I would be willing to support modest intervention in the context in which the dollar is rising in a major way, I'd say "Sure" I wouldn't have any trouble with that I would have no illusions about what it was doing but if it was doing nothing more than keeping us in the ballgame in terms of having some influence on the fundamental ways that these problems ultimately were to kick out, I'd say that's a small price to pay   I would not support that   You have Roger [Guffey]   Well, I think the danger of the Treasury getting us into entangling alliances through G-7 type mechanisms escalates in a circumstance in which the rest of the world thinks we're on the sidelines So, there's that danger first of all Second, I do agree with the Chairman that any form of intervention can be sterilized But I think Governor Johnson's problem and Lee Hoskins' problem--about the markets interpreting what the policy of the United States government is--gets greatly heightened in those circumstances Even now, quite apart from the dollar situation, there's this drift in newspapers and elsewhere about the Administration wanting the Fed to ease Now, that's enough of a problem in and of itself But if that same problem surfaced in a context in which the markets knew that we had gone on vacation insofar as exchange rate policy is concerned and in effect had abdicated to the Treasury, I think those concerns would be amplified in a very significant way both internationally and domestically So, while I agree that even the Treasury's intervention can be sterilized by us, I think the psychology of the marketplace changes in a way that is very detrimental to the interest of good monetary policy in a context in which we simply decide we're going on vacation   But even there the Congress still holds the deck   That's right   There's no danger of that happening   In terms of Tom Melzer's question, just based on discussions that I know you've had and one that I've had, the Treasury--or at least the Secretary of the Treasury--knows full well about both the policy and philosophical views that are at this table Now, they may not know that we have this big fat book in front of us There's no danger--zero--that they would misconstrue what the Chairman would be saying to them; no danger of that at all   I don't think they'd push it at that   Is your concern about the $45 billion the risk of loss or is it something other than that?   There's a chart or table--I forget which--in one of the many studies here that indicates, for what it's worth, that our foreign currency balances relative to our sister central banks are really quite small   We can [unintelligible] it now   I will make the motion   I'll move it   Because they are not exactly [unintelligible] to the idea of the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates   I wouldn't expect them to raise the issue at that forum   In that environment I'm sure they wouldn't   Alan, is Mike Prell there?    4/11/90   Mike, what are you thinking about in terms of the first quarter now?   Thank you   So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   Well, Mr Chairman, the impression I get from business people, particularly on the manufacturing side, is more in line with Mike's forecast than it is with the last three weeks of data I just don't have any sense that things suddenly fell out of bed on us here Exports are holding up quite well More generally, people are saying that business at least has stopped getting worse The computer business appears to be showing a renewed spark, and I don't know what to make of that Some of the commentary I hear even from suggests that maybe there's a little more to that than even they thought   That's probably part of it; they sure feel better So, as I said, the impressionistic information is much more in line with Mike's forecast than these very recent data Our own forecast is quite similar as well, although the policy assumptions are different We don't have a rise in short-term interest rates anything like what is in Mike's forecast and the results are about the same  On this credit crunch question, I've read all the surveys and listened to all the comments around the table, and I still can't quite shake a sense of uneasiness that there may be something there that we just haven't seen yet Of course, I have absolutely no evidence of that But possibly, just possibly, the money supply, especially M3, may be saying something about that But who knows? I'd like to dismiss it completely, but I can't quite bring myself to that  As for inflation, I blow a little hot and cold on the question of whether the underlying inflation rate has changed Where I am at the moment is that if it has changed, it has changed only a tad and maybe it is basically unchanged in core terms But whatever conclusion you draw about what's happened to the core inflation rate in recent quarters, I think what you have to be impressed with, notwithstanding all this talk about credibility and all the rest of it, is that the only way that the core inflation rate is going to come down is if there's a lot more slack in the economy With the structure of the economy today, there just doesn't seem to be much to suggest that that's going to change in a downward direction in any appreciable way, given the kinds of resource utilization patterns we have right now But that, I think, is going to create an acute dilemma for this Committee very soon, and I'm thinking in terms of this budget package I don't know whether they will get one or not I suspect that there's probably a better chance of that today than at any time in the recent past And then all of a sudden we will have what we have all said we needed--what we have all been pleading for, begging for, and cajoling for And it seems to me that the policy dilemma that the Committee is going to face in those circumstances is going to be rather awesome even if long-term interest rates come down  -19-    5/15/90  by themselves, which I'm sure they will But I think that is something that we're going to have to reflect upon a good deal I don't think that's an urgent matter because I don't think they can cut a deal that fast   I still think it has to be thought about a bit If there is a deal of some substance, it's going to make things very difficult for us in an ironic kind of fashion   You may But, as I say, in the context in which that core inflation rate is either a tad higher or stuck, that's going to be a pretty difficult environment for us   Just to come full circle, I find myself quite sympathetic with Governor Angell and Governor Johnson But I can associate myself with the prescription that you put on the table, Mr Chairman I also think, though, that this "beefed up" language--if I can put it that way--in the policy record is very important And even though I have an uneasiness about this credit crunch issue, I would agree with Bob Parry that it would be a mistake in this key part of the policy record to frame this position on those grounds, partly because I'm afraid that that is susceptible to the interpretation that we intend [unintelligible] I would be inclined to take that beefed up language and couch it more in terms of the economy, as you did a few moments ago, and the concern about the inflationary process   No question   As I said, if that language can have some of that flavor and stay away for that purpose from this credit crunch matter, I'd be a lot happier   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Mike, again in the area of the budget, but leaving aside RTC-type things, could you give me some sense as to the sensitivity of the [1991] budget deficit estimate to economic assumptions? What is [the effect of a difference of] 1 percentage point of GNP or 1 percent on the unemployment [rate] or something like that on the actual budget deficit excluding--   How much?   What I was trying to ask was this Looking at your earlier charts on page 3 for the differences in 1991 between the staff numbers and the Administration numbers for GNP, unemployment, etc, if you had to make a very rough ballpark guess, what does all that translate to in terms of the budget deficit?   Yes, that was what I thought   I don't know if my memory is very good this evening but I think there was another element in that    7/2-3/90  surcharge in 1968 And that is that for a long time prior to the point when the surcharge was supposed to come into play, there were a number of senior Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Martin, who were pushing publicly and privately very, very hard to get some kind of a tax to finance the war I certainly wasn't around or close enough to the situation to know whether or not all of their pushing put them in a position where there might have been some understanding of a [quid pro quo] Certainly, the visible case was the one that Mike cited that it was treated--whether because it was misunderstood or for other reasons--as if it were a permanent large tax increase [unintelligible] But I suspect there was a little more to it than that   Mr Chairman, to start with, our own forecast continues to be very, very similar to Mike's forecast both in terms of GNP and inflation There are some minor differences around the edges but they are really quite small But insofar as the kind of bias [unintelligible] around the forecast is concerned, I associate myself with the comments that Mr Boehne made at the opening of this discussion And that is, if somebody put a gun to my head and said "You have to put a forecast down," that's the forecast I would put down But I don't think I'd have quite the same confidence in that forecast that I would have had three or four months ago--again, for some of the reasons that Ed Boehne mentioned Anecdotally, there are some aspects of the consensus forecast that look pretty good Certainly, the impression I get is that the export sector still is quite strong, quite similar to Ted's forecast if not even a bit stronger in volume terms Again from what people say, the capital goods sector seems to be hanging in there but it is not robust by any stretch of the imagination One interesting thing that someone mentioned to me just the other day--I don't know, Bob Parry, if you picked this up--was that this was the first instance that this individual could remember of a domestic airline failing to exercise options on Boeing 737s that they had had for three years I get the sense that the capital goods sector is okay, but certainly not robust  The real estate sector is a tough call Two or three things strike me there one is that I do get the sense that the second- and third-level effects of the contraction of real estate are beginning to show up a little more directly for derivative products That's not by any means confined to the Northeast On the other hand, having spent a lot of time over the past several weeks with both bankers and with  -20-    7/2-3/90  my own examiners, some of whom I think are pretty darn good at this real estate stuff, the feeling I get is that while there is more bad news in the pipeline there isn't a sense of any kind of rout yet to come There may be pockets geographically or otherwise in which that is true But even in terms of what my own examiners tell me, drawing from the credit files and so forth, they see some things out there that still worry them, but they do not see a collapse in real estate markets generally  On the other hand, for what it's worth, those same examiners are more concerned today than they were 6 or 12 months ago about another round of LBO-related problems This is stuff that they don't feel they know enough or are sure enough about to be able to significantly downgrade some of these [unintelligible] credits, but based on their experience their comfort zone is lower [They cannot] justify substantial changes in classifications but they do tell me that they are more concerned about some of the LBO-related loans that are in there right now So, there are some good aspects in that they don't see, nor do I sense from the major banks, a further black hole with regard to the real estate situation, although in the case of some of the small banks and some of the regional banks in the Northeast I don't think they would be quite as confident because those institutions have a much higher concentration in real estate loans than big banks In the minds of everybody I talk to who has a broad- based business concern or lending concern, the big question is the consumer and what the consumer is thinking and going to do I come away with an impression, not unlike what Gary Stern was saying, of so far so good But I have this nagging feeling that any kind of a shock could knock consumer spending off in the wrong direction  Now, on the credit crunch issue more generally, I think we all have problems trying to rationalize [or to] quantify what we seem to see I think that's partly because it is a financial shrinkage that has many different aspects to it Much of it is demand-side oriented; some of it is supply-side oriented But a lot of it is a reaction of both supply and demand to excesses of the past When you try to put that all together, it's very hard to quantify; but I continue to think that there is something of consequence going on Take the example that Joan Lovett referred to in her remarks about the Chrysler matter a couple of weeks ago, where it was announced that Chrysler was being put on a credit watch list for its commercial paper ratings and, just on the basis of the announcement alone, within three or four business days Chrysler had drawn down its bank lines by almost $3-1/2 billion to replace commercial paper that it couldn't roll over That was just on the basis of an announcement! Now, one of the interesting things about that is that Chrysler had fully paid backup lines throughout the banking system The bankers are saying to me point blank that if somebody comes in looking to draw on their lines and they don't have fully paid lines, forget it--the loans simply aren't going to be made I think that is symptomatic of this very, very cautious, and ultimately healthy, process of shrinkage and consolidation that's going on But any way you cut it, I think there is clearly something there Again, I go back to Mr Boehne's comment  On the inflation front, my sense of the situation at the moment is that the so-called core inflation rate hasn't changed Maybe it is poised to go down, but when I read articles like I read in  -21-    7/2-3/90  this morning's paper about automobile price increases I have to wonder In that sector everything is--   --identified with responding to problems [by raising] prices I don't think that quite tells me we're out of the woods yet on the inflation side Thank you, Mr Chairman   When is your term over?   So you'd have 2 to 6 percent in both years, then?   What about M3?   Let me make a general comment first, and that is that I cannot quite shake the feeling that there may be something going on here that's a little more real Even all the discussion about the RTC represents something very real; and what it represents is that in the prior period there was a heck of a lot of bad debt created in the financial system So, it's not just a kind of accounting change What I keep toying with in my mind is that there is perhaps a small possibility that we are going through a phase here where this retrenchment of the financial system, as symbolized by the RTC and the slow growth of bank credit and the slowdown of overall debt, is something quite real and something that need not even be transitory If you look at the great bulk of experience over recent years, we have had this very substantial disconnection, for example, between the growth of debt in the economy and the growth of GNP And it turns out that a lot of that disconnection reflects the fact that a lot of that debt was bad debt It's now showing up as RTC and bank write-offs and junk bond write-offs, etc So, there may be something here that goes beyond the so-called transitory factors  I tend to take a rather eclectic view of all these Ms, but I am struck that even Mr Kohn can't explain, no matter how hard he tries, a sizable part of the shortfall in M2 in the second quarter So, again, I'm not quite sure that we fully grasp, or at least that I fully grasp, all that's going on here in these relationships For that reason I think we do have to be a bit more cautious about the interpretations that we put on these things  Now, with that general point in mind, Mr Chairman, for 1990 I would keep M2 where it is at 3 to 7 percent and keep debt where it is at 5 to 9 percent For 1991, I'd be thinking in terms of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for debt For M3, I'm quite prepared to let you do whatever you feel most comfortable doing But even in the framework of letting you do whatever you feel most comfortable doing, it's possible that a compromise--in the interest of cohesion in the Committee--might be to put it at 1 to 5 percent for  -40-    7/2-3/90  both years But I have no strong feeling on that at all; I'm quite prepared to let you explain it because basically you've got to explain it one way or another Either you have to explain why we changed it or you have to explain why we didn't change it And I would leave that to you   Well, I'm basically in the same place I came to the meeting thinking that there were three choices available to the Committee One was an asymmetric plain vanilla kind of directive; the second was a strongly asymmetric directive, which is what I think your suggestion amounts to; and the third was even the possibility of easing right now My own strong position was the second of those choices, the strongly asymmetric directive, so I support completely your proposition   It's an asymmetric comfort then   Well, first of all, in terms of the national outlook, I think the staff has done as well as anybody could possibly do in terms of trying to capture what might happen and what the contingencies are For what it's worth, both our baseline forecast and our alternative forecast are really quite similar to the kinds of things the staff is talking about About the only material difference is that in the next two quarters we probably have the real economy a bit softer and the inflation rate a bit higher But over the forecast period as a whole, the numbers both internally and externally (on trade) are really quite similar to the staff's baseline forecast There are multiple risks In the very short run the greatest risk or uncertainty, of course, is that the Iraqi situation will turn into a shooting war I've talked to some people who know something about the oil infrastructure in that part of the world and the impression I get is that even if it were a very short armed conflict, a guy like Hussein could do one heck of a lot of damage in a very short period of time to the oil infrastructure in terms of pipelines and that type of thing So, again, even if a shooting war were very short and very decisive for the good guys, the damage that could be done to the oil infrastructure in a matter of days is quite substantial, I gather   All the pipelines I gather are above ground even when they're far removed from Iraq or Kuwait itself So, they are just sitting there And the potential for substantial damage when you have a crazy guy like this guy is quite real   All of that would, consistent with what Gary says, involve some substantial stimulus from a lot of sources Anyway, I think the staff's effort to try and capture both the baseline and some of the contingencies is as good as one can do it in these circumstances Leaving that aside, an interesting way to think about this is to ask what was going on pre-Iraq and what superimposing Iraq means I have to say that my impression is that even prior to the Iraqi invasion the attitudes in the business community--both big business and small business--were souring My sense is that the economy, if anything, was softer rather than stronger and that even before the very latest CPI number the inflation rate was higher rather than lower--not in any decisive way, but certainly the hopes that the inflation rate was going to bend down, I think, were fading I agree with some of the others who said  -22-    8/21/90  that--again, even before the Iraqi invasion--expectations had soured quite significantly in terms of the prospects for any kind of a meaningful budget compromise Obviously, the Middle East situation has made all of those things worse, at least in the short run What I hear now is not only more overt talk about the risks of recession but a crescendo of opinion about a vicious form of stagflation in which the inflation rate, at least for the foreseeable future, could be significantly higher in a context in which the economy is just sitting there Now, the good news in all of this that I detect rather overtly in many instances is that there is a recognition in the business community and maybe even on Main Street that, at least in the short run, it's not something that is subject to any quick fix by monetary policy I think there is a recognition that all of this does put quite a constraint on monetary policy Indeed, I'm even surprised about the number of people who talk overtly about not making the same mistakes that were made in the 1970s when, in the eyes of many people, oil prices and energy shocks were allowed to feed into the general pattern of wage and price setting So, there may be at least that element of realism there Nevertheless, I have the impression at this point that things are very much on the gloomy side  One quick footnote on the real estate situation You can get many different stories there; it depends upon whom you talked to last But what I'm impressed with is that my examiners--who I think are pretty darn good, especially in real estate--are very much of the mind that the situation had to get worse before it was going to get better And again, that was before any further problems were superimposed on that situation   I also would support your formulation It's probably fair to say in my case that prior to the Iraqi developments, I would have leaned to easing in any event As things stand right now, I probably would come fairly close to associating myself with Mr Boehne's definition of the situation But I also think it's so uncertain that it could easily go the other way I could easily envision unpleasant circumstances where we might have to tighten monetary policy I say that not because I favor that, but only because it captures the range of emotions that I think is really on the table As I say, your formulation is fine with me as things sit right now I would lean toward Mr Boehne's prescription, but depending upon what happens I might be a lot more cautious about seeking out an opportunity to ease   This is Jerry Corrigan I think there is a tremendous amount of anxiety out there The anxiety may be worse in some ways than the reality, but it's there There is a lot of sentiment in the markets and elsewhere on the side that there is a kind of window, if you want to put it that way, where policy might be more accommodative But I don't see that the window is there on the basis of these numbers and the other numbers we have seen in the last couple of weeks At least for now, I too would associate myself with the position you've taken   Mr Chairman, Jerry Corrigan up in New York Let me make several comments First of all, this dollar question is becoming a matter of increasing concern to me I think the dollar question itself has been joined with a lot of the banking issues and questions, especially abroad I mentioned to you, Alan, on Friday, that last Tuesday I had an occasion to visit with  banks in London And one of the major themes of our conversation--which gets back to something Sam mentioned earlier-- was that we have this rather unusual phenomenon of the dollar being on the weak side in the midst of an international crisis One of the things he said in very unmistakable terms was that large flows of funds into US institutions and US dollars, which they themselves would ordinarily expect, were not there Funds were finding their way into British and other institutions and into non-dollar instruments, not only because of the uncertain macroeconomic situation in the United States but also because of the elevated concerns and perceptions in Europe about the banking situation in the United States And I think that reinforces macroeconomic considerations In those circumstances, it seems to me that the dollar presents another risk beyond the one just [mentioned] on price level effects and that is, though we still have this big financing need, any significant further weakness of the dollar itself runs the risk of cutting the wrong way in terms of how it plays out in long-term interest rates here in the United States I should also say that impressionistically and otherwise, I think that this credit contraction process has yet to run its course For example, I know that some of the major banking institutions are going to be in an asset contraction [mode] for the foreseeable future, in part because of supervisory policies and initiatives but also because these institutions are distinctly on the side of being gun shy But beyond that, I have had further anecdotal evidence that suggests that asset contraction by important regional institutions is having the effect of rationing out some who are perceived to be creditworthy borrowers--and in some cases creditworthy borrowers not associated with the real estate business So, I think    9/17/90  that is still at work, though it's very, very difficult for us to quantify it in any sense  Insofar as the economy itself is concerned, I would agree with the judgment that several have made that we don't, at this precise point in time, see evidence of a cumulating process of downward pressure But, I must say, given the sourness of business and consumer attitudes, that I don't think it will take a heck of a lot to give us the message Having said all of that, and having debated mightily with myself and my colleagues, my own view of policy at the moment is that we ought to try to sit tight here a bit longer in the hope that we do get something rather promptly in the budget area that is at least reasonably credible to the marketplace In those circumstances, the dollar situation would tend to be a bit better, depending upon the [actual budget] package As things stand right now, I think the likelihood is that we should ease at least a step further, but I'd rather sit it out here a bit longer in the hope that we can do that in the context of something of a positive nature in the budget process   I'll make a comment in the context of Ed Boehne's question In this immediate setting I think it is also true that concern abroad about financial fragility--or whatever you want to call it--in the United States and in US financial institutions unquestionably has been a factor in the timeframe of the last month or so It's impossible to quantify that, but there's no question in my mind that that's a factor   You're absolutely right As long as there are legions of very, very well paid people out there whose livelihood depends upon their ability to understand every nuance in Mr Sternlight's activities, we're stuck with it   Actually, that would do it!   It's true, though, that there are literally thousands of people all over the world who do only that   I don't think it would change it   No matter what we did, unless we really went the whole distance by going through some kind of a quantity as opposed to a rate--   But even that-- If you go back to the period in 1980 and 1981 where we really did, at least for a period of time, [target] the money supply range, we had pandemonium every Thursday afternoon when the money supply figures were published And that gets very frustrating But I must say it's pretty darn hard to figure out how to avoid it   So move   In terms of the national economy first, I think the forecast that Mike and his colleagues have put on the table is as good a forecast as you're going to get right now Our own bank forecast is very similar in all of its major elements to Mike's forecast But having said that, I think the point Mike made at the outset and that several others have made is very important There really is a sharp dichotomy between attitudes and expectations versus what we see in the economic statistics and what those hard economic statistics would suggest in terms of a forecast And I think there is a danger in that environment of the classic self-fulfilling prophecy  There have been several comments made about the financial fragility aspects of that Let me just add a couple of insights in that area First of all, part of what we're seeing in banking, broadly defined, is also being seen in other countries There is a similar situation at least in many respects in Japan and, while it's not widely talked about, there are symptoms of the same kind of conditions beginning to develop even in the London clearing banks because of asset quality problems and overextension of real estate loans and so on So, while the problem to date has received a lot more attention in the United States, it is not one that is in all of its dimensions unique to the United States It has secular elements to it, especially in this country, in terms of even greater questions in the marketplace as to how these institutions are going to generate the earnings that they need not only to raise capital but also to maintain reasonable rates of return for shareholders But right now there clearly is a very, very pronounced cyclical element surrounding this issue of credit quality concerns  Looking at that from the vantage point of the major money center banks, there are three areas the LDC loans, the HLT loans, and the real estate loans Right now what we see is a clustering of weighted classified asset ratios in the money center banks in New York For the institutions that have been the subject of a lot of this recent attention, those weighted classified asset ratios are now in the range of below 20 percent, which is not great but certainly should be manageable I would say right now that by far the greatest risk of further deterioration in asset quality is in the real estate  -27-    10/2/90  area The LDC situation, if anything, is better, especially after all the chargeoffs that were taken for Argentina The exposures in that area essentially now are in four big countries Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina--not that the others are totally insignificant; but of those countries two are in pretty good shape The HLT situation, while laden with uncertainties, again I would judge as manageable But the big, big question is on the real estate side Even if, as I think, the situation right now is better than a lot of the market scuttlebutt would have it, it's certainly not as good as we'd like to see it And it's very important to recognize that if you just take those seven institutions, you're talking about banking assets of about $700 billion, which is something like a quarter or a third of domestic banking assets And with only one or maybe two exceptions, for the foreseeable future the growth in assets in these institutions is going to be very, very restrained because of capital considerations, leaving aside whatever judgments one might want to make about credit screening and those types of things I think it's also important to keep in mind that the foreign banks, especially Japanese banks, that have been a very important source of the net growth of credit in the United States are not going to be a source of that kind of growth in the future, at least in the foreseeable future Again, I'm leaving aside what we mean when we talk about credit crunches I think we have a situation in which a very large number of institutions, both foreign and domestic, are simply not in a position to be doing a lot of lending because of de facto constraints, and appropriate constraints, coming from the capital side But at the moment my assessment still would be that the situation, while not pretty, is certainly not as difficult as some of these reports would indicate  I should also say in the area of financial fragility that while the spotlight at the moment is on the banks, it should also be kept in mind that the securities houses and the insurance companies are by no means exempt from these problems Indeed, I would stipulate that some of the potential sources of vulnerability in the securities industry could be even more acute than some of the ones in banking, even though that is not a subject of great conversation at the moment  Against that backdrop, a question that keeps running through my mind is Why are attitudes so sour? Now, presumably everybody is looking at the same numbers that we're looking at What is it that has produced this very, very substantial deterioration in attitudes and expectations? It seems to me that there are at least three or four factors at work here One is that I do detect, even among the most aggressive businessmen, a recognition now that inflation has proven to be much more stubborn than we expected and than they expected There was a time when we talked about inflation that a lot of people would say to us "You're fighting the last war" They don't say that anymore I think there is a recognition that the core inflation rate has not gone down and probably has crept up So, that's a factor I think the budget process, leaving aside what you think are the results in terms of numbers, has taken a major toll in terms of expectations or attitudes On Wall Street and on Main Street that has been viewed as a farce and I think in its own way has clearly undercut attitudes and expectations Again, no matter what you think of the program itself, which I actually think is pretty decent, we're still staring at this incredibly massive deficit for next year You can dress it up any way you want, but I think that number has been a    10/2/90  shock to people as well The third factor that I think is very, very important in terms of this souring of attitudes and expectations has been a decline in asset values For the typical household it really has struck right in the breadbasket because between stocks and houses there has been a very sharp psychological adjustment if not a real adjustment One of the things that sharply distinguishes this period from other periods that we've gone through in the past is the fact that asset values at the level of both the household and the corporate sector are declining in many cases Some of that, of course, especially in real estate, is a result of the excesses that went before Nevertheless, it is there  I also think that there are renewed and heightened concerns, even among people who don't normally think about this question, about the reliability of our external sources of finance All these news reports about the Japanese pulling back and other things are catching the attention of people who normally don't even give those types of issues a second thought In a way, Sam's earlier comments about the exchange rate are a manifestation of that So, you take all of that and superimpose the Middle East on top of it and the conclusion I come to is that we shouldn't be terribly surprised that expectations and attitudes are as sour as they are When you put it all together, it seems to me that what we have right now that is different from most of our earlier experience is either the reality or the danger of a significant element of illiquidity and/or credit rationing beginning to manifest itself in asset markets, especially real estate And that does seem to me to carry with it some dangers that are quite different from some of the things that we've had to deal with in the past Indeed, I would be concerned that any further or more widespread illiquidity, again especially in real estate markets, could very well be the thing that tips some of these expectational factors into more underlying behavioral factors   I got confused about a different disaggregation problem The thrust of your suggestion, Mr Chairman,  -49-    10/2/90  was that next Tuesday you would envision, in an almost automatic fashion, an adjustment of 25 basis points in the funds rate?   I'm just trying to clarify the two steps here You have said, assuming this budget resolution gets passed in the Congress, that on Tuesday of next week there would be a 25 basis point adjustment in the federal funds rate You then stipulated that there might be another?   Okay   I support your proposition with one caveat I am still quite worried about the exchange rate creating problems for us So, I would urge that after doing the first step we go quite slowly and test the waters before being committed irrevocably in any sense to the second step   A lot could happen   Just one other point As I listened, Mr Chairman, I thought there was a lot of wisdom in the suggestion that several people made about not tying this unduly to the budget resolution in your public statements The more I think about that, the more I think it would be embarrassing   Move it   The Japanese banks have always paid up in London too   One of the related things going on too, Bob, is a very clear widening out of spreads even on standbys and things like that In other words, one manifestation of all of this concern about credit quality is that for a given structure of interest rates, spreads and fees even on standbys are actually widening--and perhaps by a lot Some of that I think is directly related to this general concern about credit quality, but some of it also is directly related to the fact that the Japanese banks' profile--not just here in the United States but in Europe including Britain--really has changed   And nothing changes   That's the problem I couldn't care less what it says because I know what we're going to do anyway But I think there is a problem in that--   That's right The worst interpretation would be if we take it out and it leaves the impression  -13-    11/13/90  that the Committee has decided that it will no longer make any intermeeting adjustments in policy, and--   Well, there's not much more I can add It is now clear to me that we have had what I would characterize as a violent shock to expectations and attitudes As far as I can piece together the diagnostics of that, I rather agree with Gary Stern's view of it I think the oil situation and the war issue are in the realm of the straws that broke the camel's back A lot of stuff was there to begin with The budget process hurt a lot But I might say in that regard, having now had the time myself to put that budget package under a bit of a microscope, I find that there's a helluva lot more substance to it than I thought there was, especially in the out years But, of course, there too what happened was that the process was so long and the near-term deficits were so large that what in fact is not a bad package has just been swept away I think there's no recognition of that at all  I spoke a few moments ago about the international dimension of this situation, but I really think it does need emphasis Maybe anecdotes don't do much, but the fact of the matter is that over the past, I'd say, four to six weeks I have had literally a string of people whom I consider to be the true elder statesmen of international finance--these are guys who have been around for 40 years in many cases--telling me that they have never seen a situation as delicate as the one right now And the focus is all directed at the United States, with particular emphasis on US financial institutions And as Peter said in his remarks earlier, it is by no means limited to banks It is across the board and it is indiscriminate; AAA-rated companies are being affected just as much as lesser rated companies And as I said, I cannot help but take seriously comments like these from people who have been around the track, in a couple of cases almost longer than I've been alive I think there is the danger--I don't want to call it a probability or anything like that--of some kind of a serious liquidity shock originating offshore, And that, of course, makes for a further serious complication in the context of the whole exchange rate situation, because in the eyes of the rest of the world these problems are very much linked back to the exchange rate  -32-    11/13/90  But what we have is something that appears now to be taking on the organic, if not the statistical, properties of a recession But it's a different kind of recession and this is a little like what I think Ed Boehne was driving at If indeed we are in a recession, it will be the first recession in recent memory that has not been predated by a sharp and protracted rise in interest rates and the underlying inflation rate I don't know if my history is right but I suspect that if it is a recession it will be the first in the postwar period that will have that trait of not being preceded by a buildup in inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates In those circumstances, I think that the policy response, as Ed Boehne said, is a helluva lot more difficult It is partly expectations to be sure; but at this point it's very hard to take exception to the fact that the credit side of the equation is a powerful force at work here When I look at that credit side of the equation in kind of snapshot terms, I still come to the view that it is not as bad as all of the market forces, press reports, or rumor forces would have one believe But the problem with snapshots, of course, is that they are frozen in time and they don't tell you a lot about the future And one of the things that has become a matter of some increasing concern to me is that I can now easily see any number of other parts of the country besides the Northeast that could get bitten rather sharply by the real estate problem that is at the heart of so many of the problems, at least in the Northeast And, of course, as Ed was suggesting, if that does begin to play out and reinforce itself on the credit side, I think it can make things a heck of a lot more difficult In the context particularly of the risk--however large or small you may think it is-- of some kind of a serious liquidity problem originating offshore and of the sensitivity of the dollar, there are limits at least at this point as to how much can or should be done with lower interest rates That also brings me to the view--not unlike Dick Syron's suggestion or I think implicit in Ed Boehne's suggestions--that maybe we have to start looking at some other things here I mentioned this at the last Committee meeting and almost got run out of the room--it's not the first time that has happened and it won't be the last--but I must say that despite the political risks I still have an awful lot of sympathy in this environment for thinking about doing something with reserve requirements, even if it had to be watered down and phased in and convoluted I think I am fully sensitive to the risks, but I'm also sensitive to the risks on the other side, which I think are more than anyone knows at this point   You lost me on that last lap there, Wayne   I support your recommendation   Can we live with saying 1 to 2 percent or something instead of putting that 0 in there?   Say "M2 and M3 in the range of 1 to 2 percent" or something like that   Alan, this is Jerry I agree with how you and Mike characterized the economy itself, but I do feel that even if that's right--and it probably is--the risks are asymmetric on [the down side] I must say that the money supply and credit numbers and the lack of growth thereof now are an increasing concern   In which direction?   So move   Reserve Banks--   Second   Second   Let me add the oil was in ships!   Because it stops being solvent on some of the prices? Is that what you're saying?   Mr Chairman, as far as the national economy is concerned, I think Dick Syron made my point earlier If I had to put a forecast on a piece of paper, I'd probably put down one that looks a lot like the one that Mike has put in the Greenbook Having said that, and for all the reasons that have been cited earlier, I think the risks in the second quarter of 1991 and beyond are probably on the south side of that forecast Indeed, in looking at Mike's forecast, if we had an economy behaving in growth terms like his forecast for the next seven quarters--while it may be cyclically less than we've seen in the past--I'd consider that terrific Basically, he has 2-1/2 percent growth throughout the balance of 1991 and 1992  Let me say a brief word on the local economy, in the New York metropolitan area particularly Keeping in mind that in manufacturing terms that is nowhere near as important as it once was, the fact of the matter is that it still has something like 10 or 12 percent of the nation's population and in some industries such as real estate it's disproportionately more important than even population would indicate For the metropolitan area as a whole, it is clear that the white collar recession is still deepening Some of this is the prominent headlines that you see on cutbacks in financial firms But it's not just that Indeed, that white collar profile of the recessionary forces in the metropolitan area really is quite extraordinary in any kind of a historical perspective We think the real estate situation still has a ways to go south Again, the market measured in square footage terms is very, very large You lose sight of the fact that lower Manhattan by itself has almost as much office space as the city  -17-    12/18/90  of Chicago And when you look at the situation in the metropolitan area broadly defined, New York City itself probably is marginally okay in that vacancy rates are now in the area of 20 percent, which is high but not fatal And there is not a whole lot of fresh new supply in the construction pipeline; there is some, but not tremendously large amounts Rents, on the other hand, really have plummeted If you look at prime midtown office space--I'm talking about large chunks of space, say, 200,000 to 400,000 square feet, not little pockets of space--space that perhaps as recently as a year ago but certainly 18 months ago could have commanded $50 to $55 a foot, today they are lucky to get $30 It really is an extremely large change in a very, very short period of time As I said, the only saving grace is that there aren't that many truly large blocks of space even in the midtown market with the exception of three or four buildings that are being finished on 6th Avenue The suburban real estate markets are worse than the New York City markets and that is true pretty much across the board, whether you're talking about Long Island, Jersey, Westchester, or parts of Connecticut We don't have very good statistics in terms of how much space is sitting there Most of these surveys, Coldwell Banker and the like, are pretty good for cities but not so good for suburban areas Based on what developers are telling us and what our examiners see, we think the downside potential in the suburban community is still quite considerable  Ed Boehne touched on this in the context of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, but we have basically the same kinds of pressures on the state and local fiscal side with all the implications either for higher taxes and/or lower spending at the state and local level The New York City situation isn't great at the moment; it doesn't look anything like the way it looked in the mid-1970s, but it's not good And whether we're talking about Connecticut or parts of Long Island, there are large prospective deficits in state and local government budgets pretty much across the board Leaving the metropolitan situation alone for a moment, the general psychology of the situation, as reflected in attitudes of CEOs of major multi-national companies, is that it's pretty lousy Interestingly, in the face of Ted's comments earlier, I don't get the sense that the companies that are major exporters are quite as confident about the potential for volume growth in exports in 1991 as they were even three months ago Now, they haven't said so, but it's not considered a [near certainty] as I think it was as recently as three months ago that they would continue to see volume growth in the area of 10 percent or 12 percent  As far as the Christmas retail season goes, the sense I get from both the national retailers that are headquartered in New York and even from some of the small businessmen we talk to is that "It ain't good" It's very soft The only exception is in the very high price end of the retail market in New York City, and that's coming from foreign buyers I don't know how this gets into trade statistics and things like that--not that it's all that important in absolute dollars--but the very high end of the retail market in New York City is quite strong mainly because foreign buyers benefiting from the exchange rate look upon New York as a shopping haven at the moment  On the credit crunch, there too I think we still have a ways to go We will talk about this later, but one particular manifestation of that--the way it seems to be at least at the moment spilling through into the money supply--is becoming a greater concern  -18-    12/18/90  to me The silver lining behind the cloud of the credit crunch is that there is now what I would describe as pervasive evidence of significant rebuilding of pricing and margins taking place pretty much across the board Now, some of that has been facilitated by the withdrawal of the Japanese banks from not only the direct lending markets but the commitments and standby-type markets as well But the evidence I think is now pervasive that we are seeing a significant rebuilding of pricing and margins; whether it can be sustained is another question But I mention that because it is quite clear to me that there is some combination of margins and spreads and levels of interest rates that will snap the credit crunch and snap it in a constructive way I'm not sure we're there yet, but we may be getting closer than we suspect, especially if this rebuilding of spreads and margins proves to be somewhat durable  There are a lot of uncertainties But the combination, as Gary and Dick and several others said earlier, of the real estate sector and the vulnerabilities as they impact on the financial sector are probably the biggest single source of uncertainty as I see it right now I've said this before but let me emphasize it again There is a natural tendency to focus commentary on financial concerns on the banking system; but as I see it those problems are every bit as acute in both cyclical and structural terms for the nonbank sectors of the financial system as they are for the banking system Indeed, just yesterday we were looking at a broad cross section of data on the insurance industry, top to bottom And I will tell you, that is pretty grim stuff, to put it mildly  Just anecdotally on the real estate situation, I spent a morning last week with Bob Boykin and his Dallas directors and up until then I had been tending to convince myself that Texas had turned a corner Maybe Houston has, but one of in the construction business was telling me that he thought there were 10 to 20 million square feet of newly constructed office space in the Dallas area that would be better off bulldozed If you say $100 a square foot and take the midpoint of that estimate of 10 to 20 million, that's $1-1/2 billion worth of new construction with no place to go So, again, of all the wild cards out there I think that real estate-- as it reflects directly on the economy, along the lines of Gary's comments, but also as it reflects on these problems on the financial side--is the biggest single wild card   You'd have to! [Laughter]   First of all, I support precisely the recommendation that you put on the table That is, I hope the Board will move the discount rate 1/2 point, with the Committee trying to settle the funds rate in around 7 percent--I have no question myself that Mr Sternlight and his friends can engineer that even in the year-end environment--and maintain asymmetry in the directive I know it's late, but let me just make a couple of quick comments in terms of the policy setting I think Martha made a good point before when she spoke about the soft landing Everyone knew that was going to be a difficult exercise The economy now seems to have tipped into a recession But I think it's important that we and others keep in mind that if indeed it is a recession, the causes of it seem to be [primarily] an autonomous shift in expectations growing in part out of excesses of the past, of which the credit crunch is a symptom, and in part from Saddam Hussein Not to raise vestiges of the past, but in his Per Jacobsson lecture Paul Volcker made the point that if there is a recession, it's not going to be monetary policy's fault And I think that's right Moreover, if we can achieve an outcome like Mike's forecast, I don't think it's the end of the world by a long shot In addition, we can say now what we couldn't say six months ago that there's at least a strong [hint] or two that suggests that the inflation outcome could be better than we thought six short months ago All in all, while no one likes a recession, I don't consider the outcome terrible by a long shot as long as we get something like Mike's forecast And that's where I do worry a bit, if not a lot, about the money supply No one is ever going to accuse me of being a monetarist, but as I see it the money supply, total reserves, and whatever, are all kind of in the red zone And in those circumstances I think the policy you're suggesting is exactly right Even with that  -38-    12/18/90  policy I'm by no means convinced that we are inevitably and irreversibly destined to overdo it I think we can squeeze through  Just quickly on the point that Governor Angell raised, which I think goes well beyond how we communicate this particular change I think Governor Angell is raising a more difficult question of the whole matter of the relationships between the Board of Governors and the boards of directors on the one hand and the Open Market Committee on the other I must say, Wayne, that looked at over a very long period of time on both sides of the interest rate cycle, I for one think that those relationships are about right And I would be most reluctant to change them I might add, at the risk of seeming to prod a bit, that if one does care about the [monetary policy] role of directors and the Board of Governors it seems to me it's a matter of logical extension that one should not be too crazy about a penalty discount rate   Well, the last time we really had the problem that Governor Angell was talking about wasn't in fact in 1987; it was in 1988 To use the soft landing analogy, Mike pointed out to us 15 months ago that we overshot the runway And if you want to look for mea culpas, the mea culpas belong in 1988 and not 1987 And I think that's the last time--   And policy firmed and then firmed further through the summer of 1987 and the stock market crash took it down And when we got into 1988 that is where the real problems were   No, we didn't go down soon enough and far enough   Some of us take that personally!   This is Jerry Corrigan Let me just say something on currency In December, and especially in the last few weeks of the current period, there has been a very large amount of currency being shipped to the Middle East Based on what we know here and based on what we know about a couple of the major banks that are engaged in this, I wouldn't be at all surprised if virtually all of the net increase in currency that we're seeing in this period is going to the Gulf states   Yes, Alan, let me just add a comment In one sense, Governor Angell is right when he says the year is long [Unintelligible] but I have to say that I am getting increasingly concerned--not, as I said before, because I'm a monetarist but because there is a pattern of things that seems to me to be [systemic] and that could be very troublesome indeed That includes the point that Dick made about individuals and institutions shying away from faith in the banking system in a context in which the money creation part of the banking system was already under some pressure due to the credit crunch phenomenon that we discussed earlier So, apart from the timing of any particular policy move, I think this is a situation that we are going to have to look at very, very carefully because it may be telling us something far more fundamental than just the fact of anemic money supply growth rates But I think that's not something that can be dismissed lightly even though subsequent events may begin to reverse some of the pattern we're seeing right now I think it's at least possible--I didn't say probable, but at least possible--that we are seeing something quite extraordinary here in terms of what is going on in the real world    1/9/91   I share that concern, Tom It's hard to know what the heck these things are telling us right now   That's one of the reasons why [understanding] the behavior of excess reserves--if we can figure it out--would be very important If we have unambiguous evidence of a [marked] increase in excess reserves targeted for year-end, apart from the reduction in reserve requirements, that to me would be prima facie evidence [in support] of the hypothesis that you just stated One of the things that's so frustrating right now is that for the reasons Peter and others described earlier, it's hard to make that judgment one way or another right now But, prospectively, it seems to me that the behavior of excess reserves could be a very important variable because, as I said, if we did have evidence of a large autonomous increase is excess reserves, it would indeed be compatible with the hypothesis that you just stated that banks just aren't going to lend to anybody for anything   Alan, while Mike Prell is looking for that When are you planning to announce this?   Okay, good    2/1/91   This is highly technical and I don't mean it to sound that way, but if you're going to announce it at 915 a m, why isn't it effective today as opposed to Monday?   Do I get a bonus as Vice Chairman? [Laughter]   Condolences, Mr Chairman   I'll move it   I would move that   So moved   What we are seeing though, Dick, is foreigners backing away a little from private securities of all kinds, including bank paper--certainly anything over 5 years Even if it's from Morgan Guaranty, it cannot be sold overseas   Right, it's both    2/5-6/91   But the rate at which the balances now are turning over, whether they're required clearing balances or required reserves, has grown exponentially and is still growing So, I don't find it surprising, Bob, that that last change had as big an impact as it had   It's a very big percentage change And if you look at the turnover as a proxy for transactions, it's still rising at a geometric rate   The other thing, too, that would make a difference that I don't think Peter touched on--but I guess Don will be discussing tomorrow--is the whole question of the use and administration of the discount window, particularly in terms of these end-of-day types of things   One thought on this volatility in the funds rate in a context in which it has been stipulated that there has not been an enormous problem in terms of policy transparency I must say that I'm not sure I consider the volatility all bad If nothing else, it may ultimately be consistent with a little more discipline and a little more order in the way borrowings are managed As I said, I don't think it's necessarily the end of the world   There is this other point, too, that Bob McTeer raised and Si raised Virgil, I forgot the nature of the authorization, but in the 1980 law I remember we stuck in a provision where there is the authority to pay interest on these--   --clearing balances or supplemental balances in a context in which the Board makes a determination of whether those supplemental balances are needed I don't think it was just for monetary policy or even for clearing purposes   Mike, several people have commented on the chart show, which really was first-rate, but let me just add to that I thought the paper that you circulated on potential GNP, etc, was absolutely marvelous I don't know what your practices are about publishing those kinds of things but I would hope it would be published It's really an excellent piece of work   It really is, as I said, an absolutely first-rate piece of work  -17-    2/5-6/91   The CNN effect!   On the anecdotal side, the only thing I can say that is unambiguously good is that the weekend before last in Tampa, Florida, there were actually no signs of a recession Quite to the contrary   That's right But on a more serious note, the impression that I get from talking to businessmen and women and directors and others is that the statistics have basically caught up with their expectations, which had been distinctly sour for some time prior to the point when [the weakness] really showed through in the statistics As I've said before, I do think that the real estate situation, at least in the greater New York metropolitan area--while not in the same category as it is in parts of New England--has not bottomed out I think Gary's point is absolutely right The excess inventory of real estate of all kinds is going to take a long time to work itself out It's not just in the Northeast; I get the impression that this is pretty much a nationwide problem Also, as several people have mentioned, one does get the impression that at least for a while in mid-January the so-called CNN effect was quite real in terms of retail operations and restaurants They say it even showed through in the theaters in New York City I have no independent evidence of that  But notwithstanding all of that--and this is where we come to the great dilemma--if you go through the exercise of looking at the economy sector by sector, regardless of whether you rely on a formal econometric model or rules of thumb that you may have acquired over time, it's not that hard to see a short recession Based on my own purely subjective instincts, having spent a lot of time going through that kind of analysis, if I had to make a guess I would probably say that the chances of an outcome that is somewhere around the center of the central tendency are probably 50/50 Indeed, I would think there's at least some chance that we could get as robust a recovery as Mike has in his forecast But, of course, if we do get that, then we  -30-    2/5-6/91  have an obvious problem of the second scenario on the last page of the chart show  On the other hand, I would say that the chances of an outcome that is weaker than the central tendency--again this is not scientific --are probably about 15 percent or 20 percent But unfortunately, I can't rule out the possibility of an outcome that is very significantly weaker, either Now, I don't think that's the likely outcome but if you asked me whether we could have a long and really deep recession I think I'd have to say there's at least a 10, 15, or 20 percent possibility of that Again, I don't think it's anywhere near the likely case, but I don't think one can rule it out And the reasons it can't be ruled out in part get to the things that Gary was talking about the overhangs of the excesses of the '80s Some of Mike's charts on corporate cash flow positions and debt positions and things like that I don't think really capture how much of an overhang those things are But on top of that I do think what we have is a recession that in the first instance is being driven by expectational factors, some of which are conditioned by those earlier excesses But whatever the precise anatomy of the recession, the character of it, as I see it, is different enough that it is that much more difficult to judge how things will work their way through it, even in terms of this question of how much bang for the buck do we get from lower interest rates I'm not sure And because of some of these behavioral and expectational characteristics of current patterns of behavior it's very, very difficult to make that judgment  On the credit crunch issue, again, I essentially agree with Gary's point But I think there's also a little more to it than that One really does get the impression--it's more than an impression because I have been told point blank even by the best banks in the Second District, and at least one or two of them are among the best banks in the country--that the banks simply are not doing things on the credit extension side anything like the way they used to, even to those who would have been considered good customers 8 or 9 or 10 months ago And the rate of foreclosures as opposed to restructurings or stretchouts, especially in the real estate sector, is another symptom of that phenomenon So, while I think it's fair to say that the credit crunch is exaggerated, especially in political circles, I think it's entirely fair to say, as Gary did, that it tends to reflect these excesses of the past I still think it is a very important consideration in the current setting, especially as it bears on this all important question of confidence and expectations That is one of the many reasons why I find that I can be so ambivalent about what I think is going to happen I sit down with Dick Davis and his guys and they convince me in two hours that Mike Prell is right, or more or less right, and not to worry Then I start thinking about it and I say "I guess I am worried" And that's about where I am, Mr Chairman    I would maintain the ranges   that you  recommended   I certainly would support the suggestion you put on the table, but I would just elaborate a little on one or two aspects of policy beyond that Everybody has put his or her own probabilities on outcomes of various forecasts and, as I said yesterday, my own sense of it is that there's at least a 50 percent chance that we'll get something along the lines of the central tendency of the Federal Open Market Committee members' forecasts And we certainly can't rule out the kind of [outcome] that Mike talked about But if we're going to get either of those--a modest recovery beginning sometime around midyear or even a fairly bouncy one as in Mike's forecast--it seems to me that either outcome is already baked in the cake in policy terms There is enough there, if policy is working, to produce that result  On the other hand, there is a 10, 15 percent chance--again, pick your number--of it being a lot weaker Now, especially if it turns out to be a lot weaker, then we're looking at a very deep  -52-    2/5-6/91  recession with all of the [attendant] financial problems That, by the way, I think would blow the stock market right out of the water Then we really would have a terrible situation not only in terms of what it implies for the economy and unemployment and all the rest, but in those circumstances I think policy would be judged universally as the culprit Moreover, the risk of the whipsaw effect sometime out in the future, which is embodied in Mike's second scenario on the last page of yesterday's handout--even in the case of a steep recession-- gets much greater under any scenario like that  Now, I think the problem for policy and the appearances of policy is a bit further complicated by this credit crunch issue There are two schools of thought about the credit crunch One school of thought is that it's very real and that the Fed in particular isn't doing much about it I don't happen to agree with that school of thought Gary's analysis yesterday comes much closer to the mark as far as I'm concerned But there is that other school of thought that the Fed itself is overstating the credit crunch because that rather suits its purpose And the argument that grows out of that essentially says that the weakness in money is really due to policy, not a credit crunch--that the credit crunch is a smokescreen and the Fed is hiding behind that smokescreen Indeed, that argument goes one step further and says that the Fed is targeting the funds rate, that reserves are strictly demand determined, and that it's the policy process itself that is producing the weak growth in money supply and/or the credit crunch, or even worse for the Machiavellian types that the Fed is hiding behind the credit crunch The reason I bring that up is again in the context of what happens--regardless of whether you think the risks are 10 percent or 20 percent--if it turns out that the economy goes down the tank That leaves me in this quandary of desperately searching for what I like to think of as a low-cost insurance policy To me, a low-cost insurance policy is something that either in substance or in form tries to defuse some of those arguments without bringing with it the necessary result that we go too far in underlying policy terms and set ourselves up in the kind of conundrum that Mike so graphically described yesterday So, I ask Is there a low-cost insurance policy? That is somewhat of a contradiction in terms, of course; there really cannot be  While I don't think it's germane to the Committee's discussion this morning, I have this rather crazy idea that runs around in my head that might deserve consideration as a low-cost insurance policy Essentially, what is running through my mind is going a good deal further than we have been thinking to date about trying to bring the discount window to bear in this process The concept that rolls around in my head--and I understand it can be shot to pieces, but maybe Don and Mike and the staff could think about it a little anyway--is a 6-month period, for example, within which we would have a highly advertised program of more liberal discount window accommodation, including term discount window loans The program would be structured to say that its purpose is to ensure liquidity to individual institutions to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers We might have more liberal collateral requirements, but we'd haircut the devil out of them so there would be no risk to the Federal Reserve But the thought would be that people could have easier access and more generous collateral requirements--in terms of what is put up [as collateral], not in terms of how it is haircutted It would have a market rate of some kind or other The way I think about  -53-    2/5-6/91  it is that if it's used, I don't see that it has to have any material impact on the broad thrust of policy, at least if one thinks of policy in terms of interest rates or exchange rates I think we could engineer those effects out through Mr Sternlight's operations So, if it's used, fine; I don't think it has to compromise the basic thrust of policy And there would be no risk to the Federal Reserve On the other hand, if it's not used, I'm not sure that that's the end of the world either Indeed, if it's not used, it seems to me that it goes at least a little in the direction of helping us to defuse the argument that our unwillingness to provide liquidity either through open market operations or otherwise is the cause of the credit crunch and all these other things that go with it  Now, as I said, there really is at the end of the day, of course, no such thing as a low-cost insurance policy This has smoke and mirrors to it But I am worried about the danger that is inherent in an outcome in which [the economy] really goes south on us I ask myself what other alternatives there are that do not involve the risk of compromising the basic thrust of monetary policy, and I look with Bill Taylor and others at some of the things they are talking about on the supervisory side Now, the problem there is that the ones that might do something by their very nature are going to raise the specter of forbearance on the thrift situation and all the rest, and I think in a global setting relaxing capital standards or something like that would be crazy On the other hand, the kinds of accounting things that are being talked about I don't think are going to do anything As a matter of fact, I think they will be viewed transparently as not doing much at all Again, maybe we don't need a low-cost insurance policy; but that, I think, is your judgment   Right   But no matter how you measure reserves or anything else, in the kind of situation we're in right now the only way that we can deal with this conundrum would be to run a policy, in effect deliberately, that is prepared to accept the risks of very large amounts of free reserves or excess reserves in the System And by definition if there is something real to this so- called credit crunch, that approach to policy--no matter how you define the base or how you define reserves--carries with it the risks of a 2 percent federal funds rate   We haven't seen it because [of how] we're conducting policy But the only fail-safe experiment--and that's what it would be--that would resolve that issue, no matter how you define the base and no matter how you measure reserves, would be the willingness of this Committee to run a policy that carries with it the risks of a 2 percent federal funds rate   I know you're not   That's part of the reason why I made the suggestion about trying to get some reserves out through the discount window in a way in which Peter could do a pretty good job of protecting against--  SPEAKER(?) Sterilizing!   Protecting against--well, sterilizing them!   Just a quick comment My basic view on this was captured very well by what Ed Boehne and Bob Forrestal said I have just one added thought in the context of this enhanced consultation process, whatever it means, that I think we all have to be sensitive to And that is that within the framework of a so-called enhanced consultation we have to be mindful that that process could become counterproductive if it deteriorated into people insisting upon a formal vote of the FOMC every time there was a consultation I think we all have to have an open and flexible mind on that because if it degenerated into a process--which I don't think it will--where we ended up with frequent recorded votes in intermeeting intervals, I think that would be potentially damaging and at the extreme could produce an inertia problem with the monetary policy process itself So, at least from my perspective, the spirit of what Ed and Bob particularly said captures it very well I do think we have to be mindful that within the process of enhanced consultation that same need for flexibility will be there   I second    3/26/91   Right   Well, for starters I'd say that I am not inherently troubled at all by the fact that the Federal Reserve either on its own or in collaboration with the Treasury has foreign currency balances; that doesn't bother me at all The only point where that would bother me inherently would be if the mere fact or size of those holdings in and of themselves tended to undercut the role of the dollar as the world reserve currency That I would have an inherent problem with And I don't think that condition is within sight Now, that's kind of my breaking point But having said that, the question comes up What is reasonable and what is unreasonable? I don't know the answer, either But I do think we should keep in mind that as recently as 1977 or 1978--I forget which year--when the perception was that the United States was going in the tank, the United States government, including the Federal Reserve, found it necessary to approach the world at large, hat in hand, and establish what was then a $30 billion war chest To be sure, a lot of that war chest was smoke and mirrors and some of it was subsequently financed as you pointed out through the so-called Carter bonds But the Carter bonds were hardly a great victory from the point of view of the United  -13-    3/26/91  States either in political or in economic terms So, I think there is a lot to be said for the war chest theory  In terms of the size issue, the fact of the matter is that in the late 1970s when the world was a lot smaller than it is today what was thought to be a reasonable war chest--again recognizing that a lot of it was smoke and mirrors--was a fairly substantial amount That [leads] me, as does the point that Sam made about the currency holdings of other central banks, to the view that in rough orders of magnitude the balances we hold right now don't seem unreasonable In terms of the question of whether they should go up or go down, my instinct is that if they stay roughly the same or maybe even go down a little, that's fine so long as the reasons why they are going down are credible And here I must say that I worry a bit about undue--and I want to emphasize that "undue"--preoccupation with net losses and net profits I don't hear anybody asking Mr Sternlight how much money he lost for us in the past six weeks when the long bond went down 5 or 6 points in price or whatever it was   I suspect though, Peter, that the amount was not inconsequential in the time-frame of the past 5 or 6 weeks So, I think we have to be a little careful about latching on to the star of profitability because--   Well, the precedent in my judgment is not inconsequential I understand your point and that's why I didn't want to overstate the argument [As I] say, I think we have to be careful about making a public argument for disposing of balances simply on the basis of trying to maximize profits or minimize losses I think that would be a mistake On the other hand, if the specific suggestion is something along the lines of what Sam said--and as I heard Sam he was saying two things--one is that in a orderly way maybe we can try to wind down the warehousing and two is that maybe we ought to have in mind trying to work off the earnings I wouldn't be wildly allergic at all to something along those lines because I think he could make a fairly coherent statement, including to our colleagues abroad, as to what we're doing and why we're doing it But at the end of the day--I think Lee Hoskins touched on this--what is very, very important here is that whatever we do and however we do it, it should not be allowed to be construed by anybody as even carrying the remotest threat that the Federal Reserve or the United States is copping out in terms of international relationships, particularly the kinds of not very aggressive but nevertheless cooperative intervention that we've seen in the past six weeks, for example I'm not at all troubled that we [were] on both sides of the market within a six-week time-frame In the first case it was in a context in which a number of us were worried that the dollar was about to fall out of bed Whether you agree with that or not, we did look to our friends abroad for a little help and they gave it And it doesn't seem to me at all credible for us to say "The hell with you" six weeks later when we got  -14-    3/26/91  this unbelievably dramatic change in psychology and they turned to us and asked if we were willing to help out a little, even if it's symbolic I just don't see that as viable So, I would be careful here But if I understood what Sam was saying in operational terms, I certainly wouldn't have any problem with the thrust of his suggestion   But as a practical matter, Roger, if the Committee were of a mind to sell $5 billion equivalent of D-marks tomorrow morning, I think we would have to consult with the Treasury; indeed, I think we would feel an obligation to consult with the Bundesbank as well   It can at least take off the tail, I suspect   The answer is "no," Tommy   Well, looking first to the national economy, the forecast of the staff in New York in profile terms is similar to Mike's but there are a couple of differences Our staff essentially has the second quarter as flat and a more modest recovery in the third and fourth quarters But for what it's worth, the 1992 outlook is very similar to Mike's forecast with one or two exceptions that aren't important except in terms of algebraic signs We have net exports turning into a drag in 1992, and I want to come back to that in a minute And we also have slightly less improvement in core inflation in 1992 Mike, you have it getting down to around 3-1/2 percent?   We're basically in a holding pattern at 4 percent, which isn't great given all we've been through In terms of even the profile of the forecast, the one substantive thing that I am a bit more concerned about--aside from some anecdotal reports, which I'll get to in a minute--is the external side The kind of forecast we're looking at for 1991 even in the context of something like the current pattern of exchange rates I don't think is unreasonable, but I think there is greater risk--and Bob Forrestal or somebody already said this--on the foreign growth side, looking out from where we are right now And given the tenuous nature of the outlook, that situation at the margin can make a difference Nevertheless, I think the case for a modest recovery sometime in the spring or early summer is not at all unreasonable at this juncture  In terms of anecdotal reports, we're hearing things not unlike a number of things others have said For example, there is widespread gossip, if I can put it in the proper terminology, about a pickup in activity in housing And that's pretty much true at big banks and small banks, upstate and Long Island; it is not true in the very expensive New York City condominium market But with that exception there does seem to be something more than a seasonal pickup in housing The retail sector is still soft, and manufacturing--at least as we hear about it from the vantage point of very large manufacturing firms that are headquartered in New York--is still very soft The credit situation is better We do get anecdotal reports-- and somebody else said this, too--that at least some banks are actually out there looking for loans so long as they're not real estate loans Again, there are sound straws in the wind that the asset price deterioration may be beginning at least to moderate, if not to flatten out It's probably a little too early to make that judgment in any definitive way, but it seems to be a bit better Having said that, there is something else that seems quite clear, and that is that people feel better I guess there's a bit of a similarity with where we were last spring If you recall, last spring the anecdotal reports and the expectations were lousy and the numbers were still pretty good Right now we seem to have a situation in which the expectations and anecdotal reports are pretty good and the numbers are still pretty lousy I blow a little hot and cold as to what to make of that I think there is a danger that if the postwar  -32-    3/26/91  euphoria does not in fact reflect itself in some pickup in spending and activity, this rebound in confidence could reverse very, very quickly It's awfully hard to judge that, but right now the comment that a number of people here have made to the effect that people seem to feel better certainly is the impression I'm getting, even though the numbers aren't there to support it at the moment   "B" symmetric   I don't know about other Banks--   Well, let me try to be heard as best I can I, for one, would favor a 1/2 point discount rate cut and a 1/4 point funds rate reduction I feel that way for three reasons First of all, I just don't see much at all in terms of the economy presently, especially in the industrial sector If anything, I get the feeling from people that attitudes in the industrial sector actually have slipped The second reason--and this is something I mentioned at the last Committee meeting but it was very strongly confirmed this weekend at the BIS meeting--is that activity in the industrial world is clearly slipping across the board And that has quite important implications for net exports Going around the table at the BIS on Monday, for example, 6 of the 11 countries, including Switzerland, reported that as of right now their GNP was declining And all of the other five, including Japan and Germany, reported what I consider to be significant slowing relative to what they had to say four or five months ago The third factor that is lodged in my mind is this market expectations issue Peter Sternlight tells me that, given the CPI, there will be a virtual crescendo of opinion that we will be [easing] and that if we don't move, people will say that the reason we haven't moved is because of all these press reports of dissents So, in all those circumstances and given the much better price numbers, I do very much favor a 1/2 point reduction in the discount rate and a 1/4 point reduction in the funds rate As to the Chairman's last point, I wouldn't be the slightest bit hesitant about reversing, and reversing early, if that were necessary   What was the vote?   Move it   Well, Mr Chairman, on the forecast first We have a profile at least that is similar to Mike's, although not quite as strong--especially in the second half of the year But certainly [we expect] a respectable recovery over this six-quarter period Mike did mention several areas of uncertainty One of the reasons why our recovery is less robust than the staff's is net exports; the staff essentially has net exports plateauing and we have a $20 billion deterioration built in over the entire forecast period I don't have a lot of confidence in that forecast and I think Mike made the point earlier that it could go the other way But it is in marginal terms an area of great uncertainty in this forecast period And the difference between 0 and +20 or 0 and -20 in terms of the kind of growth rates we're talking about here is not inconsequential Another point I'd just mention about the forecast--several people have mentioned it--is the state and local sector in a context in which the underlying thrust of fiscal policy is probably on the restrictive side as well The state and local [data] have all kinds of smoke and mirrors in them and it's hard to know what the real picture is But it's hard to dismiss the possibility that there could be a greater measure of difficulty there, especially because these problems are so pervasive There are darn few states and certainly few major cities that don't seem to have pretty hefty fiscal problems Again, the smoke and mirrors makes it a lot harder to judge how difficult that may be But, as I said, I would associate myself with those who feel  -14-    5/14/91  the risks in the forecast probably are more symmetric than they were, in part because of the changes in policy that have been made  On the anecdotal side, we clearly hear report after report to the effect that the residential construction market is looking much better In your old neck of the woods of [northern] New Jersey, Tommy, one of the thrift people was telling me the other day that in the first three months of the year the stock of existing unsold houses in Summit was cut in half That's one little community, but that community is not a trivial piece of the puzzle up there in northern New Jersey The commercial side is lousy And in the industrial sector, the comments that I get from big manufacturing companies continue to be sour across the board Of course, a lot of these guys are sour all the time so you don't try to make [much] of that But one comment you do get from these guys who are sour all the time is that there is a higher sense of anxiety about the outlook for their exports over the next four to five quarters  It's also important at this point to note--and several people have touched on various facets of this--that we can now see several areas in which some good things are happening that are not entirely unrelated to the kind of policy that we've been following For example, balance sheet rebuilding even in the face of the decline in the saving rate in the household sector is making some real progress And what we're beginning to see in the corporate sector is also noteworthy Indeed, if you look at some of the things that were going on in the second half of the '80s, particularly for the companies that aren't already bankrupt, this reverse of the old phenomenon is not entirely inconsequential Taking a longer view, I think this balance sheet rebuilding, while it may temper the recovery, could turn out to be a very healthy development for the intermediate term even though it may dampen things a bit in the near term Somebody mentioned--Dick Syron, I guess--that restructuring is taking many forms and includes state and local governments I think that is now more than straws in the wind and that's beginning to pay off I'm trying to remember, Mike, when the last time was that we had a 28 percent decline in GNP and a 1 percent rise in productivity; I'm sure it has happened, but not very often And that in itself may be symptomatic of some of those things  A number of people have mentioned the inflation situation, and I have to say that in this area there has been a change in my thinking For the first time since the so-called core inflation rate plateaued at around 4 to 4-1/2 percent in 1984, I think we have a pop at penetrating that 4 to 4-1/2 percent core inflation rate I've never felt that in this entire period Now, like Gary Stern, I'm not ready to bet the ranch on it, but I do think that the inflation outlook is distinctly better I still have to wait a little to see if we can get through that threshold My hunch is if we can get through it, we might have a reasonable chance of staying through it  So, I think the outlook is still murky; there are plenty of uncertainties But on the other side of the coin, I can see in a number of areas things that might bode well for the intermediate term   Want to make a bet?   So do I   [Then] we've got problems   I think what President Keehn is hinting at, if I may, is that it might not be a bad idea to have rather firmly in mind a consultation in the first week in June or something like that  -25-    5/14/91   Don't misunderstand; I wasn't suggesting that kind of rigid linkage What I was saying is that if we had a major "tanking" in the stock market, I think that would rather quickly show through to other things   Tommy, if we had a very substantial correction in the stock market, I think it would feed right into the kinds of things that Don was talking about in terms of the confidence factor and the double-dip factor   I'll move it   I'll move it   Mr Chairman, could I briefly bring up another matter related to Desk activities?   The matter is a little project that we've been thinking about up in New York and I've touched base with Don Kohn on it very generally I affectionately call it "save a tree" The concept is basically this I've asked the two Desks to pull together a little report that is intended to remind all the Committee members of all the routine reports that the two Desks put out, ranging from daily to yearly What we'd like to do is to send to the Committee members a paper that outlines those reports and the    7/2-3/91  frequency with which they're prepared and to raise with Committee members the question of whether they all are needed or at least whether they all are needed with the same frequency that they are currently being produced, recognizing if nothing else that screens have changed the world I am simply mentioning this for the Committee's benefit right now What I would plan on doing is to make this package available to Don and his people Who knows? They may want to add some things to it! But after they have looked at it, then we'd circulate it to the Committee It's designed so that you can get through it probably in 20 minutes or a half hour at the most and [provide] us some indication as to whether all these reports are still needed at least with the frequency with which we now produce them As I said, it's called "save a tree," but it's also fair to say that if we can whittle away at this a little, it would save a lot of time on the part of the people who prepare these reports   That's right Obviously, if the results come in in the other direction--that people really find the status quo valuable--we'll maintain the status quo We also in this paper have solicited your suggestions as to whether there are some things we're not doing that we could do But I do think, Mr Chairman, that it's worthwhile at least every now and then to take a look at this and make sure that all the time and effort and money that goes into preparing these things is producing the desired results   The economic forecast that my associates in New York have put together is not now materially or systematically different from Mike's forecast; there are some differences around the edges In listening to the talk around the table, Mr Chairman, I'm inclined to the view that Mr Prell and his colleagues perhaps should qualify for a gold star either for forecasting or for courage in standing pat against the skepticism of many of us around the table for the past six months   With an oak leaf cluster! You're not there yet, Mike, but you look a heck of a lot better than we thought I do think it's a great tribute to Mike and his colleagues that they were willing to stand pat, essentially, with their forecast when a lot of people, including myself, weren't buying it Now, it's not in the barn as Roger Guffey would say--or the bin, I guess I never get those two things straight, bins and barns, but--   Okay [I had] good training; I was out in the Ninth District, too!  -21-    7/2-3/91   I left too soon In terms of the anecdotal [evidence], I can say that even among the industrial sector types that I talk to, if nothing else, the decibel count is down a bit And if you try really hard, you can even find one or two here and there that acknowledge that something looks a little better If that's not confirmation, Mike, I don't know what is! Having said that, there still is, of course, a not-so-silent minority who remain concerned about a double-dip And something that surprised me a little is that we actually hear a little more these days about the credit crunch than maybe we did even six months ago That may just be some people smelling the coffee for the first time; nevertheless, certainly that was the impression I had with the fall meeting of our Small Business Advisory Council as opposed to the last two meetings when they were in I do agree with John LaWare, Bob Forrestal, Ed Boehne, and perhaps others, who have made the point that in terms of the near-term risks, the financial fragility factor probably looms as the largest [The financial system] is still tender I think John's comments about some of the events at the end of last week illustrate that point On the other hand, and for what it's worth, we've just gotten through examinations of a couple of the big banks that we examine directly and I see some evidence, at least on the basis of that small sample, that the rise in problem loans is stabilizing at a high but, in these cases, not alarming level I'm also hearing reports from my own examiners in connection with the shared-bank credit review, Mr Chairman, in cases where they are working jointly with the Comptroller and the FDIC--for the first time certainly that they're willing to talk to me about it and I don't know whether others are picking this up as well--about rather sharp collisions between examiners working on the same credits The suggestion is that the other two agencies are differing sharply in some cases with my people over classifications of the very same loans   [Down] I don't know what to make of that, except that I do have a fairly high degree of confidence in my own examiners I don't know if others have picked this up or not   Yes   Much lower   The worst case I know of involved a fairly large credit, though not huge, where they even had differences in algebraic signs My guys were saying that they thought it should have been upgraded a notch and the dispute was to downgrade it a notch That's a big difference   As I said, I don't know whether other people have picked this up or not but I have been told this by my own guys   Well, that was one case; I don't want to make a big deal out of this isolated case I mentioned that just to be dramatic   But the point is that this is unusual; this is not something that happens with great frequency It doesn't happen often that there are material differences in judgment among teams of examiners working on the same credit at the same time I cannot verify how widespread it is, but it's widespread enough that it has been called to my attention in a couple of individual cases by my own examiners That's an aside; the main point is that the financial tenderness, if I could put it that way, is still very much in evidence  Having said that, let me just add one other general point If what I hear to be the consensus around the table is correct in that the recession is over and that at least a moderate recovery seems to be taking hold, I think it's probably fair to say that in one sense we really may have very successfully dodged the bullet because not only are we looking at what historically would be a very modest recession in all respects but a recession combined with other factors that I think have produced some of the foundations that could really help us out over the intermediate term Now, Ted mentioned earlier the improvement in the external sector The numbers Ted is looking at now compared to what we were looking at not too long ago really are a good deal better There has been a lot of talk about the prospective improvement on the inflation front; not only is that improvement absolute but it's also relative If you look at the chart on page 12 of Ted's handout, you find a very pronounced convergence in the inflation rate in the United States versus those of Germany and Japan They're not the same but the gap has narrowed very appreciably   We could   It's really significant in terms not just of the absolute improvement but the relative improvement The cost containment going on throughout the economy, including in the  -23-    7/2-3/91  banking sector, I think bodes very well for the future And notwithstanding what Governor Angell said a moment ago, I think the balance-sheet rebuilding that we're seeing in the corporate sector and the household sector, while badly needed, is not an inconsequential factor looking out over the intermediate term as well That is another way of saying that if we don't screw it up, the outlook over the next few years is a good deal better than we might have thought   I would reaffirm the '91 ranges and put in alternative II for '92 But I do take quite seriously this point you made, Mr Chairman, about the need to take a hard look at those '92 ranges in February I say that because, assuming there are no big surprises in the economy or financial system that would make me take away Mike Prell's gold star that I gave him yesterday, we are at the point in the cycle where we have to think about, or begin to think about, the need to tighten policy Certainly, I'm not saying that's needed right now, but we should start thinking in those terms And it seems to me that on this whole question of credibility, which probably gets a little overblown, the real test of our credibility is going to be whether, if it's needed, we will tighten soon enough and sufficiently enough to prevent the serious mistakes in policy that were made in the mid-1970s If you look at the forecast and take it more or less at face value, it seems to me that that question could easily be on the table in spades six months from now or so Since I see that as a possibility, and since I think our credibility really does come down to what we do and not what we say, I'd rather keep the ranges where they are just in case things do work that way And then a cut in the ranges in February will be more than symbolic and the timing might be precisely what we need So, I'm quite comfortable with reaffirming the ranges in alternative II but, as I said, I do take seriously your point about the need to look at that closely in February Indeed, things could turn out such that both substantively  -41-    7/2-3/91  and symbolically a cut in the ranges then could be just what the doctor ordered when we need it most   That's really symmetric when you don't even have to say it!   "B" symmetric Let me just come back to this point that Ed Boehne raised first and others have commented on In the period immediately ahead, partly for the reasons Tommy Melzer noted, I would worry more about slower real money supply growth than I would about fast money supply growth Part of what this dilemma about the money supply is telling me at least right now is that the money supply really isn't worth a damn either in terms of a policy indicator in the short run Wayne wants to get off the funds rate and so do I; but if you're going to get off that, you have to get on something else And it isn't clear to me what else we can get on   But this point you're raising, this intermediation phenomenon, really could make the policy process in the period ahead very, very tricky no matter what horse we're riding It is a worry   I'll move it   Alan, is Mike Prell there [to comment on] how he's looking at the real economy?   This is Jerry Corrigan Let me just make a couple of comments First of all, I don't think we have    8/5/91  anything at all to add in terms of what Don Kohn said about the diagnostics of money supply But I do think the point that Bob Parry, Ed Boehne, and Bob Forrestal made in terms of the real economy is relevant We had a directors' discussion last Thursday in which there, too, the comments bearing on the recovery reflected extremely sour attitudes on the part of some, if not most, of our directors, although I don't think that is likely to provide a full explanation I just wanted to make a suggestion, which may not be very workable, but let me try it anyway The suggestion is this Would it be possible for Don, working with a handful of people around the Reserve Banks, to try to design a quick and dirty little survey that would be directed mainly at a sample of mid-size and large banks and would be targeted at the chief financial officer of a cross section of banks around the country over the next few days? The survey would press pretty hard in terms of questions like What is motivating their pricing strategy on deposits? What do they have to say about loan demand? What do they have to say about credit standards? In other words, in what would still be anecdotal rather than perhaps a statistically perfect [way staff would] try to mount a special effort, literally over the next few days, to get some additional insights of what is going on there I don't know whether anybody has anything that they--   One of the things that I'm not certain about--maybe you know the answer--is whether we really are sure that that regular survey is being responded to by senior enough people in the organization that we're getting enough of the strategic view of what is going on as opposed to a [unintelligible] view   Well, it's a complicated issue and it's hard to do much on short notice, but I have a suspicion, [given] the way these things seem to be unfolding, that it's worth whatever special efforts it may take to get further insights here   Second   I'll move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   Move it  SPEAKER(?) Second    8/20/91   To pick up on a point that you made, Mr Chairman, I'm not inherently troubled by the fact that the rank order stayed the same over this whole period, despite Mike's clever recitation of all that took place in that period On the other hand, if you look at this table, there are at least a few cases in which the change in the rank order did mean something For example, around the time of the stock market crash in October 1987, there's no question that that change really meant something Whatever we do, I think we have to preserve some flexibility to take account of things like that On the other hand, I fear that if we got into the practice of managing the rank order as part of the normal deliberative process of the Committee, it could be disruptive to the policy process For example, I think it would be terrible if we ended up with a situation in which the Committee couldn't reach a reasonable conclusion about the thrust of policy because of a great debate as to what should be number two versus what should be number three or number four versus number two If we were going to move in the direction of what Mike Kelley has characterized as an active management of the rank order, the only way I can see that that can be done without running the risk of disrupting the normal consensus-building process within the Committee would be in a context in which there would be a consensus on that point after the policy directive itself had already been voted on The thought of inviting dissents over what is number three versus number two I think could be very disruptive   That's my point   Say that again, Mike   The only problem with that is that then the burden is on all your insurance companies   Well, I don't think there's any question that the anecdotal side of things has gotten quite shaky again Some of that is because the typical CEO of a company never really believed his or her own economists or other economists in terms of the outlook, going back two or three months ago And I think a lot of business executives have interpreted recent data to mean that they were right and the economists were wrong My own sense of the situation is that while things are not as good as they would like them to be, they're not as bad as they think they are either I believe the truth still lies somewhere in the middle Now, having said that, and as someone who has been sensitive to what I'll call financial jitters for a long time, I do think it's fair to say that confidence on the part of both consumers and business people is being further shaken by the cumulative effects of financial jitters And financial jitters, as some people have already said, take a lot of forms here There are new questions about insurance company scandals, and consumer delinquencies are rising All of that is having a little impact, or perhaps even a lot, in an insidious way on confidence in general One implication is that the economy at large is probably even more vulnerable to any kind of financial surprise or shock, even though I've believed it has been vulnerable for a long time  There are also two things of a more intermediate nature that worry me a bit relative to my earlier expectations One has already been touched on and that is that while the inflation outlook in some sense is better--and certainly I still think we can break that so- called core inflation rate of 4 percent that we've been living with for most of the decade--I, too, look at that second-quarter data on wages and so on with some concern While I can readily see how we'll break the 4 percent, I'm not nearly as sure as I was some months ago that we can do a lot better than that Indeed, it seems to me that in order to do a lot better than that one of two things has to happen One is that overall compensation has to bend down, and I'm getting a little skeptical that that can bend down in any significant way except in the context of an economic outlook that would be horrible otherwise Or, we have to get some real recovery [in] productivity, which doesn't look so [likely] either So, again, I feel a little  -25-    8/20/91  less sanguine than I did before about the intermediate-term outlook for inflation  The other intermediate-term thing that has gotten worse is the budgetary deficit outlook If you look at these new estimates-- whether you use OMB's or CBO's and whether you put the S&L [bailout costs] in or out--there really is a material deterioration in the intermediate outlook for the budgetary deficit And that's a worry Now, as Mike said, even against the backdrop of those short- and intermediate-term variables, one can conceive of a wide range of possible outcomes over the forecast period I think the saving rate is a very large wild card; indeed, in the context of Bob Black's remarks about employment and wages and so on in other cycles, one big difference is that in other cycles we didn't have a 35 percent saving rate like we have right now It's a little hard to see how that all will play out, especially if one is assuming implicitly that the rate of increase in nominal wages and compensation has to come down a lot and inflation is going to have to come down a lot So, there's a bit of a conundrum there; again, I think the saving rate is a wild card  Just a brief word if I may, Mr Chairman, on M2--not so much as a policy indicator but more in terms of what it may be telling us about the economy In looking at all the work that the staff did, I come away with the view that M2, at least in informational terms, seems to be saying two things One is fairly benign, and that is that this reach-for-yield [behavior]--in a context in which people are a lot more sophisticated and alternative outlets are a lot easier and cheaper to get at--is an important factor here That, in and of itself, is not something that I worry a lot about, if at all, in policy terms But in looking at the staff's work, I come also to the view that the credit crunch is indeed a factor Now, I can't quite yet sort out the demand side versus supply side influences that constitute the credit crunch But I do find very revealing the table following page 6 in the staff memorandum where they try to look at the relationship between core deposit growth, capital positions of banks, and loan positions of banks That table to me, which admittedly only covers the very short period of June 3rd to August 5th, is a very revealing table Again, it doesn't tell us whether it's demand or supply, but I think it does tell us an awful lot that this credit crunch [phenomenon] is quite real and that that aspect of the way the disintermediation process is working does matter for policy As I said, the reach-for-yield [phenomenon], I think, is rather irrelevant   I'm not sure I feel I can go quite that far Clearly, it says that supply is at work here   Well, it clearly says that, but there are ways in which demand forces could also be producing at least some of this result Certainly, I don't think one can say it's 100 percent supply But to me it's a very revealing table and, unlike the reach-for-yield phenomenon, does have some policy implications--though not in terms of whether M2 should be used as a target That's another  -26-    8/20/91  issue altogether If anything, it says M2 shouldn't be used as a target; but I don't want to get into that debate What it does say to me in the context of these other considerations, and in particular the emphasis on financial jitters, is that while there is a broad range [of risks, they are mostly] on the down side Having said that, I think we're probably okay in terms of Mike's forecast or something like it But the cumulative [impact of] all this financial stuff is a real overhang on the whole outlook   "B" asymmetric is okay with me On the language, I seem to remember that at the end of the last meeting I said something along the lines of "The worst thing I can think of in some sense is an economy that appears to be recovering and M2 is dead in the water" And that's what we've got I don't trust M2 and I trust it less today than I did six weeks ago For that reason, I would favor version I I think Tommy's point about getting trapped by that is a concern   Yes, let me just say a couple of further words on the Salomon situation As Peter has indicated, and as I think is widely known, the status of Salomon as a primary dealer is under active review Just so the Committee understands the way that all came about, Gutfruend called me on Friday the 9th of August and first revealed the initial violations We sent them a letter the following Monday, which they got on Tuesday, in which we basically said that in view of what they had disclosed they had 10 days to make their case on why they should be retained as a primary dealer That letter, I think, prompted the second round of disclosures, which didn't come easily I might add And when the full scope of the second round of disclosures became apparent, I told them--and this was all in consultation with the Treasury and the Chairman, so I was not acting in a vacuum--that signals were off for the 10 days and that they should not conclude that the Tuesday letter meant that we might not take immediate action And I think it's fairly clear that that message was what, in turn, prompted the decision of Strauss and Gutfruend to resign and Buffet to come on board There was no horse trading about this But we did decide here on Friday morning in the Chairman's office that in those circumstances we would give them a little more breathing room to make their case So, in effect, we did give them an extension, which has now run its course They have submitted to us a rather voluminous set of documents laying out all the changes they've made and all the changes they plan and so forth, and that is under evaluation Nevertheless, we are rapidly approaching the point where the decision time will be at hand Indeed, I would be very surprised if whatever decision we make is not    10/1/91  made sometime around the middle to the end of this month I can't see it going beyond the end of this month  At this point, I don't want to try to prejudge that decision And above all we recognize that the Board of Governors and the Committee have a natural and appropriate interest in both the decision and the decisionmaking process, if for no other reason--and there are others as well--that there are possible decisions in the spectrum of all that might be considered that could have very major implications not just for the firm but for markets as well As that gets closer we will, of course, make sure that appropriate means and mechanisms are followed to satisfy those natural interests Obviously, we will have to consult with the Treasury and the SEC as well  Even though I don't think it has to bear on the decision, whatever it is, I can't underscore enough how large and how complex this firm is If you look at it relative to Drexel, for example, Drexel literally looks like a fly on an elephant's behind in terms of both size and complexity The balance sheet, as Peter said, is down to something a little over $100 billion now But again, unlike Drexel, not insignificant parts of this balance sheet are booked in foreign offices in a multiple-currency type environment now, with significant balance sheet assets denominated in various foreign currencies Their global operations are several orders of magnitude different from anything we've seen to date But I think the biggest element of potential complexity is the off-balance sheet The off- balance sheet in total notational terms is about $650 billion, isn't it Joan? [Secretary's note Ms Lovett replied in the affirmative] Again, that's bigger than a bread basket One of the things, of course, that you see when you confront this kind of situation is that although everybody says you can net positions down and all that, it doesn't work that easily in practice The most complex element of the off-balance sheet by far is the swap book The swap book aggregates to $320 billion; the rest of it is foreign exchange, futures, and forward mortgage-backed securities They're complicated in their own right but one could at least visualize how those things can be taken care of The swap book is a horse of an entirely different color It involves multiple categories of counterparties all over the world And the swap book was, among other things, the instrumentality through which these incredibly complex hedging positions were developed  So, it's not as if you can take the swap book and carve it out without the carving out itself having very important implications for all the other instruments both on and off the balance sheet And maturities in the swap book can run out as much as 10 years; they're not just interest rate swaps Some of them are highly complex swaps that involve both interest rates and exchange rates Some have three or four or five interest rate/swap-type transactions that are tied up with currency swaps that might involve six or seven different currencies, and that's basically one transaction But the difficulty with the swap book other than its complexity is that writers of swaps essentially have either an implicit or offer a very explicit responsibility to buy them back and/or to make a market Now, the problem that creates is that if the thing starts to slip, what will happen just as sure as any of us are sitting here is the counterparties that are net plus in individual swaps will put them back and the ones that are net minus will take to the hills And that can create some rather unusual difficulties But I say that just so    10/1/91  people recognize that this is an extremely big and very, very complex firm Again, it's not that that by itself bears on what one does or does not do; but it does say that, as a part of the process of coming to whatever conclusions have to be reached, we have to consider, and we are doing so seriously, possible contingencies that could arise Mr Chairman, I think that's all I want to say at this point   Well, that's obviously a tough question The prevailing view among people in the markets here and abroad, including some very prominent foreign officials--the prevailing view among those who choose to express a view about that to me--is, yes Now, that doesn't mean that view is right We ourselves certainly think that is a possibility It's one of these things that is so hard to judge   A second question, of course, is that even if you thought it would, how do you judge the follow-on systemically? And a propos Ed Boehne's questions, from an institutional point of view, there are risks on both sides even of that Now, there are certainly people who say that our institutional reputation is damaged if we don't do something like that But if we did it and it produced that kind of problem, our institutional reputation could be damaged in the opposite direction So, it's a very, very difficult question   We surely do   I think that's the thrust of Ed's comment But there's not a win-win there that I can see   Well, let me say two things about that, Wayne First, as you know, as part of this interagency review process we are looking very hard at what steps can be taken to accelerate the programs that are already on the drawing board I don't have a firm answer as to how much can be done to accelerate that process It is unambiguously clear that some kind of electronic bidding system would help [alleviate] some of these problems But it is not by any means a panacea I think, for example, that what Salomon did was three things One is that they violated the auction rules; two is that they systematically lied about it; and three is that they used the set of customer relationships that are all within existing rules to piece together these very complicated financing arrangements for themselves and their customers that produced the "squeeze" Squeezes can be good; squeezes can be bad That's a problem in its own right In any event, that produces these distortions either in terms of the price of the underlying security or the pricing of the RP in the marketplace Now, those latter things, whether one thinks they're good or bad, could have been done entirely within the existing rules That may say that the rules are wrong; but they could have been done entirely within the existing rules And that issue in my mind is in some ways more fundamental than the fact that they broke the rules It has nothing to do with the question of penalties, of punishments fitting the crimes, and all that In terms of the way the market works, an electronic bidding system isn't going to do a darn thing to deal with those issues  The other thing that is important to keep in mind is that one can at least speculate--and that's all it is--that even the most sophisticated electronic bidding system and trading system might still result in a situation, and indeed I suspect would result in a situation, in which there still would be a relatively small number of large institutional players that are going to be a very, very prominent if not dominant part of this market In addition, even the most sophisticated electronic bidding and trading system in and of itself does not provide the answer to the question of who our counterparties are And that's where the nub of the so-called moral hazard problem arises Because as long as we have to deal with somebody, there has to be some kind of objective standard In this day and age of "Government in the Sunshine" and all the rest of it, we wouldn't last 5 minutes saying "Well, that's our business and nobody else's business" So, while the electronics can and will help a lot, and frankly in retrospect we probably--not probably, we should have been putting more emphasis on that--as you know very well, it was perceived as a question of priorities We've put huge amounts of resources into the upgrading of the book entry system itself; we've    10/1/91  put huge amounts of resources into Treasury direct; we've put huge amounts of resources in the savings bond thing; and the perception was that the auction system was working well It didn't seem, certainly to me--and I was wrong--to be at the front end of the priority list in terms of intensive application of new technology   I agree completely with that And, really--Dave has been working with us on this--we will be putting a full court press on that But I don't want to leave the impression with anybody that once we fix that, we've fixed all these other problems because that just doesn't follow   Second   This is going to sound as if it was orchestrated, but it was not Amid all these anecdotal reports, Gary's people must be sending the people in Minneapolis to talk to me because I hear all this terrible stuff too But staff at the Bank yesterday were walking me through some [analysis] on the household sector, which actually made me feel a little better Some of it Mike already referred to and indirectly John referred to it We all have this impression that the saving rate is very low, that income growth is rather sluggish, and that spending is rather sluggish But if you look at it in the context of these NBER charts, you find several things One is that the saving rate never falls in the beginning of a recovery What that means, of course, is that it is income that pushes up spending, not the saving rate falling And when you look at the income side in this recovery, it's sluggish but certainly not disastrously so I think that was part of what Mike was saying before And neither for that matter is overall consumption spending or even so-called discretionary consumption spending all that wildly out of line with what one might expect On the other hand, nonagricultural employment is a bit weaker, but interestingly enough that is not in manufacturing; it's not even in construction It's basically all in services, with particular emphasis on finance, insurance, and real estate, and in state and local governments And, of course, those problems are as much secular as they are cyclical What that basically says is that if you look at the dynamics of the consumer sector in the context of income, employment, and savings, despite the fact that nobody feels very good, it's not all that unusual looking  There's another side to it, which gets to John LaWare's point that I found even more interesting And that is what has been happening to the household balance sheet When you look at that household balance sheet in flow-of-funds terms, what you find is that the contraction in the growth of household debt doesn't look all that unusual either The only thing that's unusual is that it started a little earlier than it normally does and that the fall in the growth rate of non-mortgage debt started distinctly earlier and has been much steeper But that probably reflects the 1986 Tax Act as much as anything else But as the rate of growth of debt falls, if you believe in a balance sheet, something else must happen And of course when you look at the last four or five years as a whole, the saving rate on balance hasn't really changed at all Therefore, what we find, which isn't surprising, is that over that period the growth in the acquisition of financial assets and the acquisition or increase in liabilities are very, very similar And that, of course, makes the overall situation look even more typical But it turns out--and this is the thing I didn't really have a clue on--that there is one very big difference in terms of the financial assets side of the household balance sheet over this four-to-five year period, and that is a very large atypical shift in the composition of household financial assets out of bank deposits into various securities-type instruments, including government securities funds and so on   Well, even the mutual funds are a part of it, but it's also the government funds Now, that big relative drop in bank deposits, of course, we see in the context of the rate of growth in the money supply But if you think of it in  -19-    10/1/91  this broader context, it seems to me that the pattern as a whole is quite consistent with the hypothesis that it's being driven importantly by the desire to shed debt, which is quite consistent with John's point about the demand side of the equation being more important than the supply side Indeed, it's also quite consistent with the hypothesis that the portfolio shift phenomenon, which in part is being facilitated by technology, may have an important role here as well Now, the reason why that makes me feel a little better in the context of the earlier comments about income, consumption, the saving rate and so on is that, to the extent it is significantly driven by purposeful decisions to manage the balance sheet better and shed debt, it also makes me at least less nervous--I'm still nervous--about the money supply and about the credit crunch That's not to say that I think I understand the money supply and it's not to say that there are not elements of the credit crunch there; it's simply to say that it makes me feel a little better about them and therefore a little more comfortable with the kind of forecast that Mike has on the table  I'd quickly add, Mr Chairman, on the anecdotal side, that the attitudes one hears about, especially from big businesses, are still lousy The only other thing--I don't remember if I mentioned this at the last meeting or not--is that I do get the sense that the commercial real estate market in price terms may be bottoming out, at least in the greater New York metropolitan area There's still going to be a long workout, but one does begin to get the feel that the precipitous--   That's right   Sale prices   Yes Now, that's still in the straw-in-the-wind category, but I now have had enough people say that to me that I can't dismiss it   Well, it's not just the City I get this now from northern Jersey too, anyway Ed, I don't know what they're saying in southern Jersey, but certainly in northern Jersey--   Look, don't misunderstand me They are weak in New York But what I'm saying is that they appear to be--   Well, that's clear The rate of decline has abated, but my impression is that it is beginning to sound as though people think it may be bottoming out   "B" mildly symmetric sounds fine to me   Asymmetric There are too many adjectives in these things!   Mr Chairman, several people have already made the point that I think is very clear, and that is that the psychology of the situation is slipping We can debate as to precisely what the reasons are, but it is slipping Certainly, in the latest rounds of meetings I've had with business leaders there really has been quite a perceptible deterioration in attitudes In those circumstances, I do think that this is one of those times, of which there are not many, when we have to be thinking of a policy move that is something other than plain vanilla For that reason, I would associate myself with those who have suggested a reduction in the discount rate with a corresponding reduction in the federal funds rate I see very, very minimal downside risk in the current circumstances with that approach And if that does jump-start some things, obviously policy can respond in the opposite direction if it has to later on But right now I do think that something a bit out of the ordinary is called for to try to stem this deterioration in confidence, which I at least perceive to be fairly broadly based at the moment So, I would favor a discount rate change I could go either way as to whether [the Board] does it Friday or next week I'd be influenced a little at least by what we see in the forthcoming statistics We get labor market numbers this Friday and that might prove decisive one way or another for me as far as the timing goes I think Ed Boehne got it right when he said that a matter of a few days one way or another is not the end of the world, but I do think we need something that does convey a message here Even though normally I would be very responsive to Bob Parry's point about testing the market, in this particular circumstance I frankly find it quite awkward to do 1/4 point on the funds rate today or tomorrow or Friday and then come back with something else at the beginning of next week It seems to me that that carries the wrong message, including the message of a Federal Open Market Committee that is stumbling around a bit So, while I normally would be very sympathetic with testing the market, in this particular case I'd rather do it all at once, even if it means waiting until next week   Move it   Second   Could I ask Mr Parry a question?   Bob, just in the past few weeks I've heard a couple of people, including a really large national real estate developer, sounding very dire about the real estate outlook on the West Coast and in California particularly--much more so than anything I've heard before Is there anything to that?   Yes, this is--   I'm not going to add anything in the anecdotal area; it would be more of the same But, like everyone else, I spend a lot of time these days scratching my head a little and asking why the recovery hasn't really taken hold and what is going on out there The more I look at it and think about it, the more clear it becomes to me that there are a number of structural or semi- structural forces at work A lot has been said about inventories, and that's good news and bad news; it makes the recession itself shallower, but it also means the recovery has less "pop" One thing about inventories that I hadn't really focused on until yesterday is that the sense of comfort that inventories are in good shape is okay as a generalization, but I was surprised to see when I looked at it that in the non-auto retail sector inventories are not in all that great shape Now, maybe that's just because there are a lot more stores and maybe even a greater variety of goods; nevertheless, it's there  But beyond the inventory situation, one of the longer-term things we all talk about is this real estate overhang I think Dick Syron is right when he points to the fact that it's not just the overhang itself but the spillover effect it has on perceptions about asset quality prices that has an impact on confidence Mike Prell touched on debt burdens with a bit of a question in his mind I've had a question in my mind, but the more I think about it, the more important I think it is in terms of attitudes and financial fragility that we all have talked a lot about The fiscal situation is ugly not just because the deficits are big but because the process is basically immobilized  But when I think about those things, with the exception of inventories, one of the things that strikes me is that in a sense they're all symptomatic of the chickens coming home to roost They're all symptomatic of earlier excesses of one kind or another But I still ask myself What do they mean? I just handed some charts to the Chairman that are based on work I had staff at the Bank do in trying to look at some of this in a much longer perspective Just to cite a couple of examples that come out of that When you look at the default rate on corporate bonds--this is the default rate on all rated issues, so a lot of the junk bonds aren't even in this calculation-- it's currently 3 percent of all rated issues, which is by far the largest it has been in the postwar period We did one calculation on office space that may or may not be right, but it's pretty dramatic because it says that it would take six years of service-sector employment growth at the very rapid rates of the 1980s to absorb the overhang in service-sector office space that's there now, assuming that nothing else is built for the next six years It's a big number If you look at the banks--maybe somebody else looked at this before but I hadn't really focused on this--loan losses as a percentage of total loans are 137 percent That doesn't sound all that bad, but it turns out that 137 percent is by a wide margin the highest that this has been since 1936 And the loan losses in the banking system just in 1990 were $28 billion, as against before tax profits of $23  -18-    11/5/91  billion Again, what is interesting about the $28 billion in losses is that while $77 billion was in real estate, $72 billion was in consumer lending, $85 billion was in C&I lending, and there was still $47 billion left over in all other categories of lending Again, those are very big numbers and they're not confined by a long shot to real estate  When I look at all those things, what leaps into my mind, other than that the chickens are coming home to roost, is that in some ways I'm surprised that we didn't have a credit crunch, whatever that may mean--I think Bob McTeer makes a good point there--a lot sooner or that it hasn't been a lot worse But the way I come out on all those numbers is that, in the face of them, we're probably doing as well as we could reasonably expect to do But that raises in my mind even more this question about the outlook Clearly, those things strongly reinforce the view that the recovery, whatever else it may be, is going to be distinctly subpar That has never bothered me per se But the question that looms larger in my mind and has in the past is With all of that, can we even get a result that looks like the Greenbook in a context in which I think the Greenbook [projects] a pretty good outcome if for no other reason than that it is respectable at least in terms of growth But more than that, it is an outlook that is compatible with this continued whittling away at the core inflation rate And I guess I'm not so sure that even that outlook is as comfortably in hand as I once thought it was   I would favor the 25 basis point reduction in the funds rate accompanied by a discount rate change of 1/2 percentage point, recognizing, of course, that the timing decision [for the discount rate] itself is the Board's If both of those things were done--this gets into Ed's question about timing--I probably would favor a symmetric directive thereafter With just the funds rate done, that complicates matters and I'd probably favor an asymmetric directive   That means I'd vote either way   That's how it's a compromise!  MR, BLACK I thought we had covered every permutation and combination we could have, but I don't think anybody has come up with exactly this I would leave the federal funds rate where it is for right now, but I would favor submitting--in the case of our Bank, which would join several others--[a recommendation for] a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate with the hope that the Board would see fit to approve that on Friday If we had a steady federal funds rate right  -33-    11/5/91  now, I think that would be a good way to reassure the long-term markets and it would give us a little more time to judge the easing actions that we took last week At the same time, reducing the [discount] rate would reestablish a more normal spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate And a very important point, to which Governor Angell alluded earlier as did Tom Melzer, is that it might also convince a lot of potential borrowers who are sitting out there just waiting until they think rates have hit the bottom to move into the fray A lot of people in the real estate business think that is true Now, if we did adopt that approach, which I'm sure we're not going to, I would favor having an asymmetric directive in favor of ease thereafter   That's true all the time   That's not a bad idea!   A whole bunch!  MELZER Exactly So, if somebody is short $50 million on the 10-year, isn't that--?   It's probably $150 per 1/32 per million   I tend to be a bit conservative, as you know, about these things But in this context, I frankly don't worry about [unintelligible] people maybe getting burned because they're short They are risk takers What worries me is a little more far-reaching than that, and that is, as you know very well, we have to be very careful about this marketplace Governor Angell is quite consistent But going back to our discussion a week or 10 days ago when we were talking about basically dismantling the whole infrastructure to that market, this is a very concrete, vivid example of the kind of thing I'm worried about And we've got to be careful of these things   Well, I think Dave has the right idea Notwithstanding my extreme caution in terms of some of these other more sweeping moves, in this particular context I'd go ahead and do it on Wednesday and take our chances But that doesn't mean that my anxieties about the need for a little care and nurturing of this market can be assumed to have disappeared   I'll move it   I'll move it   I support Governor Kelley's position   Well, as everybody has already said, this is a tough one Clearly, attitudes are lousy To pick up on Gary Stern's point that the statistics are catching up with the attitudes Maybe the causation is precisely in that direction and we have a classic self-fulfilling prophecy Another interesting thing that is surfacing now in a rather forceful way, which is attitudinal in one sense, is that even among informed observers there is this notion that monetary policy is pushing on a string I just don't think that's right Mike Prell touched on it a bit But if you look at the behavior of the so-called interest-sensitive parts of spending versus the so-called non-interest-sensitive parts, at least to date, the anomaly is not in the interest-sensitive parts; it's in the non- interest sensitive parts It's not that the interest-sensitive parts are booming, but the big difference is in the non-interest-sensitive parts which, of course, is consistent with the view that monetary policy is not pushing on a string When you look at it a bit more carefully in the context of this confidence factor, where are the big differences? It seems to me that one can say, at the risk of a major  -22-    12/17/91  oversimplification, that the big differences lie in two areas The first is government itself We do have for good and necessary reasons a more restrictive fiscal policy stance at the federal level, given where the economy is, than we had in earlier episodes But what I think really makes the difference is the combination of the federal level and the state and local level Indeed, it seems to me that the state and local sector in many, many different ways--including the way it affects confidence--really is one of the major differences in the economy and the performance of the economy in recent quarters  Now, the second big difference is the one that many have touched on and that is the debt overhang problem The point that Governor Mullins made is an important one In part, the workout of the debt overhang problem has been going on for two or three years, and I don't think we fully recognized it when it began to take hold But it is one of the reasons why the economy as a whole has basically been limping along for three years And whatever you think of it, it obviously still has multifaceted implications both now and for the immediate future in terms of financial institution problems, balance sheet rebuilding, corporate restructuring, and all the rest of it But the cumulative effects of those things have a lot to do with this confidence factor that everyone's speaking of But even after having said that, I am still perplexed on the one hand and worried on the other as to why these measures of confidence have dropped like a stone in the last couple of months We can argue whether they are at 1982 levels or 1987 levels, but they do just seem to have cracked Again, I think Mike's point is right The economics profession doesn't tell us much at all about what to make of that Certainly, it doesn't tell us much at all about how to build that into a forecast or anything like that As a matter of fact, the track record of those [confidence surveys] is lousy Nevertheless, we have this sharp downward break in confidence against the history of all these other events  Well, I don't know what to make of that any more than anybody else does But it does seem to me that at the very least it raises further questions about the near-term outlook for consumer spending As I think I mentioned at the last Committee meeting, the retail inventory situation isn't great Now, when we talk to individual store owners, they say their inventories are lean as the devil; and when we go into our local department store and look around, the shelves don't look overburdened But what we forget is that there are a heck of a lot more stores out there There has been a tremendous increase in the number of retail outlets as a part of this boom of the '80s So, the information at the level of the individual store may not be telling the whole story  Another concern, in the context of this confidence factor, is the other side of Dave Mullins's point about the stock market The stock market, of course, has been doing terrifically With all of these new offerings and stock prices holding up the numbers, it is actually one of the few things that probably are helping to maintain confidence But we have to remember that, by many conventional measures of PE ratios and things like that, the stock market is at a pretty high level given any kind of reasonable guess as to what near- term profits at least are going to be Now, of course, it may be that the stock market has really gotten smart and is looking through the near term to the longer-term implications of the restructurings and  -23-    12/17/91  other things that are going on, which could be a big plus [over time] Nevertheless, it is another area of concern  When I put all that together along with what everybody else has said, I can't take serious exception to the kind of forecast that Mike has in the Greenbook or that of my own staff in New York, which isn't all that different But I think the band of uncertainty is pretty wide, if for no other reason than that this confidence factor, as John LaWare says, really is the wild card   I support your position I'd just make a point that sounds absolutely preposterous in this environment Things could develop, even in 1992, where we could get surprised on the up side That sounds ridiculous right now, but let's not forget about that possibility   He thought he wrote you down on a piece of paper without [unintelligible]   Thank you very much, Mr Chairman I assume that all members of the Committee have the draft paper that was circulated by Gary Gillum the other day And I'm sure that you all recognize that the draft paper reflects a very careful and delicate balancing of a number of competing considerations and even points of view Having said that, it reflects a point view at this juncture that [unintelligible] I think the Committee members should also recognize that at least in a rough sense this particular document has to be thought of in the context of the intra-agency report of the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Treasury that the three agencies committed to back in September at the time of the first rounds of Congressional hearings on the Salomon Brothers situation Peter Sternlight or Don Kohn can, if needed, provide Committee members with the flavor of that report I would simply say that it is voluminous; we project that the summary alone will run about 75 pages or more  The only point I would make in reference to that report pertains to these papers [unintelligible] agreement on the basis where the Federal Reserve Bank of New York only has primary day-to-day responsibility for market surveillance, which is sharply distinct from dealer surveillance The latter, of course, requires [unintelligible] along the lines [indicated in] the memorandum for the reasons set forth [therein] Don and Peter pointed this out, and they do refer to a point of view that reflects our concerns [about] dealer surveillance The Committee members I think should also know that [unintelligible], the report is likely to [be ready] for release on or about Tuesday the 22nd of January There could always be some slippage there [Unintelligible] But simultaneously when we release the agency report, we will at least [consider] something along the lines of making this internal view known I should also say that [unintelligible] in reading the introductory paragraph in the report we are in the process of consulting with the Treasury and the SEC about the view that [unintelligible]  What we're doing here [in this call is seeking] the Committee's point of view on this particular issue and [unintelligible] their support that is philosophically [unintelligible] among the agencies support Because that consultative process is still going on, there are going to be some further [changes in the] words here and there Just as an example, Ted Truman earlier today made an excellent suggestion relating to the fact that we shouldn't formulate into this the specific reference to the so-called [unintelligible] Even though I think our [views at the New York Bank] are made [clear] in the report itself, Mr Chairman, any questions or comments or observations that Committee members have on the paper and on this issue would be appropriate When we finish    1/9/92  with that I might, Mr Chairman, say a word or two on where we stand with Salomon Brothers and potential sanctions pertaining to that firm   First of all, Ed, I'll elaborate a bit further on exactly what the dealer surveillance program is It actually predates the Drysdale episode and related affairs of the early 1980s In fact, it goes back considerably before that The dealer surveillance [program] has been around [a long time] as a statistical reporting program and even goes back to the 1960s Now, [there is a] feature of the dealer surveillance program that has accentuated this kind of "moral hazard" problem, which is really what we're trying to get away from, recognizing that at least at this stage I don't think we can get away from it totally, but I think we're really going to [unintelligible] Specifically, at its best, over a period of many, many years a part of that dealer surveillance program was a formal on-site visit or inspection program for the primary dealers As a [result] of that formal on-site inspection program--I'm being loose with words here--we have led ourselves and others into believing that this is in some way the substantive equivalent of a bank examination in which we are passing some kind of judgment about their financial wherewithal, their managerial wherewithal, their internal control systems, etc, when in fact the program was never really up to that to begin with But more importantly, we have not only the [unintelligible] these firms as primary dealers And that's what we're trying to get away from I can say personally that I have been uncomfortable about that aspect of this operation literally for years I think that feature of the dealer surveillance program reinforces the impression in the marketplace that we are in fact sprinkling holy water on them or anointing them And that's the cycle that we're trying to break from    1/9/92  Now, the market surveillance is at least in general what it says It involves adding a program, perhaps including some different elements to our current statistics program, that aims at spotting anomalies in the marketplace price distortions, possible squeezes, conditions in the RP market involving specials that seem to raise questions about patterns of trading, and activity in the market as a whole Again, Don and Peter can go into this in somewhat greater detail The [crux] is that to the extent we observe through that market surveillance things that seem to suggest a potential violation of law or regulation, we would have a responsibility to bring that to the attention of the SEC or the Treasury or the Justice Department who do have the enforcement authority Though it may sound like semantics, I think there is a very substantial substantive difference between dealer surveillance on the one hand and market surveillance on the other   It could be First of all, what we tried to do here was to make this process of setting standards much more objective than it was in the past Again, we have to recognize explicitly that we do not have either formal compliance enforcement authority nor the authority to [impose] civil money penalties But we felt that we had to maintain some semblance of fit and proper standards and we wanted that to be as objective as possible We couldn't come up with something that was totally objective because--to use an example that might be a gray area--it's certainly possible to have a firm with [operational problems] that are removed from anything remotely having to do with [government securities] operations but if they had [such] problems we would be concerned It was apparent when  for example, not so long ago had some business with some defense contracts Did that mean that we should feel the need for [unintelligible] security [unintelligible]? So, there is a gray zone here and perhaps we won't [unintelligible] Nevertheless, this is an effort to make it much more objective than it was in the past but at the same time to leave a little flexibility Obviously, this is one of those places where we were doing a little high wire balancing act I should also point out, Ed, that the [wording] is carefully constructed, I think For example, earlier on where we talked about market-making and [meaningful] participation in Treasury auctions, we say we reserve the right to [dis]continue their [primary dealer] status but we say very specifically that it is strictly a business decision and has no bearing on their financial strength, their managerial competence, etc We also have incorporated this capital maintenance standard but we wanted to differentiate that clearly from the other two in a context in which it was as close to a vigorously objective standard that we could come up with    1/9/92   Had this document been in effect then, I think it would have been much easier and people would have known [unintelligible] That is another virtue of it It takes away the uncertainty But there isn't any question in my mind that this is precisely the kind of situation that would [unintelligible] I should also say, Ed, that there still is some debate going on about the [unintelligible] It was the bankers who really urged us to go ahead and suspend this primary dealer There is [several words unintelligible]   Let me read, Bob, for your benefit the language that Ted Truman gave us this afternoon Ted's suggestion, which is a good one, was to add a paragraph on page 4 along the following lines "And finally, [several words unintelligible]   All I can say, Bob, is that the point you raised has been at the heart of this issue since time immemorial There is only one solution to the problem that I know of and that solution would be that the Federal Reserve should have a full [unintelligible] and regulatory authority, something that the Federal Reserve itself historically has never been crazy about It is also something that as a practical matter would be extremely difficult to achieve in political terms, even if we thought it was the right solution Having said that, I do think this document at least goes some way toward distancing us from the problem that you've described As far as information-sharing is concerned, we have already talked to the SEC and they have agreed--and will agree I am told in writing--to come up with a basic financial information [unintelligible] tell us privately if they encounter a situation where one of the firms fell out of compliance with whatever capital standards [unintelligible] I don't think there is at least within reach any perfect solution that one can point to, but this does at least take some positive steps, perhaps, in the direction of reducing the dilemma [unintelligible]   Simply that we are trying to produce a more or less equivalent result and it fundamentally reflects the fact that the absolute level of capital in banks as opposed to broker- dealers is very different None of these things is perfect, of course, and [unintelligible] in trying to produce a roughly equivalent effect in terms of the minimum standards [unintelligible]   I guess I thought the language we used did that; maybe it needs to be made a little more clear There is a sentence at the bottom of page 6 which says "Following the implementation of automated communications for trading purposes, further expansion in the number of primary dealers will be feasible"  There was a similar sentence in the summary But, again, maybe we  need to give that a little more attention   That reference on page 4, of course, is for a completely different purpose The reference on page 4 is designed to deal with the case of a firm's [designation as a primary dealer being discontinued] if it has a relationship with us and doesn't use it It's intended to say If you have that relationship and you do not make reasonable markets and your relationship with us is for strictly business reasons, we will stop dealing with you This is precisely the way any firm would operate [unintelligible] So, the context there is quite different   I don't think so I think the other thing that is eliminated that's very important is the one you cited And, as we said before, [after the implementation of automation] we will add new dealers as quickly as is humanly possible and as quickly as they show themselves to be interested But until that automation is finished, there clearly is a finite number, which itself may change, but we can't deal with [unintelligible]   Let me see if we can fool around with the language I'll have Peter and Don see if they can come up with something that will be a little more responsive to this point   A good point   I see your point Your comment in juxtaposition with others clearly illustrates the balancing act that I referred to   It has been a big worry of mine, too I think your point is well taken   John, first of all, in the case of banks, I think we do know In the case of the SEC-registered firms, I have spoken directly to Chairman Breeden on this point I do have his commitment that if they encountered a situation of the nature that you've described, they would promptly--on that day--inform us of the circumstances But, again, it's not a perfect solution And your question is another illustration of this matter of doing the balancing [unintelligible] the SEC will live up to the commitments that it makes   Well, part of the answer to that, John, is to introduce--and this is a bit earlier in that paragraph-- this annual review of their performance relative to these admittedly nebulous performance standards that you referred to Of course, the presumption first of all is that a firm that gets into that position    1/9/92  would in most cases voluntarily withdraw We've already had a fair amount of experience with that Second, to the extent that a firm did not voluntarily withdraw, the timing of our decision to remove them coming in the context of what we know [unintelligible] annual review is such that it would be distinguished in the marketplace from an action that was taken because of capital position [unintelligible]   Well, there we go again It's a balancing act   I hear you All I can say is, yes, there obviously is an arbitrary element in that number Yes, we are mindful of the fact that in terms of where we tend to draw the line on the actual size of the bank, there is a question whether a bank even of that size can do transactions with us in sufficient size to be compatible with our needs and the efficiency of the Fed   Well, Dick, I think I can answer that The inter-agency study, just as this has, will probably in any number of ways make the point that as the auction process and our operations are automated, that itself will tend to change the character of the market in important ways The inter-agency study, for example, has a number of recommendations bearing on this whole question of price dissemination and opening up electronic trading But I think the cumulative weight of all of those things clearly moves    1/9/92  in the direction of saying that whatever franchise value is left even at this stage--and by the way it is clear that whatever it was it's going to be a lot less even as a result of these things--will dissipate further when these changes are made, I think to zero, if not to negative over time   I guess I should say that there is a concern, at least until all the automation is finished and we all have some experience with it--the Treasury in particular has a level of anxiety on this point--about these new auction procedures and whether they will work as well as we all hope Having said that, I think the cumulative weight clearly is in the direction of [unintelligible]   First of all, by way of identifying these multiple investigations of the Salomon Brothers situation [unintelligible] The point of view that has emerged over the last couple of months, which is very much shared by the SEC, is that to the extent feasible it is considered desirable to have several sanctions [unintelligible] being taken in the specific context of the actions of the SEC, although there may be [unintelligible] Now, part of the [desire] for doing that on a coordinated basis is the [unintelligible] argument, trying to minimize the dangers of multiple shoes dropping at multiple points in time with all of the uncertainties that go with that At the moment, it is still our intention to adhere to that approach with the proviso that we have some further assurances from the SEC that their determinations at least as they pertain to the firm will be forthcoming in the not too distant future There have been multiple discussions both at the staff level and with Chairman Breeden    1/9/92  on this point in recent weeks, and he is supposedly coming back to me within the next couple of days in another meeting regarding where he thinks they are in terms of the completion of that process If it seems reasonable to conclude that he is nearing the end of the road as it pertains to the firm, then I think we would be very much inclined to act in coordination with the SEC If on the other hand, that possibility is either remote or not even within reach, then I think we would have to reconsider the question of whether we [wait] or just go ahead notwithstanding the legitimate [unintelligible] Clearly, the coordinating approach [is more desirable if] he can provide some reasonable assurances that they are near the end of the process with respect to the firm in those circumstances   May I just conclude with one point, Mr Chairman? I know it's not necessary but I'll do it anyway I would emphasize that this document obviously is still extremely confidential I'm sure there will be some further wiggling here and there between now and January 22nd Some it will be aimed at the comments that were made today, which I fully endorse So, I would emphasize that the document should be treated very, very carefully   Thank you all  END OF SESSION  -10-     So move   Move it   We need a motion on the transactions    2/4-5/92 -5-   I will move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   Move it   Speaking near the end, there's not much left to say in terms of the national economy It's very hard to take serious exception to Mike's forecast at least for 1992; 1993 is obviously another question I would agree, as many of you have said in one fashion or another, that attitudes at least have stopped getting worse Whether they are better, it's hard to say; but one can [at least] say they are no worse Even some of the most bearish major corporate CEOs now associate themselves with that I also think one can make a pretty darn good argument that the stabilization of  -23-    2/4-5/92  attitudes, even if that's all it is, is fairly directly related to the change in monetary policy that was made at the end of December  Now, in terms of the shaping of the future, I have managed to convince myself that we probably are a bit further along in this correction of the debt overhang [problem] that Tom Simpson was talking about than maybe is fully recognized I also think we can now begin to make a case that the banking sector--and perhaps the financial sector more generally--looks a little better even if there still is a long way to go And I do agree with several people who made the comment that banks are more [receptive to borrowers] Just in terms of advertising space in the New York Times, we see a lot of full page ads now about loans, not deposits If those two points are accurate even at the margin, I'd stipulate that one of the key assumptions of the chart show, to the effect that the credit crunch will ease "somewhat"--I think that was the word--in 1993, might be a bit pessimistic I might be able to envision that [easing] at least in "somewhat" terms some time in 1992 But having said that, I agree also with John LaWare that the confidence factor is the wild card Even if there are some straws in the wind that smell a little better and look a little better, the economy does remain vulnerable to shock That's one of the reasons why I blow a little hot and cold about the level of the stock market But I also think, as a number of people have said, that the source of particular uncertainty is political with a capital "P," bipartisan I can't top Bob McTeer but I agree that the great [risk] on the fiscal side is that [the stimulus] will get overdone or that the process will get ugly, or both If it gets ugly in a process sense, that certainly is not going to help confidence If it gets ugly in a substantive sense, financial markets aren't going to like it And that is a major risk  Perhaps a bit longer term, I must also say that I take this Japan/US thing as a symptom of what I perceive as a real rise in protectionism and some elements of neo-isolationism This is a real concern even though it may not seem as imminent as the fiscal [actions] And while it's even less imminent, the point that Bill McDonough made in his remarks at the opening of the meeting about this tension among the Europeans--with a quite different economic profile in Germany on the one hand than in most of the other countries, with its implications for exchange rates and interest rates and some other symptoms of a political stress point--can have important economic implications, though maybe not immediately So, there's no shortage of things to worry about out there But the risks as I see them are much better balanced today than I viewed them over much of the fourth quarter I think we always run the risk of instant replay but for that reason I feel more comfortable with the kind of profile in Mike's forecast right now than I have for the last few months   Dick Syron   In the past 13 years or so I've been around this track more than once, too I can't deny the neatness [of this tunnel idea], but I have to ask myself the question Are we dealing here with form or substance? And if we're dealing with substance, it has to follow that the adoption of the tunnels would, in fact, mean that policy in some sense would be different If we're dealing with form, we're saying that policy would be the same but somehow or other the form would make a difference in terms of perceptions about policy --the so-called credibility effect I have to say that, despite the neatness, I think it's much more form than it is substance For example--and I can't allow for compounding, so Don Kohn can correct me if I'm wrong--I think it's about correct to say that had the Committee at the end of 1986 adopted a policy of a five-year cone from then to the end of 1991, policy wouldn't have been any different than it has been in one sense I think we would have been within the cone each and every year If we put ourselves back to that position--if we had had the cone and we were in it every year and M2 growth for the five- year period averaged 4 percent--would we have felt back then that we would have achieved price stability or have been much closer to it than we are right now? I think a lot of people would have said "yes" to both of those questions; but I don't think the outcome would have been any different either in terms of the execution of policy I am very skeptical--I always have been--of this so-called credibility argument The people out there setting wages and prices in the trenches wouldn't know a cone or a tunnel if they were in it What they react to is demand and supply in the marketplace And what we are ultimately trying to influence are those considerations So, while I do think [the tunnel concept] is neat, I don't think there is a great deal of substance, defined the way I did define it--meaning that the actual execution of policy would have been different than otherwise  I have a lot of sympathy with the argument that Dick Syron just made that at this juncture, not only for the reasons the Chairman cited but for the other one that Dick hinted at, this could end up as somewhat of a bear trap Right now, I'm not even sure I know what the algebraic sign of the interest elasticity of demand for M2 is In other words, I could make a pretty decent argument that if we want to accelerate M2 growth, we better raise interest rates Now, you may laugh, but I don't think you can just reject that out of hand And if we're not even sure what the algebraic sign is, why do we want to get ourselves trapped into a more mechanistic approach? In addition, there's the concern that the Chairman raised about what it might imply regardless of how we fine-tune the beginning point So, like others, I have been around this debate more times than I'd like to count I can't deny the neatness, but I would be reluctant to bet the ranch on the tunnel option at this juncture   [Unintelligible] very imperfect The technical data are interesting both in the context of Dave Mullins's question and Tom Melzer's last question If you look at the actual targets for M2 going all the way back to '83, once we got out of the recession, they have come down from 6 to 9 percent to 4 to 8 percent, to 3 to 7 percent, and to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent But if you look at the actual growth rates, in the first part of the period we had a base drift on the high side and in the second part a base drift on the low side I think for that period as a whole we probably end up about having washed it all out   That's right   I favor the alternative I tentative ranges from last year I would certainly tolerate growth in the upper half  -45-    2/4-5/92  of the range if it could materialize in a context of developments in inflation and economic activity that are otherwise satisfactory   Governor LaWare   Mr Chairman, I wonder if it might be a good idea for Governor LaWare to repeat briefly what he said when you were out of the room   I would, too  SPEAKER(?) Yes   "B," asymmetric   We're allowed to do that!   I think there really are two issues here One is this question of what should be our strategy as a whole with regard to demands on the portfolio itself I think that's fundamentally what Peter's memorandum addresses For the reasons that a couple of people have already cited, including Don Kohn, it seems to me that the premium should in fact be on liquidity even though we may need it only once in ten or twenty years When we need it we better damn well have it! I think what Peter is suggesting is quite consistent with that I don't have a great deal of allergy to the average maturity going down a little more or slowing down What Peter suggested seems to me to make a lot of sense  Of course, the other question that looms in the background, which I think is different than a coherent longer-term strategy to    3/31/92  portfolio management, is this question of whether the System, by becoming more active in the long end of the market, could or should do something of a one-time nature to help somehow or other to tilt the yield curve down I don't think that issue [unintelligible] On that point, I have to say that I am increasingly skeptical I think Peter captured it right That the great danger here is that this holds out more than it could possibly deliver I ask myself again the question of why the long rate is so high and so sticky Peter gave the usual menu of explanations Now, I think they're all relevant, but I am coming more and more to the view that maybe it's not all that complicated The Treasury is selling $100 billion, give or take, of new debt into the market per quarter It doesn't matter whether some of it is cyclical deficit or RTC financing; it's still $100 billion a quarter And it's in a context in which for the past year to 18 months--this is Bob Parry's point--private credit demands have been virtually nonexistent, net I think part of what we're seeing now is [the realization that] if the economy starts to pick up and if the credit crunch is about to have run its course and private credit demands begin to increase even a little when we still have the $100 billion a quarter hanging over our heads--and in a context in which the appetite of the Japanese for American securities and Treasury securities in particular has changed very significantly and is not likely to reverse itself in the near term--the deck is stacked against us In those circumstances, I'd have to say that any overt effort to use our own portfolio management tactics and strategies to wiggle around the long-term rate would run a very sizable risk of backfiring I would be most reluctant in these circumstances to get ourselves back into that kind of position   Let me just start with a couple of rifle shots on individual points First of all, I do get the sense from business leaders and others that things feel better How pervasive or lasting it will be I think is still a big question But even among some of the CEOs of major companies that are notoriously bearish we do get reports of a quite discernible uptick in activity in orders in the past couple of months Upon reflection, I think a lot of what is showing, at least to date, seems to be directly or indirectly related to the pickup in housing activity and the more modest pickup in the auto sector But for what it's worth, even among the most notoriously bearish that comes across  -20-    3/31/92  Just an outlier point, to get back to something that Ted Truman mentioned in passing, I have to say, Mr Chairman, that I'm getting more anxious about the situation in Japan, both in economic and financial terms Some of that I think is for the reasons that Ted mentioned or alluded to, but just in the past few weeks I have had several [talks] with private-sector individuals on firemen's visits, and these guys are really bearish At least in memory, I've never heard Japanese CEOs from both financial and nonfinancial firms speak with the concern that comes across I don't know what to make of that, but I do think that situation is probably even more tenuous than perhaps the numbers themselves would indicate at this point   Well, that's part of what I mean Closer to home, as several others have said and as I've said at a couple of previous meetings at least about the greater New York area, commercial real estate in price terms and in rental rate terms does indeed seem to be firming   Firming, yes Now, as others have said, that doesn't mean the beginning of new projects And needless to say, this Olympia and York [situation] could queer that firming depending upon how that shakes itself out My sense of that right now is that while there is a lot of international exposure, it's sufficiently widely distributed and diversified that in and of itself it would not materially add to our problem The larger question is whether [Olympia and York] is having a liquidity problem or worse I fear it's probably worse And I think the danger, aside from the obvious point about creditor exposure, is that it could reverse the apparent stabilization or slight improvement in commercial real estate in a lot of places, not just in New York or London That's an uncertainty even if the credit exposure part of it can be effectively managed  On the banking side, loan demand is still quite clearly slack I think it's also fair to say that financial fundamentals do look slightly better, partly because the real estate situation has stopped getting worse Another point that's relevant is that at the moment it's probably fair to say that the fiscal threat is reduced but not eliminated by recognition of the real dangers of highly reckless fiscal policies   I was going to say that if we had a few of these Nobel laureates under a little better control I might feel a little better! Notwithstanding that, the risks there don't look to me to be as bad as I thought they would be  One last point I'd make in terms of the national outlook-- and Mike touched on this--is that the employment outlook is very important in our thinking about the forecast, partly for the psychological reasons that people have talked a lot about I do think this confidence issue is importantly rooted in uncertainties about  -21-    3/31/92  employment prospects But beyond that, as Mike said, it would be quite unrealistic to assume that we're going to finance even a modest rise in consumer spending with a decline in the saving rate In the Greenbook there is a tiny decline over the next couple of quarters If you look at our own forecast or Mike's forecast--in round numbers, Mike, you have growth of something like 800,000 Q4-to-Q4 in payroll employment, give or take Now, that number doesn't sound all that crazy; it's 65,000 to 75,000 a month on average Those are not horrendously big numbers And that gives me some confidence in the internal consistency of the forecast But I do think that the employment situation, both for psychological reasons and for income- flow reasons, is going to turn out to be very, very important Having said all of that and recognizing that there are a lot of crosscurrents out there, I personally feel that the staff forecast is a good one Despite all the problems, I think there's a reasonably good chance that we can see a pattern that looks very much like that over the course of the year   I would favor "B" asymmetric I basically come out there for two reasons First, I think the forecast that's on the table, as I said before, is fine as a forecast There are so many crosscurrents [producing] uncertainties that a slight hedge--that's how I would think of this asymmetry--makes some sense The other thing I have to say is that even before I heard Mr Kohn's latest M2 numbers, I was a little nervous about M2, not that I have ever pledged allegiance to that number My nervousness is in part because I don't understand it; I can't figure it out But beyond that, if M2 were systematically to tank again, it certainly would make our external relationships more difficult So, "B" asymmetric   I have no problem with the broad direction we're going, and I completely agree with the point on the structure of the balances But I have to say on the D-mark balance itself that if I extrapolate out this next $10 billion, I do have a    5/19/92  nagging sense of uneasiness that we might be getting to the point where there's some danger of being too thin   Not after the next [transaction], ie the further sales proposed by Tietmeyer   I make this observation knowing, and I think broadly sharing, the sentiment of the Committee There probably are only a few of us who were around in the late '70s when we had to approach the world hat in hand [to obtain needed foreign currency balances], and that was a very uncomfortable feeling I would not like to find us in that position again   I agree with what you're saying I just want introduce a little element of caution, that's all   Mr Chairman, as you are generally aware, I wanted to bring to the Committee's attention the fact that the multiple investigations of the Salomon Brothers incident from last summer may be coming to a head in the near future I say "may" because this is a very complex matter and things could change even at the eleventh hour I don't think I can characterize the bottom line of that process except to say that a major effort is being made by all of the official agencies--the US Attorney, the Justice Department, the SEC, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve--to act in a way that puts this unhappy event behind everybody in a coordinated fashion As I said, any number of things could change, including the most obvious --the precise timing But the specific issues of primary dealer status and the status of Salomon's relationship to the Treasury in a context of the bidding restrictions that they put on them last year will be addressed as well The intention is to try to address those issues in a context that is consistent with the entirety of a solution Again, I can't characterize the likely bottom line, because I still don't quite know what the pieces of that bottom line are, but I thought it important that the Committee be broadly aware that it seems likely, but by no means certain, that this could get put to bed in the near future   Well, first of all, Governor Lindsey, in the new guidelines there is a reference to the fact that if a firm pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a criminal charge, a sanction would follow automatically However, in Congressional testimony we went to rather great lengths to say that that specific provision would not necessarily apply ex post to the Salomon situation Therefore, even if a firm were not indicted for a criminal charge, we still would have the flexibility to impose a sanction even though that specific provision, which followed the event, is there But we were quite clear in saying that we did not feel that we were necessarily bound by that in the context of the events of last August   Thank you, Dick Governor Angell   In terms of the national economy, our forecast is very similar to what Mike talked about earlier today And as he indicated, and others have also, I also have a feeling that the risks are distinctly more balanced That seems broadly consistent with the kinds of things one hears on the anecdotal side with this nagging question about sustainability, which is a question that nags at me a little too But in talking with business people, especially to the multinationals, most of them are now saying that things are better and a few are saying that they're better with emphasis And that, I think, is different Several people have cited exports; again, the anecdotal comments from these companies are quite consistent with that in terms of being surprised at how well their export activity is holding up And as Ted or Mike or somebody said, a lot of it is to Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Japan  On the commercial real estate question, I have reported over several meetings a sense that the decline in prices in the New York area had abated and perhaps even bottomed out And I think I mentioned at least once that there were very specific transactions, quasi-auctions, for very large buildings where they had cleared the market I know of at least a couple of cases [of property] sold by banks where they cleared the market at prices that exceeded the charged down level on the books of the banks--in other words, the provisions which they had taken for [loan losses] Now, at least in the New York area--and someone may have touched on this when I was out of the room--I think the Olympia & York situation does cast a bit of a cloud over that Their total real estate in New York is enormous and I think it's a little too early to make a judgment on that But that could represent a further dent here, certainly in New York The jury is very, very much out so far as how that is going to play out As I said, that introduces a new element of uncertainty  Looking more broadly--a number of people have already touched on this and I don't want to beat a dead horse--let me comment on this inflation outlook issue If I look at the 1993 forecast that Mike has, 32 percent I think in the CPI ex food and energy, I sense that that is a reasonable number I think it is going to be darn hard to do better than that, and it's not so hard to see how we can do worse than that Again, and John LaWare touched on this, in a broader perspective of what has happened going back to 1988 in terms of the CPI ex food and energy, we've essentially gone out through 1993 in the forecast from a 4-1/2 percent core inflation rate to 32 percent So, we will have brought about, if you will, a 13 percentage point decline in core inflation And if you look at it in terms of cost, it's five years of cumulatively very modest growth at best; the last two years, 1992 and 1993, are a little better but for the five years as a whole, it's not much Now, if you look at M2--and I agree with a lot of people in that I think that's not the right thing to look at-- we will have had seven years of distinctly modest M2 growth going out  -27-    5/19/92  through 1993 What I keep coming back to here is that no matter what we look at we also have to look at what is underneath, such as compensation costs, productivity, and unit labor costs, and there's a lot of slippage there But when you go underneath, even if you look at it simply as arithmetic and not as economics, it's still hard to see--at least I find it hard to see--how we're going to do a heck of a lot better, if at all better, than that very costly process that we've seen over the last five years I don't think that should alter our commitment to work toward that goal of price stability, however that's defined But the evidence is rather overwhelming that this is a very slow, costly, tough, grinding out process I don't see much that's going to change that   Thank you, governor   "B" symmetric is fine with me And just a quick footnote I don't know when we'll have to tighten; it could be soon; it could be later But I'll tell you this If that judgment is reached in a context in which M2 is still on the floor, it's going to present a mighty tricky issue in terms of formulating the logic and the public relations to go with it And it's quite possible that that could happen   Right   Well, it's especially true in stock markets I was speaking to [unintelligible], which is what they're hoping for   Move it   What is the potential growth rate implied in Chart 17?   So, essentially, what is built in here is a modest further increase in the labor force participation rate Even allowing for that and taking the potential growth rate at 2 percent, what I find really surprising--bordering I guess on unbelievable--is that if you look at case 2 versus case 3, the cumulative difference in the real GDP growth rate is always 06 of a percent over the whole period And the absolute difference, of course, in the unemployment rate at the end of the period is only 05 percent That strikes me a little as magic   It has been discovered by Canada!   Let me just start with the national outlook in terms of the forecast The forecast that the gentlemen and ladies in New York put together this time is virtually identical to Mike's forecast, not just in terms of the totals but even the components As a matter of fact, you could put a postage stamp on the two of them and cover them both in all the details From my point of view, given all the structural problems that people have been talking about, if the results over the next six quarters through the end of 1993 were in line with those forecasts, I'd be a very happy fellow I would also point out that in Mike's forecast the cumulative growth rate in real GNP for the years 1992 and 1993 combined is to the decimal point equal to the 2-year growth rate in the price stability scenario in Chart 17 So, there's no conflict whatsoever [between] the forecast, if you want to believe that chart to that level of detail, and this notion of price stability  But the question, of course, is How does one feel about achieving that result? I have to say that I share the views that have been expressed by a number of members in that I am uneasy about achieving that result The point has been made at least by a number of people that the problem is this sustainability question and the lack of any clear momentum in the economy; there's a sense [that the  -29-    6/30-7/1/92  recovery] just doesn't want to take hold The anecdotal comments that I get from businesses, small and large, are virtually without exception consistent with that concern about sustainability, momentum, etc; it's a lot like Ed Boehne's characterization of the situation Now, the one thing that we do hear anecdotally that is different, even from small businesses, is that the banks are out beating the bushes looking for business And this is the first time we've heard that on any kind of systematic basis But even where they're looking for business, it isn't there However, they do tell us now of calling officers back on the road and of banks running seminars in various parts of the state, and that's a change, clearly  In terms of where we go from here, Ed Boehne put his finger on it as far as I'm concerned The crucial variable in terms of hitting something close to that forecast is the employment/income side of the equation in a context where, Wayne, we at least don't have the saving rate going down At the beginning of the year one could roughly visualize income streams compatible with that forecast with rather modest growth in employment--65,000 to 75,000 a month-- throughout the year But we've lost ground relative to that To be sure, some of it has been made up in income terms by [increased] hours, but the fact of the matter is that employment in Q1 was lower than in Q4 of last year and, if I have this roughly right--again using Mike's forecast--Q2 payroll employment in the forecast is something like 400,000 higher than Q1 Obviously, it's going to take a pretty healthy increase [in June] to get anything like that The question really in some ways does come down to Will the employment growth and income growth be there that can produce enough by way of spending, given the structural problems, to get an outcome that roughly resembles the forecast?  On M2, I've never worried too much about it, but I think we can explain a lot of that [weakness] But, again, the point has been made by a couple of people that it's not just M2 If we look at the broadest measures of credit, we still find this systematic weakness We can explain a lot of that away, too, by the debt restructuring and the necessary consequences of all the problems in the 1980s But if that continuing pattern of very sluggish growth in any M out to M27 continues in a context in which the economy begins to fall short of the forecast, it's going to be pretty hard for anybody to dance to that tune  Again, I don't think the question in any sense is Should we be trying to accelerate the economy relative to something like the [staff's] forecast? As I said, I'd be as happy as a clam if we got a result that was even roughly like that forecast But I come back to Si Keehn's comment a long time ago--3-1/2 hours ago or something like that What if it turns out that instead of looking at a 2-1/2 percent economy we find ourselves looking at a 1-1/2 percent economy? And in terms of this argument about Fed credibility, which I think cuts both ways, if it turns out that we have a 1-1/2 percent economy and that's what we're responding to, then there's going to be a big problem in terms of Fed credibility on the other side  This is as difficult a policy setting as I can remember in a long, long time I think Mike Kelley had it right It would be a heck of a lot easier if the economy were either a lot better or a lot worse But I do think the crucial question is not whether to seek an  -30-    6/30-7/1/92  acceleration of the economy relative to the forecast but where one's comfort zone is as to whether we can either hit the forecast or come within striking distance of it And I'd have to say that my degree of comfort in terms of our ability to hit the forecast has waned from where it was a couple of months ago Thank you, Mr Chairman   For June?   I was talking about the quarterly average   Well, I would support your suggestion I have just a couple of comments to tack on First of all, in terms of this discussion about credibility and price stability and so on, I'm a believer in what we do, not what we say In trying to get a point of view across to the Congress and the public, it's obviously important, as a number of people suggested, that we reaffirm that But it's also not a bad idea to look at the record And the record of the past five or six years, including 1992, in terms of money growth is pretty darn good Not only is it darn good in an arithmetic sense [unintelligible] in terms of achieving price stability, but the fact of the matter is that this Committee has shown a great deal of stick-to-it-ness over the past three years in a context in which the performance of the economy by most standards has been lousy I think we have a darn good story to tell So, I would tell both sides of the story I would put some real emphasis not just on saying what we're thinking about for the future but what we have done I think it's a very good story  Now, the other comments I want to make are that I agree very much with this rather cute little idea of yours of keeping the Congress informed, but I wouldn't go too far in that direction or they'll have you up there every Thursday afternoon after the money supply statistics are released! So, I think we have to hang loose there a little  The last point I want to make, and I think it's more important, is that clearly part of what we're seeing here is this at least temporarily changed [financial] intermediation process And I think it's appropriate to put emphasis and perhaps a good deal of emphasis on that But there's more to it than that That is partly the reason I made the comment yesterday, and I've made it before, that if it were just M, whatever M you want, that looked funny, that argument would be quite credible But it's not just M whatever; it's the whole shooting match that looks funny Therefore, at the very least, I think in your explanation you have to try not to get too tied to this intermediation issue itself The other thing that obviously can be brought to bear is the debt restructuring and all that That's another way of saying that the questions that are running around in my mind go well beyond just the disintermediation phenomenon and the role of the intermediaries, short term and long term I'm cautious about betting the ranch on that issue The only other point I'd make in concluding, just to complicate matters further, is that if I wanted to, I could make a pretty good argument that price stability could turn out to be quite compatible with higher rates of growth of the money supply rather than lower That again is just another way of saying that we're in a heck of a box in terms of how definitive we could be about much of anything   Right   This is a tough one I guess the way I try to approach a lot of this financial confusion is that in my mind's eye I can conceivably see three profiles of the economy over the next several quarters Each looks to me as if it has profoundly different implications It is possible, although I think it's only a 10 percent probability, that we could have a 3-1/2 percent [growth] profile If that turned out to be the case, the policy response to that is pretty easy We'd have to start tightening Then there is the 2-1/2 percent economy, an economy that as I said yesterday is quite consistent with the price stability goal based on Chart 17 I do think that that's the likely outcome I would still put a 50 percent probability on that And the policy response to that is also easy We'd just sit where we are But then there's the third scenario, the 1-1/2 percent profile, which in my mental processes carries with it something like a 40 percent probability Now, that's the tough nut, because I personally believe, in the broadest possible context of public policy, that that outcome is unacceptable Also, if we find ourselves in that profile after the fact and we're left in a  -71-    6/30-7/1/92  position in which we were trying to adjust policy after the fact, I think we'd have a helluva problem on our hands Because I think there is not an inconsequential probability of that kind of outcome, I would rather squarely associate myself with an asymmetric directive   Perhaps to make it more operational we could say "However, the recent unusual behavior of the aggregates warrants especially close monitoring by the Committee" or something like that   Right   This is an alternative sentence that would say "These growth rates in the monetary aggregates are a reflection of the continuing, uncertain relationships between the aggregates and the Committee's long-term objectives"   This is Jerry Corrigan I think you should just go ahead and make the announcement Obviously, I will get my board together this morning too; and though I agree philosophically with Ed's point, this is too important to be tinkering I would just go ahead   Let me just make a further comment, partly in response to Bob Forrestal's and Dick Syron's point I think the sentiment of the Committee is quite well recognized I would say the Committee views intervention, however couched, with rather distinct displeasure, and that I think is clear enough But I don't consider the kind of thing that Bill tried to describe to be practically or philosophically out of character with that distinct Committee orientation I would say that if the orientation of the Committee is, to put it in its extreme form, that under under no circumstances could there ever be intervention for any reason, I think that is a potentially dangerous posture And while the orientation of the Committee is clear enough--I think it is well understood both within the Committee and in the markets--we have to be careful in terms of taking that orientation to the point where it is indeed seen as a statement of "never" because experience suggests that such a position is one that can come back to haunt us So, I recognize and accept the sentiment and the distinct orientation of the Committee, but I personally would not be comfortable with the logical extremis of that position that says "never" I try never to say "never"!   I think you're about right Actually, the point I was going to make builds on this Regardless of the precise legal authority in the relationship between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, I think when it comes to this area we also have to recognize as a practical matter that there are other players or partners involved--namely, the monetary authorities or central banks in other countries I think it's fair to say--and Ted or the Chairman or somebody has--that pretty much without exception the heads of all the major central banks probably in their own way would come pretty close to subscribing to the view that intervention over time doesn't do anything But I think as a group they would also certainly come pretty close to associating themselves with a hybrid point of    8/18/92  view that would incorporate some of what Bill said, some of what Wayne said, some of what the Chairman, and maybe some of what I said And I think I can say with absolute confidence that not one of them would associate themselves with the "never" school  So long as that is the case--and I suspect, frankly, that it will always be the case--it would be very, very difficult as a practical matter for us literally to go it alone in a context in which we must maintain these relationships Now, I think the evolving position of this Committee over the years has had an influence in shaping attitudes in other financial capitals on this very issue But I must say that in my judgment it would be rather naive, quite apart from our relationship with the Treasury, to say that we could literally go it alone without running some very, very high risks one way or the other that such an attitude or policy would come back to haunt us in spades It might not be on that issue but on some other issue So, putting all the theology aside, I think one has to be sensitive to these relationship questions Those relationship questions far transcend 15th Street or 14th Street or 16th Street, or wherever [the Treasury is located] So, there is also that very pragmatic aspect of this, which is one of the reasons why I subscribe to that "never say never" school   Second   I'll start out by saying that while I agree with a lot of what John LaWare said, I'd make an argument that at the very least the patient is out of intensive care I think we have made some progress As far as the national outlook is concerned, our people see it pretty much as their Board staff associates do with the one exception, as has already been discussed, being the unemployment rate And that, as has been suggested, is probably a crapshoot Our people have it more in the 7-1/2 percent range at the end of next year But the point is that regardless of whether it's 7 percent or something north of 7 percent, even taking the Board staff's forecast means nine consecutive quarters in which the unemployment rate will have been 7 percent or higher There have been multiple comments about the gloomy atmosphere and, obviously, that [unemployment rate] in itself has a lot to do with it A number of people have directly or indirectly touched on what is called a very broad political landscape; undoubtedly that has something to do with it too But whatever weight one wants to put on those or other factors, I think the tone is pretty darn sour out there  In terms of some of the underlying issues, the budget outlook even without any new magic is actually worse in the out years; on the basis of these latest figures some of that obviously reflects the level of economic activity itself, but it's not just the level of economic activity A number of people have said that the inflation outlook is better; it is A number of people have also said that price increases are not on the horizon or the radar scope for anybody, especially in manufacturing I guess that's true except for the auto industry I never quite understand those guys!  On the anecdotal side and the District side, I wish I had some brilliant new insight to offer but I don't It's really just more of the same I do think, as everybody has said one way or another, that we have this Catch-22 situation Productivity is better, profits are better, and costs are better; but in part because those things are better, employment is worse, income is worse, and attitudes are worse I think that to a very large degree is a result of cumulative pressures My own sense of it, trying to put it all together, is that on net the risks are about balanced That's about all I have to say, Mr Chairman   "B" asymmetric is fine with me    Move it   I move it   Well, it's almost time for dinner, so I'll be brief First of all, I don't see anything new on the economic outlook that differs from the bulk of what has been said around the table I do think that attitudes have gotten at least a bit more glum I put a lot of weight on Mike Prell's simultaneity paradox of linkages or reverse linkages among income, employment, and spending, especially in a context in which the saving rate is already very low and we're not going to get any more spending through a reduction in the saving rate I think there is superimposed on top of that a whole lot of concerns that intensify those things that are somewhat easy to identify--some of them political, some of them involving a growing recognition that out there in the great beyond there is a very large, very expensive series of national economic problems that are going to have to be dealt with in a context in which there are vast social problems that also have to be dealt with And I think people worry about that So, as I said, the bottom line in terms of the outlook is more of the same with, if anything, a tilt toward a bit more concern and a bit more sour expectations  I agree with those who said that inflation in some sense is a non-issue, whether it's measured correctly or not I also agree with those who are saying that whether the Fed does something now or next week is not going to have a whole lot of adverse implications for so- called Fed credibility on inflation The inflation outlook is a lot better, but it is a lot better because we're going to have 16, 17, or 18 straight quarters with an unemployment rate above 6-1/2 percent and 11 or 12 quarters with an unemployment rate above 7 percent There's no magic to it at all We have better inflation the old fashioned way We paid for it I do have some sympathy, though, with Jerry Jordan's comment or quandary as to why nobody quite believes there is at least a fighting chance of preserving that [progress on inflation] over time  The main point I want to make--and others have said it in slightly different ways--is that we do have a renewed case of the financial jitters out there It's not all that hard to explain why that's there I do think the principal points of vulnerability are  -39-    10/6/92  the stock market and the exchange market But I don't think anybody is even remotely clairvoyant enough to be able to anticipate through what channels a disturbance might work itself into those markets And that was the thrust of Bill McDonough's comments, if I can put words in his mouth I also do not think that a modest change or even a big change in monetary policy in the direction of ease right now is going to forestall the possibility that one of those disturbances might happen It won't work that way; if anything, it might work the other way But it will not work in the direction of forestalling it  I agree with a number of comments that have been made that if something starts to tilt the wrong way, the situation could get pretty messy Ed Boehne's comment about four hours ago about limited tools in a foreign exchange situation is quite valid But having said that, it is potentially dicey I think it's important to recognize, as a number of people have said, that major banks and major nonbank financial institutions in the United States, with one or two obvious exceptions, are in a much stronger condition today than they were in 1990, or in '87 or '84 or '82; and that's a plus What is not a plus is that the second-tier institutions, especially nonbanks, are in weaker condition And it's also important to recognize that if we get into one of these [situations], all institutions are going to be a lot more defensive That may be good news in one sense, but it's bad news in another sense in that it makes it that much more difficult to deal with them So, no matter what the Committee in its wisdom decides about near-term monetary policy in the conventional meaning of the word, I think that decision should be couched in a context in which it is implicitly understood that in the period ahead there could be circumstances in which the Desk or Desks will need at least a margin of greater flexibility  In terms of monetary policy in conventional terms, I am very much of the view that for a variety of reasons the better course of action, at least for the moment, would be to "maintain" I'd have a distinctly asymmetric bias but I would not do anything But above all, whatever the Committee decides about policy as a whole, we need to recognize that there could be circumstances where on a day-to-day basis an extra margin of flexibility is going to have to be built in I don't think that has to be part of the directive, but it has to be recognized   Your prescription is fine with me, Mr Chairman   That's right   Most of my colleagues have probably seen The New York Times this morning There's an article of enormous consequence on the front page For those who haven't seen it, I thought I should share it with you to make sure that these proceedings go forward on a liturgically sound basis The article reports that for the first time in more than four centuries the Roman Catholic Church today issued a new universal catechism which, among other things, identifies a range of new sins that are the product of modern- day society Among the sins defined in the new catechism are tax evasion, drug abuse, mistreatment of immigrants, abuse of the environment, artificial insemination, genetic engineering, and financial speculation I don't know about the rest of you, but I've got to get me one of those! I can see it now When Gretchen and Joan and Bill go to confession they're going to have to make sure that the confessor understands the difference between hedging and speculation   Second   I move it   I'll move them both   May I ask Do you have any particular insights you can share with regard to the intermediate-term situation at General Motors? We are now getting a sense that at least some of the financial people are going through a very fundamental reappraisal of the prospects for General Motors over time I don't know whether there's anything to that other than people just going through the exercise The other question I wanted to raise is Do you see from your vantage point any near-term possibility that GM or GMAC could start to run into problems in terms of rolling over the tremendous amount of commercial paper they have out in the marketplace?   Between GM and GMAC what do they have--something like $20 billion of commercial paper outstanding?    11/17/92   I don't have a lot to add to what has been said around the table I think things do feel a little better, as most have observed I would side with those who also have observed that it's probably a little premature to declare victory But certainly both the performance [of the economy] and the outlook are better than many had expected a couple of months ago There are, as Governor Mullins and others have noted, some scattered signs of pickup in commercial loan demand, which is something we haven't seen for a long, long time Going back to the Ninth Federal Reserve District, I can confirm that there will be at least one housing start in Montana in November because I caused it All in all, my observations and sentiments are pretty much in line with what has been said around the table  The point that Dave [Mullins] was making regarding attitudes about inflation and price stability having changed is very interesting We had our academic panel into the Bank a couple of weeks ago This is a pretty good group of people and a good cross section in terms of philosophies and ideologies There was just no sympathy at all from any of those people for doing anything to try to drive the core inflation rate down from a 3 percent level That didn't surprise me coming from some of the fellows in Mr Syron's neck of the woods, but there were among this group a couple of real old line, very conservative monetarists--people like Phil Cagan for example--and even he didn't want to hear it And that is a change in attitude Now, fortunately, these people aren't the only arbiters in this area, but it is interesting, given where we are today, that the perceptions about the costs of trying to engineer further reductions in the core inflation rate are clearly viewed a little differently today than they were several years ago  The only other thing I wanted to mention, Mr Chairman--and maybe Ted Truman could help me out here--is that my assessment of the outlook in Germany and Japan over the next three to six quarters is really pretty grim It's not at all inconceivable to me that performance in both of those countries could be distinctly south of  -18-    11/17/92  the current IMF or OECD forecasts That possibility has obvious implications for our economy in terms of the outlook for both exports and imports, but it also seems to me to raise some second-level dangers, including those on the financial side and perhaps especially on the trade side Ted, I wonder if you would share with me and the others your sense as to whether that admittedly quite pessimistic possibility is something that we should be worried about   Hardly a venial sin! [Laughter]   With regard to current policy, my preference is for "B" symmetric, but I think something has changed Over the summer months, getting back to my own example, I was fearful that we were looking at a 1-1/2 percent or worse economy and now I feel a good deal more comfortable that we're looking at a 2-1/2 percent economy But I've always felt in this transition period that that was acceptable Now, having said that, I prefer "B" symmetric; I could live with asymmetric because of my own anxieties about the international side There is an extra margin of vulnerability there, and for that reason alone I could live with an asymmetric "B"  The long-run ranges present a much more difficult problem There's a logical conundrum here If one took the position that this is totally or largely a technical phenomenon, then I don't think it matters a whole lot whether we cut the ranges now or in February And if it's technical, it's technical Some members are essentially arguing that it is technical; others are arguing that it's quasi- technical; and still others are arguing that it's substantive That is the logical dilemma I think an awful lot depends, Mr Chairman, upon how you feel as Chairman you want to play this   Well, I tend to agree with that And if one agrees with that, then it follows almost as a matter of logical necessity that it's probably better to do it in February That is in part because of Mike Kelley's argument that if we do it before February, nobody--the markets, the press, or anybody else--is going to get it right And then we would have lost our moment In addition, I did find persuasive a number of comments that members made about the way this plays into the setting of a new Administration, a new fiscal program, and all the rest of it But again, if you fundamentally view it as technical, it seems to me that the weight of that argument is dissipated as well Finally, apropos Bob Parry's comment, if you fundamentally view it as technical, don't kid yourself, you're not going to buy anything in terms of inflationary expectations or anything else You can't have it both ways But  -41-    11/17/92  because I do view it perhaps not quite exclusively but largely as technical, I would lean toward doing it in February As far as the amount is concerned, I can't get excited about 1/2 points one way or the other on this I certainly could live with 2 to 6 percent but I could also live with 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent; I'm not sufficiently comfortable with my knowledge to be able to get excited one way or another about that half point [difference] Again, from a logical point of view, the issue is whether it is technical or substantive If it's technical, then, I think the February timing falls out [as logical]   We could have an understanding among the Committee members   [We could agree] that in response to the Gonzalez letter the study would be sent up to the Hill with a very strong suggestion in [our cover] letter to the effect that the ranges for 1993 will be cut in February by some unspecified amount   I would accept asymmetric because of my concern about the international side   What I specifically said was that my preference was symmetric, but in view of my own concerns about the weight of the international side I would accept asymmetric   Let me start with either the television or the literal verbatim transcript It does seem to me that--   Speaking first to the issue of live television and verbatim transcripts It seems to me that we can make a very, very compelling case that in the normal course of this Committee's deliberations there are frequent occasions on which matters pertaining to individual companies--say, General Motors or IBM--come up in discussion in a way that, if it were on television, would be very damaging The result, of course, would be that they wouldn't come up Much more importantly, there are often discussions about individual financial institutions; but still more importantly, there are often discussions centering around information that is provided to one or more of us by central bank governors and other governmental officials abroad, and those people would be absolutely enraged if that kind of information were part of any public discussion So, it does seem to me that just on those grounds alone we can make a very powerful, entirely credible argument against live television or verbatim minutes My guess is that if we could get that off the table, then it might be a little easier for the Committee to wrestle with the question of some kind of [record such as the old memoranda of discussion] I might add--I don't know if you knew this, Ted--just looking at these memoranda of discussion for 1974, these published minutes include the write-ups of the Basle governors meetings They include write-ups of visits of individual Board members to other countries and other central banks People might have agreed to that in 1974, but today, no way    11/17/92   There's some pretty lively stuff in here, though, from those BIS meetings   I agree completely with that What we have to try to do is to protect the deliberative process Forgetting about which letter has to be responded to, it seems to me that there are four broad alternatives on the table One is to acquiesce to the television and verbatim minutes That to me is a non-starter I think that destroys the deliberative process and on top of that has the other problem that I mentioned before about confidentiality and all the rest The second alternative is something like the memoranda of discussion with a lag of a year or two or three My own hunch is that we could probably live with that, but it's a helluva lot of work   But in an edited version with a long enough lag, I think it probably isn't fatal to the deliberative process The third alternative is Mr Melzer's and that is just to say that what we're doing is the best arrangement, which is where I would actually come out The fourth alternative is the one several have suggested and that is to try to speed up some part of the release process I could probably associate myself with the kind of thing that you suggested where in addition to what we now release right away we would make [any action we take] official; Mr Coyne would put out a statement when Mr McDonough lowers the federal funds rate confirming that it has been done and maybe even put in a sentence or two explaining why it was done But from my point of view releasing something like the current policy directive at any stretch in an intermeeting period--whether it's two weeks, four weeks or the day after the meeting--I think is going to compromise the deliberative process irreparably I'd much rather do this   Yes, that's the killer   What would happen because of that is that all these Solomon-like decisions we make about asymmetry, symmetry, and the ability for the Chairman to act in intermeeting intervals would be shot We would be sitting here until midnight at every meeting trying to figure out how to get a true consensus So, one way or another, it would damage the process Either the process would stop working as it now works or we would get market whiplash effects Either way, it's a loser I just don't see how we can truly preserve the deliberative process as we know it in a context in which we would release the policy record as we now do it at any point in an intermeeting interval I'd rather do a memorandum of discussion than that But I could associate myself with the suggestion that you made I'm inclined to think--Don Winn would know better than most of us-- that that might in fact be seen as a significant gesture on our part   What I'm saying is that to release the policy record as it now exists at any point in an intermeeting interval--it doesn't matter whether it's a day, a week, two weeks, three weeks [after a meeting]--will in my judgment compromise the process   The Chairman made the proposal What I think I heard him say was that as things stand now When the Board cuts the discount rate, it [announces] it; when it changes reserve requirements, it [announces] it If the Chairman or the Committee made a decision between meetings to lower the funds rate, we would put out a statement that morning saying the Federal Reserve today eased reserve conditions and as a consequence of this the federal funds rate went down   No, that's the wrong question The question ought to be What is the cost?   That's the issue There's a benefit too, Dave The benefit is that it takes away this perception that it's the Wall Street insiders who benefit from their Fed watching activities to the exclusion of other segments of society That's the benefit   I would do the same thing--the next morning, though   It's not always clear   I'll move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   I move it   Obviously, we knew what happened to the gold, but I don't think we knew what it did to exports   Well, I'm not even going to try to answer that In this particular case I know what happened, so I think the description you have is correct   Well, as far as the outlook is concerned, our forecast is essentially the same as Mike's, so I think that's a reasonable point of departure The export sector probably is the area that I would worry about most in terms of a conventional    12/22/92  assessment of the forecast On the anecdotal side, there are a couple of things I want to mention briefly First, in the case of very large multinational corporations--and I'm not limiting this at all to IBM-- it's quite clear to me from the comments I get from CEOs that this restructuring process has not run its course That still has a ways to go IBM may be symptomatic of that, but I'm getting that from CEOs of other very, very big companies as well Second, from the anecdotal area, there is some life in loan demand out there It's not pervasive and it's not robust, but it is there And consistent with a number of comments others have made about retail sales and so on, some very large credit card issuers, bank and nonbank alike, are telling me that credit card usage really is up Interestingly enough, even though usage is up, paydowns continue and payments against usage are coming much faster than they have in the past so that among other things the levels of card usage debt are probably not capturing fully the rate of card usage in the past four to six weeks  In the commercial real estate area, I want to echo something Ed Boehne said earlier We still are getting anecdotal reports that suggest that price declines probably have bottomed out and that rental rates and concessions are probably bottoming out However, I have just heard for the first time over the past couple of weeks that some people are adding on to the length of the work-out process The reason is because they are becoming more aware of rather large pockets of space currently under lease that have been essentially vacated as employment levels have been reduced, in the financial sector in particular That means that these various statistics of vacancy rates aren't telling the whole story As a result of that there is a bit, not major, of adding on--quarters as opposed to years--in terms of the work-out process Another thing about this burst of confidence, if that's what it is, is that I think the election phenomenon has something to do with it   I think that's part of it, but what has fed on that a little is that a lot of people, including red blooded Republican businessmen and women, are very impressed by what they seem to [observe] The problem is that if what you get is not what you see, that process of feeling good can reverse itself very quickly So, I think one has to be a bit cautious about that My own sense of the risks [to the economic outlook] is a little hard to describe because I don't think of the risks in quite conventional terms I think there is something greater than a zero possibility that all of this could turn out to be another flash in the pan But I don't view those risks as high, which is another way of saying that I think there is a little more to this, barring a big disappointment on the fiscal budgetary side, than we've seen in the past But consistent with what Gary Stern and several others have said, it's not hard for me to visualize circumstances in which growth over, say, the next four or five quarters could be stronger than projected in the Greenbook I wouldn't bet my life on that, but it isn't hard for me to see circumstances in which that could in fact materialize, especially if this burst of confidence is bolstered by what turns out to be sound national policies, including budgetary policies So, I have a little trouble trying to balance the risks because in one sense I don't think they lend themselves to any kind of statistical  -20-    12/22/92  probability basis; but I certainly would not rule out the possibility that the economy could actually turn out to be a bit stronger even though, as I say, I do not consider the risk to be zero that it could fall on its face again   "B" symmetric   Alan, this is Jerry We talked about this whole set of questions a couple of months ago My recollection is that you were putting together an ad hoc committee to be chaired by Dave Mullins that was supposed to be looking at other aspects of this question Is that correct or is it now moot? Or where does that stand?   I clearly understand that Is there  anything that could be said, particularly in response to the concerns that Tom Hoenig and others have raised, apropos that you could [unintelligible] this subcommittee, have the record somehow or other [unintelligible] outflanked by events between now and February?   Actually, the connection is terrible for everybody I was asking whether there is anything at all to be said for getting on the record right now, prior to that Committee meeting in February, so that events don't completely pass us by in terms of an ability to think about what the subcommittee has to say--   I agreed with that thinking at the time But I guess now that I'm facing the question I wonder Is that thinking, however right it was then, still right today?   I'm not worried   Second    2/2-3/93   Move it   So moved   Well, Bob McTeer made a reference to America's team Being at least in the resident state of the other side, I have a little different view of that But there is something about the Super Bowl that crossed my mind too, Bob, which is that I think we're at a point here where we have to be a little careful At the end of the game it didn't matter that a defensive lineman was cruising down the field with the ball hanging out there and somebody came along and swiped it out of his hand Well, I don't think we can afford to have that happen here, Mr Chairman   For me [the picture] is a little more complicated than I think it is for some others Clearly, on the anecdotal side, the tone is better across the board Big business, small business, the man on the street, the woman on the street--and as a matter of fact coming back to Bob Forrestal's point of reference, even the CEOs that are still on the job in the big companies--seem to have graduated from flat to modest, if that puts things in a little    2/2-3/93  perspective I forget who made the point--it might have been Bob Parry--that he had gotten some anecdotal reports about surprisingly strong retail sales in January coming on top of what were very strong retail sales in the Christmas season We, too, have heard that On the other hand, and several people have made this point, we still are getting the same message from small and big businesses that this restructuring has by no means run its course And some of the multinational companies are conveying a sense of their experience in Europe that I translate [as indicating weaker economies there] than the standard forecast, whether it's our own or the IMF's or the OECD's Now, those are obviously not sophisticated forecasting comments, but I interpret the attitudes of big companies that have [operations] in Europe as worse than most of these standard forecasts would imply If we took our own forecast--and I don't know precisely what that forecast method is, whether it's a Stern version or whatever--when I put my own body English on it I end up with a forecast that you could just about put a postage stamp over it relative to the Greenbook They're virtually identical But I myself don't have any real conviction at this point as to where the risks lie On the one hand, I am worried that in part because of the restructuring and all the rest that even modest employment gains may not be as readily forthcoming as would seem to be the case And if that is not the case, then I think the consumer sector is not a "gimme putt," even though I appreciate some of the arguments that the saving rate may have a little more give in it than it might seem just by looking at the raw numbers Similarly, the net exports sector, as I've said before, is a real risk in part because of this impression I have about Europe but also because I think there is a rapidly building financial constraint on our export performance to the developing world, especially Latin America So, it wouldn't take a whole lot for some downside risks [to materialize] that are not inconsequential  On the other hand, I think we do have a situation where we see some signs cumulating on the up side Indeed, if I let my mind wander a little, I could easily see a 3-1/2 percent growth rate or maybe more And that worries me because, while I'm a firm believer in inflation being fundamentally related in a technical sense to slack in the economy, we could start to see some deterioration in the inflation outlook sooner rather than later, even with slack, because I think the speed factor is still a reality I don't think the business community and the economy at large have yet bought zero inflation by a long shot Now, putting that together, one could say that's the way it should be A forecast should say there is this risk and that risk and they all tend to wash out But that's not how I look at it As a matter of fact, I feel fairly certain that 1993 will not look like the forecast But I can't quite decide on which side is the greater risk And I might add that either side has problems So, it looks like a nice easy walk in the sun for the next couple of quarters or so, but I'm not so sure of that   Well, a 2 to 6 percent formulation is a slam-dunk for me But I have to say that I find some of the discussion around the table troubling on several points First of all, as someone who has had nothing but distaste if not disdain for M2--even when people thought it was good--I'm not quite ready to    2/2-3/93  accept the point that there is no policy purpose to be served in the context of this discussion, even though I have no confidence in M2 But I also find troubling the amount of emphasis that you put on the point that this is basically a political thing we're talking about here I don't agree with that I think in the first instance the choices before the Committee are substantive choices They are choices that in the current circumstances have to be [viewed] more in a context in which there's a lot of noise in the numbers as well as elsewhere But I view this as substantive And in my own kind of bimodal risk analysis I think it becomes very substantive, whether one likes M2 or not, because depending upon how the economy evolves, it could make a tremendously important difference in terms of both the perceptions about policy and policy itself So, as I said, I'm not altogether enamored by some of the body English that has gone with this discussion  I am also terribly concerned about throwing all these Ms out there Now, you pointed out, Mr Chairman, that that's what Arthur Burns did Chairman Burns may have succeeded in confusing the Congress but he may have confused himself because, looking at the results of policy in that era, I'm not so sure they are something I would want to be associated with I think there is a grave danger that if we get all of these Ms out there--[up to] M27 or something-- everybody's going to be happy with one of those Ms but it's not going to be the same for everybody and we're going to end up with a convoluted policy So, I've got to help you write your testimony too, but unlike almost everybody else I'd keep it really simple I think we have a pretty good story to tell in terms of the whole policy process and what has happened in the economy Go back to 1989 and the fact of the matter is that a soft landing in the economy has been achieved with a degree of success and precision that is almost beyond the human mind's capacity to imagine I'd rather talk about that than M27   As I said, the 2 to 6 percent M2 range is a slam-dunk, but I would try to keep [the explanation] as simple as possible I would not get into these comments about how we're going to have to take another close look at this in July; it's just another trap Here it is Let's go with it   My question is not so much for Don but for Mike Prell; this has nothing to do with current policy Mike, do you have any concrete sense as to what this $30 billion fiscal package is and particularly whether it involves one-time [items] or [programs] that are going to be with us?   I'm sorry for the interruption; it was out of context   "B" symmetric   The easy way to deal with it if you're asked, even if the Chairman is not asked, is to say the vote was unanimous  SPEAKER(?) Yes   I think that's the way to do it   Would he come here or we go there?   Then they'll start [unintelligible] further press conferences   Fundamentally I have sympathy with all of the tentative conclusions Now, if we could get the protection in Freedom of Information Act terms, I could associate myself with some kind of Memorandum of Discussion type document, but I don't know if we can get that protection I also agree that the funds rate  -68-    2/2-3/93  [announcement] may be the most fruitful avenue to look at further I don't worry so much about the very short-run problem of a stock market crash; that I think we can deal with But I do think that the slippery slope here is making a conclusion, as I think Al said, in a context in which that conclusion is dominated by a mind-set that [involves] funds rate targeting I don't think it's quite as portable to other policy regimes and that's the aspect of it that I think has to be thought about more carefully The first crisis situation we could always [unintelligible] Contrary to Gary Stern and Governor Phillips and maybe a couple of others, I'm not at all into this press conference thing I just don't see how we can turn that into a winner The closest institution that I know of to the Federal Reserve is the Supreme Court I have some trouble with the thought of the Chief Justice deciding he's going to have a press conference to explain a couple of recent court decisions The analogy stinks, but I think you do give up something when you get yourself into that business I don't know, Dave, about your own experience but in the old days, which predated you, the Treasury never did [press conferences and the like] and then they got into it in spades But I'm not so sure what the net effect of that has been in terms of [enhancing the] credibility of the President and the way it is perceived If the Chairman really has something to say, I think he can always find a way to do it Any time he wants an audience Joe Coyne can get him an audience [with no difficulty] So I don't think the Chairman lacks instruments to get [a message] out there when he wants to I think the press conference option is a very slippery slope And if it ever slid into the perception that the Fed was marketing itself in some sense, I think it would be disastrous And doing [press conferences] I don't think will cut off the kinds of [problems] Gary was referring to So I am very dubious about that But I know that is clearly an area where reasonable men and women can differ   Alan, could you read that sentence about [unintelligible] again please?   It's not in that part, really You [noted] three points that were important to you I think at the end of the third point there was a specific sentence about policy  SPEAKER(?) It's at the end, sir    2/18/93   Actually, in the first instance the caveat in that sentence that Alan just read is that I'm a little concerned about that reference to adjusting policy in precisely that context For example, later on when you talk about monetary policy you say that monetary policy has to take a lot of things, including fiscal policy, into account   And that flavor, frankly, has a bit more appeal to me   It's hard to see that when we don't have the words in front of us, so let me just leave the thought with you that when you read that sentence that you just reread, it sounded to me as though it was something [akin] to the interpretation of dangling something out there here and now   It's [unintelligible] when you don't have it in front of you; but that was my reaction as you read it, for what it's worth   Alan, I agree with what Wayne is saying but I assume that the testimony as a whole deals with that time and time again And I must say that the way you have that [worded], at least as I remember your reading it, I think for this purpose is precisely the right way to do it because everything you read relates to the structural deficit And in a context of a discussion about the structural deficit it seems to me that the point you're trying to make in that paragraph--in effect that we can't inflate [out of] a structural deficit--has to depend on its own merits And I really don't think it's in your interest--as a matter of fact I think it might be almost suicidal--to try to entangle the price stability argument into that context As I said, I assume that the price stability argument is thoroughly embossed in the main part of your overall testimony   No, I thought the beauty of that statement as you have it drafted there was that you're talking solely about a structural deficit; and that's the power of the argument   It's true, Alan; what you're referring to there is that from '94 out they have a real GDP growth assumption in the baseline of 2-1/2 percent   By any standard I think that is conservative or typical or--   I think it's rather inappropriate to have a sentence in there like that This is the first time in my memory that a budget and economic planning are based on anything other than a rosy scenario; the rosy scenario is what we've had in the past I think they deserve credit for that   Alan, it's Jerry again That could be a pesky issue In the context of Si's question and maybe Ed's question as well, is it possible that you could say what you said before but at least in generic terms raise the question of the enforcement mechanism on the spending side?   Without having to get into the line- by-line type of stuff?   I don't think you have to endorse one or the other   As I said, I don't think you have to get to the point where you endorse one mechanism or another But it seems to me that you can stick to that answer you gave to Ed Boehne before but if you get further pressure, along the lines of Si's question, you might be able to get away with just conceptually stressing the importance of a credible enforcement mechanism on the spending side and avoid getting trapped into a line-by-line discussion of individual spending programs   I don't think you're going to have to worry about that, Alan   Alan, let me come back again to this long-term rate question It seems to me that one has to be very, very careful here If the reaction to the Clinton plan in the Congress is  -13-    2/18/93  politics as usual and within a week or 10 days we have a traditional partisan street fight going on in the Congress, that reduction in long-term interest rates could be reversed with a vengeance   Be very careful about [unintelligible] this improvement in long-term rates as characterized I would personally be very, very hesitant about trying to draw fine lines of distinction as to what [deficit reduction] is saying about inflation or what it's saying about anything Again, it wouldn't take much at all, based on the track record of the way these things work out in the Congress from a process point of view, for the bond market to tank in a hurry   Well, I personally would answer it by saying that it reflects a broad-based judgment that we have a fighting chance of getting a real measure of fiscal restraint And if you want [unintelligible] because if you don't, it's going to back up   That's the point in the context of a number of the other comments and observations that are being made here If one tries to get into this sophisticated fine-tuning argument about how much of the improvement of long rates is due to X and how much is due to Y and how much is due to Z, I see that as a black hole   Again, I don't know what your feeling is but my feeling is that if we have the usual partisan street fight in the Congress starting tomorrow or next week, this [decline in long- term rates] could turn around in a flash and with a vengeance   Dave, I think it's a good idea to do this I have the same question about the executive summary I think that could end up competing with the good and noble purpose   I think the worst case with the executive summary is that we'd have to have a meeting between the meetings to agree on the language of the summary   Second   Second   I have very little to add in terms of anecdotal-type insights I think the tone at the moment is better Nowadays when one talks to business leaders and community leaders about a 3 percent economy they no longer look at you as though you're from Mars But having said that, I don't find many, especially among the big firms--for the reasons that Dick Syron mentioned--talking about even 3 percent being a shoe-in But at least there is a clear central tendency of popular opinion It's hard, whether from an anecdotal base or empirical base, to disagree with the kind of outlook that Mike has in the Greenbook, and I would not But I still have this nagging sense of unease that things are either going to be better or worse than that rather benign forecast, and I can't decide which way it's going to be I do very much associate myself with the comments that Bob Forrestal and Gary Stern made about some of the intermediate- to longer-term problems or potential problems that are sitting out there Indeed, some of those things could turn out to be more imminent rather than further down the road than we suspect right now And I think one has to stay at least sensitive to those  Like Dave Mullins, I cannot bring myself simply to dismiss these latest inflation numbers as nothing more than an aberration Like Dave and others, if I look at the fundamentals it's very tempting to say it's just an aberration But it's hard to dismiss Now, one thing these numbers have done already is to make it a lot harder just to stand there and confidently say to somebody that, looking out over '93 or '94, the inflation rate is going to continue to edge down even as the economy does much better You get the feeling that maybe your nose is growing as you say that And that in its own small way is one of the reasons why I find it hard to dismiss those numbers out of hand Partly for that reason but for some other reasons as well--and notwithstanding all that has been said including by my distinguished colleagues from Liberty Street--I think this long bond rally is vulnerable I think we could see a turnaround in the long bond market And I say that partly because of that nagging sense of uneasiness about inflation, but I want to go a bit further on that  It's quite right, of course, to take the indisputable view that the long-bond rate has a real component and an inflation expectations component That's the Bible But I don't think it's quite right to argue that the dynamics of the marketplace as reflected in the prices of those bonds in periods of 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 months dissect quite that neatly and easily in terms of what's driving investors, especially when the so-called professional investors have missed the whole thing as Bill McDonough said When you look at the behavior of the bond market over the last 5 or 6 months, I think you have to allow at least for a phenomenon that isn't quite as neat and precise economically and logically as we'd all wish it to be For example, you could put this on one of three levels coming out of the period of the election There's one very, very unsophisticated view of things that simply says people started to feel better; I don't quite know why, but they began to feel better And there's a slightly more sophisticated version of that, which to me seems consistent with Gary Stern's comment, that says "Well, at least fiscal policy is getting into the ball game here" It has been on the sidelines for 12 years and they don't quite know what it's going to do, but it's going to make things a little better no matter what And then, of course,  -26-    3/23/93  there is the more sophisticated view that I think Al Broaddus brought up very early in the meeting and that is the net result of the Clinton package and all the rest leading to the view that there's distinctly less of a threat of forced monetization of debt over time and that is what's working its way back into inflationary expectations and fiscal policy being on the table and so forth Now, having said that, I don't know where the truth lies I don't think anybody knows where the truth lies But if for any reason--and I'll get to the reasons in a minute--the public at large or the marketplace in particular conclude that something on the order of magnitude of the deficit reduction that is thought to be on the table cannot or will not be attained or that the whole program whether you like it or not is up for grabs, I think that bond market could turn around with a vengeance and in a hurry  Unfortunately, my own comfort level with those prospects is not as strong as I'd like it to be Just as an example, if everything went according to Hoyle in the context of the deficit reduction effort and economic assumptions were perfect and there were no technical mis- estimates, Medicare and Medicaid costs alone behaving over the next three years or four years like they behaved over the past two years could easily offset most or all of the deficit reduction part of the Clinton plan So, I don't think that [deficit reduction] is a shoe-in by a long shot Now, I'm not ready to throw in the towel either I think this is the best chance that we've had in many, many years to get some of this stuff done But if there is disappointment in how it begins to evolve in practice, there are going to be a lot of people scratching their heads asking "Where did that wonderful rally in long bonds go?" I don't think it's secure by a long shot So, again, I am essentially as comfortable as I can be with the kind of outlook shown in the Greenbook, but I must say that the multiple sources of my uneasiness about how things may in fact work out are no less today than they were two months ago   I, too, would support alternative B, symmetric Again, in the face of all these conflicting signals, I think we have to go back and look at the fundamentals And the fundamentals, as best I can judge them, are still okay even though the risks have changed Again, in the context of Governor Angell's earlier point, I don't remember '68 or '69, but I do remember '84 and '87 I might add '88; I think '88 was a watershed, too In all three of those cases I was on the same side of the ledger, whatever that's worth, but in all three of those cases I had some conviction about the economy itself I might feel differently six weeks from now but at least at this moment I still don't have that conviction about [where] the real economy [is going] And it's for that reason that I prefer to stay where we are at least for a little while longer   I'd say that was "C" symmetric!   I move it   So moved   You're talking about expectations in general?   I'll try to do this in three sentences First, my instincts about the real economy have not changed much; Governor Mullins was on the mark there But as I've said at several meetings running, I still do not have any great conviction about the future in terms of the real economy I still think it could be stronger, but it could be weaker; I just don't have that conviction I want to second very strongly the comment you made at the outset of the meeting, Mr Chairman, about the situation in Europe I was not, as you know, at that last Basle meeting, but the string of visitors who passed through after the Interim Committee meeting, both on the official side and the private side, were gloomy across the board I mean really gloomy The third point is that I don't understand this inflation situation any better than anybody else does I think we cannot dismiss it as simply broccoli prices and  -37-    5/18/93  other wholly transitory things On the other hand, I do still think that economic fundamentals matter And while I probably am not as hopeful as Mike Prell, I don't think I'm quite as gloomy as some others appear to be in terms of where we are going But I agree that it is a changed situation   Let me make a factual observation and then a comment--not that we should let facts get in the way of these things On this inflation issue, the question, aside from the diagnostics of what is causing it, is really Where are we? It's clear that achieving the further progress toward price stability that everyone is hoping for in 1993 looks a bit remote at this point But the other side of the question is that while we may not be doing as well as we hoped, are we doing as badly as we think? Of that I'm not so sure, so I think a little perspective here might be useful Look at the core CPI in the first and second quarters of the years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993 In '90 it was 53 and 55 percent; in '91 it was 65 and 38 percent; in '92 it was 42 and 33 percent; in '93 it is 41 percent and--if you take the Greenbook [projection for the second quarter], which I'm quite prepared to do--33 percent Now, that's not what we had hoped for Again, Wayne or David made the point that the number reported in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony as the central tendency of the Committee was 2-1/2 to 3 percent or something like that So, in that sense things aren't working out as well as we had hoped But at least to date I'm not yet quite persuaded that the genie is out of the bottle If you look at the experience at least so far, while there's no question it's not what we want it to be, I'm not so sure that I'm personally ready to concede the point that all is lost I don't think it is  -44-    5/18/93  Now, on the question of procedure First of all, under any circumstance I have always believed that no matter what we do we've always got to leave the Chairman with maneuvering room I don't care whether the directive is asymmetric or symmetric; to me that's irrelevant There always has to be that powerful, powerful prejudice that leaves the Chairman with flexibility when he needs it Having said that, and putting aside my own views about policy which will come later, in my mind's eye one argument for an asymmetric directive that I don't think has yet been mentioned--it has nothing to do with process--is that if it turns out that things do start to look a little better, we're going to look a lot better by virtue of having that asymmetric directive on the record   If overall performance starts to look better in terms of the economy, inflation, or both, and that asymmetric directive is on the record, I think institutionally that makes us look better In other words the signal is still there that we weren't insensitive to what was going on   Yes, we saw the bear in the woods; he went back to hibernate but we saw the SOB This seems to me to be a win/win [situation] because if on the other hand it turns out that things aren't so good--that the bear is out in the corn field or the back yard--and we have an asymmetric directive that we've utilized, we're better off as well So, putting aside all of these complicated questions of process, I think those arguments should be part of the picture As a matter of fact, I think the substantive arguments are more important in this setting than are the process arguments   Si, just to emphasize in case I wasn't clear, I agree with you There's no question that with or without asymmetry the Chairman always has a margin of flexibility I was trying to suggest that on the issue of whether to prefer symmetric or asymmetric--not that they are the only possibilities but just focusing on those two--the substantive [reason] for having an asymmetric directive is that no matter what happens, if things get worse or if things get better, the Committee is at that point on the record as having been vigilant and alert   I'm quite comfortable with "B" asymmetric I might say, if I could just add a word on process which I know you want to deal with separately, that if it turns out that the Committee does come to a consensus that a tightening move is needed in the foreseeable future, of course, I won't be a part of that decision But leaving that aside, if a tightening move is needed any time between now and the next meeting, that will be one of the relative handful of watershed policy decisions that come along This is not a "gimme putt" Indeed, it's probably [a watershed decision] not just because it would be a turning point but because of the environment in which it is going to happen, if it happens So, I think there's a great deal of wisdom in the suggestion that several people have made that if you do that, you better do it right with a meeting of the Committee by telephone or otherwise and by a vote   I also assume that if something really ugly happens that has nothing to do with the things we're talking about here, you will always have--
