 So move   So move   I move on that   I think I can make it $12 billion [Laughter]   Is it because banks and thrifts are getting super conservative? Is that the idea?   Well, Mr Chairman, I think we'll probably get a little better sense of things when we get back to work in earnest in September and businesses start doing their planning for 1988 But, as I look at things right now, first, I think that the outlook for the economy is better--not that I thought that it was all that bad to begin with And second, I have to conclude that the inflation risks have risen In terms of the "body english" that can  -19-    8/18/87  be put on that, some can say--as I think Mike Prell did a long time ago--that one way to look at it is simply with a higher degree of confidence that something approaching 3 percent real growth could be realized I would simply add that, in the current circumstances, I do think we have to keep in mind that something like the staff forecast for real growth isn't far from what is optimal, considering the need to effect the external adjustments that we have all been talking about and to maintain some hope that the inflationary process does not get away from us, as a number of people have suggested  On this all-important question of the external adjustment, for what it's worth, the New York staff forecast is a little stronger overall in real GNP Interestingly enough, it is also one in which there is no assumption of further dollar depreciation in 1988, but despite that, we get a better showing in the trade account and the current account in nominal terms and end up at about the same place in real terms Now, the reasons for those differences, I think, are important One is that we do have slightly stronger growth--not a gangbuster pace by any means--but marginally stronger growth in the non-US industrialized world than is in the staff forecast A second factor, of course, is that without the second or third J-curve effect, the nominal effects work in the right direction And finally, we do have US export prices going up more rapidly than the staff forecast does Each one of those, obviously, is a big "if" and, taken together, they are a lot of "ifs" But the key point is that they do suggest at least the possibility that you could get an outcome that is better in nominal terms and about the same in real terms, without having to rely on a further depreciation of the dollar, with its inflationary implications and the risk, of course, that further depreciation of the dollar could get away from us I think that is important for another reason I tend to look a lot at what I call "a domestic savings gap" in trying to figure out where we are in terms of capital and savings requirements As things stand right now, and assuming a Federal budget deficit in 1988 somewhere in the $150 to $160 billion range, the fact of the matter is that we have made precious little progress in reducing the so-called domestic savings gap If the budget deficit next year is in that $150-$160 billion range, and if total net private investment is only about 5 percent of the GNP, which is darn small, the savings gap relative to GNP is still going to be 2-1/2 percent or more of GNP It is still going to be $145 or $150 billion in absolute terms--not down at all from its peak in 1985 or 1986 So, that fundamental disequilibrium is still there In fact, it has not improved much at all, despite the reductions that we have seen in the budget deficit, because the saving rate for the economy as a whole has slipped off its peaks of 1985 and 1986--not decisively, but enough so that the problem, both in relative and absolute terms, is still very much with us throughout the forecast period That in itself says to me that we have to be especially cautious, because one way or another that residual is going to have to be filled from abroad, if interest rates and exchange rates are going to remain consistent with the kind of economic profile that the forecasts are talking about  On the inflation question, I can be very brief and simply say that a number of us, including myself, have fretted in the past about crossing that threshold of 4 percent in the deflator and 5 percent in the consumer price index; and it seems to me that the consensus view, though not the universal view, among private economists and others is  -20-    8/18/87  that we are there That, I think, is the reality As things stand right now, I can postulate conditions that would produce a result better than that, but I certainly don't think that those are the likely outcome Indeed, I guess I'd be on the side that says that I could also postulate conditions in which, heaven forbid, we could find ourselves looking at 5 percent on the deflator and 6 percent in the consumer price index If we get to that point, then we are looking at a situation that inevitably carries with it the risks of highly destabilizing consequences for the real economy here and around the world Indeed, I think the lessons of the past are clear if you wait to see that kind of problem staring you in the face, the costs of unwinding it are going to be exponentially greater than the costs of checking it in the first place   Thank you, Mr Chairman I can be rather brief As I said earlier, in the totality of circumstances that we face, I view something like the staff forecast as about as close to optimal as we can get right now But I also regard the risks in that forecast as being strongly asymmetrical on the side of the economy being stronger and the inflation rate being higher Because I have that view as to the asymmetries of the situation, and because I regard the risks of that type of an outcome to be potentially so severe, I would favor, at this point, a modest move in policy that would take the borrowing level to $600 million--in other words, something between "B" and "C" It's not that I think that kind of a move in and of itself is going to be decisive; but I do think that it will be enough of a move to show through in the marketplace, and to convey a sense of concern on the part of this Committee as to the potential for things working in an adverse way I see that kind of an approach as relatively risk-free in that the initial change that it would carry, whether in terms of interest rates or things like that, is inconsequential as far as the forecast for the economy is concerned I do not regard signal value as being inconsequential So, on the theory that a stitch in time may indeed be worth nine, I would proceed along those lines   I wouldn't object I would just offer a historical caution, for what it's worth I think we have to be a little bit careful about jiggling around these quarterly objectives at mid-quarterly meetings, especially when we are so near the end of the quarter It can convey something more than I think we had in mind   I think it's better to leave them close to where they were at mid-quarter  -34-    8/18/87    The convention, I think, Mr Chairman, is that you do not average that   The majority is--   I think it is hard to average it One other thing that is done, in terms of trying to sense where the critical mass is, if I could put it that way, or where the Committee might stand, is that the Chairman has been known from time to time to ask people what their preferences are as opposed to what they could live with In this particular case, you may have some shadings of opinion around those borrowing numbers, for example, based on the question of symmetry or tilt that would go with them--in other words, the "woulds" and the "mights" I, myself, certainly would not dissent, at this meeting, over the difference between $600 million and $500 million in the context in which there was some tilt along the lines that Governor Johnson has suggested So, you do have some play; but I don't think that most members of the Committee would be comfortable with averaging the borrowings I think that can get to be quite awkward when there are larger differences, as there may be, than the difference between $500 million and $600 million   Second   In general, based on a number of these periodic surveys that have been done, the thinking is that the percentage of transactions that will in some sense be related to the underlying exchange of goods is very, very small   So move it   In terms of the forecast, it has been true for some time, and it's still true, that our staff work in New York has the same overall result as the Greenbook forecast but with an unchanged dollar and a slightly smaller adjustment in real net exports because we have a scattering of stronger elements of domestic demand, including inventories So, while the aggregate numbers look very'much the same, what lies beneath them is quite different insofar as the dollar and real net exports Our inflation outlook, despite the fact that we have the dollar stable, is about the same, or maybe a shade worse than the Greenbook  Mr Boehne raised a question earlier in the discussion about this overall adjustment process that I'd like to comment on just briefly, and then turn back I think, Ed, your question was can it work? Or is the scale of the problem so big that you can't get from here to there? When you look at the big three countries--the United States, Germany, and Japan--the fact of the matter is that by conventional standards the adjustment is well underway in the sense that for both 1986 and 1987, and in our forecast for 1988, the growth in domestic demand in both Germany and Japan is stronger to significantly stronger than is the growth in their own GNP In the case of the United States, we still had domestic demand stronger than GNP in 1986; but in 1987, and in our forecast and yours as well-- although there are some differences there--you get a widening out such that GNP growth in the United States is something like a percentage point greater than growth in domestic demand It is true that overall growth in Germany and Japan is perhaps lower than one would like to see But, the dynamics of the adjustment have set in, in what I think is not an inconsequential way Again, the evidence in all three of the major countries is basically working the way the textbook says it should The problem, to some extent, is what Ed touched on earlier, and that is the scale of the adjustment that we are talking about and the scale of adjustment that is needed When you look at it in terms of the behavior of exports--and this is all relevant to the outlook, I'm just getting there in a roundabout way--we all know these numbers are lousy, but the numbers for July 1987 versus July 1986 indicate that US export growth really has been, I think we can say, almost spectacular And it's not confined any more to a handful of products or a handful of countries; it's pretty much across the board, including very sharp increases in exports even to Japan The strength of those export numbers in the context of the overall dynamics of the adjustment raises a couple of questions in my mind What's offsetting it in part, of course, is imports Our own imports are still very, very strong, across the board, with few exceptions--perhaps lumber But, by and large, those imports are still humming and a lot of that is price Then again, how many J curves do we have to see in terms of import prices? That's one of the reasons why I like our forecast--at least right now--better than I like the Board staff's forecast But, when you put it together, it leads me to one or two possible conclusions One is that there really is something systematically wrong with the trade numbers, at least as we see them month to month The second is that the domestic economy is, in fact, stronger than we think it is, or at least than the conventional measures are telling us My hunch is that probably both of those things are true that the trade numbers are messed up and that the domestic economy, if anything, is actually a bit stronger than we think it is  -17-    9/22/87  Partly for the reasons I've just noted, I would certainly join those who have already said that, in looking at the outlook at this point in time, the risks are decidedly on the upside I find it hard at this point to ignore the galaxy of numbers in the business fixed investment areas, industrial production, orders, and labor markets They all seem to be to pointing in that direction, in a context in which I really do believe that the margin of upside error, if you will, is really quite slim I think you can now make a pretty good case that actual GNP is brushing up against potential GNP; labor markets, no matter how you look at them, have to be at least near the danger zone; and I think it's not hard to visualize at least some selective bottlenecks beginning to develop, for example, in nondurable goods areas where we already see that raw and intermediate material prices are rising Now, we could get a little help There is a faint chance, at least in the near term, that the oil price pressures could be downward rather than upward That would be temporary, but that's possibly a favorable straw in the wind But when I put it all together, it seems to me that both the global picture as well as what we can derive from our own situation statistically lead me to view that the risks are on the upside  Now, on your question about the long-term Treasury rate, Mr Chairman, I thought we were framing the question a little differently than maybe you were I was prepared to answer this question what do I think is driving the rate up? Is that what you are asking? I'm not sure it is the same   Well, the breakdown of the components to the increment and the breakdown of the components to the level may not be the same, though But, let me try to answer   If it were the increment in the nominal rate, which is the question I thought you were asking, I would put virtually none of that on volatility, which was the middle factor you raised I would put the greater weight on inflation-related considerations, including the exchange rate of the dollar But, I do think there is something real there too; I can't be very precise as to what But I'd give zero weight on volatility, certainly   Yes   Yes, but I would say that while I think the bulk of the increment has been driven by these inflation- related things, I also would say that the level of the real interest rate does come out higher Maybe, just maybe, that's because there is something happening in terms of the marginal productivity of capital It's possible  -18-    9/22/87   No, I agree   These are both [unintelligible] integrated plants?   I'd be completely satisfied with that formulation--that is, staying with $600 million borrowing and using symmetric language In a nutshell, I think that is where policy should be   In a nutshell, I genuinely think that is precisely where policy should be   Yes   I don't think it's just the money supply question I think that President Poehl, in particular, believes that if push comes to shove, the Germans and the German economy can handle a somewhat stronger mark and weaker dollar And he quite firmly believes, whether anyone happens to agree or not, that the risks are squarely on the side of the United States--that the risks of a weaker dollar are greater risks to the United States than they are for Germany and--   I think it is correct I was just going to say that I find it hard to violently disagree with that The question that I think Ed Boehne is raising goes beyond the technical mechanism of the Louvre or anything else and that is What are the risks? At least that's how I think of it What are the risks of one set of policies, however broadly defined, versus another set of policies? I ask myself this question What event of a foreseeable nature could really get us in the soup again? And I'm thinking, in part, of the events of the past couple of weeks I must say that I think the dollar is still high on that list If the dollar were to fall out of bed--however one might choose to define that--first of all, whether we like to admit it or not, I think the dollar/domestic interest rate linkage is still there I'm not quite sure it is--or ever was--as precise as some people thought, but I certainly think that linkage is still there I think the danger is clear; I can't assign probabilities to it but the danger is clear that you can end up with the worst of both worlds a lower dollar and higher interest rates The collapse of the exchange markets could easily trigger a renewed outburst of chaos in the financial markets There is one particular thing that we have to keep in mind, and that is that a decidedly weaker dollar could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, especially for the Japanese stock market I think that is a very real danger   What could they do? What they should have done was do something several years ago But what should they do right now?   Well, that may be; but we can't be indifferent to it   I don't think it's quite that black and white I think there is something of a workable middle ground and we have to try to find it   Manley, when you're talking about a brave new world, the thing that is most new and most brave about this world right now is that we have no policies We have no fiscal policies; we have no exchange rate policies,   [Unintelligible] around 6 to 7 percent   I don't know about the demand for BMWs and Mercedes, but that shouldn't affect the productivity numbers too much Actually, they should go up   In the very near term, Mr Chairman, I don't think there's much doubt that the stock market and related developments do work in the direction of weaker spending and lower inflation But I am not at all sure as to amounts and I am not at all sure what one should infer for the longer term There are probably several dozen scenarios that anybody could think of Unlike Mr Prell, I don't have to put one on paper but, in my thinking, there are two more likely scenarios in the near term One is that the financial markets, and by that I mean all of them--exchange markets, bond markets, stock markets--kind of settle in more or less where they have been in the last couple of days I don't know where they are right now, so I have to qualify that But suppose the Dow settles in at the 1900-2000 range, the long bond settles in at 9 percent or a little more or a little less, and the exchange markets are roughly in line with [the levels of] recent days Now, in that scenario, my hunch is that economic performance will be respectable but not spectacular over the intermediate term--probably something like what I heard Mr Parry describe, which I don't consider to be all bad, by the way The other scenario, which I think has to be thought about along with that one, isn't so pretty And that's a scenario in which for whatever reason-- because the exchange markets go south or the budget negotiations rupture--there's a sudden hit to the system Who knows what the exact trigger might be, but we could find ourselves confronted with another very, very difficult and turbulent set of conditions in the financial markets Obviously, I can't put a probability on that But if I were to just think of the two broad scenarios that would warrant the closest attention from a policy point of view, I guess those are the two that stick out in my mind Interestingly enough, at least from my perspective, they both seem to me to have the same immediate policy implications in that they both imply the need for a great deal of caution in policy, and a very measured and disciplined approach to policy in which we maintain maximum flexibility for the future    11/3/87  I would also, if I may Mr Chairman, like to make a comment or two about the longer-term situation as I see it, because I think it's extremely germane both to where we are and to policy options for the future There is, of course, a great deal of discussion in all circles about imbalances in the US and the world economy, whether in terms of trade or payments or whatever But, we should not lose sight of a couple of powerful forces on the domestic side that I think are germane One is the dramatic increase in debt, in leveraging, that we have had in recent years the ratio of overall nonfinancial debt to GNP--and I understand all the limits in the data--has risen from something like 141 in the early 1980s to almost 181 early this year It may be coincidence--it probably is--but the fact of the matter is that the last time we saw that ratio in a range that high was in the late 1920s And it's not all government debt, although government debt has a lot to do with it Since the first quarter of 1984, the net issuance of equity is down $270 billion and corporate debt is up $600 billion Again, if you look at this problem of government deficits and savings, it's really quite dramatic In the late 1970s, the general US government budget deficit as a percent of net private savings averaged about 10 percent It has risen sharply throughout the 1980s, peaking at 66 percent in 1986 Indeed, in 1986 the federal budget deficit itself absorbed more than 90 percent of net private savings And even in 1987, that absorption rate relative to domestic savings will fall only to the mid-50 percent range I stress that because in the context of all this discussion about budget packages and all the rest, I think we have to keep in mind that, even under the best of circumstances, the kinds of things that are talked about in the area of budget reform are really quite small Indeed, there is a great likelihood that the budget deficit in 1988 in absolute terms will be larger than in 1987 It is in that context, I think, that a lot of these acute dilemmas and very, very sharp risks have to be evaluated and considered   Let me just make a couple of comments about policy generally, and then I may have some language here that can encompass a lot of what is being said First of all, to return briefly to this exchange rate question, I don't approach the exchange rate as a matter of theology; I approach it as a matter of trying to balance the risks And my principal point on the exchange rate is that I do see very real risks of a further substantial depreciation in the value of the dollar I know certain things that it will do it will add to inflationary pressures at home; it will work in the direction of putting greater pressure rather than lesser pressure on interest rates at home I don't know how it works; but I know the algebraic signs And I also know that, at least in the short run, it raises more questions about growth prospects abroad, in part, because of another elongation in the J curve Now, I have to balance those risks against the hope that it will somehow accelerate the turnaround in the US trade deficit, in a context in which there are a host of uncertainties--such as growth prospects abroad--that I think are more important than the exact level of the exchange rate So again, it's not a matter of theology for me; it's a matter of where are the risks and what are the greater risks Then, there is this question of debt deficits and debtor nations The point that I was trying to get at in bringing that up before is that whether we like it or not, history tells us in rather unmistakable terms that a country that finds itself in the position that we find ourselves in right now is going to have higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case There may be an example someplace, somewhere in history that's contrary to that, but I don't know of it   I don't think it exists The only other point I'd make is on this question of a measured approach to what we are trying to do here I favor alternative "B" as Governor Johnson defined it a moment ago But let me, if it's agreeable to you, Mr Chairman, suggest some language here   This is built on Variant I, and I think it gets at a lot of the things that you have been saying The first sentence, without prejudging decreasing or maintain or whatever would read "In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to [decrease somewhat/maintain/increase slightly] the degree of pressures on reserve positions sought in recent days" Tom, I think that gets at your point And I would remove the next sentence after the semicolon completely Go down to the next sentence "The Committee "   Take out all that stuff after the semicolon I'm at Variant I The first sentence reads "In the  -38-    11/3/87  implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to [decrease somewhat/maintain/increase slightly] the degree of pressures on reserve positions" and I would insert "sought in recent days"   Yes, I think they do   Well, either way; we can come back to that   Well, let me come to that in a minute because what I was going to suggest in the next sentence, Si, deals with that, I think "The Committee recognizes that the volatile conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may call for a special degree of flexibility in open market operations" and then insert "depending, in particular, on demands for liquidity growing out of recent or prospective developments in the financial markets"   But the idea, Si, is to get that all into one sentence so it's not too overburdening Then the next sentence--and in my mind this is crucial--would start "Apart from such considerations", in other words apart from the providing liquidity, etc Then you would have your regular sentence with the somewhat or slightly lesser or greater reserve restraint In other words, that next sentence would stay as it is Others may not agree with this, but contrary to what somebody said, I personally would take out the sentence on the next page about relatively frequent consultations We certainly can do that and may do that, but I think we ought to be trying to project not business as usual but not that we are ready to jump out the window ourselves So, as I see it, Mr Chairman, a directive couched more or less in those terms would allow us to do what you certainly want to do and I gather what a lot of other people want to do But it would stop short of a directive that becomes a federal funds rate directive And at least in my judgment, it provides a bridge to go from these extraordinary conditions right now to a more "normal" environment, if circumstances permit   I'm agnostic on that; I would have a broad range there--5 to 9 percent or 4 to 8 percent; I wouldn't worry too much about that  -39-    11/3/87   I'm not sure what it says right now because it was sent out to be typed about 10 minutes ago; it hasn't come back yet   Let me see it   Let me just take a look at it   Right; that's right   I guess so   The sentence I think should read "Apart from such considerations slightly lesser reserve restraint would or slightly greater might"   Somewhat lesser reserve restraint--   Okay   And the economy, strength of the business expansion, etc   That's right The Chairman is talking about a major international event we have coming up in June We have a challenge of a softball game between the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  SPEAKER(?) We better beat them   Much is at stake  SPEAKER(?) You're going to have a hard time   You can wait for the outcome to see   Move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   Can I raise a point of order, Mr Chairman?   Going back to the organizational meeting schedule, I wonder if it might not be well for the Committee to consider changing the organizational meeting from March to February The rationale I have in mind is that it always strikes me as anomalous that the presidents who vote for the annual targets at the February meetings cease being the presidents who vote for the balance of the year I just wonder if in the interest of consistency--   Okay   I think that that is right in terms of the real question, but I'm not so sure that the question is unanswerable, in the ultimate sense of the word I find it compelling to ask myself a question What are the implications of a significant further decline in the dollar from where we are now? I think you have to think it through on the trade side and on the financial side In my view, the problem on the trade side is that the current forecast may embody a speed of adjustment that is about as fast as we can hope to achieve; indeed, it seems to me that it may border on the edge of being dangerously fast, in the context of being inflationary So, I don't see that there is a whole lot to be gained in the foreseeable future on the trade side from a further decline in the dollar Then, I ask myself the question What does it imply on the financial side? And by financial side, of course, I mean our capacity to finance a $140 billion current account deficit this year And that question, it seems to me, is more difficult I can't quantify how much more difficult, but I think the algebraic sign is clear enough So, where I come out, without being able to be precise, is that I see a clear risk on the side of a further depreciation of the dollar and I see    3/29/88  very little to be gained by a further depreciation of the dollar I don't know what it gets us   I think that's a big part of the problem You don't have that wholesale deposit problem in this case We have it to some extent, but it's very small compared to what you    3/29/88  had in Continental I think that in terms of the market's sharp reaction, that put a very different coloration on Continental as opposed to this  SPEAKER(?) I do think that it might be a bit of a mistake to assume that it's only a regional problem   I so move   I move that, too   Let me make a couple of general comments I think that Ann-Marie Meulendyke's memorandum that is attached to Peter's and Don's memorandum is very revealing, because what it says to me is that there's nothing new under the sun--that the same frustrations and the same debate has been going on since time immemorial   Okay I'm sorry   As I started to say, I think Ann- Marie's memorandum is interesting because what it says is that there's nothing new under the sun--that this debate, in various forms, has been going on since time immemorial One of the more revealing things in her memorandum, it seems to me, is that in 1968, as I recall, we established a system of lagged reserve accounting to help us hit a free reserve target; and as soon as we went through all the pain and expense of doing that, we abandoned free reserve targets What she didn't say, of course, is that in the early 1980s we went to incredible pain and expense to institute a system of contemporaneous reserve accounting to help us set the money supply; and no sooner had we gone through the pain and expense of that we abandoned the money supply targets Now, if that isn't coming full circle, I don't know what is  -18-    3/29/88  But I think what is at issue here are two things that are inescapable One is that it's a lot easier to ease monetary policy than it is to tighten I don't care what indicators you're using; I don't care what your philosophy is; it's a lot easier to go one way than it is the other And I think that the history of monetary policy around the world is ultimately tied up in that question I think it's also true, as Manley said, that the borrowings number is obviously a proxy for a bunch of things But so is the federal funds rate Indeed, there's nothing particularly appealing about the federal funds rate in itself You can pick federal funds rates, which at different points in time have been associated with wildly different patterns of economic activity, inflation, and all the rest of it There is absolutely no magic in the federal funds rate and its relationship to the things that we really care about The funds rate in its own sense is merely symbolic of a bunch of things So, whether you're talking borrowings or the funds rate, I think, in some sense, you're talking about a proxy for a collection of things  And that's partly the answer to Governor Heller's question as to why, if the procedure is so lousy, the results are so good I think the answer to that is, in part, because we all look through the procedures In other words, we do not focus simply on the transmission variables or the proxy variables; we look through those things and we make judgments about them based on what we see in the economy, in inflation, and all the rest Indeed, it seems to me that that's why there are conditional elements in the directive language That reinforces the view, in my judgment, that the things we are focusing on are imperfect proxies for the things we really care about  I don't fully agree with the argument that the move away from the federal funds rate was simply a politically driven decision, especially one that was motivated by obfuscation I think it was more fundamental than that I think it did reflect the earlier experience And the experience was, as Frank said, that we were staring a roaring inflation in the face And we chose [not] to, or were unwilling to, recognize it and respond to it So, I think there's more to that than politics and obfuscation I also think that there's more to it in another sense It seems to me that, regardless of what we use as the proxy for policy, a very crucial question is What constitutes a change in policy? We are always the ones who will have to answer that question So, of the decisions that we make, which do we regard as a change in policy? I think we have a responsibility to inform the world when we make a change in policy, as opposed to a little give here and there based on markets and developments and all the rest of that That's the question that I think is on the table At the extreme, if you have money supply targets and they're annual and you literally view them as targets, you very seldom change policy But if you're talking a federal funds rate that is a discrete number--that has a point estimate attached to it--and you really want to say that that's your policy instrument, it seems to me that you are looking at a situation in which you're going to have to be saying with great frequency, Mr St Germain, we changed policy yesterday   But again, I think there's a reason for that And the reason is that they are construed in a way in which  -19-    3/29/88  lowering your borrowing target is not viewed as a change in policy It is viewed as consistent with an ongoing policy   But what are you going to announce?   Again, I just caution you, you get to the point where you still have to answer the question What is a change in policy? That I think--   A change of policy, in the context of existing directives, is an increase or a decrease in the amount of pressure on reserves And it seems to me--   It's not the same   It absolutely is not the same in terms of--   It differs in the very sense that we're stuck on this problem right now Now, when you go back to October, you're trying to hit a federal funds rate target to the second decimal point And if you're going to do that, it seems to me that that carries with it the implication that policy defined in those terms is going to take on a short-run orientation that is going to be disruptive to markets, more difficult to communicate If we were to change policy right now, what would you say in your testimony? I saw it on C-Span; you were asked two or three times Has there been a change in the approach to policy? You said no in your recent testimony If we literally take the step of saying that we're going to target the federal funds rate, I don't think you can answer that question by saying no   I'm talk--   What would you do, I guess is the question?   But that's a change in the approach to policy   That's what helps us   But neither does the federal funds rate   Oh, sure   Every change in the borrowings level is on that solid line   But not the other--no, that's where I think there's a difference of opinion   Well, that's the question   Now, when you look at the rate of [unintelligible]--I think that is the crucial question   That, I think, is the crucial question I was trying to get at before What is a policy change? I have never felt that every change in the borrowings number in that path has to be considered a policy change If a change in borrowing is made that is consistent with the way the directive was structured by the Committee, it doesn't follow to me that that is a change in policy Indeed, that's why I think that it's quite appropriate that that be done by the Chairman   But, again, it seems to me that's the--   And I think it's crucial for you, Mr Chairman, because as I tried to say before, ultimately the question that is on the table here--aside from the substantive question--is under what conditions do the procedures create a situation in which you are, in effect, required to make a public statement--through a testimony, a speech, or one way or another--that Fed policy has changed And I don't want to get into a situation in which you have to do that every two months or every two weeks   Okay; then, many of these things here would not be policy changes   That's part of it Regardless of what you use as your indicators or your proxies, I think that one way or another we have to try to project an underlying forward looking consistency in policy that ultimately overrides all this noise Again, as I said before, I think part of the problem is that each of us, in our own way, looks through the noise anyway Obviously, our judgments about the noise are conditioned by what we see and feel about the economy, inflation and the stuff that really matters And it's not easy to capture that in the directive either   Do it in December   Sure   Right   I lost the tail end of your remarks, Ted You cited a rule of thumb--and I think you said 10 percent--   Goods output in the context you are using it here--that's something I could roughly associate with industrial production as well?   No   I don't have much to add Our forecast is virtually identical to the staff's forecast I think that the amount of room on the upside is just about zero In other words, any acceleration of growth from these forecasts carries with it rapidly escalating risks that the inflation problem will begin to show through again The problem with inflation is that if it starts to show through, it could build quite rapidly On the other hand, if GNP growth were even a percentage point or so slower than forecasted for a quarter or two, especially if that slower growth were in domestic demand, I have to say that it isn't going to hurt my feelings terribly As I said earlier, I do view the exchange rate situation with some renewed anxiety It's not that I care about one exchange rate versus another, but right now I see clear risks on the downside with very little to be gained To me, it's a question of risks versus rewards and I don't see much there on the reward side at all  I also have a lot of sympathy with the point that Tom Melzer made about the return of the wild, wild West to the financial scene I, too, find it frankly astonishing that some of the things have reappeared as fast as they have, coming off the events of October I don't know what we do about that I guess the answer probably is, nothing But it clearly does bring with it some long-term problems of a potentially serious nature Hopefully, we won't have a recession in the foreseeable future, but we will at some point I don't know if it  -50-    3/29/88  will be 1999 or 1989, but there will be a recession And when that recession comes, the potential consequences of it--in a context in which the system is progressively more and more leveraged and basic tenets of financial discipline don't seem able to stick--are very, very distressing I don't think there is anything we can do about that at the moment, but it is a big concern   Do what?   Well, my instincts probably are the same, but I think that for financial market reasons, if nothing else, I'd be willing to sneak up on it To me, that would mean do the $100 million now with asymmetric language, although I could live with an arrangement in which you and Peter have some flexibility in terms of edging that $100 million in But, certainly, I feel very strongly that we should get that first $100 million in promptly I think that the two changes in policy that have been made in the last several weeks or so clearly have been viewed favorably by the markets as an indication that we are indeed prepared to respond to these conditions But I agree with Bob Parry that, insofar as the economy is concerned, I doubt that they've done much of anything I think that Don Kohn made that point in a way, earlier on, when he pointed out that nominal and real interest rates--even after those moves--are precious little different from what they were a year ago And in the intervening year, the economy has grown at a rate that simply won't work prospectively I also have a nagging fear here--I don't know what the staff's views on this are--that because of these highly mobile money and capital markets on a worldwide basis, that it may take a higher level of interest rates to achieve a given degree of restraint in the real world And if that were the case, our problems that lie ahead, especially in the context of Governor Seger's comments about thrifts and a lot of other things, would be all the more difficult and all the more damaging It is precisely for that reason that I feel so strongly that moving now is the right thing to do I agree with comments made by Governor Johnson, I think before the coffee break, and by Lee Hoskins a few minutes ago that we've got to avoid fine tuning here; the broad thrust of developments over the next six or seven quarters is what we have to keep in mind And that, too, says to me that we ought to move now I also agree with Governor Johnson on the discount rate question In the situation that we have right now--where we're on the upside of the cycle and where we don't have to worry about frictional levels of borrowings--I don't see that there is the same kind of prejudice for a discount rate [increase] that there was on the downside, where we run into that frictional borrowings problem So, I don't see that there is any presumption whatsoever, at least in my judgment, that if we moved--perhaps even as far as a full- blown "C"--that that would create a strong bias toward having to move    5/17/88  the discount rate Indeed, at the phase of things that we're in, like Governor Johnson, I personally--not that I have a final say on the discount rate--would try to keep our powder dry on the discount rate and work through the market as much as possible I think that does two things One, it minimizes the dangers of market disruptions; and secondly, it leaves us in a stronger position if something really adverse develops in the next month or two, or whatever To summarize, Mr Chairman, I would do the $100 million now, with an asymmetric directive That's it   I have trouble with it   I would have the first sentence say the Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserves   I understand that, but you asked me what I would prefer That's what I prefer   You don't know what May is yet   Well, I probably have more sympathy for this, at this point, than I did the last time we talked but--   [Unintelligible] a storm going on here because my thinking is probably conditioned by my worries that we  -25-    5/17/88  could be making a horrible mistake in monetary policy here I do have trouble, as I said before, with the base on a kind of intellectual level A number of comments have been made on technical issues But leaving those somewhat technical issues aside, I think what Tom is suggesting here is that there ought to be something--whether or not it has to be precisely this--something that makes us say "Hey, wait a minute" in a very, very deliberate, aggressive, forceful way And that's what I have more and more sympathy with, even though I must confess I can't really warm up to this particular proposal, for somewhat technical reasons There are two systematic periods, using the numbers that Tom has picked, in which this thing went astray One was in the early 1980s, and the other one, which Governor Angell was just talking about, was in 1986 Now, as Frank Morris pointed out, the Committee was aware that everything, including the base, was in the one case growing very slowly, and in the other case, growing very rapidly But the Committee made a conscious decision--not focusing on the base itself, but on other things that in some sense are symptomatic of the base--to ignore those Why did they make that decision? I think the answer is, in a sense, quite simple In the early 1980s, despite the fact that we were in what turns out to have been a hell of a recession, we also still had very high inflation rates In other words, the adjustment in the inflation process, while underway, was by no means finished and by no means locked in There was still some concern that the inflationary momentum of the late 1970s, 1980 and 1981, was still a demon that didn't have to just be wounded, but had to be stomped out And so there was, I think, a conscious decision to be tolerant of those shortfalls The same was more or less true in 1986, in that the very rapid growth in the base and the other aggregates was in some sense tolerated because, among other things, the inflation rate, while certainly not zero, was low, partly for oil price reasons, and certainly not rising And that leads me to the view that if a procedure like this were to have some functional utility, that utility might arise in a context in which there was some kind of a relationship between it and what, in fact, was going on with regard to inflation Now, I don't want to get into the rules game, either way But it's clearly one thing if the monetary base, or some other monetary measure, is outside of some range and the inflation rate is high and/or rising, as opposed to a situation where it's outside and the inflation rate is low and/or falling At least in my mind's eye, if something like this were to have some utility in a policy framework, either implicitly or otherwise, somehow or other you would need to take it one step further   Second   Could I, Mr Chairman, just make a comment rather than raise a question? Sam Cross mentioned in the course of his remarks that he thought that intervention on the part of the major central banks in this intermeeting period had helped curtail, if you will, the rise of the dollar I think that's a fair statement I want to actually make a more general, albeit a brief statement, about intervention because I think it has gotten a bit of a bad name It's not that I have any illusions about the ability of intervention to be decisive in terms of the position of a currency either short term or long term--but I do think there is a characteristic of the foreign exchange market, at least as I see it, that we have to keep in mind And the characteristic is the equivalent of these very sophisticated and very aggressive forms of program trading in the foreign exchange markets whereby individual institutions and individual traders take very, very large positions And they're willing to push those positions to the very limit One of the things that those trading strategies do is reinforce, in my judgment, the tendency toward one-way markets--in a context in which the perception is that you can make a quick buck by pushing that as far as possible And as long as those trading strategies are as dominant as I think they are, the dangers that can be associated with one-way markets become all the greater, and the tendencies for the exchange market to overshoot all the greater  My point in those circumstances is this I think that intervention does play a useful role in reaffirming the fact that there are two-way markets And I think that in and of itself is of value even if one can not argue persuasively that a particular exchange rate could or should emerge from the process But I do think that the presence of the central banks does create something of a conviction toward two-way markets If there's any doubt about that, all you have to do is talk to traders They will say that they tend to be much more cautious when they feel that the central banks may be on the scene So, I do think that these trading strategies--and the way at least I think they manifest themselves in the market--provide to me a fairly convincing case that there is merit or wisdom in the central banks showing their hand from time-to-time in the market even if one is agnostic about the effects in terms of a particular exchange rate at a particular point in time    8/16/88   I think the character of the market has changed in the last several years All you have to do, in one sense, is just look at the sheer volume of transactions If you use CHIPS transactions as a proxy--an imperfect proxy, but one which still is a pretty good way to do it because our survey suggests that something like 90 percent of the CHIPS traffic is foreign exchange transactions--they're up And if you look at what has happened in the development of the derivative markets in foreign exchange, perhaps especially the options [market], it's very clear that the sheer size of the market and the amount of turnover has grown enormously Look at the profits that all the major banks and investment banks are generating quarterly from foreign exchange trading I still can't fully understand that myself But every single quarter, with an exception here or there, all of these major firms are generating very sizable profits from foreign exchange trading If you look at some of the individual trading strategies, at least in some cases, they are a very elaborate form of program trading applied in a different area  I think all of those things taken together do constitute a change--admittedly over time--but a change in the character, the structure, the fabric of the market And I wouldn't argue with any conviction that the totality of those things is decisive, in any sense of the word, in producing these tendencies to overshoot that we see in the markets But I do think that they can be tempered a bit Indeed, as I said, the foreign exchange traders say they behave differently when they sense the central banks are on the scene Again, I'm not trying to make an argument that necessarily would dispute any of these earlier reports--finding point estimates and being able to say that this pattern of central bank intervention produced this result I'm agnostic myself about that   It should be   We've got a lot of that   Well, in some ways, Mike Prell gave my report I think I agree very much with how Mike characterized the economy Getting to the anecdotal stuff, I really haven't much to add There is more talk about scarcities in the labor market, even in terms of part-time jobs and things like that In terms of anecdotes, I think we'll get a better fix on things in early September I think most of these major companies come back after Labor Day and sit down    8/16/88  and really begin the process of thinking in earnest about 1989 and so on I think that some of the feedback that should begin to flow out of that will probably give us a better and fresher picture of what the situation is But at least for now, virtually every comment I hear is very much on the bullish side  In the context of the outlook and the forecast, I have just a couple of comments Looking at the external side of the Board staff forecast and, for what it's worth, the New York Fed staff forecast, both have real net exports in GNP terms in the fourth quarter of 1989 below -$50 billion And I think that is quite a remarkable result in one sense But I think it belies something else that gets kind of lost in the dust here--and that is, that both also have for the year 1989 a current account deficit that's still $125 billion And those current account deficits are going to have to be financed I mention that because, while there's a certain element of euphoria in markets and elsewhere about adjustments taking place, the fact of the matter is that in financial terms, as measured by the current account, we still have very, very large external imbalances And for that matter, the budget deficit is still sitting there stuck somewhere around $150 billion So, I don't see that a lot has been achieved in terms of significant progress on both the internal and external financial imbalances that are the root cause of many of our problems  On the inflation side, I guess my biggest concern by far at this point, Mr Chairman, is that I think there is at least a 50/50 chance that the inflation genie is already out of the bottle I don't take any forecast very seriously, but if we look, for example, at our own forecast--which by the way has a very modest increase in interest rates with orders of magnitudes about half of what Mike is talking about--it has a GNP deflator toward the middle and the end of next year at rates of increase of 4-1/2 percent and higher It has a fixed-weight deflator of 5 percent and higher; it has a CPI of 5-1/2 percent and higher; it has compensation per man-hour at 5 to 5-1/4 percent and higher By each one of those measures, the acceleration in the rate of inflation is somewhere in the area of 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points over what has been the experience for the past several years  That to me is very problematic in its own right But what is particularly problematic is that it just doesn't take much at all for those price forecasts to end up a threshhold level higher In other words, instead of pushing and penetrating 5 percent on some measures you could easily get results that break through the 6 percent level It takes very little to go wrong, at least in the context of our price numbers, to produce that result  As I said, our forecast differs from the staff only in the sense that I think the interest rate assumptions or, if you will, the policy assumptions may be somewhat different But when I look at the situation in that light, it does produce that fear on my part that we may already have an accelerating inflation problem on our hands that is going to be very costly to deal with   Like some others, there is at least a crisp debate in my own mind as to whether you could make a case that we should proceed promptly with a further move in the direction of tightening But I am persuaded that the interest of orderly procedure, if nothing else, suggests that there is something to be  -45-    8/16/88  said for what I will call a short period of gestation here So in that setting, I would support the formulation that you suggested Mr Chairman  I don't want to muddy the waters, but I would myself at least prefer the form of asymmetry that eliminates any reference to lesser reserve restraint whatsoever in the directive I am absolutely convinced at this juncture that we are going to have to firm up policy further and I think the sooner we get on with that test the better That's because, fundamentally, I agree with much of what Frank Morris says I am afraid that even as we speak the inflation problem may be on top of us And I agree with much of what John LaWare said about the financial risks But the other side of that is that the one thing we know will get us those killer interest rates is a killer inflation rate So I am very sensitive to those financial risks, but I'm also, as I say, very sympathetic with what Frank said   I'll just say for the record--I'm not going to make a fuss about it--I would prefer that it stayed fourth in line, but--   You caught it; I figured that   Second   Move it   Frank Morris would know Can you judge in terms of the time, Frank? I can't remember any better than quarter of 12   Mr Chairman, our forecast at the Bank is one that I think is close to the other side of Mike's coin We do not have a significant increase in interest rates built into our forecast; we have a bit of an upward drift But for that reason and for others, it's a forecast that ends up, on balance, with a phenomenal GNP growth rate--a percentage point and a half or so above what's in the Greenbook And because of where we are relative to potential, a good part of that excess shows through in terms of higher inflation Indeed, by the end of the forecast period, our forecast would have a very significantly higher inflation rate than what's in the Greenbook  That is not a testimony to any one forecast, but I think it's very vivid testimony to how much of a razor's edge we are on, in terms of what does or does not happen in the economy I don't have a great deal of conviction per se about any one forecast, but I must say my instincts continue to be very similar to Bob Parry's I'll just briefly share [some comments] with the Committee, Mr Chairman, partly because this is such a very difficult period to read  In the first two weeks of September, we talked to a couple of dozen firms to try to get a more systematic anecdotal appreciation of what's going on Now, a systematic approach to anecdotal reports is in no way a survey for purposes of OMB or anybody else   With that in mind, I'd like to touch on just a couple of the highlights The firms that we talked to  -14-    9/20/88  included about a dozen or so very prominent manufacturing firms with headquarters in the Second District, some smaller manufacturing firms, and some very prominent retail firms As of right now, what comes through is that the export sector is literally still booming Export sales were very strong indeed, with increases in volume terms typically well into double digits There was only one case where that was not true, and that particular firm didn't seem very concerned about it because they have a very large backlog of orders--orders that haven't even formally been booked yet for jet engines that are ultimately destined for overseas markets  On the question of the current level of the dollar, none of the firms expressed any concern about the current level Indeed, the impression was that even at current exchange rates, US firms were quite competitive except in apparel and clothing categories There were two small firms that did say that a yen/dollar of 140 was kind of a threshhold for them But generally speaking, there was no concern expressed in terms of current exchange rates and the ability of this strong export performance to continue But perhaps even more interesting is that we see here for the first time, in anecdotal terms, a number of clear cases of capital goods shifting away from foreign suppliers to US suppliers I don't want to suggest that that was the universal pattern, but of the major firms, about an equal number reported that positive shifting was taking place None said it was getting worse, with the exception of one company that was doing more sourcing from Mexico--which in some ways is a good thing, of course In addition, quite apart from capital goods, there were also a number of firms--and we haven't heard this for a long time either-- that were also reporting gains in domestic market shares in general, relative to imports In other words, they are actually now displacing imports in the domestic marketplace Again, the major exception to that is all of the clothing and textile firms--apparel-related things That area is still lousy throughout, both at production and retail levels But in other areas there are some distinct changes In terms of domestic sales performance, with only one or two exceptions, these firms reported current trends I think that were really quite strong, often in double digits  On the output, wage, and capacity side--again, none of this is very scientific and I don't want to put the wrong cast on it But it's really interesting because about half of the big firms--and these are the manufacturers, of course--reported no capacity constraints to speak of or nothing they couldn't cope with Whereas another half reported some problems--and these were typically in the areas that we would expect When it got to the particular question of input problems, in terms of price, delivery delays, etc, again it was about half-and-half About half did report that they were having input problems defined either as rapidly rising prices or delivery lags Those patterns were clear in steel, plastics, computer chips, aluminum, paper, and surprisingly, in some Japanese component parts But the other side of it is that about half of them didn't report particular problems of that nature  On the labor question--and this is very interesting--the responses broke almost straight down the line based on size The large firms did not report any particular problems in terms of labor shortages; the small firms did The same was more or less true in terms of wages in general The overall impression that I get, not  -15-    9/20/88  just from this but from listening to our directors and others, is that there is some upward movement on the wage side but it's not significant yet That's defined in terms of maybe a 1/2 percentage point type of thing But the conclusion that I draw from all this impressionistic data is consistent or compatible at least with my own thoughts and instincts--that the risks are rather asymmetric in the direction of greater pressures on domestic output and resources, at least over the near term On the other hand, it may also be consistent with the view that while the inflation genie isn't perhaps out of the bottle, it's by no means clear that the cork is firmly in place   I think you can tranship them to Dallas   I, too, agree with the prescription you've put on the table I guess I would be more in the Bob Parry camp in terms of what I think the likely pressure points are going to be in the intermeeting period If I could, I'd just like to add a quick comment on the point Governor Kelley and Governor Heller made about the dangers of a recession-induced rise in the budget deficit in the intermediate term That really is pretty ugly in terms of a setting, not just for monetary policy, but more generally But I think that of the things that could produce that result, one of them clearly is a rise in the inflation rate in the shorter term If added inflationary pressure does begin to show through more than it has to date, to be certain that is a recession in the making So if we're really concerned about a recession-induced rise in the budget deficit, that's just double reason why we should be especially sensitive about any further upward movement in the inflation rate   Play your cards right, you can set an all-time record here   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   I think of the issue as quasi- housekeeping but with some substance The point I raised, of course, was that under current arrangements the four rotating Reserve Bank presidents on the Committee who are responsible for the vote to establish the targets for each calendar year at the February meeting rotate off the Committee a couple of weeks later It seemed to me that as a matter of good procedure there was something to be said for changing those dates so that the four rotating Reserve Bank presidents who vote for the annual targets remain on the Committee throughout the calendar year [to which those targets apply] The Committee's General Counsel [Mr Bradfield] has advised that he thinks that such a change can be made within the framework of the statute, and it seems to me, Mr Chairman, that simply as a quasi-housekeeping matter--or to put it differently, a matter of good procedure--that there is some logic to trying to structure things to have that consistency over the calendar year and with the establishment of the annual targets   Well, that is the argument   There is a way you can do that, of course, and that is make it effective a year from now and just mention it almost in passing in your testimony in February that beginning next year we're going to have this procedural change I don't think it matters all that much in terms of--   Sure   Right   Well, it seems to me that this approach, in contrast to what I will call a naive monetarist model, does say something that is both very intuitive and very important What it says is that some given M2 target has different inflationary implications depending upon the amount of slack in the economy, and that is both important and intuitive What's good about this is that it does confirm that intuitive notion in a fairly robust way, to use your term In that sense, it has a great deal of appeal, and it also says something I think rather compelling about what's wrong with the naive monetarist perception of things Now having said that, I guess my judgment as to its utility in a policy context is somewhere along the following lines I would not be willing to go so far as to adopt what I think you're calling a rigid M2 targeting approach simply on the basis of what we see here On the other hand, I do think that it can be useful to the Committee internally in terms of trying to frame our thinking more systematically as to what might constitute reasonable targets over time In that sense, it has some real utility because I'm not ready to jump on the M2 bandwagon to the exclusion of everything else, which will come as no surprise to you   It works   Well, it's not so much necessarily that they expect a change after November 8th   But I do think that there has been a large gut feeling in the market for months that authorities would go to rather extraordinary lengths to prevent the dollar from falling on its face   But also there are comments you get from [unintelligible] that suggest that at least in the market there has been a somewhat marked shift in diversifying assets without [unintelligible] at this point   It's precisely for those reasons that you've got a mess in these circumstances and huge balances out there that have got to be financed [Unintelligible]   Second   So moved   Let me respond to that, Manley   I think, first of all, the two things shouldn't be written together To some extent, the flexible limit of 50 is a straight-forward business decision in terms of how many people the Desk can with some efficiency do business with There's simply no need from a straight-forward business point of view for a group even as large as 50 So, to some extent the 50, flexible 50 if you will, is dictated on straight-forward business grounds rather than any other grounds   Now, the problem is that you will have situations, I think, in which unless you had some notion of some kind of a cap where there is no conceivable set of criteria that wouldn't end up looking overtly discriminatory toward somebody I don't see how you can get from here to there And this point on geographic concentration is not new We have articulated that in various [unintelligible] or another some time ago And what we're really trying to say, at least what I'm trying to say, is that we have a situation right now where in round numbers 15 percent of the market is in effect controlled by foreign firms I have no problem with that In other words, I do think that there is a special point--I don't know where it is and I hope we never get to the point where we have to worry seriously about it--but I think there is a threshold point in the market for US government securities within which one would have problems in substance  And I think that all we're trying to do is to send a signal that says conditions could arise in which we might well conclude that enough is enough As I just said, I don't think we're anywhere near that, but having that principle established is I think a very cautious approach But it's one that we should do because again I can't think of a series of criteria that could be administered even-handedly that could in and of themselves guarantee that that condition might not arise in the future   You still have to worry about acquisitions, though   So move   In terms of the national economy, our guesstimate for the next five quarters really is not materially different from the outlook contained in the Greenbook, although there are some differences in individual sectors The big difference that we continue to have is on the inflation side in that by the end of 1989 our inflation forecast is about 1-1/4 points higher than the Greenbook forecast Now, analytically there are two factors that account for that One is that we have a higher oil price--we have an effective oil price of $15 whereas I think Mike has $13 for the year as a whole And that's about 4/10ths of a percent in our arithmetic; I don't know what it would be in yours But the big, big difference is in the fact that we have the unemployment rate drifting down and you've got it drifting up From where we are, in terms of labor markets, the difference in the algebraic sign makes quite a difference Indeed, if you look through the numbers, by the end of next year with essentially the same productivity numbers we end up with compensation rates and inflation rates that are in underlying terms 8 to 9/10ths of a percent faster than what is in the Greenbook I don't know what to make of that Our year-end unemployment rate is 51 percent; the [Greenbook] staff's is 56 percent One would like to think that a half point couldn't make that much difference, but I think it's quite conceivable that it could Indeed, I think I could even make a case that it could be worse than that  In terms of the question you raised earlier, Mr Chairman, about why hasn't more shown through on the wage side given where we are right now, we were looking at some numbers that really fascinated me yesterday I'm sure, Mike, that you look at these I've just never seen them before But the breakdown it shows for the collective bargaining agreements was--for example, in 1988 if I remember these numbers correctly--that for still 40 percent of individuals covered by agreements reached in 1988, the agreement provided for some kind of a lump sum payment in lieu of, or partially in lieu of, a wage increase And even more astonishingly, 20 percent of the population in 1988 still had no wage increase, but a wage reduction In both cases--if my memory is correct on the numbers, but I think it's close enough-- those numbers of 40 percent and 20 percent respectively are down significantly from where they were in 1984, 1985, and 1986 But I found it surprising they were still as large as they are And I think that in a symbolic way that is part of the answer to your question as to why we don't see more pressure than we've already seen on the wage side Now, how much further that kind of thing could work in our system, I don't know I personally think that the point Frank Morris made about foreign competition is a very big part of it And maybe we'll get lucky in 1989 as well But I would agree with Frank that any way I would cut it that the risks are distinctly on the side of an inflation outcome that is somewhere north of the numbers that are in the Greenbook  -40-    11/1/88  As far as the economy itself is concerned, again the anecdotal comments that we're picking up from directors and others are broadly consistent with the commentary around the table--that things have slowed down a bit from the almost breakneck pace of the late spring and summer But the economy nevertheless is still being characterized as very solid looking into the future I think we are still getting anecdotal comments to the effect that export performance outlook still looks good, although I must say in looking at the economic forecast the one place where I still am a little bit nervous on the downside is in terms of net exports We've got a slower improvement which is understandable, but I don't think that's by any means baked in the cake But all in all, I think that we're pretty lucky in one sense to be where we are And, Mr Boehne, I think that one can look at all of this and easily envision things that could have been a lot, lot more difficult   I support your recommendation   I will   I think I would move it   But to change the $12 billion would take specific action of the Committee?   So moved   So moved   So moved   So move   [Unintelligible] on a hedge   So move   So move   Let me start with a couple of impressionistic or anecdotal comments My sense is that most people in the business community that I talk to associate themselves with the view that there are these straws in the wind that the economy may be settling down a bit But I think it's almost universally true that they would tend to be in the soft landing camp in that I have absolutely no suggestions [from them] of any accumulating downturn or anything even remotely resembling recession or remotely indicative of that There is, I think, especially among major industrial companies, far less conviction today than there was three months ago about the prospective strength of exports Some of that is exchange-rate related but, seemingly, a lot of it is not simply a reflection of exchange rates; there's a combination of capacity constraints and other considerations as well But certainly there is less conviction about the near-term strength of exports than has been the case Even  has changed his tune, Alan, quite perceptibly  The anecdotal material on the inflation side is, frankly, a bit sour right now Virtually all companies--small and large--that we've talked to in the recent past do point to both labor and nonlabor cost pressures And consistent with Gary's comment [they report] less difficulty in passing costs through I don't think I would characterize these impressions as symptomatic of a 1979-80 type outburst of inflation Nevertheless, I think the perception is there that the pressure is greater One little tiny vignette that's germane our small business and agricultural advisory committee members were talking last week--and this really shocked all of us, I think--about wage increases as high as 9 and 10 percent Presumably, because these are small companies these are not wage increases as much as they are increases in hiring rates In other words, when they lose employees they have to go out into the marketplace and replace them And I think the thrust of their comment was that, in at least some cases, replacement rates are now 9 or 10 percent above prevailing rates for existing employees So it's not a wage increase in the usual sense of the term but I think it is symptomatic of quite tight labor markets throughout the District, including most of upstate New York at this point  The other impression that I pick up an awful lot lately--and I think it's just worth repeating--is an almost universal skepticism, bordering on cynicism, about the outlook for budget deficit reduction plans, as they may or may not emerge over the weeks ahead Again, it doesn't matter whether you're talking to small businesses, big businesses, upstate, or downstate There really is a growing concern that nothing seems to be happening Whether the Administration's quiet diplomacy will produce something is another question But I think it is a matter of increasing concern  As far as the forecasts are concerned, the New York staff forecast for 1989 in terms of GNP, real GNP, and indeed almost all the components of GNP, is virtually identical with the Board staff's forecast The only major difference we continue to have is on the inflation side Depending upon which index you look at, our inflation rates are a half--   I'm sorry The only material difference in our staff forecast versus the Board staff's forecast is on inflation That has narrowed a bit but we still have inflation rates in 1989--depending upon which index you look at--that are 1/2 to 3/4 of a point above the Board staff's forecast That still seems to reflect, primarily, a different view on markups Mike's forecast still has a small negative spread between, say, the deflator and unit labor costs and ours continues to have a small positive spread But when you add the two of them together it comes out to 3/4 of a point difference on the high side in our forecast In 1990, for whatever weight one wants to put on a 1990 forecast, there's a fairly sharp difference between the Board staff's forecast and ours We don't have as much of a slowdown in domestic demand as they do And we have the external adjustment process essentially flattening out and indeed deteriorating a little So there's a quite a sharp difference in 1990 I don't put any more weight on those forecasts than Ted Truman does, but to get back to the point the Chairman raised earlier-- whether you take the staff's forecast or our forecast for '89 and '90 on the external side--both imply an increase in US net external liabilities in balance sheet terms of about $275 billion for the two years combined And I must say as an intermediate- or medium-term policy problem I am getting more and more concerned about the implications of anything even resembling that kind of a result for the two years running  With regard to the near-term growth prospects in the economy, my sense of things, Mr Chairman, is that under the best of circumstances the near-term inflation numbers are going to be bad And if the economy is simply pausing rather than trending down they could be terrible So an awful lot does ride on the question of how much weight one should give to these signs, however tentative or firm one may think they are, as to the near-term course of the economy Just one last point on the price side Mike and Ted talked a fair bit about oil prices and Governor Angell will probably talk a bit about commodity prices But one thing I did notice in looking at commodities is that stocks of a very wide range of agricultural and industrial crude materials are at quite low levels right now I'd simply observe that if we don't get some rain in some parts of the country pretty soon that could further complicate the near-term outlook on the price front   Well, as you know Mr Chairman, I blow hot and cold on this, to put it mildly I probably have changed my mind about what is the right thing to do about once every hour for the past two weeks I clearly think that we've got to maintain a tilt toward firmness; indeed, I think my preference would actually be to come out somewhere between "B" and "C" right now Let me just elaborate on two basic reasons as to why that's where my preference lies The first is, as I've said before, that it seems to me we have a period immediately in front of us just about baked in the cake in which the price statistics are going to tend to be on the bad side I think that's kind of locked in By "bad" I don't mean anything like those January-February PPI numbers but something in the range of 5 percent or higher Again, if our forecast and our hunches about soft landings prove to be right then we could get lucky On the other hand, if our forecast and hunches about soft landings are wrong and we have a pause rather than a slowdown then I think we have real trouble, which is another way of saying that I still think the risks are distinctly asymmetric  I have another concern that reinforces my tilt [preference] And that is, notwithstanding Don Kohn's Chart 7--which I agree is pretty impressive to look at--I still worry that the changes in the financial system and structure may well have produced a situation in which it takes a higher level of both nominal and real interest rates to get the same degree of restraint that might have been associated with that nice neat relationship in Chart 7 And that leads me to a couple of things First of all, as we look around right now there is no evidence that I can see of any credit availability problems There's plenty of credit there That shouldn't surprise us, given all the structural changes in the financial system and so on But what it means, of course--and Ted Truman touched on this--is that one way or another restraint has to come through price effects Price effects either mean the exchange rate--and if they are the exchange rate that complicates immensely that medium-term problem I spoke of earlier this morning--or they have to be one way or another through interest rates But what I'm not so sure about is how much we know today about the way the interest mechanism itself works For example, take the consumer sector it's unambiguously clear that rising interest rates have a net positive impact on personal income even after you take account of floating rate mortgages and home equity loans Now, that itself doesn't tell you too much; you then have to make a lot of judgments about relative propensities to consume But it's unambiguous in terms of its cash flow effect on the consumer sector as a whole  -36-    3/28/89   That's true That's what they are right now But on the other hand, the business sector clearly is hurt more in cash flow terms by rising interest rates than it once was And we get the anomalous effect that at least in cash flow terms the effects of rising interest rates are more of a problem in the place where we need spending activity rather than in the consumer sector where it should go the other way Just as another illustration of this financial engineering, we're now all familiar with the swap market but we now have emerging markets in interest rate caps, collars, and floors And this market, which is only a couple of years old, we know to be $300 billion in size and we think it is probably $500 billion in size This market didn't even exist three years ago! And as a reflection of the way that market has been working in recent months, the open interest in Euro-dollar futures contracts in Chicago is now up to $760 billion Now, I just don't know myself how all these things interact in terms of the way monetary restraint works itself into the system by interest rate channels But my hunch is that, if anything, it probably works to slow it down rather than speed it up And that's the second reason why I have that tilt Having said that my preference would lie between "B" and "C" right now, I guess I can go along with your formulation in the spirit of Bob Parry's earlier comments   That's for sure   As in M1A?   I'll second   Second   Second   Yes   I had a brief postscript, Mr Chairman I didn't want to confuse the discussion further I just  the    5/16/89  wanted to say, after Bob Heller's comments, that we're sitting here today discussing this in the context of concern about a strong dollar I still fear the day will come when we'll be sitting here looking at this question from a very different perspective I would simply like to add that quickly to the discussion   Well, Mr Chairman, I am encouraged by recent business statistics and recent business developments in that they suggest the kind of adjustment that I thought was needed It's also true that, broadly speaking, the statistics and the anecdotal comments we get from business people are more or less compatible with each other, which isn't always the case The one exception to that may be a bit more concern on the anecdotal side about near-term inflationary prospects But like Ed Boehne, when I look out at the profile over the next six or seven quarters, in some ways I conclude that it is indeed about as good as one could hope for On the question of risks, I'm still impressed on balance with the resiliency of the economy Far more often than not the surprises tend to be on the plus side rather than on the negative side And I guess that's where I would hedge my bets  Having said that the outlook in Mike's forecast in some ways is about as good as one can hope for, I think it's worthwhile to then ask Where does that leave us? What does it look like out there at the end of 1990--keeping in mind that these point estimates are not worth a darn? Nevertheless, where are we by the end of 1990? Well, even in Mike's forecast the underlying inflation rate is still 5 percent, maybe a shade higher The external situation is terrible In the staff forecast the current account deficit in the fourth quarter of 1990 is $135 billion; in our forecast it's more like $155 billion I would stipulate that if that combination of numbers is anything near right the economy at the end of 1990, if not sooner, will be a good deal more vulnerable in many respects than it is right now In addition to the kind of recession--financial and other types of things--one thing I'm quite sure of is that the protectionist problem will be a heck of a lot greater if we get out that far and we're still looking at external imbalances of the type that are built into the forecast  Then I start to ask myself the questions What's going to change that? What might produce a better result than those 1990 point estimates? And I start to go down the list US fiscal policy, not likely; US monetary policy, well, which way? Do we want to ease monetary policy? That might help stimulate domestic demand a bit but that's going to hurt on the trade side It might help net exports a little but that will be offset partly in terms of domestic demand And both are going to be inflationary So, I don't see much help there We could tighten US monetary policy, but that's going to make the dollar go up, among other things, and I don't see much help there If you look to foreigners, there's very little excess capacity abroad for the industrialized countries, so we're not going to see much there Indeed, while they may tighten monetary policy for domestic price inflation reasons, that in turn is going to restrict the growth in their own domestic demand, which in turn is going to hurt in terms of the adjustment in trade and exports from the US point of view In short, I don't think you can fix it either way with the exchange rate And I think there are great risks on both sides of that, especially in a context in which the protectionist problem is likely to get worse, not better That's a long-winded way of saying that I don't mind at all running the risk prospectively that the economy will slow; indeed, I wouldn't even care if it slowed a bit more than Mike's forecast as long as I do not see signs of a recession, which I do not see right now    5/16/89   "B;" $600 million; symmetric I wouldn't dare try to add to the nuances of this   I'm not sure about that, because I have a potential real problem here   No My definition of unchanged policy from a market perspective is that the market views that policy as the funds rate in the 9-3/4 to 9-7/8 percent area   Yes, but there has been some effort to try to define that at 9-3/4 percent I promised not to get into the semantics of this but at that point it's more than semantics to me   That I can--   That can be dealt with and finessed But that's not--okay   6 to 12 percent   No   I think a lot would depend upon why the market thought interest rates were going down Just to take two contrasting possibilities If the market really thought that the underlying rate of inflation was coming down, and interest rates were coming down in response to that, that would be one thing On the other hand, if the market felt the economy was ready to fall out of bed and interest rates were coming down because of that, I think you'd get quite a different [slide] It really does depend very much on perceptions as to why   Probably not  SPEAKER(?) Give us two years   Si, this is still an important lever in the overall process We had a meeting--about 10 days ago, Ted?-- when most of the ducks were in a row in terms of this deal being done But there are about 4 or 5 categories of things that have to be locked up, several of which are very difficult, by August 30th There will be another meeting--the "lock-up meeting" either next week or the day after Labor Day, I'm not sure which yet What we have said to both parties is that the official bridge will be activated and disbursed only when these other things are done, mainly that all of the detail is agreed to by both parties I think the issue here is trying to keep as much pressure [as possible] on the process And I think Ted's suggestion, the Chairman's suggestion, and Governor Angell's are all compatible with that, in that you authorize it but you don't give the impression that it's an absolute done deal You keep the trump card in the Chairman's pocket That's the rationale   Then we will have looked good not to have disbursed it, anyway   Second   It's a long way off  END OF MEETING  -48-       In my judgment, if we have external debt of 40 percent of GNP we're in real trouble   It's transferred   Well, I guess I start out where a lot of other people do but I'm not sure I end up where others do Certainly, I would agree that if one could take a snapshot of the first half of this year, especially after the revisions are all in, one would be very tempted to declare a victory and go home One might even be tempted to do that looking at the staff forecast Obviously, most forecasts that are being talked about are within striking distance of that one But that forecast is for real GNP growth of 2 percent or so stretching out as far as the eye can see and an underlying inflation forecast of 5 percent or so stretching out as far as the eye can see Even when Mike gets around to [forecasting] 1991, I think we'll probably still have something that looks like that When I think about that kind of an outlook I have to say that it's probably as good as we can do So it doesn't trouble me But on the other hand, I say to myself Well, how reasonable is it to think that things can just roll on in that fashion in perpetuity? I guess that's where I get into trouble I just don't think we can either be that good or that lucky Indeed, even right now I would say that the risks in the forecast are reasonably well balanced to the symmetric, but I don't draw as much comfort from that as I think some do There is one  -32-    8/22/89  risk that could be quite transitory but quite troubling and that is that we might get a spurt in consumer spending in the second half of the year over and above the little spurt that Mike has I don't think that's at all beyond the realm of possibility But if that did happen, I think it could really throw some other things out of kilter  On the other side, I can at this point see signs of potential weakness in the economy that are more troubling to me We've talked about exports a lot Another area is construction In part, the closer we are to the reality of the thrift industry liquidations and the tremendous overhang that will produce in real estate markets--not just in the Southeast or Southwest, but nationally--that seems to me more of a concern than it has been in the past I hear comments around the table and I see in New York City commercial construction going ahead pell mell in a context in which vacancy rates, at least in Manhattan, are now higher than they have been in 25 years I suspect, Si, that Chicago must be about in the same position by this point, though maybe not quite that bad In the Northeast, housing prices still are rising like gangbusters But the stock of unsold new and used homes is rising very rapidly too And those two things are just obviously incompatible with one another The irony of it is that in this construction area--whether it's commercial, the thrift overhang, or even residential in the Northeast--the problem ultimately is not that interest rates have been too high; if anything, the problem is that they have been too low A lot of this construction really is excessive overbuilding, speculation--all the seeds of real problems down the road Martha, I think, mentioned this corporate cash flow problem If you look at the profile of corporate cash flow out to late 1990 into early 1991 there is a profound change there in terms of the relative capacity of the corporate sector to finance itself internally versus externally My hunch is that even the numbers we have don't really yet take account of all the implications of these highly leveraged transactions, which are starting to look worse too There again, the problem is excesses rather than interest rates being in any sense too high So, there are a lot of things that bother me in terms of the real economy, even though on balance I would regard the risks as reasonably well balanced in the context of that steady- state 2 percent--except that I don't think it's going to happen  Now, on inflation--and this is where I guess I differ with a lot of the views around the table--I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel I would agree that the data through the first half of the year are compatible with the notion that the inflation rate probably has stopped rising But I'm not even sure of that When I look at the inflation outlook I tend to focus very heavily on the [unintelligible] compensation, the productivity mixes, and what can go wrong there I think the risks are quite asymmetric there; the risk is that, if anything, the compensation numbers may tend to be on the high side and the productivity numbers on the low side, in a context in which the staff forecast continues to have a negative spread between unit labor costs and the GNP deflator On wages, just as one example If you look at the data on collective bargaining agreements where there have been either freezes or declines in wages in the first year or concessions on COLAs and other fringe benefits, there is a huge, huge change in terms of what we've seen in the first half of this year versus what we were seeing in the mid-1980s In the mid- 1980s up through 1987 the percentage of workers that either had frozen wages, declining wages, or givebacks of one kind or another were  -33-    8/22/89  running [unintelligible] Based on the first half of this year they are running somewhere in the range of 6 to 10 percent Now, that too may turn out to be an aberration; but it does say to me that it is premature to declare victory in terms of the wage and compensation situation So, I'm really in an uncomfortable position, despite the fact that I think the first half looks terrific and the forecast looks great I think the probabilities are rising that we're not going to get that nice, neat outcome And it's easier for me today to see some things that might develop--whether it's next year or even 1991--that are quite troubling But right at this precise moment it looks great   I'm sorry, Roger, I didn't hear the beginning Where did you come out on the symmetry?   I prefer "B" symmetric, as well, although I accept the fact that we will do what we have to do in any event I'm not terribly worried about that But I guess I'm just not as confident as the majority of the Committee seems to be about the very near-term outlook I think there is a possibility--not a likelihood but a possibility--that over the next couple of months the economy could be stronger rather than weaker And what I really worry about is that therein lies the problem for 1990 That's really why I would prefer to be symmetric   Well, I accept that But of all the ugly things that we could think about that one gets pretty ugly   As I say, I don't think it's the likely case  -45-    8/22/89   It worries me   Well, I can accept that   Second   You're shooting the messenger here, Governor Johnson! [Laughter]   A couple of points first of all, there's absolutely no question that a perception--whether it's reality or not--that the central bank is trying to beat down the dollar is a very, very dangerous thing; we would all agree with that What may not be agreed to or perhaps understood is the amount of effort that has gone into trying to minimize the kinds of problems that could arise in the current circumstances both with our own Treasury and elsewhere Maybe that hasn't been pristine pure or perfect in its execution but I think the thrust of the effort has been in that vein But, again, the real question is the one that Ed Boehne started to ask and the real debate, it seems to me, should be on the threshold question of where we are Obviously, Governor Johnson says in effect there are no imbalances That isn't quite what you said but it's--   I think that is really where the debate should lie I don't think it's a question of intervention tactics per se I think the real issue is the implications over time for where we are and where we are going with regard to the global economy and our national economy In terms of some of the attitudes that go into this kind of convoluted point we're at, there are very sharp differences of opinion about the implications of the current situation and the outlook for the world economy   I don't think that's the question here   I agree that is the key issue but the question is Are those goals compatible in any reasonable sense over even a 5-year period?    10/3/89   Manley, I think what we have to try to do is what the Chairman has been trying to do at one level and Sam and Ted [have been trying to do at their levels] If you really want the worst scenario that we're all so terrified of, I'll tell you how you get it That would be to advocate this and then have our 40 percent taken away so it's nothing And then you would have your green eye shade guy running the shop   It's not   No, that's not the scenario   The point is that there is that danger; it raises the specter of what a fight will alter That is the way this plays out And if it's precisely that, that could precipitate the collapse in the dollar and the rout in the bond markets and the stock markets That's what I think we have to be so careful of   But that's a different debate   That's a different debate; that gets to the heart of the question of how do you get from here to there It seems to me that's a different issue   The problem is we don't have any coordinated policy We've got a lousy fiscal policy and a pretty good monetary policy That's at the heart of the problem   That is a different issue The question in terms of the price stability goal is How do you get from here to there? There are a lot of variables that go into that question of how you get from 4-1/2 percent inflation to 0 inflation   Well?   That's the debate; that's the right issue How do you get from here to there?   The problem there though, Roger, is that you give the Congress a choice If you really do say you are going to give the Treasury some more money or you are going to balance the budget, which way do you think they're going to go?   Can I make the last comment?   I want to come back to this price stability issue Obviously, that is the overriding goal for central banks But I think we have to be a little careful about how we articulate that goal If we articulate it in a way that creates or reinforces the perception that we can get from here to there in a costless, painless, way I think that can be very, very dangerous And it's in that context that I worry about large current account deficits I certainly don't view them as a goal, as I'm sure you know, Manley   The question--if I can just finish-- is whether the presence of current account deficits in excess of $100 billion in perpetuity are compatible with an orderly and relatively painless ability to reach that goal of price stability   That's a different question   It's not   The analogy, I think, is that any time someone dissented on monetary policy grounds they would have to dissent on Mr Sternlight's operations  SPEAKER(?) It says "ratified"   Mr Chairman, could I raise another question before we formally adjourn?   I wonder what the sentiment around the table might be, looking forward to our next meeting, to ask Mr Prell and Mr Truman and Mr Kohn and others to do a special presentation for the Committee where we would take a look at this question of price stability in five years in some systematic way I'm not suggesting a forecast but alternative scenarios, problems, obstacles, and costs, so that we could really get a systematic feel of what kinds of problems would be involved in that kind of underlying policy goal I don't think--   Well, putting aside this other view, I don't want to prejudge the letter   We have to deal with that But quite apart from that, I really think that we ought to put this exercise under a microscope so we really have a--  SPEAKER(?) Well, this is something [unintelligible]   Well, I'm just trying to formalize that  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I agree   That's why I want to look at it   What you want to do--   [Even] over five years there are going to be costs   Well, I think he would say that   Well, in terms of the near-term outlook I'd be in the moderate but steady camp that somebody--I guess Dick Syron--mentioned As I said to you this morning, there is some evidence of a lessening in prices for some raw materials and intermediate goods and even some evidence of modest improvement in availability of deliveries But all-in-all as I look at the current situation, my bottom line is that I fear it will be weaker and my instinct is that it will be stronger Therefore, I think it's about balanced But let me take up a further [unintelligible] in terms of the intermediate-term outlook The staff has taken the forecast in the Greenbook through the end of 1991 and I think what the staff is saying is very, very revealing You may not like it, but I think it is probably the most exhaustive and professional insight that you can get What does it say? It says 2 percent growth for three years running; the unemployment rate rising to 6 percent; the saving rate falling again to 5 percent; the CPI with or without food or energy stuck in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range; compensation per man hour stuck  -33-    10/3/89  at 5 percent; the fiscal deficit still over $100 billion; and the trade and current account deficits at the end of 1991, even with some depreciation, still around $100 billion Net external liabilities at the end of '91 are going to be $1 trillion and portfolio net income flows are going to be minus $50-odd billion It seems to me that what you get out of that is an intermediate-term outlook that I consider to be in some ways as good as you can expect but in other ways very, very risky and dangerous It tells me, as we all know, that we have an absolutely lousy policy mix in this country It tells me that there are great risks of a renewal of protectionist attitudes in this country It tells me that there are risks even in terms of the ability of this country to provide leadership And it certainly tells me that there are very grave risks in the economic outlook in terms of growth, inflation, and the exchange rate I think the exchange rate risk over time is clearly on the down side That's one of the reasons why, though I may not agree with the analysis, I certainly agree with the stated concerns about the dangers of beating up on the dollar But I don't consider this three-year outlook anything but trouble looking for a place to happen somehow or other   I'm comfortable with alternative B I guess I prefer symmetric but since we have asymmetric, that's fine-- just leave it there I would come out there pretty much on the grounds of my own assessment of the domestic economy, although the exchange rate situation makes it a bit more compelling I would note, Mr Chairman, tongue somewhat in cheek, that I'm not prepared to make this argument, but much of the earlier discussion today would not be incompatible with tightening monetary policy   A whole variety of things the dollar, price stability, making room for export growth You could make a pretty good argument based on the discussion around this table that we should be tightening policy I'm not prepared to make it   Second   So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   What you're saying I think has to be true   So moved    11/14/89   Second   Second   Second   What's the timing going to be?   I think for the sake of the items [on the agenda] we ought to start at 1230 pm; we better start earlier than 300 pm  -34-    11/14/89   Earlier than 300 pm on Monday   That's what I mean It seems to me that we really should be prepared to devote a good solid chunk of time to these issues I would suggest starting much earlier than usual; I don't know about people's travel  SPEAKER(?) How about 100 pm?   No, have lunch at 1200 noon and start work at 100 pm  SPEAKER(?) That's good   As far as the forecast, our bank staff forecast is still slightly stronger than Mike's forecast, as it has been for some time, but the differences are hardly statistically significant And again, as it has been for some time, our inflation forecast is slightly higher Leaving aside the technicalities of the forecast it does seem to me that the two major areas of uncertainty are capital goods and exports And, of course, they're both related; they both get right to these questions that have been raised about the manufacturing sector The point that Gary Stern made about keeping that in some perspective is very valid I am a little more agnostic than some are in terms of trying to explain to my own satisfaction what is going on in the manufacturing sector and its possible implications for the economy at large For example, I have a very, very hard time accepting the view that anything along the lines of the current level of either nominal or real interest rates should be capable of triggering a significant cumulative decline in the economy Indeed, I'm not even sure myself--and I have not been for some time-- how much of the slowing in the so-called interest sensitive sectors of the economy is really due to interest rates anyway, especially in a    11/14/89  context in which the underlying prices of things like cars and houses and so on have been going up rather sharply, at least until recently  I'm also a little perplexed by the exchange rate arguments Certainly, as Mike or Ted said earlier, it's true that the exchange rate we are seeing is one that is a good deal stronger than was built into the forecast going back, say, nine months ago or something like that But there too it seems to me that at least part of that stronger exchange rate is being offset by a stronger growth abroad than was being thought about early in this year It seems to me that in the context of this uncertainty about net exports, and exports in particular, the current exchange rate in the face of the growth patterns that we're seeing in the rest of the industrialized world should be compatible with continued quite respectable growth in exports Indeed, I'm beginning to worry that if that's not the case then something may be more seriously wrong than we think in terms of competitiveness or something I can't quite bring myself to the view that even the current exchange rate, in the face of the very strong growth abroad, should not yield quite a respectable continued growth in net exports  Now, the inflation situation I see as a Catch-22 in that I find it difficult to get too caught up in the inflationary prospects so long as the broad measures of wages and compensation are behaving the way they are Indeed, if you look at our forecast and the Board staff's forecast, both now have unit labor costs growing faster than the deflator in a context in which, as Governor Johnson has pointed out, this profit squeeze is already very sharp I don't see how you get any relief from that until you see the wage and compensation costs turn down One of the worries I have is that if you build from where we are in terms of profits and profits as a share of GNP, what a period of four or five or six or seven quarters with a negative spread between unit labor costs and the deflator implies for profits raises some pretty serious questions in my mind about the implications for stock prices The last point I would make, which is germane to these issues about manufacturing and the profits squeeze and exports, is that for the first three quarters of this year--if I remember the statistics right--the rate of net private investment for the economy as a whole is now down to 47 percent of GNP And that is a very, very low number And how we're going to get out from underneath a variety of these problems and get the productivity kicks that can really help us with this inflation problem with an investment rate of 47 percent of GNP is a real question   I know that's what it's called   Asymmetric prime   "B" asymmetric is acceptable to me But I do want to associate myself with those who are suggesting a need for great caution at this point   Move it   One of the things that the Drexel case shows is that if there are serious problems in one part of the firm, those problems cannot be isolated from the rest of the firm In that case, even though the primary dealer that we do business with had capital in excess of regulatory guidelines and all the rest of it, once the name of the firm was so badly tarnished, people wouldn't do business with the government security firm even in a context of book entry transactions in government securities So you can't fully isolate or insulate the primary dealer from the affairs of the firm as a whole    3/27/90  But if we ever have a need to raise a concern about the affairs of a firm as a whole, we always do it in very close collaboration with the SEC We go to extraordinary lengths in all of these types of issues through the day-to-day, at times hour-to-hour, very close if not intimate, working relationship with the SEC The SEC is always center stage Again, in the case of this company, it also happens to be true that some of the most serious problems that were encountered once the chute went up happened to be in entities that were not regulated by the SEC at all So both we and the SEC had the problem of these unregulated entities being the focal point of some of the greatest sources of tension as they applied to markets generally But, Governor Seger, we do try to maintain what we loosely think of as a fit-and-proper standard that's built into the written, published guidelines for primary dealers What it essentially tries to say is that we recognize that even where, as in this case, the business entity that we're doing business with is fine--indeed, this was a good government securities dealer--if the rest of the firm gets into deep trouble, no matter how good the entity is that we're doing business with and even though it may be a business entity to itself, it will be contaminated by the problems of the rest of the firm And that, of course, is precisely what happened We try to walk that fine line, and there is no case where we would make the point about any other aspect of the firm without close consultation and collaboration with the SEC   We would never say anything about whether a firm should be doing junk bond financing or not We might make a comment, as we did in this case, about the overall liquidity of the firm--about the ability of the firm to meet its obligations in the event of adversity And we might stress, as we did, that they ought to be thinking seriously about how they would respond to problems But we would never say they should or shouldn't do this or that We would always be very, very general If we thought something specific needed to be said we would call Mr Ketchum or Mr Breeden or somebody [else at the SEC] and say "Look, you ought to be aware of this" We were the ones that first called to the attention of the SEC the fact that the excess capital was being taken out of the broker dealer We never told them what they should do about it, but we certainly informed them of it; and it was up to them what they did about it   Right   That's correct Oh, sure   Technically, I don't think we have legal authority I think it grows out of--   Oh, sure   It's a very fine line We agonized in the period after Drexel had pleaded guilty under what the US attorney [unintelligible] and had entered into this agreement with the SEC There was just no question that the government securities entity itself had nothing to do with all these problems And we agonized about the kind of point that Governor Johnson is making Should we, on the basis of general fit-and-proper standards, terminate in a public way our relationship with the firm? As I said, we talked about it at great length and finally decided that doing that in a public way, given all that was going on, probably in and of itself would have produced the immediate demise of the firm as a whole So what we did, in effect, was put them on a formal probation We put them on notice that if they failed to live up to all of the commitments they had made to the US attorney and to the SEC, we would publicly stop doing business with them But it was one of those very tough calls on an issue; I think in retrospect our instincts were right Had we just overtly, publicly, stopped doing business with them instead of privately putting them on notice and putting them on probation, it's now very clear to me that that action, had we taken it, would have caused the demise of the firm; it was that tender Now, it happened anyway I must say I would rather that it happened the way it did than as a result of some overt action on our part   It's still hard to tell   One of the problems, too, in terms of what may be left is that you have to take the common things like their leasehold obligations Their leasehold obligations, believe it or not, are in the area of $11 million a month   And there are a lot of leases   Well, you do hear it in real estate   Second   But the issue shouldn't swing on that question   First of all, I very much agree with Ed Boehne I think we have to be pragmatic about these matters It's quite clear that every central banker that is worth his salt, regardless of country of origin, is going to want a strong currency And that covers even [unintelligible] But against that backdrop and the immediately past history, I would go even a step further, Ed, in the distinctions that you made There are intervention activities that are aimed at countering disorderly markets in the historical context of that word There are intervention activities that may aim at trying to check what seems to be an unsustainable rise in currency x But then there are also intervention activities that are at least perceived as seeking to beat down your own currency I think in the immediate past a lot of the tension, not just between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury but between nations--including both central banks and finance ministries--really has focused on that point Indeed, I think much of the dissatisfaction around this table has been targeted at that point ie, intervention tactics or strategies that seem to have as their sole purpose stomping on our own currency So, that is a third distinction that I think is useful in trying to put these issues in perspective   I was going to get to that issue in a minute   Given the kind of institutional background that we operate in, it seems to me that with respect to the distinction I tried to draw as to the motivation for intervention in the first place, the first kind of troublesome threshold we all come  -57-    3/27/90  up against is this debate as to whether intervention works Indeed, there are very sharp differences of opinion even around this table Some people are against intervention because they say it doesn't work and other people are against it because they say it does work I don't see quite how you square that circle Then, you look at the great body of empirical analysis, some of which was summarized in Paper 11 That paper seems to say that it's pretty hard to find evidence that it does work I have to say that I'm a little agnostic on that point And I want to try to make the point that my agnosticism does not grow out of my place of origin, Liberty Street I've asked my people to look at this question for me in some detail and I was very scrupulous I asked some of the old timers like Dick Davis to look at it knowing their institutional biases; but I asked some people whose roots actually are here, like Bonnie Loopesko, to look at it And they both tell me the same thing What they say, basically, is that while maybe you can't draw a clear conclusion that intervention works, you can't draw one that it doesn't work Moreover, they make the point that there is also a non-empirical foundation that tells us what determines exchange rates in the first place--whether intervention does or doesn't [work] or whether anything does or doesn't [work] So, I think one has to have at least a healthy element of skepticism or agnosticism in terms of drawing sweeping conclusions on that threshold point  My own view is not unlike Governor Johnson's in that intuitively I think it can work at least in the short run And because it can work I think we should treat it as though it does work Now, in that setting, the questions about profits and losses, opportunity costs, size of portfolio, and amount of balances in some sense are secondary We can find ways, I think, to deal with those But it does seem to me that the threshold questions are What role should this institution play in the process, if any? And in addressing that question, it's important to keep in mind that for most of this decade we essentially have been operating with a currency that has been strong rather than weak But it wasn't that long ago--the latter part of the previous decade--when things were distinctly the other way around And we went hat in hand to the rest of the world asking them to help defend our currency Now, whether that worked or not, whether it was an expedient or not, or whether we were short- sighted or not as a nation, is beside the point That's what we did And there is no guarantee that we might not have to face those circumstances again at some point in the future So, I think that in itself is a reason not to throw the proverbial baby out with the bath water  As I see it, the biggest danger with intervention--whether it's done by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury or both--is the danger that it can ultimately co-opt monetary policy That, I think, is the ultimate risk And that has a bearing on this question of whether we should be a part of the process or not To me, the danger of co-opting monetary policy in some underlying sense is greater when we're out of the picture than when we're in the picture I think it transcends the question of whether the Chairman with his considerable persuasive powers, or Mr Cross and Mr Truman with their persuasive powers, can browbeat the Undersecretary or the Secretary of the Treasury into a more sensible position day-by-day It's much more fundamental than that And I think that alone is more than a sufficient reason why the Federal Reserve should maintain a  -58-    3/27/90  continuing, active, involved posture and presence in these matters I also think that our international relationships lead to the same conclusion We may think we'll scare the heck out of the Treasury by telling them we aren't going to play, but if the world at large-- including our sister central banks--felt that that was our attitude, it would scare the heck out of them too That in itself might produce precisely the problem that we're most interested in avoiding, and that is a weak currency rather than a strong currency   If the international community of central banks thought that the Federal Reserve was throwing in the towel and leaving this whole business to the Treasury, I don't think they'd be very happy As a matter of fact, I don't think the international financial community would be very happy   For now they might be, but I don't think that the perception that the Federal Reserve was jumping ship on the process would be well received   Well, I think he probably would   Well, I concede that we--   I concede that, especially in the case of 1978 policies in general, we probably were short-sighted But I don't think things are quite that one dimensional Again, in the immediate circumstance, would it be a good thing, unambiguously good, if the yen [fell] from 157 to 200? It's not at all clear to me that that is unambiguously good   And with those circumstances, it seems to me that we have a constructive role to play in terms of--   Well, let me just finish here I'll come back to that The point I was making was on the threshold question of whether we as an institution should maintain a meaningful presence in this arena I'm suggesting that we should And the last reason I cited as to why I thought we should was not just for fear of loss of monetary policy autonomy in a domestic context, but that it would not be well received by the world at large if they literally felt that we had jumped ship on the process Indeed, I for one could not [imagine] asking the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to go off to a G-7 meeting next Saturday with his hands tied squarely behind his back I don't think that's in the interest of the Federal Reserve; I don't think it's in the interest of the United States of America; and I don't think it's in the interest of the well being of the world economy So, the threshold question I'm trying to address is Are we in or are we out? And in my judgment we're far better off in   The threshold question is Are we in or out? You know where I come out on that Then we get to the question of procedures, the question of tactics, the question of portfolios and so on Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have some sympathy with what Ed Boehne said that there probably is room for some more systematic procedures at the Committee level to try and help members' comfort levels with what we're doing But even there, at the end of the day I think the Chairman in particular has to have an appropriate degree of flexibility And I'm not quite sure, Ed, how you square the circle in terms of what I interpreted your suggestion to be Now, whether it means there should be a more systematic review or reports after the fact of G-7 meetings and other things like that or whether--and I personally hope not--we have to go so far as having a directive that mirrors the domestic directive, I'm not sure But if you're saying, Manley, that we ought to have some better mousetraps within a context along the broad lines that I think we're all talking about, I don't have any problem with that   The problem with that is none of us can anticipate what the Chairman is going to run into at one of those meetings   You cannot anticipate that   In those circumstances, you're painting a picture not unlike what was true in the United States here in the late 1970s We were unable or unwilling to face up to our problems Now, that's going to break at some point But in those precise circumstances that you described, if you asked me whether I would be willing to support modest intervention in the context in which the dollar is rising in a major way, I'd say "Sure" I wouldn't have any trouble with that I would have no illusions about what it was doing but if it was doing nothing more than keeping us in the ballgame in terms of having some influence on the fundamental ways that these problems ultimately were to kick out, I'd say that's a small price to pay   I would not support that   You have Roger [Guffey]   Well, I think the danger of the Treasury getting us into entangling alliances through G-7 type mechanisms escalates in a circumstance in which the rest of the world thinks we're on the sidelines So, there's that danger first of all Second, I do agree with the Chairman that any form of intervention can be sterilized But I think Governor Johnson's problem and Lee Hoskins' problem--about the markets interpreting what the policy of the United States government is--gets greatly heightened in those circumstances Even now, quite apart from the dollar situation, there's this drift in newspapers and elsewhere about the Administration wanting the Fed to ease Now, that's enough of a problem in and of itself But if that same problem surfaced in a context in which the markets knew that we had gone on vacation insofar as exchange rate policy is concerned and in effect had abdicated to the Treasury, I think those concerns would be amplified in a very significant way both internationally and domestically So, while I agree that even the Treasury's intervention can be sterilized by us, I think the psychology of the marketplace changes in a way that is very detrimental to the interest of good monetary policy in a context in which we simply decide we're going on vacation   But even there the Congress still holds the deck   That's right   There's no danger of that happening   In terms of Tom Melzer's question, just based on discussions that I know you've had and one that I've had, the Treasury--or at least the Secretary of the Treasury--knows full well about both the policy and philosophical views that are at this table Now, they may not know that we have this big fat book in front of us There's no danger--zero--that they would misconstrue what the Chairman would be saying to them; no danger of that at all   I don't think they'd push it at that   Is your concern about the $45 billion the risk of loss or is it something other than that?   There's a chart or table--I forget which--in one of the many studies here that indicates, for what it's worth, that our foreign currency balances relative to our sister central banks are really quite small   We can [unintelligible] it now   I will make the motion   I'll move it   I think the tone of the business situation is better, judged at least by the decibel [level] currently of people who in preceding months were concerned that the economy was really going to go off the edge I think part of that simply is a reflection of the view that, at least statistically, both the fourth quarter and the first quarter are probably going to turn out better than a lot of people expected If you recall, it wasn't that long ago when it was quite possible to find a lot of people who were expecting a negative real GNP number in either the fourth or the first quarter or both And that is no longer the case   Yes, I know   Looking at the components, I think part of the improvement in the tone of the business situation that I detect is rightly characterized as the collective breathing of a sigh of relief Now, how much better the situation is in underlying terms is a little tougher to tell But my sense is that it probably is better in underlying terms as well Some of the comments around the table are consistent with that For example, Si Keehn talks about sales of 14-1/2 million trucks and cars, and that's not a bad year That's a lot Even before the meeting today I thought there were two sectors of the economy that at the margin could make quite a difference and those are agriculture and energy I find it  -31-    3/27/90  interesting that Roger and Si and Bob Forrestal and Bob Boykin are suggesting that conditions in those two industries, even outside of the Southwest in the energy area, show a little snip of a pickup in activity And at the margin, those two sectors of the economy can make a distinct difference So in terms of the business outlook, the staff forecast is probably a reasonable depiction of the situation It's very similar to our forecast; the difference probably is that one may have a little more confidence in it than was the case several months ago  Now, on this credit crunch issue, I think there is something to it but I'm not sure it's as pervasive and fundamental as perhaps some think I get a sense of it, for example, with banks in northern New Jersey and Long Island where we've had some excesses in real estate lending as well On the other hand, I don't get much of a sense of it at all from the money center banks; the money center banks are simply complaining about a lack of business--period There's another thing that we have to keep in mind about this silent credit crunch During much of the second half of the 1980s we had a situation in the country when private credit demands were growing very, very rapidly and private credit growth was way out of line with historical relationships relative to GNP And now what we are seeing is that a lot of that credit growth was bad credit We're seeing it in chargeoffs in the banking industry, in the thrift industry, and in markdowns of prices of junk bonds So, I'm not so sure that some margin of greater discipline in the credit origination process is something we should be terribly concerned about It's probably a good thing In terms of the small business side of it, again, I don't get the sense from our small business advisory groups and others that well-run small businesses are having any particular problem with credit availability That doesn't mean there aren't some who are having trouble, but I don't think it's a general phenomenon  On inflation, in underlying terms, I come out where Gary Stern does We've been stuck at 4-1/2 percent or something like that for a long time I think what is different right now is that if one expected that we were going to do better than that, what the recent information suggests, of course, is that that's not going to come about very easily But I myself don't think that the inflation situation has deteriorated in any significant way; it just refuses to get better, which is a problem in its own right  The biggest area of uncertainty in my mind continues to be the external side of the economy Ted has one scenario built into the forecast; he described another The fact of the matter is that you probably could put together three or four external scenarios, each of which would be strikingly different from the others and none of which could automatically be ruled out of hand There is a range of uncertainties not just because of exchange rates but because of political developments, economic developments--the whole spectrum So, I think the range of possible outcomes in the external sector out over the next six to eight quarters is really very wide indeed  The only other point I would make, Mr Chairman--I don't have to make it but maybe you do--is that the renewed discussion here about the budgetary situation is possibly interesting Rostenkowski's pronouncement, of course, has gotten shot down, as I'm sure he thought it would Nevertheless, I still find it rather surprising, and maybe  -32-    3/27/90  even a bit encouraging, that somebody like Rostenkowski was willing to put his cards on the table in the budget arena I don't know whether that's just ceremonial or if there are some straws in the wind that would suggest that something constructive might happen on the budget front As I said, I don't know if you want to comment on that later or not   I have no stomach at all for changing policy right now either, but I came here with a very, very mild preference for asymmetric language My preference is probably a bit stronger for asymmetric language, but operationally I don't think it matters a lot We can react to incoming data as needed in either  -45-    3/27/90  case I think the only real argument that can be made for asymmetric has been made; as I say, I can be reasonably comfortable with "B" [symmetric]   So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second   Well, Mr Chairman, the impression I get from business people, particularly on the manufacturing side, is more in line with Mike's forecast than it is with the last three weeks of data I just don't have any sense that things suddenly fell out of bed on us here Exports are holding up quite well More generally, people are saying that business at least has stopped getting worse The computer business appears to be showing a renewed spark, and I don't know what to make of that Some of the commentary I hear even from suggests that maybe there's a little more to that than even they thought   That's probably part of it; they sure feel better So, as I said, the impressionistic information is much more in line with Mike's forecast than these very recent data Our own forecast is quite similar as well, although the policy assumptions are different We don't have a rise in short-term interest rates anything like what is in Mike's forecast and the results are about the same  On this credit crunch question, I've read all the surveys and listened to all the comments around the table, and I still can't quite shake a sense of uneasiness that there may be something there that we just haven't seen yet Of course, I have absolutely no evidence of that But possibly, just possibly, the money supply, especially M3, may be saying something about that But who knows? I'd like to dismiss it completely, but I can't quite bring myself to that  As for inflation, I blow a little hot and cold on the question of whether the underlying inflation rate has changed Where I am at the moment is that if it has changed, it has changed only a tad and maybe it is basically unchanged in core terms But whatever conclusion you draw about what's happened to the core inflation rate in recent quarters, I think what you have to be impressed with, notwithstanding all this talk about credibility and all the rest of it, is that the only way that the core inflation rate is going to come down is if there's a lot more slack in the economy With the structure of the economy today, there just doesn't seem to be much to suggest that that's going to change in a downward direction in any appreciable way, given the kinds of resource utilization patterns we have right now But that, I think, is going to create an acute dilemma for this Committee very soon, and I'm thinking in terms of this budget package I don't know whether they will get one or not I suspect that there's probably a better chance of that today than at any time in the recent past And then all of a sudden we will have what we have all said we needed--what we have all been pleading for, begging for, and cajoling for And it seems to me that the policy dilemma that the Committee is going to face in those circumstances is going to be rather awesome even if long-term interest rates come down  -19-    5/15/90  by themselves, which I'm sure they will But I think that is something that we're going to have to reflect upon a good deal I don't think that's an urgent matter because I don't think they can cut a deal that fast   I still think it has to be thought about a bit If there is a deal of some substance, it's going to make things very difficult for us in an ironic kind of fashion   You may But, as I say, in the context in which that core inflation rate is either a tad higher or stuck, that's going to be a pretty difficult environment for us   Just to come full circle, I find myself quite sympathetic with Governor Angell and Governor Johnson But I can associate myself with the prescription that you put on the table, Mr Chairman I also think, though, that this "beefed up" language--if I can put it that way--in the policy record is very important And even though I have an uneasiness about this credit crunch issue, I would agree with Bob Parry that it would be a mistake in this key part of the policy record to frame this position on those grounds, partly because I'm afraid that that is susceptible to the interpretation that we intend [unintelligible] I would be inclined to take that beefed up language and couch it more in terms of the economy, as you did a few moments ago, and the concern about the inflationary process   No question   As I said, if that language can have some of that flavor and stay away for that purpose from this credit crunch matter, I'd be a lot happier   Well, first of all, in terms of the national outlook, I think the staff has done as well as anybody could possibly do in terms of trying to capture what might happen and what the contingencies are For what it's worth, both our baseline forecast and our alternative forecast are really quite similar to the kinds of things the staff is talking about About the only material difference is that in the next two quarters we probably have the real economy a bit softer and the inflation rate a bit higher But over the forecast period as a whole, the numbers both internally and externally (on trade) are really quite similar to the staff's baseline forecast There are multiple risks In the very short run the greatest risk or uncertainty, of course, is that the Iraqi situation will turn into a shooting war I've talked to some people who know something about the oil infrastructure in that part of the world and the impression I get is that even if it were a very short armed conflict, a guy like Hussein could do one heck of a lot of damage in a very short period of time to the oil infrastructure in terms of pipelines and that type of thing So, again, even if a shooting war were very short and very decisive for the good guys, the damage that could be done to the oil infrastructure in a matter of days is quite substantial, I gather   All the pipelines I gather are above ground even when they're far removed from Iraq or Kuwait itself So, they are just sitting there And the potential for substantial damage when you have a crazy guy like this guy is quite real   All of that would, consistent with what Gary says, involve some substantial stimulus from a lot of sources Anyway, I think the staff's effort to try and capture both the baseline and some of the contingencies is as good as one can do it in these circumstances Leaving that aside, an interesting way to think about this is to ask what was going on pre-Iraq and what superimposing Iraq means I have to say that my impression is that even prior to the Iraqi invasion the attitudes in the business community--both big business and small business--were souring My sense is that the economy, if anything, was softer rather than stronger and that even before the very latest CPI number the inflation rate was higher rather than lower--not in any decisive way, but certainly the hopes that the inflation rate was going to bend down, I think, were fading I agree with some of the others who said  -22-    8/21/90  that--again, even before the Iraqi invasion--expectations had soured quite significantly in terms of the prospects for any kind of a meaningful budget compromise Obviously, the Middle East situation has made all of those things worse, at least in the short run What I hear now is not only more overt talk about the risks of recession but a crescendo of opinion about a vicious form of stagflation in which the inflation rate, at least for the foreseeable future, could be significantly higher in a context in which the economy is just sitting there Now, the good news in all of this that I detect rather overtly in many instances is that there is a recognition in the business community and maybe even on Main Street that, at least in the short run, it's not something that is subject to any quick fix by monetary policy I think there is a recognition that all of this does put quite a constraint on monetary policy Indeed, I'm even surprised about the number of people who talk overtly about not making the same mistakes that were made in the 1970s when, in the eyes of many people, oil prices and energy shocks were allowed to feed into the general pattern of wage and price setting So, there may be at least that element of realism there Nevertheless, I have the impression at this point that things are very much on the gloomy side  One quick footnote on the real estate situation You can get many different stories there; it depends upon whom you talked to last But what I'm impressed with is that my examiners--who I think are pretty darn good, especially in real estate--are very much of the mind that the situation had to get worse before it was going to get better And again, that was before any further problems were superimposed on that situation   I also would support your formulation It's probably fair to say in my case that prior to the Iraqi developments, I would have leaned to easing in any event As things stand right now, I probably would come fairly close to associating myself with Mr Boehne's definition of the situation But I also think it's so uncertain that it could easily go the other way I could easily envision unpleasant circumstances where we might have to tighten monetary policy I say that not because I favor that, but only because it captures the range of emotions that I think is really on the table As I say, your formulation is fine with me as things sit right now I would lean toward Mr Boehne's prescription, but depending upon what happens I might be a lot more cautious about seeking out an opportunity to ease   I'll make a comment in the context of Ed Boehne's question In this immediate setting I think it is also true that concern abroad about financial fragility--or whatever you want to call it--in the United States and in US financial institutions unquestionably has been a factor in the timeframe of the last month or so It's impossible to quantify that, but there's no question in my mind that that's a factor   You're absolutely right As long as there are legions of very, very well paid people out there whose livelihood depends upon their ability to understand every nuance in Mr Sternlight's activities, we're stuck with it   Actually, that would do it!   It's true, though, that there are literally thousands of people all over the world who do only that   I don't think it would change it   No matter what we did, unless we really went the whole distance by going through some kind of a quantity as opposed to a rate--   But even that-- If you go back to the period in 1980 and 1981 where we really did, at least for a period of time, [target] the money supply range, we had pandemonium every Thursday afternoon when the money supply figures were published And that gets very frustrating But I must say it's pretty darn hard to figure out how to avoid it   So move   In terms of the national economy first, I think the forecast that Mike and his colleagues have put on the table is as good a forecast as you're going to get right now Our own bank forecast is very similar in all of its major elements to Mike's forecast But having said that, I think the point Mike made at the outset and that several others have made is very important There really is a sharp dichotomy between attitudes and expectations versus what we see in the economic statistics and what those hard economic statistics would suggest in terms of a forecast And I think there is a danger in that environment of the classic self-fulfilling prophecy  There have been several comments made about the financial fragility aspects of that Let me just add a couple of insights in that area First of all, part of what we're seeing in banking, broadly defined, is also being seen in other countries There is a similar situation at least in many respects in Japan and, while it's not widely talked about, there are symptoms of the same kind of conditions beginning to develop even in the London clearing banks because of asset quality problems and overextension of real estate loans and so on So, while the problem to date has received a lot more attention in the United States, it is not one that is in all of its dimensions unique to the United States It has secular elements to it, especially in this country, in terms of even greater questions in the marketplace as to how these institutions are going to generate the earnings that they need not only to raise capital but also to maintain reasonable rates of return for shareholders But right now there clearly is a very, very pronounced cyclical element surrounding this issue of credit quality concerns  Looking at that from the vantage point of the major money center banks, there are three areas the LDC loans, the HLT loans, and the real estate loans Right now what we see is a clustering of weighted classified asset ratios in the money center banks in New York For the institutions that have been the subject of a lot of this recent attention, those weighted classified asset ratios are now in the range of below 20 percent, which is not great but certainly should be manageable I would say right now that by far the greatest risk of further deterioration in asset quality is in the real estate  -27-    10/2/90  area The LDC situation, if anything, is better, especially after all the chargeoffs that were taken for Argentina The exposures in that area essentially now are in four big countries Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina--not that the others are totally insignificant; but of those countries two are in pretty good shape The HLT situation, while laden with uncertainties, again I would judge as manageable But the big, big question is on the real estate side Even if, as I think, the situation right now is better than a lot of the market scuttlebutt would have it, it's certainly not as good as we'd like to see it And it's very important to recognize that if you just take those seven institutions, you're talking about banking assets of about $700 billion, which is something like a quarter or a third of domestic banking assets And with only one or maybe two exceptions, for the foreseeable future the growth in assets in these institutions is going to be very, very restrained because of capital considerations, leaving aside whatever judgments one might want to make about credit screening and those types of things I think it's also important to keep in mind that the foreign banks, especially Japanese banks, that have been a very important source of the net growth of credit in the United States are not going to be a source of that kind of growth in the future, at least in the foreseeable future Again, I'm leaving aside what we mean when we talk about credit crunches I think we have a situation in which a very large number of institutions, both foreign and domestic, are simply not in a position to be doing a lot of lending because of de facto constraints, and appropriate constraints, coming from the capital side But at the moment my assessment still would be that the situation, while not pretty, is certainly not as difficult as some of these reports would indicate  I should also say in the area of financial fragility that while the spotlight at the moment is on the banks, it should also be kept in mind that the securities houses and the insurance companies are by no means exempt from these problems Indeed, I would stipulate that some of the potential sources of vulnerability in the securities industry could be even more acute than some of the ones in banking, even though that is not a subject of great conversation at the moment  Against that backdrop, a question that keeps running through my mind is Why are attitudes so sour? Now, presumably everybody is looking at the same numbers that we're looking at What is it that has produced this very, very substantial deterioration in attitudes and expectations? It seems to me that there are at least three or four factors at work here One is that I do detect, even among the most aggressive businessmen, a recognition now that inflation has proven to be much more stubborn than we expected and than they expected There was a time when we talked about inflation that a lot of people would say to us "You're fighting the last war" They don't say that anymore I think there is a recognition that the core inflation rate has not gone down and probably has crept up So, that's a factor I think the budget process, leaving aside what you think are the results in terms of numbers, has taken a major toll in terms of expectations or attitudes On Wall Street and on Main Street that has been viewed as a farce and I think in its own way has clearly undercut attitudes and expectations Again, no matter what you think of the program itself, which I actually think is pretty decent, we're still staring at this incredibly massive deficit for next year You can dress it up any way you want, but I think that number has been a    10/2/90  shock to people as well The third factor that I think is very, very important in terms of this souring of attitudes and expectations has been a decline in asset values For the typical household it really has struck right in the breadbasket because between stocks and houses there has been a very sharp psychological adjustment if not a real adjustment One of the things that sharply distinguishes this period from other periods that we've gone through in the past is the fact that asset values at the level of both the household and the corporate sector are declining in many cases Some of that, of course, especially in real estate, is a result of the excesses that went before Nevertheless, it is there  I also think that there are renewed and heightened concerns, even among people who don't normally think about this question, about the reliability of our external sources of finance All these news reports about the Japanese pulling back and other things are catching the attention of people who normally don't even give those types of issues a second thought In a way, Sam's earlier comments about the exchange rate are a manifestation of that So, you take all of that and superimpose the Middle East on top of it and the conclusion I come to is that we shouldn't be terribly surprised that expectations and attitudes are as sour as they are When you put it all together, it seems to me that what we have right now that is different from most of our earlier experience is either the reality or the danger of a significant element of illiquidity and/or credit rationing beginning to manifest itself in asset markets, especially real estate And that does seem to me to carry with it some dangers that are quite different from some of the things that we've had to deal with in the past Indeed, I would be concerned that any further or more widespread illiquidity, again especially in real estate markets, could very well be the thing that tips some of these expectational factors into more underlying behavioral factors   I got confused about a different disaggregation problem The thrust of your suggestion, Mr Chairman,  -49-    10/2/90  was that next Tuesday you would envision, in an almost automatic fashion, an adjustment of 25 basis points in the funds rate?   I'm just trying to clarify the two steps here You have said, assuming this budget resolution gets passed in the Congress, that on Tuesday of next week there would be a 25 basis point adjustment in the federal funds rate You then stipulated that there might be another?   Okay   I support your proposition with one caveat I am still quite worried about the exchange rate creating problems for us So, I would urge that after doing the first step we go quite slowly and test the waters before being committed irrevocably in any sense to the second step   A lot could happen   Just one other point As I listened, Mr Chairman, I thought there was a lot of wisdom in the suggestion that several people made about not tying this unduly to the budget resolution in your public statements The more I think about that, the more I think it would be embarrassing   Move it   The Japanese banks have always paid up in London too   One of the related things going on too, Bob, is a very clear widening out of spreads even on standbys and things like that In other words, one manifestation of all of this concern about credit quality is that for a given structure of interest rates, spreads and fees even on standbys are actually widening--and perhaps by a lot Some of that I think is directly related to this general concern about credit quality, but some of it also is directly related to the fact that the Japanese banks' profile--not just here in the United States but in Europe including Britain--really has changed   And nothing changes   That's the problem I couldn't care less what it says because I know what we're going to do anyway But I think there is a problem in that--   That's right The worst interpretation would be if we take it out and it leaves the impression  -13-    11/13/90  that the Committee has decided that it will no longer make any intermeeting adjustments in policy, and--   Well, there's not much more I can add It is now clear to me that we have had what I would characterize as a violent shock to expectations and attitudes As far as I can piece together the diagnostics of that, I rather agree with Gary Stern's view of it I think the oil situation and the war issue are in the realm of the straws that broke the camel's back A lot of stuff was there to begin with The budget process hurt a lot But I might say in that regard, having now had the time myself to put that budget package under a bit of a microscope, I find that there's a helluva lot more substance to it than I thought there was, especially in the out years But, of course, there too what happened was that the process was so long and the near-term deficits were so large that what in fact is not a bad package has just been swept away I think there's no recognition of that at all  I spoke a few moments ago about the international dimension of this situation, but I really think it does need emphasis Maybe anecdotes don't do much, but the fact of the matter is that over the past, I'd say, four to six weeks I have had literally a string of people whom I consider to be the true elder statesmen of international finance--these are guys who have been around for 40 years in many cases--telling me that they have never seen a situation as delicate as the one right now And the focus is all directed at the United States, with particular emphasis on US financial institutions And as Peter said in his remarks earlier, it is by no means limited to banks It is across the board and it is indiscriminate; AAA-rated companies are being affected just as much as lesser rated companies And as I said, I cannot help but take seriously comments like these from people who have been around the track, in a couple of cases almost longer than I've been alive I think there is the danger--I don't want to call it a probability or anything like that--of some kind of a serious liquidity shock originating offshore, And that, of course, makes for a further serious complication in the context of the whole exchange rate situation, because in the eyes of the rest of the world these problems are very much linked back to the exchange rate  -32-    11/13/90  But what we have is something that appears now to be taking on the organic, if not the statistical, properties of a recession But it's a different kind of recession and this is a little like what I think Ed Boehne was driving at If indeed we are in a recession, it will be the first recession in recent memory that has not been predated by a sharp and protracted rise in interest rates and the underlying inflation rate I don't know if my history is right but I suspect that if it is a recession it will be the first in the postwar period that will have that trait of not being preceded by a buildup in inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates In those circumstances, I think that the policy response, as Ed Boehne said, is a helluva lot more difficult It is partly expectations to be sure; but at this point it's very hard to take exception to the fact that the credit side of the equation is a powerful force at work here When I look at that credit side of the equation in kind of snapshot terms, I still come to the view that it is not as bad as all of the market forces, press reports, or rumor forces would have one believe But the problem with snapshots, of course, is that they are frozen in time and they don't tell you a lot about the future And one of the things that has become a matter of some increasing concern to me is that I can now easily see any number of other parts of the country besides the Northeast that could get bitten rather sharply by the real estate problem that is at the heart of so many of the problems, at least in the Northeast And, of course, as Ed was suggesting, if that does begin to play out and reinforce itself on the credit side, I think it can make things a heck of a lot more difficult In the context particularly of the risk--however large or small you may think it is-- of some kind of a serious liquidity problem originating offshore and of the sensitivity of the dollar, there are limits at least at this point as to how much can or should be done with lower interest rates That also brings me to the view--not unlike Dick Syron's suggestion or I think implicit in Ed Boehne's suggestions--that maybe we have to start looking at some other things here I mentioned this at the last Committee meeting and almost got run out of the room--it's not the first time that has happened and it won't be the last--but I must say that despite the political risks I still have an awful lot of sympathy in this environment for thinking about doing something with reserve requirements, even if it had to be watered down and phased in and convoluted I think I am fully sensitive to the risks, but I'm also sensitive to the risks on the other side, which I think are more than anyone knows at this point   You lost me on that last lap there, Wayne   I support your recommendation   Can we live with saying 1 to 2 percent or something instead of putting that 0 in there?   Say "M2 and M3 in the range of 1 to 2 percent" or something like that   So move   Reserve Banks--   Second   Second   Let me add the oil was in ships!   Because it stops being solvent on some of the prices? Is that what you're saying?   Mr Chairman, as far as the national economy is concerned, I think Dick Syron made my point earlier If I had to put a forecast on a piece of paper, I'd probably put down one that looks a lot like the one that Mike has put in the Greenbook Having said that, and for all the reasons that have been cited earlier, I think the risks in the second quarter of 1991 and beyond are probably on the south side of that forecast Indeed, in looking at Mike's forecast, if we had an economy behaving in growth terms like his forecast for the next seven quarters--while it may be cyclically less than we've seen in the past--I'd consider that terrific Basically, he has 2-1/2 percent growth throughout the balance of 1991 and 1992  Let me say a brief word on the local economy, in the New York metropolitan area particularly Keeping in mind that in manufacturing terms that is nowhere near as important as it once was, the fact of the matter is that it still has something like 10 or 12 percent of the nation's population and in some industries such as real estate it's disproportionately more important than even population would indicate For the metropolitan area as a whole, it is clear that the white collar recession is still deepening Some of this is the prominent headlines that you see on cutbacks in financial firms But it's not just that Indeed, that white collar profile of the recessionary forces in the metropolitan area really is quite extraordinary in any kind of a historical perspective We think the real estate situation still has a ways to go south Again, the market measured in square footage terms is very, very large You lose sight of the fact that lower Manhattan by itself has almost as much office space as the city  -17-    12/18/90  of Chicago And when you look at the situation in the metropolitan area broadly defined, New York City itself probably is marginally okay in that vacancy rates are now in the area of 20 percent, which is high but not fatal And there is not a whole lot of fresh new supply in the construction pipeline; there is some, but not tremendously large amounts Rents, on the other hand, really have plummeted If you look at prime midtown office space--I'm talking about large chunks of space, say, 200,000 to 400,000 square feet, not little pockets of space--space that perhaps as recently as a year ago but certainly 18 months ago could have commanded $50 to $55 a foot, today they are lucky to get $30 It really is an extremely large change in a very, very short period of time As I said, the only saving grace is that there aren't that many truly large blocks of space even in the midtown market with the exception of three or four buildings that are being finished on 6th Avenue The suburban real estate markets are worse than the New York City markets and that is true pretty much across the board, whether you're talking about Long Island, Jersey, Westchester, or parts of Connecticut We don't have very good statistics in terms of how much space is sitting there Most of these surveys, Coldwell Banker and the like, are pretty good for cities but not so good for suburban areas Based on what developers are telling us and what our examiners see, we think the downside potential in the suburban community is still quite considerable  Ed Boehne touched on this in the context of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, but we have basically the same kinds of pressures on the state and local fiscal side with all the implications either for higher taxes and/or lower spending at the state and local level The New York City situation isn't great at the moment; it doesn't look anything like the way it looked in the mid-1970s, but it's not good And whether we're talking about Connecticut or parts of Long Island, there are large prospective deficits in state and local government budgets pretty much across the board Leaving the metropolitan situation alone for a moment, the general psychology of the situation, as reflected in attitudes of CEOs of major multi-national companies, is that it's pretty lousy Interestingly, in the face of Ted's comments earlier, I don't get the sense that the companies that are major exporters are quite as confident about the potential for volume growth in exports in 1991 as they were even three months ago Now, they haven't said so, but it's not considered a [near certainty] as I think it was as recently as three months ago that they would continue to see volume growth in the area of 10 percent or 12 percent  As far as the Christmas retail season goes, the sense I get from both the national retailers that are headquartered in New York and even from some of the small businessmen we talk to is that "It ain't good" It's very soft The only exception is in the very high price end of the retail market in New York City, and that's coming from foreign buyers I don't know how this gets into trade statistics and things like that--not that it's all that important in absolute dollars--but the very high end of the retail market in New York City is quite strong mainly because foreign buyers benefiting from the exchange rate look upon New York as a shopping haven at the moment  On the credit crunch, there too I think we still have a ways to go We will talk about this later, but one particular manifestation of that--the way it seems to be at least at the moment spilling through into the money supply--is becoming a greater concern  -18-    12/18/90  to me The silver lining behind the cloud of the credit crunch is that there is now what I would describe as pervasive evidence of significant rebuilding of pricing and margins taking place pretty much across the board Now, some of that has been facilitated by the withdrawal of the Japanese banks from not only the direct lending markets but the commitments and standby-type markets as well But the evidence I think is now pervasive that we are seeing a significant rebuilding of pricing and margins; whether it can be sustained is another question But I mention that because it is quite clear to me that there is some combination of margins and spreads and levels of interest rates that will snap the credit crunch and snap it in a constructive way I'm not sure we're there yet, but we may be getting closer than we suspect, especially if this rebuilding of spreads and margins proves to be somewhat durable  There are a lot of uncertainties But the combination, as Gary and Dick and several others said earlier, of the real estate sector and the vulnerabilities as they impact on the financial sector are probably the biggest single source of uncertainty as I see it right now I've said this before but let me emphasize it again There is a natural tendency to focus commentary on financial concerns on the banking system; but as I see it those problems are every bit as acute in both cyclical and structural terms for the nonbank sectors of the financial system as they are for the banking system Indeed, just yesterday we were looking at a broad cross section of data on the insurance industry, top to bottom And I will tell you, that is pretty grim stuff, to put it mildly  Just anecdotally on the real estate situation, I spent a morning last week with Bob Boykin and his Dallas directors and up until then I had been tending to convince myself that Texas had turned a corner Maybe Houston has, but one of in the construction business was telling me that he thought there were 10 to 20 million square feet of newly constructed office space in the Dallas area that would be better off bulldozed If you say $100 a square foot and take the midpoint of that estimate of 10 to 20 million, that's $1-1/2 billion worth of new construction with no place to go So, again, of all the wild cards out there I think that real estate-- as it reflects directly on the economy, along the lines of Gary's comments, but also as it reflects on these problems on the financial side--is the biggest single wild card   You'd have to! [Laughter]   First of all, I support precisely the recommendation that you put on the table That is, I hope the Board will move the discount rate 1/2 point, with the Committee trying to settle the funds rate in around 7 percent--I have no question myself that Mr Sternlight and his friends can engineer that even in the year-end environment--and maintain asymmetry in the directive I know it's late, but let me just make a couple of quick comments in terms of the policy setting I think Martha made a good point before when she spoke about the soft landing Everyone knew that was going to be a difficult exercise The economy now seems to have tipped into a recession But I think it's important that we and others keep in mind that if indeed it is a recession, the causes of it seem to be [primarily] an autonomous shift in expectations growing in part out of excesses of the past, of which the credit crunch is a symptom, and in part from Saddam Hussein Not to raise vestiges of the past, but in his Per Jacobsson lecture Paul Volcker made the point that if there is a recession, it's not going to be monetary policy's fault And I think that's right Moreover, if we can achieve an outcome like Mike's forecast, I don't think it's the end of the world by a long shot In addition, we can say now what we couldn't say six months ago that there's at least a strong [hint] or two that suggests that the inflation outcome could be better than we thought six short months ago All in all, while no one likes a recession, I don't consider the outcome terrible by a long shot as long as we get something like Mike's forecast And that's where I do worry a bit, if not a lot, about the money supply No one is ever going to accuse me of being a monetarist, but as I see it the money supply, total reserves, and whatever, are all kind of in the red zone And in those circumstances I think the policy you're suggesting is exactly right Even with that  -38-    12/18/90  policy I'm by no means convinced that we are inevitably and irreversibly destined to overdo it I think we can squeeze through  Just quickly on the point that Governor Angell raised, which I think goes well beyond how we communicate this particular change I think Governor Angell is raising a more difficult question of the whole matter of the relationships between the Board of Governors and the boards of directors on the one hand and the Open Market Committee on the other I must say, Wayne, that looked at over a very long period of time on both sides of the interest rate cycle, I for one think that those relationships are about right And I would be most reluctant to change them I might add, at the risk of seeming to prod a bit, that if one does care about the [monetary policy] role of directors and the Board of Governors it seems to me it's a matter of logical extension that one should not be too crazy about a penalty discount rate   Well, the last time we really had the problem that Governor Angell was talking about wasn't in fact in 1987; it was in 1988 To use the soft landing analogy, Mike pointed out to us 15 months ago that we overshot the runway And if you want to look for mea culpas, the mea culpas belong in 1988 and not 1987 And I think that's the last time--   And policy firmed and then firmed further through the summer of 1987 and the stock market crash took it down And when we got into 1988 that is where the real problems were   No, we didn't go down soon enough and far enough   Some of us take that personally!   Just a quick comment My basic view on this was captured very well by what Ed Boehne and Bob Forrestal said I have just one added thought in the context of this enhanced consultation process, whatever it means, that I think we all have to be sensitive to And that is that within the framework of a so-called enhanced consultation we have to be mindful that that process could become counterproductive if it deteriorated into people insisting upon a formal vote of the FOMC every time there was a consultation I think we all have to have an open and flexible mind on that because if it degenerated into a process--which I don't think it will--where we ended up with frequent recorded votes in intermeeting intervals, I think that would be potentially damaging and at the extreme could produce an inertia problem with the monetary policy process itself So, at least from my perspective, the spirit of what Ed and Bob particularly said captures it very well I do think we have to be mindful that within the process of enhanced consultation that same need for flexibility will be there   I second    3/26/91   Right   Well, for starters I'd say that I am not inherently troubled at all by the fact that the Federal Reserve either on its own or in collaboration with the Treasury has foreign currency balances; that doesn't bother me at all The only point where that would bother me inherently would be if the mere fact or size of those holdings in and of themselves tended to undercut the role of the dollar as the world reserve currency That I would have an inherent problem with And I don't think that condition is within sight Now, that's kind of my breaking point But having said that, the question comes up What is reasonable and what is unreasonable? I don't know the answer, either But I do think we should keep in mind that as recently as 1977 or 1978--I forget which year--when the perception was that the United States was going in the tank, the United States government, including the Federal Reserve, found it necessary to approach the world at large, hat in hand, and establish what was then a $30 billion war chest To be sure, a lot of that war chest was smoke and mirrors and some of it was subsequently financed as you pointed out through the so-called Carter bonds But the Carter bonds were hardly a great victory from the point of view of the United  -13-    3/26/91  States either in political or in economic terms So, I think there is a lot to be said for the war chest theory  In terms of the size issue, the fact of the matter is that in the late 1970s when the world was a lot smaller than it is today what was thought to be a reasonable war chest--again recognizing that a lot of it was smoke and mirrors--was a fairly substantial amount That [leads] me, as does the point that Sam made about the currency holdings of other central banks, to the view that in rough orders of magnitude the balances we hold right now don't seem unreasonable In terms of the question of whether they should go up or go down, my instinct is that if they stay roughly the same or maybe even go down a little, that's fine so long as the reasons why they are going down are credible And here I must say that I worry a bit about undue--and I want to emphasize that "undue"--preoccupation with net losses and net profits I don't hear anybody asking Mr Sternlight how much money he lost for us in the past six weeks when the long bond went down 5 or 6 points in price or whatever it was   I suspect though, Peter, that the amount was not inconsequential in the time-frame of the past 5 or 6 weeks So, I think we have to be a little careful about latching on to the star of profitability because--   Well, the precedent in my judgment is not inconsequential I understand your point and that's why I didn't want to overstate the argument [As I] say, I think we have to be careful about making a public argument for disposing of balances simply on the basis of trying to maximize profits or minimize losses I think that would be a mistake On the other hand, if the specific suggestion is something along the lines of what Sam said--and as I heard Sam he was saying two things--one is that in a orderly way maybe we can try to wind down the warehousing and two is that maybe we ought to have in mind trying to work off the earnings I wouldn't be wildly allergic at all to something along those lines because I think he could make a fairly coherent statement, including to our colleagues abroad, as to what we're doing and why we're doing it But at the end of the day--I think Lee Hoskins touched on this--what is very, very important here is that whatever we do and however we do it, it should not be allowed to be construed by anybody as even carrying the remotest threat that the Federal Reserve or the United States is copping out in terms of international relationships, particularly the kinds of not very aggressive but nevertheless cooperative intervention that we've seen in the past six weeks, for example I'm not at all troubled that we [were] on both sides of the market within a six-week time-frame In the first case it was in a context in which a number of us were worried that the dollar was about to fall out of bed Whether you agree with that or not, we did look to our friends abroad for a little help and they gave it And it doesn't seem to me at all credible for us to say "The hell with you" six weeks later when we got  -14-    3/26/91  this unbelievably dramatic change in psychology and they turned to us and asked if we were willing to help out a little, even if it's symbolic I just don't see that as viable So, I would be careful here But if I understood what Sam was saying in operational terms, I certainly wouldn't have any problem with the thrust of his suggestion   But as a practical matter, Roger, if the Committee were of a mind to sell $5 billion equivalent of D-marks tomorrow morning, I think we would have to consult with the Treasury; indeed, I think we would feel an obligation to consult with the Bundesbank as well   It can at least take off the tail, I suspect   The answer is "no," Tommy   Well, looking first to the national economy, the forecast of the staff in New York in profile terms is similar to Mike's but there are a couple of differences Our staff essentially has the second quarter as flat and a more modest recovery in the third and fourth quarters But for what it's worth, the 1992 outlook is very similar to Mike's forecast with one or two exceptions that aren't important except in terms of algebraic signs We have net exports turning into a drag in 1992, and I want to come back to that in a minute And we also have slightly less improvement in core inflation in 1992 Mike, you have it getting down to around 3-1/2 percent?   We're basically in a holding pattern at 4 percent, which isn't great given all we've been through In terms of even the profile of the forecast, the one substantive thing that I am a bit more concerned about--aside from some anecdotal reports, which I'll get to in a minute--is the external side The kind of forecast we're looking at for 1991 even in the context of something like the current pattern of exchange rates I don't think is unreasonable, but I think there is greater risk--and Bob Forrestal or somebody already said this--on the foreign growth side, looking out from where we are right now And given the tenuous nature of the outlook, that situation at the margin can make a difference Nevertheless, I think the case for a modest recovery sometime in the spring or early summer is not at all unreasonable at this juncture  In terms of anecdotal reports, we're hearing things not unlike a number of things others have said For example, there is widespread gossip, if I can put it in the proper terminology, about a pickup in activity in housing And that's pretty much true at big banks and small banks, upstate and Long Island; it is not true in the very expensive New York City condominium market But with that exception there does seem to be something more than a seasonal pickup in housing The retail sector is still soft, and manufacturing--at least as we hear about it from the vantage point of very large manufacturing firms that are headquartered in New York--is still very soft The credit situation is better We do get anecdotal reports-- and somebody else said this, too--that at least some banks are actually out there looking for loans so long as they're not real estate loans Again, there are sound straws in the wind that the asset price deterioration may be beginning at least to moderate, if not to flatten out It's probably a little too early to make that judgment in any definitive way, but it seems to be a bit better Having said that, there is something else that seems quite clear, and that is that people feel better I guess there's a bit of a similarity with where we were last spring If you recall, last spring the anecdotal reports and the expectations were lousy and the numbers were still pretty good Right now we seem to have a situation in which the expectations and anecdotal reports are pretty good and the numbers are still pretty lousy I blow a little hot and cold as to what to make of that I think there is a danger that if the postwar  -32-    3/26/91  euphoria does not in fact reflect itself in some pickup in spending and activity, this rebound in confidence could reverse very, very quickly It's awfully hard to judge that, but right now the comment that a number of people here have made to the effect that people seem to feel better certainly is the impression I'm getting, even though the numbers aren't there to support it at the moment   "B" symmetric   Move it   Well, Mr Chairman, on the forecast first We have a profile at least that is similar to Mike's, although not quite as strong--especially in the second half of the year But certainly [we expect] a respectable recovery over this six-quarter period Mike did mention several areas of uncertainty One of the reasons why our recovery is less robust than the staff's is net exports; the staff essentially has net exports plateauing and we have a $20 billion deterioration built in over the entire forecast period I don't have a lot of confidence in that forecast and I think Mike made the point earlier that it could go the other way But it is in marginal terms an area of great uncertainty in this forecast period And the difference between 0 and +20 or 0 and -20 in terms of the kind of growth rates we're talking about here is not inconsequential Another point I'd just mention about the forecast--several people have mentioned it--is the state and local sector in a context in which the underlying thrust of fiscal policy is probably on the restrictive side as well The state and local [data] have all kinds of smoke and mirrors in them and it's hard to know what the real picture is But it's hard to dismiss the possibility that there could be a greater measure of difficulty there, especially because these problems are so pervasive There are darn few states and certainly few major cities that don't seem to have pretty hefty fiscal problems Again, the smoke and mirrors makes it a lot harder to judge how difficult that may be But, as I said, I would associate myself with those who feel  -14-    5/14/91  the risks in the forecast probably are more symmetric than they were, in part because of the changes in policy that have been made  On the anecdotal side, we clearly hear report after report to the effect that the residential construction market is looking much better In your old neck of the woods of [northern] New Jersey, Tommy, one of the thrift people was telling me the other day that in the first three months of the year the stock of existing unsold houses in Summit was cut in half That's one little community, but that community is not a trivial piece of the puzzle up there in northern New Jersey The commercial side is lousy And in the industrial sector, the comments that I get from big manufacturing companies continue to be sour across the board Of course, a lot of these guys are sour all the time so you don't try to make [much] of that But one comment you do get from these guys who are sour all the time is that there is a higher sense of anxiety about the outlook for their exports over the next four to five quarters  It's also important at this point to note--and several people have touched on various facets of this--that we can now see several areas in which some good things are happening that are not entirely unrelated to the kind of policy that we've been following For example, balance sheet rebuilding even in the face of the decline in the saving rate in the household sector is making some real progress And what we're beginning to see in the corporate sector is also noteworthy Indeed, if you look at some of the things that were going on in the second half of the '80s, particularly for the companies that aren't already bankrupt, this reverse of the old phenomenon is not entirely inconsequential Taking a longer view, I think this balance sheet rebuilding, while it may temper the recovery, could turn out to be a very healthy development for the intermediate term even though it may dampen things a bit in the near term Somebody mentioned--Dick Syron, I guess--that restructuring is taking many forms and includes state and local governments I think that is now more than straws in the wind and that's beginning to pay off I'm trying to remember, Mike, when the last time was that we had a 28 percent decline in GNP and a 1 percent rise in productivity; I'm sure it has happened, but not very often And that in itself may be symptomatic of some of those things  A number of people have mentioned the inflation situation, and I have to say that in this area there has been a change in my thinking For the first time since the so-called core inflation rate plateaued at around 4 to 4-1/2 percent in 1984, I think we have a pop at penetrating that 4 to 4-1/2 percent core inflation rate I've never felt that in this entire period Now, like Gary Stern, I'm not ready to bet the ranch on it, but I do think that the inflation outlook is distinctly better I still have to wait a little to see if we can get through that threshold My hunch is if we can get through it, we might have a reasonable chance of staying through it  So, I think the outlook is still murky; there are plenty of uncertainties But on the other side of the coin, I can see in a number of areas things that might bode well for the intermediate term   Want to make a bet?   So do I   [Then] we've got problems   I think what President Keehn is hinting at, if I may, is that it might not be a bad idea to have rather firmly in mind a consultation in the first week in June or something like that  -25-    5/14/91   Don't misunderstand; I wasn't suggesting that kind of rigid linkage What I was saying is that if we had a major "tanking" in the stock market, I think that would rather quickly show through to other things   Tommy, if we had a very substantial correction in the stock market, I think it would feed right into the kinds of things that Don was talking about in terms of the confidence factor and the double-dip factor   Second   I'll move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   Move it  SPEAKER(?) Second    8/20/91   To pick up on a point that you made, Mr Chairman, I'm not inherently troubled by the fact that the rank order stayed the same over this whole period, despite Mike's clever recitation of all that took place in that period On the other hand, if you look at this table, there are at least a few cases in which the change in the rank order did mean something For example, around the time of the stock market crash in October 1987, there's no question that that change really meant something Whatever we do, I think we have to preserve some flexibility to take account of things like that On the other hand, I fear that if we got into the practice of managing the rank order as part of the normal deliberative process of the Committee, it could be disruptive to the policy process For example, I think it would be terrible if we ended up with a situation in which the Committee couldn't reach a reasonable conclusion about the thrust of policy because of a great debate as to what should be number two versus what should be number three or number four versus number two If we were going to move in the direction of what Mike Kelley has characterized as an active management of the rank order, the only way I can see that that can be done without running the risk of disrupting the normal consensus-building process within the Committee would be in a context in which there would be a consensus on that point after the policy directive itself had already been voted on The thought of inviting dissents over what is number three versus number two I think could be very disruptive   That's my point   Say that again, Mike   The only problem with that is that then the burden is on all your insurance companies   Well, I don't think there's any question that the anecdotal side of things has gotten quite shaky again Some of that is because the typical CEO of a company never really believed his or her own economists or other economists in terms of the outlook, going back two or three months ago And I think a lot of business executives have interpreted recent data to mean that they were right and the economists were wrong My own sense of the situation is that while things are not as good as they would like them to be, they're not as bad as they think they are either I believe the truth still lies somewhere in the middle Now, having said that, and as someone who has been sensitive to what I'll call financial jitters for a long time, I do think it's fair to say that confidence on the part of both consumers and business people is being further shaken by the cumulative effects of financial jitters And financial jitters, as some people have already said, take a lot of forms here There are new questions about insurance company scandals, and consumer delinquencies are rising All of that is having a little impact, or perhaps even a lot, in an insidious way on confidence in general One implication is that the economy at large is probably even more vulnerable to any kind of financial surprise or shock, even though I've believed it has been vulnerable for a long time  There are also two things of a more intermediate nature that worry me a bit relative to my earlier expectations One has already been touched on and that is that while the inflation outlook in some sense is better--and certainly I still think we can break that so- called core inflation rate of 4 percent that we've been living with for most of the decade--I, too, look at that second-quarter data on wages and so on with some concern While I can readily see how we'll break the 4 percent, I'm not nearly as sure as I was some months ago that we can do a lot better than that Indeed, it seems to me that in order to do a lot better than that one of two things has to happen One is that overall compensation has to bend down, and I'm getting a little skeptical that that can bend down in any significant way except in the context of an economic outlook that would be horrible otherwise Or, we have to get some real recovery [in] productivity, which doesn't look so [likely] either So, again, I feel a little  -25-    8/20/91  less sanguine than I did before about the intermediate-term outlook for inflation  The other intermediate-term thing that has gotten worse is the budgetary deficit outlook If you look at these new estimates-- whether you use OMB's or CBO's and whether you put the S&L [bailout costs] in or out--there really is a material deterioration in the intermediate outlook for the budgetary deficit And that's a worry Now, as Mike said, even against the backdrop of those short- and intermediate-term variables, one can conceive of a wide range of possible outcomes over the forecast period I think the saving rate is a very large wild card; indeed, in the context of Bob Black's remarks about employment and wages and so on in other cycles, one big difference is that in other cycles we didn't have a 35 percent saving rate like we have right now It's a little hard to see how that all will play out, especially if one is assuming implicitly that the rate of increase in nominal wages and compensation has to come down a lot and inflation is going to have to come down a lot So, there's a bit of a conundrum there; again, I think the saving rate is a wild card  Just a brief word if I may, Mr Chairman, on M2--not so much as a policy indicator but more in terms of what it may be telling us about the economy In looking at all the work that the staff did, I come away with the view that M2, at least in informational terms, seems to be saying two things One is fairly benign, and that is that this reach-for-yield [behavior]--in a context in which people are a lot more sophisticated and alternative outlets are a lot easier and cheaper to get at--is an important factor here That, in and of itself, is not something that I worry a lot about, if at all, in policy terms But in looking at the staff's work, I come also to the view that the credit crunch is indeed a factor Now, I can't quite yet sort out the demand side versus supply side influences that constitute the credit crunch But I do find very revealing the table following page 6 in the staff memorandum where they try to look at the relationship between core deposit growth, capital positions of banks, and loan positions of banks That table to me, which admittedly only covers the very short period of June 3rd to August 5th, is a very revealing table Again, it doesn't tell us whether it's demand or supply, but I think it does tell us an awful lot that this credit crunch [phenomenon] is quite real and that that aspect of the way the disintermediation process is working does matter for policy As I said, the reach-for-yield [phenomenon], I think, is rather irrelevant   I'm not sure I feel I can go quite that far Clearly, it says that supply is at work here   Well, it clearly says that, but there are ways in which demand forces could also be producing at least some of this result Certainly, I don't think one can say it's 100 percent supply But to me it's a very revealing table and, unlike the reach-for-yield phenomenon, does have some policy implications--though not in terms of whether M2 should be used as a target That's another  -26-    8/20/91  issue altogether If anything, it says M2 shouldn't be used as a target; but I don't want to get into that debate What it does say to me in the context of these other considerations, and in particular the emphasis on financial jitters, is that while there is a broad range [of risks, they are mostly] on the down side Having said that, I think we're probably okay in terms of Mike's forecast or something like it But the cumulative [impact of] all this financial stuff is a real overhang on the whole outlook   "B" asymmetric is okay with me On the language, I seem to remember that at the end of the last meeting I said something along the lines of "The worst thing I can think of in some sense is an economy that appears to be recovering and M2 is dead in the water" And that's what we've got I don't trust M2 and I trust it less today than I did six weeks ago For that reason, I would favor version I I think Tommy's point about getting trapped by that is a concern   Yes, let me just say a couple of further words on the Salomon situation As Peter has indicated, and as I think is widely known, the status of Salomon as a primary dealer is under active review Just so the Committee understands the way that all came about, Gutfruend called me on Friday the 9th of August and first revealed the initial violations We sent them a letter the following Monday, which they got on Tuesday, in which we basically said that in view of what they had disclosed they had 10 days to make their case on why they should be retained as a primary dealer That letter, I think, prompted the second round of disclosures, which didn't come easily I might add And when the full scope of the second round of disclosures became apparent, I told them--and this was all in consultation with the Treasury and the Chairman, so I was not acting in a vacuum--that signals were off for the 10 days and that they should not conclude that the Tuesday letter meant that we might not take immediate action And I think it's fairly clear that that message was what, in turn, prompted the decision of Strauss and Gutfruend to resign and Buffet to come on board There was no horse trading about this But we did decide here on Friday morning in the Chairman's office that in those circumstances we would give them a little more breathing room to make their case So, in effect, we did give them an extension, which has now run its course They have submitted to us a rather voluminous set of documents laying out all the changes they've made and all the changes they plan and so forth, and that is under evaluation Nevertheless, we are rapidly approaching the point where the decision time will be at hand Indeed, I would be very surprised if whatever decision we make is not    10/1/91  made sometime around the middle to the end of this month I can't see it going beyond the end of this month  At this point, I don't want to try to prejudge that decision And above all we recognize that the Board of Governors and the Committee have a natural and appropriate interest in both the decision and the decisionmaking process, if for no other reason--and there are others as well--that there are possible decisions in the spectrum of all that might be considered that could have very major implications not just for the firm but for markets as well As that gets closer we will, of course, make sure that appropriate means and mechanisms are followed to satisfy those natural interests Obviously, we will have to consult with the Treasury and the SEC as well  Even though I don't think it has to bear on the decision, whatever it is, I can't underscore enough how large and how complex this firm is If you look at it relative to Drexel, for example, Drexel literally looks like a fly on an elephant's behind in terms of both size and complexity The balance sheet, as Peter said, is down to something a little over $100 billion now But again, unlike Drexel, not insignificant parts of this balance sheet are booked in foreign offices in a multiple-currency type environment now, with significant balance sheet assets denominated in various foreign currencies Their global operations are several orders of magnitude different from anything we've seen to date But I think the biggest element of potential complexity is the off-balance sheet The off- balance sheet in total notational terms is about $650 billion, isn't it Joan? [Secretary's note Ms Lovett replied in the affirmative] Again, that's bigger than a bread basket One of the things, of course, that you see when you confront this kind of situation is that although everybody says you can net positions down and all that, it doesn't work that easily in practice The most complex element of the off-balance sheet by far is the swap book The swap book aggregates to $320 billion; the rest of it is foreign exchange, futures, and forward mortgage-backed securities They're complicated in their own right but one could at least visualize how those things can be taken care of The swap book is a horse of an entirely different color It involves multiple categories of counterparties all over the world And the swap book was, among other things, the instrumentality through which these incredibly complex hedging positions were developed  So, it's not as if you can take the swap book and carve it out without the carving out itself having very important implications for all the other instruments both on and off the balance sheet And maturities in the swap book can run out as much as 10 years; they're not just interest rate swaps Some of them are highly complex swaps that involve both interest rates and exchange rates Some have three or four or five interest rate/swap-type transactions that are tied up with currency swaps that might involve six or seven different currencies, and that's basically one transaction But the difficulty with the swap book other than its complexity is that writers of swaps essentially have either an implicit or offer a very explicit responsibility to buy them back and/or to make a market Now, the problem that creates is that if the thing starts to slip, what will happen just as sure as any of us are sitting here is the counterparties that are net plus in individual swaps will put them back and the ones that are net minus will take to the hills And that can create some rather unusual difficulties But I say that just so    10/1/91  people recognize that this is an extremely big and very, very complex firm Again, it's not that that by itself bears on what one does or does not do; but it does say that, as a part of the process of coming to whatever conclusions have to be reached, we have to consider, and we are doing so seriously, possible contingencies that could arise Mr Chairman, I think that's all I want to say at this point   Well, that's obviously a tough question The prevailing view among people in the markets here and abroad, including some very prominent foreign officials--the prevailing view among those who choose to express a view about that to me--is, yes Now, that doesn't mean that view is right We ourselves certainly think that is a possibility It's one of these things that is so hard to judge   A second question, of course, is that even if you thought it would, how do you judge the follow-on systemically? And a propos Ed Boehne's questions, from an institutional point of view, there are risks on both sides even of that Now, there are certainly people who say that our institutional reputation is damaged if we don't do something like that But if we did it and it produced that kind of problem, our institutional reputation could be damaged in the opposite direction So, it's a very, very difficult question   We surely do   I think that's the thrust of Ed's comment But there's not a win-win there that I can see   Well, let me say two things about that, Wayne First, as you know, as part of this interagency review process we are looking very hard at what steps can be taken to accelerate the programs that are already on the drawing board I don't have a firm answer as to how much can be done to accelerate that process It is unambiguously clear that some kind of electronic bidding system would help [alleviate] some of these problems But it is not by any means a panacea I think, for example, that what Salomon did was three things One is that they violated the auction rules; two is that they systematically lied about it; and three is that they used the set of customer relationships that are all within existing rules to piece together these very complicated financing arrangements for themselves and their customers that produced the "squeeze" Squeezes can be good; squeezes can be bad That's a problem in its own right In any event, that produces these distortions either in terms of the price of the underlying security or the pricing of the RP in the marketplace Now, those latter things, whether one thinks they're good or bad, could have been done entirely within the existing rules That may say that the rules are wrong; but they could have been done entirely within the existing rules And that issue in my mind is in some ways more fundamental than the fact that they broke the rules It has nothing to do with the question of penalties, of punishments fitting the crimes, and all that In terms of the way the market works, an electronic bidding system isn't going to do a darn thing to deal with those issues  The other thing that is important to keep in mind is that one can at least speculate--and that's all it is--that even the most sophisticated electronic bidding system and trading system might still result in a situation, and indeed I suspect would result in a situation, in which there still would be a relatively small number of large institutional players that are going to be a very, very prominent if not dominant part of this market In addition, even the most sophisticated electronic bidding and trading system in and of itself does not provide the answer to the question of who our counterparties are And that's where the nub of the so-called moral hazard problem arises Because as long as we have to deal with somebody, there has to be some kind of objective standard In this day and age of "Government in the Sunshine" and all the rest of it, we wouldn't last 5 minutes saying "Well, that's our business and nobody else's business" So, while the electronics can and will help a lot, and frankly in retrospect we probably--not probably, we should have been putting more emphasis on that--as you know very well, it was perceived as a question of priorities We've put huge amounts of resources into the upgrading of the book entry system itself; we've    10/1/91  put huge amounts of resources into Treasury direct; we've put huge amounts of resources in the savings bond thing; and the perception was that the auction system was working well It didn't seem, certainly to me--and I was wrong--to be at the front end of the priority list in terms of intensive application of new technology   I agree completely with that And, really--Dave has been working with us on this--we will be putting a full court press on that But I don't want to leave the impression with anybody that once we fix that, we've fixed all these other problems because that just doesn't follow   Second   This is going to sound as if it was orchestrated, but it was not Amid all these anecdotal reports, Gary's people must be sending the people in Minneapolis to talk to me because I hear all this terrible stuff too But staff at the Bank yesterday were walking me through some [analysis] on the household sector, which actually made me feel a little better Some of it Mike already referred to and indirectly John referred to it We all have this impression that the saving rate is very low, that income growth is rather sluggish, and that spending is rather sluggish But if you look at it in the context of these NBER charts, you find several things One is that the saving rate never falls in the beginning of a recovery What that means, of course, is that it is income that pushes up spending, not the saving rate falling And when you look at the income side in this recovery, it's sluggish but certainly not disastrously so I think that was part of what Mike was saying before And neither for that matter is overall consumption spending or even so-called discretionary consumption spending all that wildly out of line with what one might expect On the other hand, nonagricultural employment is a bit weaker, but interestingly enough that is not in manufacturing; it's not even in construction It's basically all in services, with particular emphasis on finance, insurance, and real estate, and in state and local governments And, of course, those problems are as much secular as they are cyclical What that basically says is that if you look at the dynamics of the consumer sector in the context of income, employment, and savings, despite the fact that nobody feels very good, it's not all that unusual looking  There's another side to it, which gets to John LaWare's point that I found even more interesting And that is what has been happening to the household balance sheet When you look at that household balance sheet in flow-of-funds terms, what you find is that the contraction in the growth of household debt doesn't look all that unusual either The only thing that's unusual is that it started a little earlier than it normally does and that the fall in the growth rate of non-mortgage debt started distinctly earlier and has been much steeper But that probably reflects the 1986 Tax Act as much as anything else But as the rate of growth of debt falls, if you believe in a balance sheet, something else must happen And of course when you look at the last four or five years as a whole, the saving rate on balance hasn't really changed at all Therefore, what we find, which isn't surprising, is that over that period the growth in the acquisition of financial assets and the acquisition or increase in liabilities are very, very similar And that, of course, makes the overall situation look even more typical But it turns out--and this is the thing I didn't really have a clue on--that there is one very big difference in terms of the financial assets side of the household balance sheet over this four-to-five year period, and that is a very large atypical shift in the composition of household financial assets out of bank deposits into various securities-type instruments, including government securities funds and so on   Well, even the mutual funds are a part of it, but it's also the government funds Now, that big relative drop in bank deposits, of course, we see in the context of the rate of growth in the money supply But if you think of it in  -19-    10/1/91  this broader context, it seems to me that the pattern as a whole is quite consistent with the hypothesis that it's being driven importantly by the desire to shed debt, which is quite consistent with John's point about the demand side of the equation being more important than the supply side Indeed, it's also quite consistent with the hypothesis that the portfolio shift phenomenon, which in part is being facilitated by technology, may have an important role here as well Now, the reason why that makes me feel a little better in the context of the earlier comments about income, consumption, the saving rate and so on is that, to the extent it is significantly driven by purposeful decisions to manage the balance sheet better and shed debt, it also makes me at least less nervous--I'm still nervous--about the money supply and about the credit crunch That's not to say that I think I understand the money supply and it's not to say that there are not elements of the credit crunch there; it's simply to say that it makes me feel a little better about them and therefore a little more comfortable with the kind of forecast that Mike has on the table  I'd quickly add, Mr Chairman, on the anecdotal side, that the attitudes one hears about, especially from big businesses, are still lousy The only other thing--I don't remember if I mentioned this at the last meeting or not--is that I do get the sense that the commercial real estate market in price terms may be bottoming out, at least in the greater New York metropolitan area There's still going to be a long workout, but one does begin to get the feel that the precipitous--   That's right   Sale prices   Yes Now, that's still in the straw-in-the-wind category, but I now have had enough people say that to me that I can't dismiss it   Well, it's not just the City I get this now from northern Jersey too, anyway Ed, I don't know what they're saying in southern Jersey, but certainly in northern Jersey--   Look, don't misunderstand me They are weak in New York But what I'm saying is that they appear to be--   Well, that's clear The rate of decline has abated, but my impression is that it is beginning to sound as though people think it may be bottoming out   "B" mildly symmetric sounds fine to me   Asymmetric There are too many adjectives in these things!   Move it   Second   That's true all the time   That's not a bad idea!   A whole bunch!  MELZER Exactly So, if somebody is short $50 million on the 10-year, isn't that--?   It's probably $150 per 1/32 per million   I tend to be a bit conservative, as you know, about these things But in this context, I frankly don't worry about [unintelligible] people maybe getting burned because they're short They are risk takers What worries me is a little more far-reaching than that, and that is, as you know very well, we have to be very careful about this marketplace Governor Angell is quite consistent But going back to our discussion a week or 10 days ago when we were talking about basically dismantling the whole infrastructure to that market, this is a very concrete, vivid example of the kind of thing I'm worried about And we've got to be careful of these things   Well, I think Dave has the right idea Notwithstanding my extreme caution in terms of some of these other more sweeping moves, in this particular context I'd go ahead and do it on Wednesday and take our chances But that doesn't mean that my anxieties about the need for a little care and nurturing of this market can be assumed to have disappeared   Could I ask Mr Parry a question?   Bob, just in the past few weeks I've heard a couple of people, including a really large national real estate developer, sounding very dire about the real estate outlook on the West Coast and in California particularly--much more so than anything I've heard before Is there anything to that?   Yes, this is--   I'm not going to add anything in the anecdotal area; it would be more of the same But, like everyone else, I spend a lot of time these days scratching my head a little and asking why the recovery hasn't really taken hold and what is going on out there The more I look at it and think about it, the more clear it becomes to me that there are a number of structural or semi- structural forces at work A lot has been said about inventories, and that's good news and bad news; it makes the recession itself shallower, but it also means the recovery has less "pop" One thing about inventories that I hadn't really focused on until yesterday is that the sense of comfort that inventories are in good shape is okay as a generalization, but I was surprised to see when I looked at it that in the non-auto retail sector inventories are not in all that great shape Now, maybe that's just because there are a lot more stores and maybe even a greater variety of goods; nevertheless, it's there  But beyond the inventory situation, one of the longer-term things we all talk about is this real estate overhang I think Dick Syron is right when he points to the fact that it's not just the overhang itself but the spillover effect it has on perceptions about asset quality prices that has an impact on confidence Mike Prell touched on debt burdens with a bit of a question in his mind I've had a question in my mind, but the more I think about it, the more important I think it is in terms of attitudes and financial fragility that we all have talked a lot about The fiscal situation is ugly not just because the deficits are big but because the process is basically immobilized  But when I think about those things, with the exception of inventories, one of the things that strikes me is that in a sense they're all symptomatic of the chickens coming home to roost They're all symptomatic of earlier excesses of one kind or another But I still ask myself What do they mean? I just handed some charts to the Chairman that are based on work I had staff at the Bank do in trying to look at some of this in a much longer perspective Just to cite a couple of examples that come out of that When you look at the default rate on corporate bonds--this is the default rate on all rated issues, so a lot of the junk bonds aren't even in this calculation-- it's currently 3 percent of all rated issues, which is by far the largest it has been in the postwar period We did one calculation on office space that may or may not be right, but it's pretty dramatic because it says that it would take six years of service-sector employment growth at the very rapid rates of the 1980s to absorb the overhang in service-sector office space that's there now, assuming that nothing else is built for the next six years It's a big number If you look at the banks--maybe somebody else looked at this before but I hadn't really focused on this--loan losses as a percentage of total loans are 137 percent That doesn't sound all that bad, but it turns out that 137 percent is by a wide margin the highest that this has been since 1936 And the loan losses in the banking system just in 1990 were $28 billion, as against before tax profits of $23  -18-    11/5/91  billion Again, what is interesting about the $28 billion in losses is that while $77 billion was in real estate, $72 billion was in consumer lending, $85 billion was in C&I lending, and there was still $47 billion left over in all other categories of lending Again, those are very big numbers and they're not confined by a long shot to real estate  When I look at all those things, what leaps into my mind, other than that the chickens are coming home to roost, is that in some ways I'm surprised that we didn't have a credit crunch, whatever that may mean--I think Bob McTeer makes a good point there--a lot sooner or that it hasn't been a lot worse But the way I come out on all those numbers is that, in the face of them, we're probably doing as well as we could reasonably expect to do But that raises in my mind even more this question about the outlook Clearly, those things strongly reinforce the view that the recovery, whatever else it may be, is going to be distinctly subpar That has never bothered me per se But the question that looms larger in my mind and has in the past is With all of that, can we even get a result that looks like the Greenbook in a context in which I think the Greenbook [projects] a pretty good outcome if for no other reason than that it is respectable at least in terms of growth But more than that, it is an outlook that is compatible with this continued whittling away at the core inflation rate And I guess I'm not so sure that even that outlook is as comfortably in hand as I once thought it was   I would favor the 25 basis point reduction in the funds rate accompanied by a discount rate change of 1/2 percentage point, recognizing, of course, that the timing decision [for the discount rate] itself is the Board's If both of those things were done--this gets into Ed's question about timing--I probably would favor a symmetric directive thereafter With just the funds rate done, that complicates matters and I'd probably favor an asymmetric directive   That means I'd vote either way   That's how it's a compromise!  MR, BLACK I thought we had covered every permutation and combination we could have, but I don't think anybody has come up with exactly this I would leave the federal funds rate where it is for right now, but I would favor submitting--in the case of our Bank, which would join several others--[a recommendation for] a 1/2 point cut in the discount rate with the hope that the Board would see fit to approve that on Friday If we had a steady federal funds rate right  -33-    11/5/91  now, I think that would be a good way to reassure the long-term markets and it would give us a little more time to judge the easing actions that we took last week At the same time, reducing the [discount] rate would reestablish a more normal spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate And a very important point, to which Governor Angell alluded earlier as did Tom Melzer, is that it might also convince a lot of potential borrowers who are sitting out there just waiting until they think rates have hit the bottom to move into the fray A lot of people in the real estate business think that is true Now, if we did adopt that approach, which I'm sure we're not going to, I would favor having an asymmetric directive in favor of ease thereafter   I'll move it   I'll move it   I support Governor Kelley's position   Well, as everybody has already said, this is a tough one Clearly, attitudes are lousy To pick up on Gary Stern's point that the statistics are catching up with the attitudes Maybe the causation is precisely in that direction and we have a classic self-fulfilling prophecy Another interesting thing that is surfacing now in a rather forceful way, which is attitudinal in one sense, is that even among informed observers there is this notion that monetary policy is pushing on a string I just don't think that's right Mike Prell touched on it a bit But if you look at the behavior of the so-called interest-sensitive parts of spending versus the so-called non-interest-sensitive parts, at least to date, the anomaly is not in the interest-sensitive parts; it's in the non- interest sensitive parts It's not that the interest-sensitive parts are booming, but the big difference is in the non-interest-sensitive parts which, of course, is consistent with the view that monetary policy is not pushing on a string When you look at it a bit more carefully in the context of this confidence factor, where are the big differences? It seems to me that one can say, at the risk of a major  -22-    12/17/91  oversimplification, that the big differences lie in two areas The first is government itself We do have for good and necessary reasons a more restrictive fiscal policy stance at the federal level, given where the economy is, than we had in earlier episodes But what I think really makes the difference is the combination of the federal level and the state and local level Indeed, it seems to me that the state and local sector in many, many different ways--including the way it affects confidence--really is one of the major differences in the economy and the performance of the economy in recent quarters  Now, the second big difference is the one that many have touched on and that is the debt overhang problem The point that Governor Mullins made is an important one In part, the workout of the debt overhang problem has been going on for two or three years, and I don't think we fully recognized it when it began to take hold But it is one of the reasons why the economy as a whole has basically been limping along for three years And whatever you think of it, it obviously still has multifaceted implications both now and for the immediate future in terms of financial institution problems, balance sheet rebuilding, corporate restructuring, and all the rest of it But the cumulative effects of those things have a lot to do with this confidence factor that everyone's speaking of But even after having said that, I am still perplexed on the one hand and worried on the other as to why these measures of confidence have dropped like a stone in the last couple of months We can argue whether they are at 1982 levels or 1987 levels, but they do just seem to have cracked Again, I think Mike's point is right The economics profession doesn't tell us much at all about what to make of that Certainly, it doesn't tell us much at all about how to build that into a forecast or anything like that As a matter of fact, the track record of those [confidence surveys] is lousy Nevertheless, we have this sharp downward break in confidence against the history of all these other events  Well, I don't know what to make of that any more than anybody else does But it does seem to me that at the very least it raises further questions about the near-term outlook for consumer spending As I think I mentioned at the last Committee meeting, the retail inventory situation isn't great Now, when we talk to individual store owners, they say their inventories are lean as the devil; and when we go into our local department store and look around, the shelves don't look overburdened But what we forget is that there are a heck of a lot more stores out there There has been a tremendous increase in the number of retail outlets as a part of this boom of the '80s So, the information at the level of the individual store may not be telling the whole story  Another concern, in the context of this confidence factor, is the other side of Dave Mullins's point about the stock market The stock market, of course, has been doing terrifically With all of these new offerings and stock prices holding up the numbers, it is actually one of the few things that probably are helping to maintain confidence But we have to remember that, by many conventional measures of PE ratios and things like that, the stock market is at a pretty high level given any kind of reasonable guess as to what near- term profits at least are going to be Now, of course, it may be that the stock market has really gotten smart and is looking through the near term to the longer-term implications of the restructurings and  -23-    12/17/91  other things that are going on, which could be a big plus [over time] Nevertheless, it is another area of concern  When I put all that together along with what everybody else has said, I can't take serious exception to the kind of forecast that Mike has in the Greenbook or that of my own staff in New York, which isn't all that different But I think the band of uncertainty is pretty wide, if for no other reason than that this confidence factor, as John LaWare says, really is the wild card   I support your position I'd just make a point that sounds absolutely preposterous in this environment Things could develop, even in 1992, where we could get surprised on the up side That sounds ridiculous right now, but let's not forget about that possibility   He thought he wrote you down on a piece of paper without [unintelligible]   I think there really are two issues here One is this question of what should be our strategy as a whole with regard to demands on the portfolio itself I think that's fundamentally what Peter's memorandum addresses For the reasons that a couple of people have already cited, including Don Kohn, it seems to me that the premium should in fact be on liquidity even though we may need it only once in ten or twenty years When we need it we better damn well have it! I think what Peter is suggesting is quite consistent with that I don't have a great deal of allergy to the average maturity going down a little more or slowing down What Peter suggested seems to me to make a lot of sense  Of course, the other question that looms in the background, which I think is different than a coherent longer-term strategy to    3/31/92  portfolio management, is this question of whether the System, by becoming more active in the long end of the market, could or should do something of a one-time nature to help somehow or other to tilt the yield curve down I don't think that issue [unintelligible] On that point, I have to say that I am increasingly skeptical I think Peter captured it right That the great danger here is that this holds out more than it could possibly deliver I ask myself again the question of why the long rate is so high and so sticky Peter gave the usual menu of explanations Now, I think they're all relevant, but I am coming more and more to the view that maybe it's not all that complicated The Treasury is selling $100 billion, give or take, of new debt into the market per quarter It doesn't matter whether some of it is cyclical deficit or RTC financing; it's still $100 billion a quarter And it's in a context in which for the past year to 18 months--this is Bob Parry's point--private credit demands have been virtually nonexistent, net I think part of what we're seeing now is [the realization that] if the economy starts to pick up and if the credit crunch is about to have run its course and private credit demands begin to increase even a little when we still have the $100 billion a quarter hanging over our heads--and in a context in which the appetite of the Japanese for American securities and Treasury securities in particular has changed very significantly and is not likely to reverse itself in the near term--the deck is stacked against us In those circumstances, I'd have to say that any overt effort to use our own portfolio management tactics and strategies to wiggle around the long-term rate would run a very sizable risk of backfiring I would be most reluctant in these circumstances to get ourselves back into that kind of position   Let me just start with a couple of rifle shots on individual points First of all, I do get the sense from business leaders and others that things feel better How pervasive or lasting it will be I think is still a big question But even among some of the CEOs of major companies that are notoriously bearish we do get reports of a quite discernible uptick in activity in orders in the past couple of months Upon reflection, I think a lot of what is showing, at least to date, seems to be directly or indirectly related to the pickup in housing activity and the more modest pickup in the auto sector But for what it's worth, even among the most notoriously bearish that comes across  -20-    3/31/92  Just an outlier point, to get back to something that Ted Truman mentioned in passing, I have to say, Mr Chairman, that I'm getting more anxious about the situation in Japan, both in economic and financial terms Some of that I think is for the reasons that Ted mentioned or alluded to, but just in the past few weeks I have had several [talks] with private-sector individuals on firemen's visits, and these guys are really bearish At least in memory, I've never heard Japanese CEOs from both financial and nonfinancial firms speak with the concern that comes across I don't know what to make of that, but I do think that situation is probably even more tenuous than perhaps the numbers themselves would indicate at this point   Well, that's part of what I mean Closer to home, as several others have said and as I've said at a couple of previous meetings at least about the greater New York area, commercial real estate in price terms and in rental rate terms does indeed seem to be firming   Firming, yes Now, as others have said, that doesn't mean the beginning of new projects And needless to say, this Olympia and York [situation] could queer that firming depending upon how that shakes itself out My sense of that right now is that while there is a lot of international exposure, it's sufficiently widely distributed and diversified that in and of itself it would not materially add to our problem The larger question is whether [Olympia and York] is having a liquidity problem or worse I fear it's probably worse And I think the danger, aside from the obvious point about creditor exposure, is that it could reverse the apparent stabilization or slight improvement in commercial real estate in a lot of places, not just in New York or London That's an uncertainty even if the credit exposure part of it can be effectively managed  On the banking side, loan demand is still quite clearly slack I think it's also fair to say that financial fundamentals do look slightly better, partly because the real estate situation has stopped getting worse Another point that's relevant is that at the moment it's probably fair to say that the fiscal threat is reduced but not eliminated by recognition of the real dangers of highly reckless fiscal policies   I was going to say that if we had a few of these Nobel laureates under a little better control I might feel a little better! Notwithstanding that, the risks there don't look to me to be as bad as I thought they would be  One last point I'd make in terms of the national outlook-- and Mike touched on this--is that the employment outlook is very important in our thinking about the forecast, partly for the psychological reasons that people have talked a lot about I do think this confidence issue is importantly rooted in uncertainties about  -21-    3/31/92  employment prospects But beyond that, as Mike said, it would be quite unrealistic to assume that we're going to finance even a modest rise in consumer spending with a decline in the saving rate In the Greenbook there is a tiny decline over the next couple of quarters If you look at our own forecast or Mike's forecast--in round numbers, Mike, you have growth of something like 800,000 Q4-to-Q4 in payroll employment, give or take Now, that number doesn't sound all that crazy; it's 65,000 to 75,000 a month on average Those are not horrendously big numbers And that gives me some confidence in the internal consistency of the forecast But I do think that the employment situation, both for psychological reasons and for income- flow reasons, is going to turn out to be very, very important Having said all of that and recognizing that there are a lot of crosscurrents out there, I personally feel that the staff forecast is a good one Despite all the problems, I think there's a reasonably good chance that we can see a pattern that looks very much like that over the course of the year   I would favor "B" asymmetric I basically come out there for two reasons First, I think the forecast that's on the table, as I said before, is fine as a forecast There are so many crosscurrents [producing] uncertainties that a slight hedge--that's how I would think of this asymmetry--makes some sense The other thing I have to say is that even before I heard Mr Kohn's latest M2 numbers, I was a little nervous about M2, not that I have ever pledged allegiance to that number My nervousness is in part because I don't understand it; I can't figure it out But beyond that, if M2 were systematically to tank again, it certainly would make our external relationships more difficult So, "B" asymmetric   I have no problem with the broad direction we're going, and I completely agree with the point on the structure of the balances But I have to say on the D-mark balance itself that if I extrapolate out this next $10 billion, I do have a    5/19/92  nagging sense of uneasiness that we might be getting to the point where there's some danger of being too thin   Not after the next [transaction], ie the further sales proposed by Tietmeyer   I make this observation knowing, and I think broadly sharing, the sentiment of the Committee There probably are only a few of us who were around in the late '70s when we had to approach the world hat in hand [to obtain needed foreign currency balances], and that was a very uncomfortable feeling I would not like to find us in that position again   I agree with what you're saying I just want introduce a little element of caution, that's all   Mr Chairman, as you are generally aware, I wanted to bring to the Committee's attention the fact that the multiple investigations of the Salomon Brothers incident from last summer may be coming to a head in the near future I say "may" because this is a very complex matter and things could change even at the eleventh hour I don't think I can characterize the bottom line of that process except to say that a major effort is being made by all of the official agencies--the US Attorney, the Justice Department, the SEC, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve--to act in a way that puts this unhappy event behind everybody in a coordinated fashion As I said, any number of things could change, including the most obvious --the precise timing But the specific issues of primary dealer status and the status of Salomon's relationship to the Treasury in a context of the bidding restrictions that they put on them last year will be addressed as well The intention is to try to address those issues in a context that is consistent with the entirety of a solution Again, I can't characterize the likely bottom line, because I still don't quite know what the pieces of that bottom line are, but I thought it important that the Committee be broadly aware that it seems likely, but by no means certain, that this could get put to bed in the near future   Well, first of all, Governor Lindsey, in the new guidelines there is a reference to the fact that if a firm pleads guilty or nolo contendere to a criminal charge, a sanction would follow automatically However, in Congressional testimony we went to rather great lengths to say that that specific provision would not necessarily apply ex post to the Salomon situation Therefore, even if a firm were not indicted for a criminal charge, we still would have the flexibility to impose a sanction even though that specific provision, which followed the event, is there But we were quite clear in saying that we did not feel that we were necessarily bound by that in the context of the events of last August   Thank you, Dick Governor Angell   In terms of the national economy, our forecast is very similar to what Mike talked about earlier today And as he indicated, and others have also, I also have a feeling that the risks are distinctly more balanced That seems broadly consistent with the kinds of things one hears on the anecdotal side with this nagging question about sustainability, which is a question that nags at me a little too But in talking with business people, especially to the multinationals, most of them are now saying that things are better and a few are saying that they're better with emphasis And that, I think, is different Several people have cited exports; again, the anecdotal comments from these companies are quite consistent with that in terms of being surprised at how well their export activity is holding up And as Ted or Mike or somebody said, a lot of it is to Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Japan  On the commercial real estate question, I have reported over several meetings a sense that the decline in prices in the New York area had abated and perhaps even bottomed out And I think I mentioned at least once that there were very specific transactions, quasi-auctions, for very large buildings where they had cleared the market I know of at least a couple of cases [of property] sold by banks where they cleared the market at prices that exceeded the charged down level on the books of the banks--in other words, the provisions which they had taken for [loan losses] Now, at least in the New York area--and someone may have touched on this when I was out of the room--I think the Olympia & York situation does cast a bit of a cloud over that Their total real estate in New York is enormous and I think it's a little too early to make a judgment on that But that could represent a further dent here, certainly in New York The jury is very, very much out so far as how that is going to play out As I said, that introduces a new element of uncertainty  Looking more broadly--a number of people have already touched on this and I don't want to beat a dead horse--let me comment on this inflation outlook issue If I look at the 1993 forecast that Mike has, 32 percent I think in the CPI ex food and energy, I sense that that is a reasonable number I think it is going to be darn hard to do better than that, and it's not so hard to see how we can do worse than that Again, and John LaWare touched on this, in a broader perspective of what has happened going back to 1988 in terms of the CPI ex food and energy, we've essentially gone out through 1993 in the forecast from a 4-1/2 percent core inflation rate to 32 percent So, we will have brought about, if you will, a 13 percentage point decline in core inflation And if you look at it in terms of cost, it's five years of cumulatively very modest growth at best; the last two years, 1992 and 1993, are a little better but for the five years as a whole, it's not much Now, if you look at M2--and I agree with a lot of people in that I think that's not the right thing to look at-- we will have had seven years of distinctly modest M2 growth going out  -27-    5/19/92  through 1993 What I keep coming back to here is that no matter what we look at we also have to look at what is underneath, such as compensation costs, productivity, and unit labor costs, and there's a lot of slippage there But when you go underneath, even if you look at it simply as arithmetic and not as economics, it's still hard to see--at least I find it hard to see--how we're going to do a heck of a lot better, if at all better, than that very costly process that we've seen over the last five years I don't think that should alter our commitment to work toward that goal of price stability, however that's defined But the evidence is rather overwhelming that this is a very slow, costly, tough, grinding out process I don't see much that's going to change that   Thank you, governor   "B" symmetric is fine with me And just a quick footnote I don't know when we'll have to tighten; it could be soon; it could be later But I'll tell you this If that judgment is reached in a context in which M2 is still on the floor, it's going to present a mighty tricky issue in terms of formulating the logic and the public relations to go with it And it's quite possible that that could happen   Right   Let me just make a further comment, partly in response to Bob Forrestal's and Dick Syron's point I think the sentiment of the Committee is quite well recognized I would say the Committee views intervention, however couched, with rather distinct displeasure, and that I think is clear enough But I don't consider the kind of thing that Bill tried to describe to be practically or philosophically out of character with that distinct Committee orientation I would say that if the orientation of the Committee is, to put it in its extreme form, that under under no circumstances could there ever be intervention for any reason, I think that is a potentially dangerous posture And while the orientation of the Committee is clear enough--I think it is well understood both within the Committee and in the markets--we have to be careful in terms of taking that orientation to the point where it is indeed seen as a statement of "never" because experience suggests that such a position is one that can come back to haunt us So, I recognize and accept the sentiment and the distinct orientation of the Committee, but I personally would not be comfortable with the logical extremis of that position that says "never" I try never to say "never"!   I think you're about right Actually, the point I was going to make builds on this Regardless of the precise legal authority in the relationship between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, I think when it comes to this area we also have to recognize as a practical matter that there are other players or partners involved--namely, the monetary authorities or central banks in other countries I think it's fair to say--and Ted or the Chairman or somebody has--that pretty much without exception the heads of all the major central banks probably in their own way would come pretty close to subscribing to the view that intervention over time doesn't do anything But I think as a group they would also certainly come pretty close to associating themselves with a hybrid point of    8/18/92  view that would incorporate some of what Bill said, some of what Wayne said, some of what the Chairman, and maybe some of what I said And I think I can say with absolute confidence that not one of them would associate themselves with the "never" school  So long as that is the case--and I suspect, frankly, that it will always be the case--it would be very, very difficult as a practical matter for us literally to go it alone in a context in which we must maintain these relationships Now, I think the evolving position of this Committee over the years has had an influence in shaping attitudes in other financial capitals on this very issue But I must say that in my judgment it would be rather naive, quite apart from our relationship with the Treasury, to say that we could literally go it alone without running some very, very high risks one way or the other that such an attitude or policy would come back to haunt us in spades It might not be on that issue but on some other issue So, putting all the theology aside, I think one has to be sensitive to these relationship questions Those relationship questions far transcend 15th Street or 14th Street or 16th Street, or wherever [the Treasury is located] So, there is also that very pragmatic aspect of this, which is one of the reasons why I subscribe to that "never say never" school   Second    I'll start out by saying that while I agree with a lot of what John LaWare said, I'd make an argument that at the very least the patient is out of intensive care I think we have made some progress As far as the national outlook is concerned, our people see it pretty much as their Board staff associates do with the one exception, as has already been discussed, being the unemployment rate And that, as has been suggested, is probably a crapshoot Our people have it more in the 7-1/2 percent range at the end of next year But the point is that regardless of whether it's 7 percent or something north of 7 percent, even taking the Board staff's forecast means nine consecutive quarters in which the unemployment rate will have been 7 percent or higher There have been multiple comments about the gloomy atmosphere and, obviously, that [unemployment rate] in itself has a lot to do with it A number of people have directly or indirectly touched on what is called a very broad political landscape; undoubtedly that has something to do with it too But whatever weight one wants to put on those or other factors, I think the tone is pretty darn sour out there  In terms of some of the underlying issues, the budget outlook even without any new magic is actually worse in the out years; on the basis of these latest figures some of that obviously reflects the level of economic activity itself, but it's not just the level of economic activity A number of people have said that the inflation outlook is better; it is A number of people have also said that price increases are not on the horizon or the radar scope for anybody, especially in manufacturing I guess that's true except for the auto industry I never quite understand those guys!  On the anecdotal side and the District side, I wish I had some brilliant new insight to offer but I don't It's really just more of the same I do think, as everybody has said one way or another, that we have this Catch-22 situation Productivity is better, profits are better, and costs are better; but in part because those things are better, employment is worse, income is worse, and attitudes are worse I think that to a very large degree is a result of cumulative pressures My own sense of it, trying to put it all together, is that on net the risks are about balanced That's about all I have to say, Mr Chairman   "B" asymmetric is fine with me   Move it   I move it   Well, it's almost time for dinner, so I'll be brief First of all, I don't see anything new on the economic outlook that differs from the bulk of what has been said around the table I do think that attitudes have gotten at least a bit more glum I put a lot of weight on Mike Prell's simultaneity paradox of linkages or reverse linkages among income, employment, and spending, especially in a context in which the saving rate is already very low and we're not going to get any more spending through a reduction in the saving rate I think there is superimposed on top of that a whole lot of concerns that intensify those things that are somewhat easy to identify--some of them political, some of them involving a growing recognition that out there in the great beyond there is a very large, very expensive series of national economic problems that are going to have to be dealt with in a context in which there are vast social problems that also have to be dealt with And I think people worry about that So, as I said, the bottom line in terms of the outlook is more of the same with, if anything, a tilt toward a bit more concern and a bit more sour expectations  I agree with those who said that inflation in some sense is a non-issue, whether it's measured correctly or not I also agree with those who are saying that whether the Fed does something now or next week is not going to have a whole lot of adverse implications for so- called Fed credibility on inflation The inflation outlook is a lot better, but it is a lot better because we're going to have 16, 17, or 18 straight quarters with an unemployment rate above 6-1/2 percent and 11 or 12 quarters with an unemployment rate above 7 percent There's no magic to it at all We have better inflation the old fashioned way We paid for it I do have some sympathy, though, with Jerry Jordan's comment or quandary as to why nobody quite believes there is at least a fighting chance of preserving that [progress on inflation] over time  The main point I want to make--and others have said it in slightly different ways--is that we do have a renewed case of the financial jitters out there It's not all that hard to explain why that's there I do think the principal points of vulnerability are  -39-    10/6/92  the stock market and the exchange market But I don't think anybody is even remotely clairvoyant enough to be able to anticipate through what channels a disturbance might work itself into those markets And that was the thrust of Bill McDonough's comments, if I can put words in his mouth I also do not think that a modest change or even a big change in monetary policy in the direction of ease right now is going to forestall the possibility that one of those disturbances might happen It won't work that way; if anything, it might work the other way But it will not work in the direction of forestalling it  I agree with a number of comments that have been made that if something starts to tilt the wrong way, the situation could get pretty messy Ed Boehne's comment about four hours ago about limited tools in a foreign exchange situation is quite valid But having said that, it is potentially dicey I think it's important to recognize, as a number of people have said, that major banks and major nonbank financial institutions in the United States, with one or two obvious exceptions, are in a much stronger condition today than they were in 1990, or in '87 or '84 or '82; and that's a plus What is not a plus is that the second-tier institutions, especially nonbanks, are in weaker condition And it's also important to recognize that if we get into one of these [situations], all institutions are going to be a lot more defensive That may be good news in one sense, but it's bad news in another sense in that it makes it that much more difficult to deal with them So, no matter what the Committee in its wisdom decides about near-term monetary policy in the conventional meaning of the word, I think that decision should be couched in a context in which it is implicitly understood that in the period ahead there could be circumstances in which the Desk or Desks will need at least a margin of greater flexibility  In terms of monetary policy in conventional terms, I am very much of the view that for a variety of reasons the better course of action, at least for the moment, would be to "maintain" I'd have a distinctly asymmetric bias but I would not do anything But above all, whatever the Committee decides about policy as a whole, we need to recognize that there could be circumstances where on a day-to-day basis an extra margin of flexibility is going to have to be built in I don't think that has to be part of the directive, but it has to be recognized   Your prescription is fine with me, Mr Chairman   That's right   Most of my colleagues have probably seen The New York Times this morning There's an article of enormous consequence on the front page For those who haven't seen it, I thought I should share it with you to make sure that these proceedings go forward on a liturgically sound basis The article reports that for the first time in more than four centuries the Roman Catholic Church today issued a new universal catechism which, among other things, identifies a range of new sins that are the product of modern- day society Among the sins defined in the new catechism are tax evasion, drug abuse, mistreatment of immigrants, abuse of the environment, artificial insemination, genetic engineering, and financial speculation I don't know about the rest of you, but I've got to get me one of those! I can see it now When Gretchen and Joan and Bill go to confession they're going to have to make sure that the confessor understands the difference between hedging and speculation   Second   I move it   I'll move them both   Let me start with either the television or the literal verbatim transcript It does seem to me that--   Speaking first to the issue of live television and verbatim transcripts It seems to me that we can make a very, very compelling case that in the normal course of this Committee's deliberations there are frequent occasions on which matters pertaining to individual companies--say, General Motors or IBM--come up in discussion in a way that, if it were on television, would be very damaging The result, of course, would be that they wouldn't come up Much more importantly, there are often discussions about individual financial institutions; but still more importantly, there are often discussions centering around information that is provided to one or more of us by central bank governors and other governmental officials abroad, and those people would be absolutely enraged if that kind of information were part of any public discussion So, it does seem to me that just on those grounds alone we can make a very powerful, entirely credible argument against live television or verbatim minutes My guess is that if we could get that off the table, then it might be a little easier for the Committee to wrestle with the question of some kind of [record such as the old memoranda of discussion] I might add--I don't know if you knew this, Ted--just looking at these memoranda of discussion for 1974, these published minutes include the write-ups of the Basle governors meetings They include write-ups of visits of individual Board members to other countries and other central banks People might have agreed to that in 1974, but today, no way    11/17/92   There's some pretty lively stuff in here, though, from those BIS meetings   I agree completely with that What we have to try to do is to protect the deliberative process Forgetting about which letter has to be responded to, it seems to me that there are four broad alternatives on the table One is to acquiesce to the television and verbatim minutes That to me is a non-starter I think that destroys the deliberative process and on top of that has the other problem that I mentioned before about confidentiality and all the rest The second alternative is something like the memoranda of discussion with a lag of a year or two or three My own hunch is that we could probably live with that, but it's a helluva lot of work   But in an edited version with a long enough lag, I think it probably isn't fatal to the deliberative process The third alternative is Mr Melzer's and that is just to say that what we're doing is the best arrangement, which is where I would actually come out The fourth alternative is the one several have suggested and that is to try to speed up some part of the release process I could probably associate myself with the kind of thing that you suggested where in addition to what we now release right away we would make [any action we take] official; Mr Coyne would put out a statement when Mr McDonough lowers the federal funds rate confirming that it has been done and maybe even put in a sentence or two explaining why it was done But from my point of view releasing something like the current policy directive at any stretch in an intermeeting period--whether it's two weeks, four weeks or the day after the meeting--I think is going to compromise the deliberative process irreparably I'd much rather do this   Yes, that's the killer   What would happen because of that is that all these Solomon-like decisions we make about asymmetry, symmetry, and the ability for the Chairman to act in intermeeting intervals would be shot We would be sitting here until midnight at every meeting trying to figure out how to get a true consensus So, one way or another, it would damage the process Either the process would stop working as it now works or we would get market whiplash effects Either way, it's a loser I just don't see how we can truly preserve the deliberative process as we know it in a context in which we would release the policy record as we now do it at any point in an intermeeting interval I'd rather do a memorandum of discussion than that But I could associate myself with the suggestion that you made I'm inclined to think--Don Winn would know better than most of us-- that that might in fact be seen as a significant gesture on our part   What I'm saying is that to release the policy record as it now exists at any point in an intermeeting interval--it doesn't matter whether it's a day, a week, two weeks, three weeks [after a meeting]--will in my judgment compromise the process   The Chairman made the proposal What I think I heard him say was that as things stand now When the Board cuts the discount rate, it [announces] it; when it changes reserve requirements, it [announces] it If the Chairman or the Committee made a decision between meetings to lower the funds rate, we would put out a statement that morning saying the Federal Reserve today eased reserve conditions and as a consequence of this the federal funds rate went down   No, that's the wrong question The question ought to be What is the cost?   That's the issue There's a benefit too, Dave The benefit is that it takes away this perception that it's the Wall Street insiders who benefit from their Fed watching activities to the exclusion of other segments of society That's the benefit   I would do the same thing--the next morning, though   It's not always clear   May I ask Do you have any particular insights you can share with regard to the intermediate-term situation at General Motors? We are now getting a sense that at least some of the financial people are going through a very fundamental reappraisal of the prospects for General Motors over time I don't know whether there's anything to that other than people just going through the exercise The other question I wanted to raise is Do you see from your vantage point any near-term possibility that GM or GMAC could start to run into problems in terms of rolling over the tremendous amount of commercial paper they have out in the marketplace?   Between GM and GMAC what do they have--something like $20 billion of commercial paper outstanding?    11/17/92   I don't have a lot to add to what has been said around the table I think things do feel a little better, as most have observed I would side with those who also have observed that it's probably a little premature to declare victory But certainly both the performance [of the economy] and the outlook are better than many had expected a couple of months ago There are, as Governor Mullins and others have noted, some scattered signs of pickup in commercial loan demand, which is something we haven't seen for a long, long time Going back to the Ninth Federal Reserve District, I can confirm that there will be at least one housing start in Montana in November because I caused it All in all, my observations and sentiments are pretty much in line with what has been said around the table  The point that Dave [Mullins] was making regarding attitudes about inflation and price stability having changed is very interesting We had our academic panel into the Bank a couple of weeks ago This is a pretty good group of people and a good cross section in terms of philosophies and ideologies There was just no sympathy at all from any of those people for doing anything to try to drive the core inflation rate down from a 3 percent level That didn't surprise me coming from some of the fellows in Mr Syron's neck of the woods, but there were among this group a couple of real old line, very conservative monetarists--people like Phil Cagan for example--and even he didn't want to hear it And that is a change in attitude Now, fortunately, these people aren't the only arbiters in this area, but it is interesting, given where we are today, that the perceptions about the costs of trying to engineer further reductions in the core inflation rate are clearly viewed a little differently today than they were several years ago  The only other thing I wanted to mention, Mr Chairman--and maybe Ted Truman could help me out here--is that my assessment of the outlook in Germany and Japan over the next three to six quarters is really pretty grim It's not at all inconceivable to me that performance in both of those countries could be distinctly south of  -18-    11/17/92  the current IMF or OECD forecasts That possibility has obvious implications for our economy in terms of the outlook for both exports and imports, but it also seems to me to raise some second-level dangers, including those on the financial side and perhaps especially on the trade side Ted, I wonder if you would share with me and the others your sense as to whether that admittedly quite pessimistic possibility is something that we should be worried about   Hardly a venial sin! [Laughter]   With regard to current policy, my preference is for "B" symmetric, but I think something has changed Over the summer months, getting back to my own example, I was fearful that we were looking at a 1-1/2 percent or worse economy and now I feel a good deal more comfortable that we're looking at a 2-1/2 percent economy But I've always felt in this transition period that that was acceptable Now, having said that, I prefer "B" symmetric; I could live with asymmetric because of my own anxieties about the international side There is an extra margin of vulnerability there, and for that reason alone I could live with an asymmetric "B"  The long-run ranges present a much more difficult problem There's a logical conundrum here If one took the position that this is totally or largely a technical phenomenon, then I don't think it matters a whole lot whether we cut the ranges now or in February And if it's technical, it's technical Some members are essentially arguing that it is technical; others are arguing that it's quasi- technical; and still others are arguing that it's substantive That is the logical dilemma I think an awful lot depends, Mr Chairman, upon how you feel as Chairman you want to play this   Well, I tend to agree with that And if one agrees with that, then it follows almost as a matter of logical necessity that it's probably better to do it in February That is in part because of Mike Kelley's argument that if we do it before February, nobody--the markets, the press, or anybody else--is going to get it right And then we would have lost our moment In addition, I did find persuasive a number of comments that members made about the way this plays into the setting of a new Administration, a new fiscal program, and all the rest of it But again, if you fundamentally view it as technical, it seems to me that the weight of that argument is dissipated as well Finally, apropos Bob Parry's comment, if you fundamentally view it as technical, don't kid yourself, you're not going to buy anything in terms of inflationary expectations or anything else You can't have it both ways But  -41-    11/17/92  because I do view it perhaps not quite exclusively but largely as technical, I would lean toward doing it in February As far as the amount is concerned, I can't get excited about 1/2 points one way or the other on this I certainly could live with 2 to 6 percent but I could also live with 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent; I'm not sufficiently comfortable with my knowledge to be able to get excited one way or another about that half point [difference] Again, from a logical point of view, the issue is whether it is technical or substantive If it's technical, then, I think the February timing falls out [as logical]   We could have an understanding among the Committee members   [We could agree] that in response to the Gonzalez letter the study would be sent up to the Hill with a very strong suggestion in [our cover] letter to the effect that the ranges for 1993 will be cut in February by some unspecified amount   I would accept asymmetric because of my concern about the international side   What I specifically said was that my preference was symmetric, but in view of my own concerns about the weight of the international side I would accept asymmetric   I'll move it  SPEAKER(?) Second   I move it   Obviously, we knew what happened to the gold, but I don't think we knew what it did to exports   Well, I'm not even going to try to answer that In this particular case I know what happened, so I think the description you have is correct   Well, as far as the outlook is concerned, our forecast is essentially the same as Mike's, so I think that's a reasonable point of departure The export sector probably is the area that I would worry about most in terms of a conventional    12/22/92  assessment of the forecast On the anecdotal side, there are a couple of things I want to mention briefly First, in the case of very large multinational corporations--and I'm not limiting this at all to IBM-- it's quite clear to me from the comments I get from CEOs that this restructuring process has not run its course That still has a ways to go IBM may be symptomatic of that, but I'm getting that from CEOs of other very, very big companies as well Second, from the anecdotal area, there is some life in loan demand out there It's not pervasive and it's not robust, but it is there And consistent with a number of comments others have made about retail sales and so on, some very large credit card issuers, bank and nonbank alike, are telling me that credit card usage really is up Interestingly enough, even though usage is up, paydowns continue and payments against usage are coming much faster than they have in the past so that among other things the levels of card usage debt are probably not capturing fully the rate of card usage in the past four to six weeks  In the commercial real estate area, I want to echo something Ed Boehne said earlier We still are getting anecdotal reports that suggest that price declines probably have bottomed out and that rental rates and concessions are probably bottoming out However, I have just heard for the first time over the past couple of weeks that some people are adding on to the length of the work-out process The reason is because they are becoming more aware of rather large pockets of space currently under lease that have been essentially vacated as employment levels have been reduced, in the financial sector in particular That means that these various statistics of vacancy rates aren't telling the whole story As a result of that there is a bit, not major, of adding on--quarters as opposed to years--in terms of the work-out process Another thing about this burst of confidence, if that's what it is, is that I think the election phenomenon has something to do with it   I think that's part of it, but what has fed on that a little is that a lot of people, including red blooded Republican businessmen and women, are very impressed by what they seem to [observe] The problem is that if what you get is not what you see, that process of feeling good can reverse itself very quickly So, I think one has to be a bit cautious about that My own sense of the risks [to the economic outlook] is a little hard to describe because I don't think of the risks in quite conventional terms I think there is something greater than a zero possibility that all of this could turn out to be another flash in the pan But I don't view those risks as high, which is another way of saying that I think there is a little more to this, barring a big disappointment on the fiscal budgetary side, than we've seen in the past But consistent with what Gary Stern and several others have said, it's not hard for me to visualize circumstances in which growth over, say, the next four or five quarters could be stronger than projected in the Greenbook I wouldn't bet my life on that, but it isn't hard for me to see circumstances in which that could in fact materialize, especially if this burst of confidence is bolstered by what turns out to be sound national policies, including budgetary policies So, I have a little trouble trying to balance the risks because in one sense I don't think they lend themselves to any kind of statistical  -20-    12/22/92  probability basis; but I certainly would not rule out the possibility that the economy could actually turn out to be a bit stronger even though, as I say, I do not consider the risk to be zero that it could fall on its face again   "B" symmetric   Dave, I think it's a good idea to do this I have the same question about the executive summary I think that could end up competing with the good and noble purpose   I think the worst case with the executive summary is that we'd have to have a meeting between the meetings to agree on the language of the summary   Second   Second   I have very little to add in terms of anecdotal-type insights I think the tone at the moment is better Nowadays when one talks to business leaders and community leaders about a 3 percent economy they no longer look at you as though you're from Mars But having said that, I don't find many, especially among the big firms--for the reasons that Dick Syron mentioned--talking about even 3 percent being a shoe-in But at least there is a clear central tendency of popular opinion It's hard, whether from an anecdotal base or empirical base, to disagree with the kind of outlook that Mike has in the Greenbook, and I would not But I still have this nagging sense of unease that things are either going to be better or worse than that rather benign forecast, and I can't decide which way it's going to be I do very much associate myself with the comments that Bob Forrestal and Gary Stern made about some of the intermediate- to longer-term problems or potential problems that are sitting out there Indeed, some of those things could turn out to be more imminent rather than further down the road than we suspect right now And I think one has to stay at least sensitive to those  Like Dave Mullins, I cannot bring myself simply to dismiss these latest inflation numbers as nothing more than an aberration Like Dave and others, if I look at the fundamentals it's very tempting to say it's just an aberration But it's hard to dismiss Now, one thing these numbers have done already is to make it a lot harder just to stand there and confidently say to somebody that, looking out over '93 or '94, the inflation rate is going to continue to edge down even as the economy does much better You get the feeling that maybe your nose is growing as you say that And that in its own small way is one of the reasons why I find it hard to dismiss those numbers out of hand Partly for that reason but for some other reasons as well--and notwithstanding all that has been said including by my distinguished colleagues from Liberty Street--I think this long bond rally is vulnerable I think we could see a turnaround in the long bond market And I say that partly because of that nagging sense of uneasiness about inflation, but I want to go a bit further on that  It's quite right, of course, to take the indisputable view that the long-bond rate has a real component and an inflation expectations component That's the Bible But I don't think it's quite right to argue that the dynamics of the marketplace as reflected in the prices of those bonds in periods of 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 months dissect quite that neatly and easily in terms of what's driving investors, especially when the so-called professional investors have missed the whole thing as Bill McDonough said When you look at the behavior of the bond market over the last 5 or 6 months, I think you have to allow at least for a phenomenon that isn't quite as neat and precise economically and logically as we'd all wish it to be For example, you could put this on one of three levels coming out of the period of the election There's one very, very unsophisticated view of things that simply says people started to feel better; I don't quite know why, but they began to feel better And there's a slightly more sophisticated version of that, which to me seems consistent with Gary Stern's comment, that says "Well, at least fiscal policy is getting into the ball game here" It has been on the sidelines for 12 years and they don't quite know what it's going to do, but it's going to make things a little better no matter what And then, of course,  -26-    3/23/93  there is the more sophisticated view that I think Al Broaddus brought up very early in the meeting and that is the net result of the Clinton package and all the rest leading to the view that there's distinctly less of a threat of forced monetization of debt over time and that is what's working its way back into inflationary expectations and fiscal policy being on the table and so forth Now, having said that, I don't know where the truth lies I don't think anybody knows where the truth lies But if for any reason--and I'll get to the reasons in a minute--the public at large or the marketplace in particular conclude that something on the order of magnitude of the deficit reduction that is thought to be on the table cannot or will not be attained or that the whole program whether you like it or not is up for grabs, I think that bond market could turn around with a vengeance and in a hurry  Unfortunately, my own comfort level with those prospects is not as strong as I'd like it to be Just as an example, if everything went according to Hoyle in the context of the deficit reduction effort and economic assumptions were perfect and there were no technical mis- estimates, Medicare and Medicaid costs alone behaving over the next three years or four years like they behaved over the past two years could easily offset most or all of the deficit reduction part of the Clinton plan So, I don't think that [deficit reduction] is a shoe-in by a long shot Now, I'm not ready to throw in the towel either I think this is the best chance that we've had in many, many years to get some of this stuff done But if there is disappointment in how it begins to evolve in practice, there are going to be a lot of people scratching their heads asking "Where did that wonderful rally in long bonds go?" I don't think it's secure by a long shot So, again, I am essentially as comfortable as I can be with the kind of outlook shown in the Greenbook, but I must say that the multiple sources of my uneasiness about how things may in fact work out are no less today than they were two months ago   I, too, would support alternative B, symmetric Again, in the face of all these conflicting signals, I think we have to go back and look at the fundamentals And the fundamentals, as best I can judge them, are still okay even though the risks have changed Again, in the context of Governor Angell's earlier point, I don't remember '68 or '69, but I do remember '84 and '87 I might add '88; I think '88 was a watershed, too In all three of those cases I was on the same side of the ledger, whatever that's worth, but in all three of those cases I had some conviction about the economy itself I might feel differently six weeks from now but at least at this moment I still don't have that conviction about [where] the real economy [is going] And it's for that reason that I prefer to stay where we are at least for a little while longer   I'd say that was "C" symmetric!   I move it   So moved   I also assume that if something really ugly happens that has nothing to do with the things we're talking about here, you will always have--   You're talking about expectations in general?   I'll try to do this in three sentences First, my instincts about the real economy have not changed much; Governor Mullins was on the mark there But as I've said at several meetings running, I still do not have any great conviction about the future in terms of the real economy I still think it could be stronger, but it could be weaker; I just don't have that conviction I want to second very strongly the comment you made at the outset of the meeting, Mr Chairman, about the situation in Europe I was not, as you know, at that last Basle meeting, but the string of visitors who passed through after the Interim Committee meeting, both on the official side and the private side, were gloomy across the board I mean really gloomy The third point is that I don't understand this inflation situation any better than anybody else does I think we cannot dismiss it as simply broccoli prices and  -37-    5/18/93  other wholly transitory things On the other hand, I do still think that economic fundamentals matter And while I probably am not as hopeful as Mike Prell, I don't think I'm quite as gloomy as some others appear to be in terms of where we are going But I agree that it is a changed situation   Let me make a factual observation and then a comment--not that we should let facts get in the way of these things On this inflation issue, the question, aside from the diagnostics of what is causing it, is really Where are we? It's clear that achieving the further progress toward price stability that everyone is hoping for in 1993 looks a bit remote at this point But the other side of the question is that while we may not be doing as well as we hoped, are we doing as badly as we think? Of that I'm not so sure, so I think a little perspective here might be useful Look at the core CPI in the first and second quarters of the years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993 In '90 it was 53 and 55 percent; in '91 it was 65 and 38 percent; in '92 it was 42 and 33 percent; in '93 it is 41 percent and--if you take the Greenbook [projection for the second quarter], which I'm quite prepared to do--33 percent Now, that's not what we had hoped for Again, Wayne or David made the point that the number reported in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony as the central tendency of the Committee was 2-1/2 to 3 percent or something like that So, in that sense things aren't working out as well as we had hoped But at least to date I'm not yet quite persuaded that the genie is out of the bottle If you look at the experience at least so far, while there's no question it's not what we want it to be, I'm not so sure that I'm personally ready to concede the point that all is lost I don't think it is  -44-    5/18/93  Now, on the question of procedure First of all, under any circumstance I have always believed that no matter what we do we've always got to leave the Chairman with maneuvering room I don't care whether the directive is asymmetric or symmetric; to me that's irrelevant There always has to be that powerful, powerful prejudice that leaves the Chairman with flexibility when he needs it Having said that, and putting aside my own views about policy which will come later, in my mind's eye one argument for an asymmetric directive that I don't think has yet been mentioned--it has nothing to do with process--is that if it turns out that things do start to look a little better, we're going to look a lot better by virtue of having that asymmetric directive on the record   If overall performance starts to look better in terms of the economy, inflation, or both, and that asymmetric directive is on the record, I think institutionally that makes us look better In other words the signal is still there that we weren't insensitive to what was going on   Yes, we saw the bear in the woods; he went back to hibernate but we saw the SOB This seems to me to be a win/win [situation] because if on the other hand it turns out that things aren't so good--that the bear is out in the corn field or the back yard--and we have an asymmetric directive that we've utilized, we're better off as well So, putting aside all of these complicated questions of process, I think those arguments should be part of the picture As a matter of fact, I think the substantive arguments are more important in this setting than are the process arguments   Si, just to emphasize in case I wasn't clear, I agree with you There's no question that with or without asymmetry the Chairman always has a margin of flexibility I was trying to suggest that on the issue of whether to prefer symmetric or asymmetric--not that they are the only possibilities but just focusing on those two--the substantive [reason] for having an asymmetric directive is that no matter what happens, if things get worse or if things get better, the Committee is at that point on the record as having been vigilant and alert   I'm quite comfortable with "B" asymmetric I might say, if I could just add a word on process which I know you want to deal with separately, that if it turns out that the Committee does come to a consensus that a tightening move is needed in the foreseeable future, of course, I won't be a part of that decision But leaving that aside, if a tightening move is needed any time between now and the next meeting, that will be one of the relative handful of watershed policy decisions that come along This is not a "gimme putt" Indeed, it's probably [a watershed decision] not just because it would be a turning point but because of the environment in which it is going to happen, if it happens So, I think there's a great deal of wisdom in the suggestion that several people have made that if you do that, you better do it right with a meeting of the Committee by telephone or otherwise and by a vote
