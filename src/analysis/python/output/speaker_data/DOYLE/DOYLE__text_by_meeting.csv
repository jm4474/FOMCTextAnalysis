1281,1979-10-22,DOYLE," This is Doyle substituting for Mayo We support  your recormnendation, Mr Chairman, feeling that it is far too early--  despite the tenseness on the scene today--to do anything differently  We certainly would wait through at least this week  "
1514,1980-06-05,DOYLE, Yes 
1677,1980-11-18,DOYLE," Thank you, Mr Chairman There have been two prominent themes in the discussion so far, and I certainly would emphasize that there is some inherent conflict between what to do about the uncertainties on the one hand and what to do about the credibility issue on the other The uncertainties question, as Governor Partee and others have already pointed out, may be changing from that status to something closer to [a real threat] in terms of the energy situation I believe the reaction to movement in either direction on that is difficult to determine That is, if a change does occur or is suggested in either direction, it's hard to say just how the market or anybody else would react in terms of dealing with these uncertainties that I don't believe are perceived by the markets generally at the present time On the credibility side, I might suggest that the issue may not be that we have a credibility problem but that we don't have one In fact, I think the public and market perception of the Federal Reserve, as someone else has just suggested, is that we are the only game in town and that we are doing the job right Therefore, I would not like to see any further slippage from the targets that were [adopted] last month I believe it would have a severe credibility [impact] and would produce some negative reactions Therefore, I would support alternative B with some slight narrowing of the funds range, perhaps to 13 to 17 percent "
1849,1981-03-31,DOYLE," Mr Chairman, as many others have today, I come out on the gloomy side of the forecast on the real economy The principal reason for that is that it's just inescapable in our District to come to any other conclusion I know that the plight of the automobile industry has been widely acknowledged, but I think it's important that the impact of that industry and the state it is in be seen in terms of what it does to us in the Seventh District For example, there are all kinds of numbers on just what the employment base is, but I will cite just a couple of observations about that Even little American Motors, which I think had less than 2 percent of the market last year, is the largest single employer in the state of Wisconsin While hundreds of thousands of jobs have gone down on the production side, their board just recently announced that they have terminated 60,000 salaried employees, and a cut into the staffing side is quite a change The second point is that the plight of Chrysler, I think, has tended to overshadow somewhat some of the problems throughout the rest of the industry Of all of the automobiles sold in the country last year--just the domestic models--Ford only had two models in the top ten, and one of those was the Pinto which is no longer made One has to go all the way down to about the 21st rank before we find the car that used to be the number two and number one best seller in the country the large size Ford The most difficult aspect, however, is the future The industry has always been a cyclical one and it has always been optimistic But it is extremely pessimistic I think that relates primarily to two things One is the difference in wage [costs] as they perceive them between the imports and the domestic models While those figures again are all over the board, they could be greatly understated if we take into account such factors as absenteeism and other benefits for the American worker And the second is the growing conviction among the domestic automakers--and we hear this more all the time--that the large car must come back in order for them to survive They are convinced that, given the choice between a high-priced small car and a high-priced larger car, the consumer is going to take that large car  -44-    3/31/81  I'm not saying they're right; I'm merely reporting how they feel about it But if they are wrong, that will have a very serious impact down the road  Despite that, there are some bright spots in our area, particularly in steel and capital goods But on balance, and despite the suggestion--and certainly our directors feel very strongly about this--that we should be easing economic policy, strong inflationary pressures still persist That's particularly true in agriculture, where we probably have been lucky so far as price increases are concerned, as others have commented here We possibly will see continued upward pressures on prices toward the end of the year And beyond that, any arguments toward easing tend to focus more on the cost of money In fact, I think many of us feel the reason why automobiles, for example, are not selling is because of the prices rather the cost of money borrowed to acquire them So, on balance, I would concur with alternative B "
1874,1981-04-28,DOYLE," This is Dan Doyle in Chicago I would certainly agree with the general direction here, but I have to point out like a broken record that this part of the country in particular, as it reflects the auto industry and housing, is still in a very bearish situation And, if anything, those sales numbers are expected to deteriorate rather markedly over the next several weeks "
1915,1981-05-18,DOYLE," Sorry to add to that, Mr Chairman The automobile industry is still in a very depressed state in our District and its influence is quite pervasive Even though production has been up quite a bit lately, largely associated with the introduction of some new models, no one I talked with really expects much of a turnaround in that area at all There now seem to be increased concerns spreading somewhat to the rural areas The banks are highly liquid, but high interest rates are discouraging borrowers and we tend to hear more and more from this particular sector recently The drought has ended in the Middle West and it has brought with it some rather interesting revisions in estimates of food price [increases] for this year, which are expected to be somewhat less than the USDA projections--say, somewhere around 10 or 11 percent rather than up in the 11 to 12 percent range  Mr Chairman, it's very difficult for me not to be influenced by the state of the economy in the Seventh Federal Reserve District, particularly the credit-sensitive industries, which are extremely depressed Every day the feeling seems to be growing that the risks are greater that some of these industries may not recover their former strength Hence, I would favor alternative A but I could reluctantly support alternative B  -35-    5/18/81 "
8071,2007-01-30,DOYLE,"  As Dave has explained, policy committees at central banks may   choose to produce and publish one of several different types of forecasts— centralized, coordinated, or independent—or they may choose to release a staff  forecast  In the table at the top of exhibit 4, columns A, B, and C show some of the  forecast publication choices of the central banks discussed in the International  Finance Division background paper  Seven central banks publish a centralized  forecast; one, a coordinated forecast; and one, a staff forecast  In my portion of the  presentation, I will first address some factors (shown in the last four columns) that  appear to be associated with these choices     By our reckoning, the first central bank shown, the Reserve Bank of New   Zealand, possesses the characteristics that would most likely lead to a centralized  forecast without dissent [laughter] It has a small policy committee, composed of only  the governor (which does tend to limit dissent); hence its committee is located in the  same place, and its head bears sole responsibility for monetary policy  The other  central banks that produce a centralized forecast without dissents (shown in rows 2 to  5 of the table) share many of these characteristics  In Canada (row 3), as in New  Zealand, the central bank head has primary responsibility for monetary policy  In  other cases, such as Australia and Norway (rows 4 and 5), external members, who  have no executive functions, mainly participate at the monetary policy meeting,  leaving the remaining members a larger role in producing the forecast     The Swedish Riksbank and the Bank of England have members who all play a   more equal role in shaping monetary policy  These banks also publish a centralized  forecast, but they recognize members’ dissents from the central forecast in their  published minutes  The Bank of England has a larger committee than the first six  banks shown  The entire committee is involved in the production of each forecast,  and with the larger committee size, the process takes about four weeks, including  many meetings to decide on the details of the projection   January 30-31, 2007 136 of 255      All seven central banks that publish a centralized forecast also release a single   narrative of the forecast to the public  However, their choices vary about the features  of the forecast, such as the presentation of uncertainty and the treatment of policy  rates  Three of these central banks—the Norges Bank, the Riksbank, and the Bank of  England—publish “fan” charts that convey the policymakers’ collective view on the  distribution of possible outcomes  Others describe uncertainty around their central  forecast through their discussion of risks or through alternative scenarios  As shown  in column C, some central banks choose to publish their own forecast for the  appropriate path of interest rates rather than conditioning their forecast on a specified  path, such as a flat path for the policy rate or one based on market expectations     In contrast to the Bank of England, the two other central banks with relatively   large committees—the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank—do not  publish centralized forecasts  To reflect the diversity of its nine policy board  members’ views, the Bank of Japan publishes the range and the central tendency of  their forecasts, along with the median  These forecasts are coordinated because the  board members base their forecasts on a path of interest rates consistent with market  quotes  These forecast statistics are published with a description of the outlook,  which is drafted by the staff with board input and then voted on by the board  Board  members may register (with attribution) their dissent from the description of the  forecast in the minutes of the policy meeting  The ECB’s policy committee—which  includes twelve members from the national central banks, who are located throughout  the euro area—does not publish any forecast of its own but releases its staff forecast  instead  The staff forecast is not voted on by the governing council, and its standing  with respect to policy decisions is not clear     As outlined in the bullets in the bottom panel, despite the different choices of   these central banks, their publication of economic forecasts is generally regarded as  useful  The central banks say that publication has eased communication  Many  central banks have started publishing forecasts, none of these has stopped, and most  have increased the extent of detail reported  Most observers agree that published  forecasts have improved communication and facilitated accountability  Many have  commented favorably on the quality of forecast publications  Overall, commentary  on the publication of forecasts by both producers and consumers is quite positive     However, we have found very little econometric work that specifically evaluates   whether publishing forecasts has improved monetary policy communication or  economic outcomes  The publication of forecasts has nearly always been part of a  package  Attempts to detect major positive or negative effects of adopting such  packages have met with little success  Limited evidence suggests that their adoption  may have helped anchor inflation expectations, but whether the publication of  forecasts has made an independent contribution is unknown  A few event studies  have found that the release of forecasts has some effect on interest rates and other  financial variables  On balance, existing econometric evidence does not provide a   January 30-31, 2007 137 of 255    firm basis for assessing the cost and benefits of publishing forecasts  Vincent will  now complete our presentation      They would be a combination of market participants, academics, and anyone   with an interest in what central banks do or say    Unfortunately it is    Certainly  Other central banks have multiple objectives  Some that are   specifically stated are the ones that the Federal Reserve has stated  maximum employment and   stable prices  I’m not sure, but some are quite close in terms of keeping inflation low and watching   output as well  "
