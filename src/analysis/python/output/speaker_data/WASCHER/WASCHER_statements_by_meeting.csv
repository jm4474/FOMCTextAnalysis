8087,2007-01-30,"  The top panel of exhibit 5 summarizes our assumptions about  the supply side of the economy  As indicated in line 1, we assume that potential  output growth will edge down over the forecast period, from 27 percent in 2006 to  25 percent in 2008  This slowing primarily reflects our assumptions about trend  hours growth (line 2), which steps down from about ¾ percent last year to ½ percent  in 2008 because of a steepening downward trend in the labor force participation rate  and a gradual slowing of population growth  Although we are comfortable with these  assumptions—and, indeed, have not made any changes to them in this projection— we do see risks on both sides of our point estimates  For example, as shown in the  middle left panel, many outside forecasters are basing their projections on a  significantly higher estimate of potential output—in some cases above 3 percent per  year  We suspect that these differences, at least in part, reflect different views about  the underlying trend in the labor force participation rate     The participation rate and our estimate of its trend are shown in the middle right   panel  As indicated by the black line, labor force participation has risen about  ½ percentage point since its trough in early 2005  Some forecasters appear to have  taken this increase as a signal of faster labor force growth going forward  However,  we see it as largely a cyclical response to steady employment growth and a tighter  labor market, and we expect it to be reversed in the near future as the pace of hiring  slows and the underlying demographic forces show through  In part, our view  reflects the fact that the participation rate tends to rise above its trend when the  unemployment rate is low  Periods in which the unemployment rate was below the  staff’s estimate of the NAIRU are denoted by the yellow shaded areas in the chart,  and the current gap between the actual participation rate and our estimate of the trend  does not appear to be outsized relative to historical norms  In addition, as shown in  the bottom left panel, the increase in the participation rate over the past couple of  years has been fueled by a rise in the percentage of individuals who moved directly  from out of the labor force to a job; this flow also exhibits noticeable sensitivity to  labor market tightness  That said, some groups have behaved differently than our  models would have predicted  On the one hand, the participation rate of older  individuals, shown by the red line in the bottom right panel, has risen steadily for  some time, presenting an upside risk to our forecast  On the other hand, participation  among teenagers (the black line) has remained surprisingly low, and there are  undoubtedly downside risks to our forecast of an upturn for this segment of the  population     Exhibit 6 describes another source of tension in the recent data that may have   implications for our estimate of potential output  As shown in the top left panel, our  standard Okun’s law simulation (the red line) suggests that the unemployment rate  (the black line) fell more last year than would have been expected given our current  estimate of real GDP growth in 2006  In the baseline forecast, we assume that an  increase in the unemployment rate causes that gap to disappear gradually, an  assumption that does not seem unreasonable given that the error in Okun’s law at the  end of last year was within the bounds of historical experience  However, other  interpretations are possible as well  One possibility is that current estimates of real   January 30-31, 2007 15 of 255    GDP understate economic growth last year  One piece of evidence in support of this  hypothesis is shown in the top right panel  We currently estimate that real gross  domestic income rose 4 percent in 2006, about ¾ percentage point more than real  GDP  As shown by the green line in the top left panel, if we replace real GDP growth  with our estimate of real GDI growth over the past year and re-run the Okun’s law  simulation, the actual unemployment rate in the fourth quarter lines up very closely  with its simulated value       An alternative interpretation of the recent error in Okun’s law is that potential   output growth was weaker last year than we have assumed—perhaps because of a  downshift in structural productivity growth  The middle and bottom panels address  this possibility  As shown by the difference between actual productivity growth (the  black line in the middle left panel) and a simulation from our standard model (the red  line), labor productivity decelerated much more last year than the model would have  expected  As shown in the panel to the right, a purely statistical model based on a  Kalman filter would have responded to the incoming data since March of last year by  cutting its estimate of structural productivity growth by a full percentage point  In  contrast, because we place less weight on the recent data that have not yet been  through an annual revision, we have reduced our own estimate by only 06 percentage  point  The bottom panels provide a couple of reasons for our reluctance to lower our  estimate of structural productivity growth as much as the statistical model would have  lowered it  First, as shown on the left, labor productivity in the nonfinancial  corporate sector was quite strong last year  In part, the better performance of  productivity in this sector reflects the fact that its output is measured from the income  side of the accounts and thus incorporates the difference between GDI and GDP  noted above  In addition, this component omits some sectors that are notoriously  difficult to measure  Second, as shown on the right, a measure of productivity that  excludes the residential construction industry also held up fairly well last year,  suggesting that much of the deceleration in nonfarm business productivity may be  cyclical  As shown in the middle panel, all told we expect actual labor productivity  growth to step back up to an annual rate of about 2½ percent by the middle of this  year as businesses reduce the pace of hiring in lagged response to the slower rate of  output growth in recent quarters       The implications of this forecast for the labor market are shown in the top panels   of exhibit 7  In particular, gains in nonfarm payroll employment—shown by the  black line in the top left panel—are projected to slow to about 60,000 per month by  the second half of this year  This pace is somewhat below our estimate of trend  employment growth—the red line  As a result, the unemployment rate—shown in the  top right panel—drifts up to just under 5 percent, our estimate of the current level of  the NAIRU  To help gauge whether the estimated gap between the unemployment  rate and the NAIRU is sending an appropriate signal about the degree of tightness in  the labor market, I have included some other measures of slack in the remaining  panels of this exhibit  As shown in the middle left panel, the job openings rate from  the BLS’s JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) rose over the second  half of last year to its highest level since early 2001  Because the job openings rate   January 30-31, 2007 16 of 255    has such a short history, its equilibrium level is difficult to estimate  However, we  can learn something by combining the openings rate and the unemployment rate to  form the Beveridge curve shown to the right  The curve is estimated using data from  the first quarter of 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2006, with the openings rate on  the vertical axis and the unemployment rate on the horizontal axis  The relationship  between job openings and unemployment appears to have been fairly stable in recent  years, which suggests that the NAIRU has not changed materially over that period   Moreover, the latest data point is in the far upper left portion of the graph—the  segment of the curve indicative of a tight labor market  Two other margins of slack  are shown in the lower two panels  The bottom left shows the percentage of  employed persons working part time because of slack work at their firm or because  they couldn’t find a full-time job  This measure has moved down over the past  couple of years and is currently below its average level in the second half of 1996— an earlier period when we thought that labor markets were roughly in equilibrium   Also, as shown to the right, the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing remains a  little above its long-run average level     Exhibit 8 presents the inflation outlook  Despite our view that labor and product   markets are tight, other influences on our inflation projection have been more  favorable than we were expecting at the time of the last Greenbook  Perhaps most  notably, the recent data on core consumer prices—shown in the top left panel—have  been lower than expected  Core PCE prices were about unchanged in November and,  based on the latest CPI reading, we expect an increase of only 02 percent in  December  As a result, as shown in the second column of the table, we have marked  down our estimate of core PCE inflation in the fourth quarter by ½ percentage point,  to an annual rate of 21 percent  As shown in the top right panel, the lower path of oil  prices led us to revise down our projection of consumer energy prices  These lower  prices directly pull down our forecast for total PCE prices; they also imply somewhat  smaller indirect effects from energy costs on core prices over the forecast period  As  shown in the middle left panel, a higher exchange value of the dollar in this forecast  led us to reduce the projected path of core nonfuel import prices  The combination of  these various influences led us to shave our projection for core PCE prices—line 4 of  the middle right panel—by 01 percentage point in both 2007 and 2008, to 22 percent  and 20 percent respectively  As before, the slight downward trajectory to core  inflation reflects our projections of waning indirect effects of the earlier increases in  energy and other commodity prices, declining relative import prices, and a  deceleration in shelter costs     In light of my earlier discussion of the risks to our assumptions about potential   output growth, the bottom panels present one alternative simulation from the  Greenbook, in which we assume both a higher trend for the labor force participation  rate and slower growth in structural productivity  Specifically, we calibrated the  simulation so that overall potential output growth was essentially the same as in the  baseline forecast, but with structural productivity growth ½ percentage point weaker  and trend hours growth ½ percentage point stronger  As shown in the bottom left  panel, this change to the composition of potential output growth has little effect on   January 30-31, 2007 17 of 255    aggregate activity and the unemployment rate  However, the implications for  inflation—the middle panel—are noticeable, with core PCE inflation moving up  toward 2½ percent next year because of the effects of lower structural productivity  growth on trend unit labor costs  Joe will now continue our presentation      That’s right  The potential output measures are based on a GDP   concept, and productivity in the nonfarm business sector is the measure of structural productivity   that we’re using for potential GDP  The upper panel is just to illustrate what might happen if, for   example, the real GDP numbers for last year were revised up to show the same growth rate that   GDI shows now     Well, real wages wouldn’t be different, but the adjustment could come   either through flexible nominal wages or faster increases in prices  In the FRB/US model, which   January 30-31, 2007 22 of 255    is used to generate these simulations, trend unit labor costs do cause an increase in the rate of   price inflation, which is what you see here, and that helps equilibrate the labor market     I think that’s probably right  "
8373,2008-01-29,"  Sure  The birth-death model basically assumes that the cyclical   properties of births and deaths are the same as for continuing establishments  The BLS has only   about five years of experience with the birth-death model, so I think it is pretty difficult to judge   whether they need to make any additional adjustments in births and deaths, other than the same   pattern that occurs in terms of net employment changes in continuing firms  But without much   to go on, they don’t take a very strong stand on whether they do a very good job of picking up   the turning points because they don’t have any history on which to base their analysis  So I think   there are reasons to suspect that that is possibly the case, but I don’t think there is any strong   evidence that it is, and it is important to note that they do assume some cyclicality in births and   deaths in their procedures  "
8467,2008-06-24,"  Exhibit 10 reviews our assumptions about aggregate supply    As you can see from the first two rows of the table at the top, we now assume that  potential output growth will hold steady at about 2½ percent per year over the  forecast period, about ¼ percentage point per year higher from 2007 to 2009 than we  had assumed in the April Greenbook  This upward revision is split roughly equally  between structural productivity growth (lines 3 and 4) and trend hours (lines 5 and 6)     The middle two panels provide the reasoning for our change  The left panel   shows the difference between actual productivity growth (the black line) and a  simulation from our standard model (the green line) using the pace of structural  productivity growth that we had assumed in April  As you can see, labor productivity  growth in recent quarters has been stronger than the model would have expected  given the deceleration in economic activity  As shown in the inset box, a purely  statistical model based on a Kalman filter would have responded to the recent data by  raising its estimate of structural productivity growth 02 percentage point  Because  we place less weight on data that have not yet been through an annual revision, we  generally tend to revise our own estimate by less than the amount suggested by such  models; moreover, the Kalman filter model does not take into account the steep rise  in energy prices, which we think might subtract a bit from structural productivity  growth in coming years  Nevertheless, we did think it appropriate to nudge up our  productivity growth trend a little  The green line in the middle right panel shows a  similar model simulation for the labor force participation rate, again using our  previously estimated trend  Here, too, the incoming data have been a little higher   June 24–25, 2008 18 of 253    than the model would have expected  One can think of potential explanations for  this—for example, it may be that strains on household budgets associated with rising  costs of food and energy have increased labor force participation among secondary  earners, an influence not captured by the model  We are not ready to back away from  our basic story that demographics will continue to put downward pressure on the  participation rate over time, but we did slightly raise our assumed trend in response to  the recent data     The key elements of the labor market forecast are shown in the bottom panels  As   indicated to the left, nonfarm payroll employment (the black line) is projected to  decline about 40,000 per month through the rest of this year  As the economy  improves in 2009, we expect payrolls to start rising again, although at a pace below  our estimate of trend employment growth (the green line) for most of the year  As  shown in the inset box in the bottom right panel, we expect the unemployment rate to  drop back in June from its suspiciously high May reading, which would leave the  average jobless rate in the second quarter at 53 percent  However, with employment  declines projected to continue for a while longer, we expect the unemployment rate to  drift up to 57 percent by early next year and remain near that level through the end of  2009     Exhibit 11 presents the near-term inflation outlook  As you can see in the top left   panel, the recent data on consumer prices have come in a little lower than we had  expected at the time of the April Greenbook  As shown on line 3, core PCE prices  rose only 01 percent in April, and based on the latest CPI and PPI readings, we  expect an increase of 02 percent in May  As a result, we have marked down our  estimate of core PCE inflation in the second quarter by 03 percentage point, to an  annual rate of 2 percent  Total PCE prices (line 1) have risen at a substantially faster  pace than core prices; but here, too, the current-quarter forecast is a little lower than  in our previous projection, both because of the lower core inflation and because the  sharp increases in oil prices have been slow to feed through to finished energy prices   Despite this recent news, we expect inflation to rise sharply over the next few months   In part, this reflects our judgment that core prices were held down in the first half by  some factors that will not persist into the second half  In addition, as shown to the  right, we expect increases in food and energy prices to push up the twelve-month  change in the total PCE price index more than 1 percentage point over the next  several months, to about 4½ percent     The remaining panels of the exhibit focus on the projection for energy and food   prices  As shown by the black line in the middle left panel, rising crude oil prices  have pushed up retail gasoline prices sharply so far this year  Even so, margins are  still relatively low, and we expect further sizable increases in pump prices in coming  months  Spot prices for natural gas (the red line) have also risen noticeably,  reflecting its substitutability with crude oil  Meanwhile, prices for crops, plotted in  black at the right, have moved well above the levels at the time of the April  Greenbook, mainly in response to the severe flooding in the Midwest  The higher  prices for grains have also pushed up livestock prices (the blue line), although recent   June 24–25, 2008 19 of 253    increases in supply have tempered this rise somewhat  In both cases, futures prices  indicate that market participants expect these prices to flatten out at about their  current levels  The bottom two panels show our forecast for overall consumer food  and energy prices  Based on current futures prices, we expect energy price inflation  to move yet higher next quarter before slowing to a pace close to zero in 2009  We  expect food prices to show a similar—albeit less pronounced—pattern, with the four- quarter change peaking at about 5 percent this quarter and then decelerating to a pace  of 2½ percent next year     The upper panels of your next exhibit examine the implications of the recent   increases in energy and other commodity prices for core inflation  The first thing to  note is that these increases are showing through to producers’ costs  As indicated in  the top left panel, the producer price index for core intermediate materials (the black  line) has accelerated yet again and was up more than 7 percent over the past twelve  months, with especially large increases for metal products and energy-intensive  materials  Likewise, the diffusion index for prices paid from the Institute for Supply  Management’s manufacturing survey (the red line) has climbed steadily since late last  year  As Nathan noted, rising commodity prices have been an important source of the  sizable increases in import prices shown to the right  In addition, higher energy  prices have boosted the costs of shipping goods from manufacturers to wholesalers  and retailers  As you can see in the middle left panel, the PPIs for both trucking and  rail transport have accelerated sharply over the past year or so  Obviously, a key  question is the extent to which these higher costs will be passed through to core  consumer prices  The panel to the right provides rough estimates of the size of these  pass-throughs from our suite of econometric models, with the effect of energy prices  on core PCE inflation shown by the blue bars and the combined effects of import  prices and other commodity prices indicated by the red bars  As you can see, these  effects add more than 06 percentage point to our forecast of core inflation this year   With energy and import prices expected to decelerate, the contribution of these  factors to core inflation steps down to ¼ percentage point next year     In contrast to the evidence of greater cost pressures from commodity prices,   we’ve seen no signs of acceleration in labor costs  The bottom left panel plots the  three main measures of labor compensation that we follow  None of them suggests  that employers have experienced a step-up in the pace of compensation growth; and  given the weaker labor market in our projection, we don’t think that workers will do  much better over the next year and a half either  Accordingly, we expect the rise in  trend unit labor costs, shown in the table to the right, to hold steady at about 2 percent  per year over the projection period     In putting together our forecast, we’ve also had to make some decisions about   how to interpret the recent data on inflation expectations—the subject of your final  exhibit  As shown in the top left panel, some measures of short-run inflation  expectations have jumped sharply in response to the run-up in energy and food prices  this year  In particular, the Reuters-Michigan measure of one-year-ahead  expectations (the blue line) rose above 5 percent in May and remained high in the   June 24–25, 2008 20 of 253    preliminary June survey  Meanwhile, as shown to the right, indicators of long-run  inflation expectations have ranged from roughly unchanged to higher since late April   As I already noted, the recent compensation data do not suggest that higher inflation  expectations have started to push up wage increases  However, on balance, we view  the data as consistent with a slight updrift in the underlying long-run inflation  expectations that drive actual inflation, and we have carried this updrift into the  projection period  All told, we expect core PCE inflation (line 3 of the middle left  table) to step up to a 2½ percent annual rate in the second half of this year, pushed up  by the effects of higher input costs and the increase in inflation expectations  In  2009, core inflation is projected to step back down to 2¼ percent, as the effects of  decelerating energy and import prices and a wider unemployment gap offset a small  further updrift in expected inflation     We have taken only a small signal from the apparent deterioration in expected   inflation, but we view the possibility that inflation expectations will become  unmoored in response to the persistently high rate of headline inflation as a risk to our  forecast  Accordingly, as indicated in the box to the right, we included in the  Greenbook an alternative simulation that assumes that long-run inflation expectations  move up ¾ percentage point relative to baseline in the third quarter  Consistent with  our usual practice, monetary policy in this simulation is assumed to respond  according to the estimated Taylor rule  Both wages and prices are affected by these  higher inflation expectations, and as you can see by the green line in the middle panel  at the bottom, core inflation rises to 26 percent in 2009, almost ½ percentage point  higher than baseline  Monetary policy responds in this simulation by raising the  federal funds rate more than in the baseline forecast  As a result of this additional  tightening, the unemployment rate declines a bit more slowly, and core inflation  moderates to about 2¼ percent in 2012  Brian will now continue the presentation      No, I agree with you  I think our models have been surprised by the low   rates of compensation growth  One way to think about it is that in the past we might have seen   June 24–25, 2008 26 of 253    higher headline inflation passed through more quickly to compensation growth—as in the ’70s,   when those wage–price spirals were really led by prices, but then wages contributed by following    So far we haven’t seen any sign that higher headline inflation has been putting upward pressure on   compensation costs  I think there’s a risk  We obviously included the simulation because we think   there’s a risk that could happen in the future, but to date we have not seen evidence that that’s been   the case  There are a number of reasons to think that things now might be different than they used   to be  For example, just a structural reason, unions are less powerful than they used to be; a much   smaller share of the work force is unionized  In the 1970s there were all sorts of automatic cost-of-  living adjustment clauses  Even when there weren’t, there were big catch-ups for past inflation    Another structural reason might be that the minimum wage was higher in the 1970s, and it is lower   in real terms now  I think more generally this fits in with the general notion that inflation   expectations are less responsive to immediate shocks in headline inflation than perhaps they used to   be    Well, we don’t account for that in our compensation model  That said,   as I mentioned, the models have been surprised about how low compensation has been  That would   be one possible explanation for that residual  If that factor were to diminish, it would imply that that   residual would diminish, but we haven’t built such an effect into our forecast  "
8889,2009-12-15,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We received two data releases this  morning—housing starts and the CPI—and you should have in front of you a three-page handout  that summarizes the data  The first page summarizes the housing starts data, and you can see  from the top line that total starts moved up to an annual rate of 574,000 units in November, with  increases in starts of both single-family and multifamily units  The jump in multifamily starts,  which is about halfway down the table, basically reverses a sharp dip in October, and that was in  line with our expectations  While single-family starts also increased, that increase was smaller  than we were expecting Permits, which are a better underlying measure of starts, increased  more than starts in November But the combination of the permits and starts figures in  November was weaker than we were expecting, and it suggests to us that our near-term forecast  for single-family starts is probably too optimistic  While I would still think that a gradual  improvement in new home sales will lead to a more noticeable pickup in the pace of starts next  year, these data suggest that the upturn is lagging a little bit more than we were projecting  The  implications of these data for GDP are mainly for the first quarter, given the lag between starts  and construction; these data, and our reaction to them, would probably take off a tenth or two of  a percentage point from our forecast for GDP growth in the first quarter   The next page summarizes the data for the CPI  The total CPI rose 04 percent in  November, which is what we were expecting for the headline number  However, energy prices  rose a larger-than-expected 41 percent last month, while core prices were about unchanged in  November; to two decimal places, they rose three basis points  We had been expecting an  increase in the core index of about 01 percent  The softness was concentrated in prices of  services, especially in rents  In contrast, core goods prices rose 02 of a percent in November,  with noticeable increases in tobacco prices and in motor vehicle prices   It looks as if yesterday’s PPI release and today’s CPI release, taken together, will imply a  lower estimate of core PCE inflation in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter than we had        December 15–16, 2009 93 of 247  in the Greenbook In particular, it looks as if we’ll be down from 16 percent in the fourth  quarter in the Greenbook to 12 percent for core PCE price inflation, and in the first quarter down  from 13 percent to 11 percent  For the total PCE price index, we would revise our estimate for  the fourth quarter from 28 percent to 26 percent; for the first quarter, because of the higher  energy prices, we would still be at 11 percent Thank you  "
9017,2010-06-22,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My colleagues and I will be   referring to the exhibits in the packet labeled “Material for Staff Presentation on the   Economic Outlook”            Turning to the first exhibit, recent data on spending and production have been   broadly in line with our expectation for a moderate recovery in economic activity    Starting with the labor market, private payroll employment (the black line in the   upper left panel) has continued to rise in recent months  Although the increase in   May was smaller than we were expecting, that followed larger-than-expected   increases in April and March, and the level of payrolls in May turned out to be close   to what we were projecting in April  Moreover, employers have continued to   lengthen workweeks, and aggregate employee hours (the purple line) moved up at an   annual rate of 5 percent over the past three months  On a less positive note, the   unemployment rate came in above our expectations in both April and May, and initial   UI claims remain elevated   The industrial sector has been a notable source of strength  Manufacturing IP—  shown in the upper right panel—rose 09 percent in May, bringing the latest three-  month change to an annual rate of 12½ percent  The recent gains have been   widespread across industries, with the three-month diffusion index of production   changes currently at its highest level since 1987   The middle left panel presents our latest estimates of real PCE based on the   available data on retail sales and light motor vehicle sales in May  As we were   anticipating, increases in consumer spending appear to have moderated from their   robust first-quarter pace  However, the level of spending in April and May was still a   little above what we were expecting, and, on a quarterly average basis, we now                                                     3 The materials used by Messrs Wascher and Erceg and Ms Liang are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   June 22–23, 2010 55 of 213             expect real PCE to rise at an annual rate of 29 percent this quarter, about   ¾ percentage point more than our forecast in April                     As shown to the right, home sales have also risen noticeably in recent months    However, we think that this upturn largely reflects another pull-forward of sales in   advance of the expiration of the homebuyers’ tax credit rather than an improvement   in the underlying pace of housing activity  Indeed, single-family starts (not shown)   were revised down noticeably in April and fell further in May, leaving their level well   below what we had been expecting  In addition, today’s report on existing home   sales in May was somewhat weaker than we were expecting  Accordingly, we have   scaled back our near-term forecast for starts and sales in coming months   In the business sector, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods (shown   in the lower left panel) have continued to trend up in recent months  And, with the   level of orders above shipments, we anticipate further near-term gains in spending  In   addition, while activity in the nonresidential construction sector (not shown) remains   very weak, there are hints in the recent data that the steep declines in this sector may   be abating   All told, as shown in the lower right, we now estimate that real GDP rose at an   annual rate of 31 percent in the first quarter, and we are looking for an increase of   36 percent in the second quarter  Both figures are a shade higher than in the April   projection   Your next exhibit focuses on the medium-term outlook  The available data on   spending and production largely pertain to April and May and, thus, are probably   mostly unaffected by the recent turmoil in Europe  In contrast, recent events have   had a noticeable influence on financial markets, with significant consequences for the   medium-term projection  As indicated in the upper left panel, the most important of   these changes were the sizable decline in the stock market and the marked   appreciation of the dollar since the time of the April Greenbook; in addition, we   revised down our outlook for foreign growth  Lower oil prices and mortgage rates   provide only a partial offset to these negative influences   As shown to the right, we accordingly marked down our forecast for real GDP   growth to an annual rate of 3 percent in the second half of this year and to 3¾ percent   in 2011, about ¾ percentage point lower in both periods than in our April projection    Part of the revision is in net exports, line 6, but most is accounted for by a downward   revision to domestic final sales   The bottom four panels provide some additional detail on the outlook for private   domestic final demand  Scanning through the panels, you can see that our projections   for each of the major components have been revised down  However, the basic story   of the projection is similar to that in recent projections  The accommodative stance of   monetary policy, improving financial conditions, and rising household and business   confidence contribute to a further strengthening in consumer spending and business   June 22–23, 2010 56 of 213             investment in equipment and software (the middle two panels)  Activity in the   housing sector, the lower left, is also expected to turn up, albeit only modestly  In   contrast, as indicated in the lower right, we do not expect to see a meaningful   recovery in nonresidential construction for some time                  Turning to exhibit 3, gains in private payroll employment (the black dotted line in   top left panel) are expected to average about 200,000 per month over the second half   of this year and 275,000 per month in 2011  This puts our employment projection   between the jobless recoveries that followed the past two recessions (the bottom two   lines) and the more robust expansions following the 1974 and 1982 recessions (the   upper two lines)  The deviation of our forecast from those more robust expansions is   explained both by the more modest pace of recovery in our projection and by the   slower assumed pace of trend labor force growth  As shown to the right, the   relatively tepid growth of labor demand leaves the unemployment rate above   8½ percent at the end of 2011, about ½ percentage point higher than in the April   projection   As shown in the middle left panel, inflation continues to be subdued  As seen in   the inset box, core PCE prices rose only 01 percent in April, and, based on the latest   CPI and PPI readings, we expect another 01 percent increase in May; meanwhile,   total PCE prices are expected to edge down in May  Looking ahead, the greater slack   in this projection, coupled with lower core nonfuel import prices (the middle right   panel) and lower energy prices, add to the downward pressure on inflation relative to   the April forecast  However, with longer-run inflation expectations (the lower left   panel) apparently holding steady, we made only a small downward adjustment to core   inflation (line 5 in the lower right panel) to about ¾ percent both this year and next;   total PCE prices, line 1, are projected to rise at a pace close to core in both years   Returning to the top right panel, we continue to assume that the availability of   extended and emergency UI benefits has pushed the short-term “effective” NAIRU   (the red line) above 6 percent this year and that this influence will fade as these UI   programs expire  Our assumed longer-run NAIRU remains at 5¼ percent  This   assumption reflects our assessment that the rise in structural unemployment   associated with the recession has been modest  Your next two exhibits provide an   update of some of the labor market indicators we’ve relied on in making this   judgment   Turning to the next exhibit, as we have noted previously, one potential source of   higher structural unemployment is the need to reallocate labor across sectors of the   economy  Because it typically takes longer for workers to become reemployed if they   have to change industries, occupations, or location, an unusual amount of labor   reallocation may raise structural unemployment for a time   The panel in the upper left presents a measure of the extent of reallocation across   industries  This figure presents a decomposition of the variance in the percent   changes in employment into two pieces the part associated with typical cyclical   June 22–23, 2010 57 of 213             dynamics (the black line) and the part associated with unusual—or excess—  dispersion (the red line)  The small degree of excess dispersion at present suggests   that the amount of reallocation in employment across industries that needs to take   place is not especially large, given the depth of the recession  A similar exercise for   employment changes across states (the upper right panel) comes to much the same   conclusion  These results are not suggestive of long-lasting increases in structural   unemployment               However, these measures may be too crude to capture fully all of the reallocation   in the labor market that may be in train  An alternative way to assess reallocation is   to focus on permanent job loss, because it may be associated with substantial costs in   terms of relocation and lost human capital that could slow the pace at which workers   find new jobs  In this regard, the middle left panel indicates that, while the rate of   permanent job loss (the red line) was only briefly at an unusually high level and has   fallen considerably this year, the stock of permanent job losers (the black line)   remains very high  This suggests that many permanent job losers are experiencing   difficulties in finding a new job, raising the possibility of an increase in structural   unemployment   In the past, one mechanism that has been important in helping the labor market re-  equilibrate is the migration of workers from locations with weak labor markets to   locations with stronger ones  In this regard, there have been claims that migration is   being impeded by the substantial number of homeowners with underwater mortgages,   and, indeed, migration rates have fallen noticeably in recent years  Whether this is   due to house-lock is debatable; for example, as shown in the middle right panel,   migration does not appear to have fallen more in states where the proportion of   homeowners with negative equity is relatively high (the black line) than in other   states (the green line)  Regardless of its source, the decline in migration raises the   possibility that the equilibration of labor markets across locations will occur more   slowly than in the past   Another relationship we use to assess the extent of structural unemployment in the   economy is the one between the unemployment rate and job vacancies shown in the   lower left panel and often referred to as the Beveridge curve  All else equal, the   unemployment rate (the horizontal axis) and job vacancies (the vertical axis) should   move inversely over the course of the business cycle  Thus, movements along a   curve running from the upper left of the panel toward the lower right can be   interpreted as cyclical movements in labor demand  In contrast, shifts in the   Beveridge curve—increases or decreases in unemployment for a given level of   vacancies—can be interpreted as changes in structural and frictional unemployment    The latest observations are given by the red square and the green circle in the lower   right corner of the panel  It seems clear at this point that the curve has shifted out   The Beveridge curve can shift out for several reasons, not all of which are   indicative of higher structural unemployment  For example, we think that one factor   that has contributed to the outward shift has been the availability of extended and   June 22–23, 2010 58 of 213             emergency UI benefits  However, staff analysis that decomposes the shift in the   Beveridge curve into its various components also points to some increase in structural   unemployment  This is illustrated in the chart to the right  The black line shows the   percentage of the unemployed who find a job in the next month, that is, move from   unemployment (U) to employment (E)  The red line plots an estimated value from a   regression of the rate of unemployment to employment flows on the ratio of   vacancies to unemployment  An actual value that is close to the estimated value   suggests that the job-matching process is operating normally  Recently, however, the   actual job-finding rate has fallen below the red line, suggesting that some of the   outward shift in the Beveridge curve may be due to a deterioration in the efficiency of   job-matching, consistent with a modest increase in the level of structural   unemployment             In all, we view the various indicators in this exhibit as broadly consistent with our   assumption that higher structural unemployment has boosted the NAIRU by about   ½ percentage point since late 2008  However, we recognize that this is very inexact   science, and one important risk to our NAIRU assumption is illustrated in the next   exhibit  As shown in the upper left panel, the extent of long-term unemployment—  expressed here as a percent of the labor force—has risen to extraordinary levels    While, to date, this increase seems well explained by the factors shown in the box to   the right—high rates of permanent job loss, continued weak labor demand, and   extended and emergency unemployment insurance benefits—a key question going   forward is whether this high level of long-term unemployment will lead to a further   increase in the NAIRU through hysteresis-type effects   As shown in the middle left panel, hysteresis in unemployment seems to have   been more a feature of the European economic landscape than of ours in the past few   decades  In particular, the recessions in the 1970s and 1980s appear to have   contributed to persistently higher levels of European unemployment subsequent to   those recessions  In contrast, in the United States, the unemployment rate has tended   to fall back to previous levels within a few years following recessions  Econometric   research on this issue, summarized in the box to the right, suggests that this difference   in unemployment dynamics reflects a differential effect of recessions on structural   unemployment in the two regions  For example, unemployment shocks have not led   to persistently high levels of long-term unemployment in the US in the past, whereas   they have in European countries  In addition, and in contrast to some evidence for   Europe, the long-term unemployed appear to put downward pressure on wage and   price inflation in the US, an indication that long-term unemployment has not   contributed to a higher NAIRU in the US in the past  These differences between the   US and European experiences are often attributed to differences in labor market   policies and institutions in the two regions   Although the US historical experience gives us some reason to be optimistic, the   unusually high level of long-term unemployment that we are now seeing suggests   caution in extrapolating these results to the current situation  The lower left panel   provides one reason to be concerned  Job-finding rates tend to fall as the duration of   June 22–23, 2010 59 of 213             unemployment spells lengthen, so that only a little more than 10 percent of   individuals unemployed for more than 26 weeks find a job in the following month    Research suggests that much of this pattern reflects worker heterogeneity—the long-  term unemployed tend to be those with lower job-finding rates more generally    However, we should not rule out the possibility that the factors shown to the right will   come more into play this time around, leading to a higher rate of structural   unemployment in the future, especially in light of the slow pace of improvement in   the labor market that we are projecting  At present, we do not see enough evidence to   warrant putting a further rise in the NAIRU into our baseline projection  However,   we do see that possibility as a risk and so will continue to reassess our assumptions   about structural unemployment and the NAIRU as the economy evolves  Chris will   now continue our presentation     "
9211,2011-04-26,"  Right  From that standpoint, people who want a job but have dropped   out of the labor force and still indicate that they want a job might have accounted for   02 percentage point of the decline in the unemployment rate over the past year  "
9288,2011-08-09,"  Well, I guess I don’t have a lot to add to what you’ve just said  We do   think there’s a significant downward trend in the participation rate that’s been associated with the   aging of the population, and that’s been going on for a while now, for the past decade or so  We   think there’s a cyclical component to the low participation rate that’s associated with the lack of   job opportunities and some people dropping out  That’s offset to some degree by the extended   unemployment insurance benefits, which we think are keeping some people in the labor market   who would have dropped out in the absence of those benefits  But that cyclical component is   pretty big now  The unemployment rate is quite high; the labor market’s very weak  And I think   a number of people have dropped out because they’ve become discouraged about job prospects    But as David noted, I think we’re a little surprised by how low the participation rate is, and we’re   not quite sure why  Much of the surprise is in the teenage categories, and that’s always been an   age group that’s been difficult to understand  [Laughter]  The participation rate is a few tenths   lower than what we would have expected, given our models  And we’re not quite sure whether   that extra few tenths is just a bigger cyclical effect than we normally would see, given the labor   market slack more generally, or whether there’s something special going on for teenagers or for   some other particular age group that we don’t quite understand yet    For that group, the participation rate has actually edged up, I think, a   little bit   August 9, 2011 27 of 162               That effect could be going on, and some people might just get   discouraged and take early retirement  I’m sure that’s true for many people  But there are others   who have lost a lot of wealth, for example, in their 401(k) retirement plans, and they can’t afford   to do it, so they’re staying in  And more generally, in terms of the longer-term trends, older   people are healthier and, I think, more generally likely to stay in the labor market longer  That   has only a small offset to the aging of the population because their participation rates are quite a   bit lower than for the prime-age individuals  But that does go the other way in a longer-term   sense, in general  And those factors are offsetting, I think, in the current environment  "
9382,2011-12-13,"  That’s right, there have been upward revisions to the establishment   survey employment numbers, and those are used to construct the initial estimates of wage and   salary income in the NIPA  For example, for the third quarter—and then for our estimate for the   fourth quarter because we have data through October—we would use those to construct our   estimates of personal income  It is also the case that BEA later gets estimates from the   unemployment insurance tax system on basically a universe count of wages and salaries in the   economy  That is the big downward revision that David referred to in Q2  There is some   possibility—and this is one of the reasons we discounted some of the income surprise in making   our forecast for consumption—that we will see an upward revision to Q3  The statistical   analysis suggests that there is some negative correlation in the revisions, so it does seem possible   that we will see an upward revision to income in Q3  Again, that is one of the reasons we did not   take full signal from the downward revision to personal income  "
