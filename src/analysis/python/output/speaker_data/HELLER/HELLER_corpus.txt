 Well, I think it would be very nice if the forecast came true, but I'm pretty pessimistic [I doubt] that we are going to see [export] growth rates of up to 15-1/2 percent on a quarterly basis Certainly, in Europe and Japan it's going to be very tough for Americans to make rapid inroads into those domestic markets And at the going exchange rates, I don't think we really have a competitive advantage, although we have roughly leveled the playing field versus other industrialized countries I don't see the growth in the LDCs--and I think that's where the relative exchange rate movement probably has a bigger role to play, because when you're competing in [third] markets you're on more equal terms than when you're competing in foreign home markets--in spite of the generosity as far as Mexico is concerned The federal deficit, I think, plays a role too And that certainly isn't going to come down as fast as the trade balance comes down [in your forecast], from $146 billion to $82 billion at the end of the forecast period That's a terrific swing My last question to you really would be What do you assume as far as exchange rates are concerned to make that scenario compute?   Net exports   Right  SPEAKER(?) In the fourth quarter of 1987   Your own staff projections assume already a decline of the dollar of 10 percent to make the projected trade picture come true So, if we don't get any dollar decline at all, presumably the trade picture would be a lot worse than--   At least for consistency purposes Well, the feeling around the table was that people were a bit more pessimistic than the staff was, so you clearly need the exchange rate story--   On current account you also get the big statistical discrepancies worldwide--   So that is a lot worse in the current account than the trade account   I want to come back to the interest rates and the exchange rates To not cut the discount rate or lower interest rates in order to avoid the drop in the exchange rate I think would really give the wrong signal to all our foreign countries And that is exactly what you are saying By doing that, you are in essence forcing their domestic hand, which you want to do anyhow That is where you want to be and the exchange rate is the threat--   Well, then the exchange rate is the thing that will do it eventually I am the last person who would like to see a low dollar for international financial purposes But on the trade front, it may forestall the protectionist [unintelligible]   May I ask you a quick question? Please rule it out of order if you don't [think it's appropriate] In the Bluebook, and also earlier in the discussion, it came up that [the staff] expects monetary growth to slow down in the next two or three months   Well, it is a very comforting thought Why?   I think I can't wait any longer here Listening to the discussion, it's just about evenly divided between the discount rate cutters and noncutters I think that shows how tough the job is going to be As far as monetary policy is concerned, I think it's very important to preserve the credibility of the Federal Reserve, to stick to preannounced targets and not to get out of the target ranges The A alternative gets awfully close--if only I had my bifocals--to the line that I would really like to stay a bit below I would agree very much with the discussion around the table about alternative B As far as the discount rate is concerned, as I look at the economy, I don't see that much strength in the immediate future Given consumer spending and the high consumer debt levels that are already there and the prospect of not having these consumer debts tax deductible in the future, I think consumer spending will be soft during the coming year On the investment side, I certainly don't see any prospects for sharp increases in investment and the fiscal picture, with the tax reform, would support that view On the trade balance, as I said earlier, I am not quite as optimistic as the forecasts that have been made by the staff It clearly will improve, but I think it will be very rough going, especially in Europe Therefore, largely for the international reasons that also were cited by Mr Rice, I would favor a discount rate cut at the present time   But Sam, the other Europeans are intervening mainly in deutschemarks and not in--   Where do you plan to be, roughly, if you talk about the percentage of total portfolio? Now we have 48 percent, which is about a record high Two or three years from now where do you think we'll be?   To 55, 60 percent?   So you're taking about every two years or so another 5 percentage points up there Is that roughly the result of--   Is it by a large rise or--   It depends on the rollover, the runoff of the coupons   They're going to the short end   I think we are making amazingly good progress this late in the recovery Overall, I agree with what most people have said that there is a more balanced economy than there was last year and very little in excesses actually developing I agree with the staff that consumer spending is very well sustained and I think consumers are going to get a second wind next year when the tax cuts become effective We see behavioral changes taking place already, both in the financial markets and as far as planned purchasing is concerned Investment will be slow in coming, but at least we have bottomed out, especially in the agricultural and energy area; so we don't have any more drag from those sectors in the future And the government deficit reduction program, disappointing as it is, will be a positive contribution that should be particularly good in the financial markets  I am less optimistic on the trade front, as I said previously I think our exports won't increase very rapidly but at least the erosion in GNP due to imports will tend to stop So, overall, the export sector will tilt a bit more in our favor and that also reduces some of those imbalances On the inflation front, I am amazed by the good news that came in this morning It is very heartening And I fully agree with what Wayne was saying about wage increases When you look at the European wage increases, given the high unemployment rates, it is amazing that they are all running in the 5 percent range--much above the 3 percent range that we heard here in other comments before Overall, I think it is a very satisfactory performance with fewer imbalances than we have had in the past   Alternative B without comment or reservations   What would we really do differently if international credit markets would change unless it's [unintelligible] to the exchange rate?   But the labor markets in Germany are very tight right now in skilled workers They just can't hire anybody Openings are--   Also a sectoral unemployment   And because they have the enormous terms of trade gains in the external sector they [can] pay the high wage this year without hurting themselves domestically in making it show on the inflation front But I think the difficult situation will be next year when the terms of trade don't improve any more and people have become accustomed to big wage increases   But if the weakness should show through, I think they're fully prepared to move forward to 1987 the tax cuts that they are now scheduling for 1988--although those deadlines are passing very rapidly right now   Not before the election, but--   In the Greenbook data in that first table, I-7, you have some amazingly good news that you didn't even refer to in the oral presentation or the written material, and that is a 04 increase in the GNP deflator for the fourth quarter of 1986--unless it's a typo Would you tell me about this?   But you just said you expect import prices to go up and--   Too--   Well, I agree broadly with the views expressed by the staff and by the speakers around the table In particular, I think three developments are very heartening First, the reduction in the federal imbalance--and if you take the state and local in together, the deficit is down to just slightly over $110 billion Second, the external sector imbalance is being reduced And third, the agricultural and oil-patch situation [seems to be] bottoming out So, overall, I think we are seeing a strong reduction in the structural imbalances here And I think that all bodes well for the success of the staff forecast   Domestic demand in Germany is much better than in Japan That's the big difference And investment too [unintelligible]--   Oh, "previous" is slightly clearer, isn't it? Because "the past" would include the months in the period that he was talking about earlier   I actually disagree with you a little on that one I think we should look forward to the time when the monetary aggregates would slow down   One quick question You mentioned the Japanese- US agreement So far, has all of that been holding together on the exchange rate side just by the market perception that there could be intervention?   You don't see, say, capital flows into the United States now to a greater extent because there is greater confidence that there would be--   Do you see that hedging more or less?   The sad thing is that they are going back to indexation, at least partially If you didn't weight--   I think they allowed bank deposits back Do they link back to--    12/15-16/86   You have a nice chart on the effect in the Greenbook I can't find it right now, but it is kind of startling the authority goes down and the outlays are going up I don't know what page it is on, but it really makes the point nicely   Page 17   May I ask you a different question on the domestic side? The hourly earnings index has been declining very sharply, and there has been a lot of publicity recently given to new entrants into the workforce being paid barely above minimum wage Is that improvement in the index entirely due to new low-wage workers entering the workforce? Or is it across the board for existing workers as well? In other words, is the mix--   Well, actually I wasn't focussing on the November numbers I was looking at the quarterly numbers because the    12/15-16/86  monthly figures are so volatile The quarterly figures show a sustained downward trend and I was really wondering whether the new entrants are pulling the average down or whether that reflects just low settlements across the board   That's outside the index?   If any? You are required to have them, right?   I think it is not only the disinflation impact on M1 but also the very sharp shifts that we get in the components right around that borderline of Ml, those between Ml and M2 We get growth rates up and down, near 20, 30, or 50 percent sometimes And it is right on that borderline; it's very difficult to draw a line right there If we want to have an Ml target we might want to look at the old M1A, or something like that, which apparently has been a little more stable   Maybe somebody from the Research Department could--  -13-    12/15-16/86   No, I am not going advocate the old M1A I am just saying between that and the current M1 it would be the lesser evil   You could go the other way If you go on the control issue raised by Mr Melzer, what is wrong with going to the monetary base? Then you have something that is really under our control, and it probably has been performing better than the current M1 at least   What about the base? You don't get that kind of shifting that you get around the artificial line drawn on M1 and [in response to] what you call financial deregulation   That may give you the perfect excuse in a way You may want to say at the beginning of the year that you are studying the possibility of reintroducing narrow monetary aggregates and at the present time you are conducting studies to determine if M1A, or something along those lines, might be appropriate If so, at a later moment in the year you may want to set new targets Therefore, it's clear that you want to go back to targets but you avoid having to set a target at the beginning of the year that you will clearly overshoot   An off-balance-sheet item   Yes I would stay away from setting an explicit target right now and then note that we are thinking of re-establishing a target at some later time   Make it out of rubber!   Mr Morris makes an important point there, because I think it really explains a lot of the past behavior that we have seen The trouble with it is that if you are trying to use it for forecasting purposes you first have to forecast what the stock market and the bond market are going to do, and that's probably just as tough as anything else that we've seen But you can get more stable functions that way; I fully agree with you   How about import prices? Do they go up? Is that what you are saying?   Oh, I guess if we have to--   Overall, I'm in broad agreement with the staff forecast I think their numbers are eminently reasonable I'm a bit more optimistic on the consumer; I'm not only looking at the high debt levels, but also at the high asset growth that they've experienced and some interesting data that were brought to our attention recently; the latter show that the net worth of the consumer is now at its highest    12/15-16/86  point in relation to personal income in the last decade So, it really doesn't mean that the consumer has to fall off the cliff, as a lot of the debt-watchers would make us believe Furthermore, tax reform will clearly be a positive picture for the consumer Starting on January 1 there will be bigger pay checks--maybe even for the federal employees, who knows? The bad surprise for the consumer will only come in April '88 when he realizes that his deductions and the old tax shelters have been gone for the last year and that he has to come up with a tax payment But I don't think it will influence consumer behavior a lot before then  On the foreign trade sector--well, I hope Bob Parry is right But I don't see an awful lot of growth in the foreign economies, and I think it is very difficult for American producers, given the current situation and current exchange rates, to increase their market shares So, on the export side, I don't think we will see as much progress as has been hoped for I think we will be making the progress on the import substitution side because American producers clearly are more competitive, although some of the numbers will be skewed--for instance by the automobile plant building in this country and foreign plants in general that have been [unintelligible] On investment, I'm not quite as pessimistic as some people I think it's important for the manufacturers to see the sales going up rather than just looking at the tax incentives; and as long as sales are sustained they will also start to invest again Overall, as I said earlier, I'm in broad agreement with the staff's GNP forecast for growth of slightly below 3 percent   37   Can't avoid it anymore I also favor alternative B   Taking Henry Wallich's spot, I would want "C" But I think I'll go with the "B" And while I would not favor asymmetrical language, I agree that we should shade it in an asymmetrical fashion if it comes to that point So I am taking Mr Corrigan's amendments to Mr Johnson's proposition   But it would set the stage a bit for the February testimony   Sure   [Unintelligible]   It would tilt our foreign trade balance the wrong way   I'll certainly go along with that   We should publish a guide to asymmetry   It seems that the Germans are emphasizing [domestic demand] a lot as well as the GNP numbers that we focus on and that look pretty discouraging Domestic demand is expanding at 4 to 4-1/2 percent and the difference is going to imports I think that's where our perspective and their perspective are really different They say as long as we have a 4 to 4-1/2 percent domestic demand expansion, we don't mind the low production figure at home as long as the rest goes into imports That way we make our contribution to international adjustment  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible]   With the mirror, right   Their GNP number is a lot lower The 1-1/2 percent they are talking about now is a lot lower than the 2 percent they were talking about a couple of weeks ago   With a shrinking population they'll say that is tough to do   Credit cards?   Yes, but there are no credit companies in--   Oh I see! Well, as part of the Bank of America sale to BAI, they got a big credit card operation over in Deutscheland   If you had expanding credit demands--it is clear how that can happen as it did in that year-end period--under our operating procedures you just can't adjust your projections of required reserves quickly enough to adapt On an on-going basis and in a more orderly fashion, can that phenomenon create greater pressures in the funds market?   So, in theory, you ought to be able to keep up with it if it is more or less orderly   Oh, I understand that   Zero in the evening!   Mr Truman, you have the interesting chart 5 there, with real interest rate differentials and the US dollar plus your forecast for the real interest rate differentials   Pardon me?   I'm sorry; I totally misread the chart I was going to ask if you forecasted real interest rate differentials what the underlying actual rates implied by that chart were   Well, the actual interest rates that you were looking at   So it's a flat line   In my mind there are always two possible outcomes The one is like the scenario that you are outlining--that the dollar will really plunge; the other possible outcome is that you say okay, the balance is not turning and, therefore, there will be more exports and that will give confidence  -14-    2/10-11/87   So then you are stuck with the first one   The pay shows that Governor Angell is not worrying very much   Overall, I very much agree with the staff My numbers are almost indistinguishable from the staff forecast, but on the trade picture I agree more with Jerry Corrigan Having been through Europe only a day or two before him, I think the hand- delivered Wall Street Journal article, courtesy of Manley Johnson today, says it all "Fed Official Finds Little Sympathy in Germany on Trade Deficit" It will be difficult to get the very optimistic progress on the export growth front On the other hand, on the import substitution side I think there probably is a lot more room for progress So the net outcome may well be very much the same as forecast by the staff but the composition would be very different  On the inflation front, I think the key is not the direct effect of the depreciation of the dollar but the response of US manufacturers to the increase in prices by their competitors And if the US automobile industry and their pricing behavior is any indication, I think we are in for a hard time I hope that not everybody will follow that example but will instead hold prices and go for the market share If the auto example were followed it would clearly be very detrimental on the trade front, because we would not get the relative price effect and the trade picture would be very bad  One last brief comment a lot was made out of the difference between the CPI and the GNP deflator I think there is good reason to assume that next year that discrepancy will be bigger than it has been in the past because the prices from imports will show up in the CPI while they are going to be subtracted out of the GNP numbers So there is going to be a bigger discrepancy there I think that is basically a statistical quirk that we have to be aware of but shouldn't overemphasize   Well, I'm in favor of alternative II but now you've got me a bit confused First of all, let me remark on the short-run alternatives I realize we may want to discuss it later, but the target for the first three months is rather high It's at the high end of the range for M2 and the lower end of the range for M3 I think that's what Chairman Volcker was just talking about But San Francisco also got me confused You are in favor of discount rate cuts yet you want to have a tighter monetary target?   I'll stick to alternative II   I think the bottom line still is that we have no idea what the demand for money function looks like And to put in a quantitative target--   Yes, but there are a lot more factors in it too There's the whole deregulation angle still in it And, as Mr Morris said earlier, that makes it very difficult to do The one trouble I have with the different economic scenarios in defining the alternative growth path is that if you mention the dollar--if the dollar should go down or if the dollar should do this--you're hooking yourself   But what are you going to do if some senator then says Well, what do you expect the dollar to do? And what will you do if the dollar goes down by 10 percent? And then what if it should do this? That's--   I trust you can dress it up well in the testimony But I think one of the things we really should do is redouble our efforts to study M1 and the proper definition of M1 so that we will be able to sort out some of those behavior patterns Maybe we'll be able to do that in a better way than we're able to do it right now In any case, I would avoid setting a figure for M1 growth   We could just set one for the first half of the year, January to June Set the whole thing--   [March is] only two or three more weeks   If you take the end of December as a base then you have a good chance that--   That sounds good   One thing we might want to keep in mind also is that our last directive was asymmetric in the other direction and that's what will be released   In the testimony, do you release the language?   Okay And the minutes from the last meeting are going to be released when?  SPEAKER(?) This Friday   Friday   You are going to get that whammy--the market is going to see the earlier language and a week later the tighter   Also say "primarily"   With the "such as" language the only thing I am not too happy with is the last statement "In the context of signs such as continuing economic expansion" That does not cause us to reduce growth It would have to be something like unsustainable economic expansion   Or "in the framework"   But you are putting "continuing economic expansion" ahead, right?  -62-    2/10-11/87   "Related to"?   In my mind at least, debt should be more among the categories of things we are monitoring prices, growth, interest rates, exchange rates Debt should be in that category rather than as a target variable   Sam, are they all sterilized here and abroad?   You put a lot of emphasis on these statements, but there was an awful lot of hot news that was very bad too All of the trade numbers that came in were very bad The current account numbers were very bad I think that was the real substance that--   Sam, has any consideration been given to forward purchases and sales rather than spot?   I agree with the growth and inflation forecasts of the staff I was happy to see that the first quarter was revised upward I always thought that the tax would have an overall beneficial effect Let me focus mainly on the external side As many speakers have pointed out, our main problem is the high and persistent trade deficit Sooner or later we will have to correct it But at the going exchange rates that trade deficit will continue to persist, as the staff's projections have shown for the exchange rates and foreign growth, I should hasten to add The staff projections in the Greenbook, I think, already have incorporated the decline in the value of the dollar Obviously, if foreigners were willing to expand their economies that would help on the trade side But as we have also learned they are unwilling to do so So the question that will be before us here is whether it will be advisable for us to delay the adjustment in the exchange rate by letting interest rates drift upward I think that that would lower the growth projections we have for the US economy which are only running slightly above 2-1/2 percent That wouldn't help the world economy; the LDCs would be hurt by higher interest rates and clearly their export markets would be hurt by having lower growth in the United States as well I am willing to let interest rates drift up if it would be necessary in order to help on the price front But in spite of the few hiccups that we have seen, overall the projections still show that inflation is essentially flat in the profile for the year as a whole, and I am comfortable with that projection So I think that the debate we are really going to focus on in our later deliberation is whether we want to focus monetary policy on domestic or international projections   Like most speakers before me, I favor alternative B I think it's important to keep US economic growth going and also to maintain inflation at a subdued pace I was very happy to see that the Ms have been slowing, and I think we should not do something that pushes them very sharply from their current paths I'd like to note that short-term interest rates are already very high in real terms With federal funds trading today between 6 and 7 percent, if you take the GNP deflator of 3 percent you're talking about a short-term [real] interest rate of between 3 and 4 percent I certainly wouldn't want to follow Germany and Japan into their slowdown just for the sake of holding the dollar exchange rate against those two currencies at the present time, as has been noted many times before The dollar has not depreciated very much against the broader basket of currencies As is implied by the staff projection, if we prevent the dollar from falling we will get lower growth rates than are actually indicated here So we're risking the chance of a substantial slowdown, if not a recession, in the United States That certainly wouldn't help the world economy, as such We've mentioned before that we should intervene in disorderly markets and I agree with that With all that taken into account, I favor symmetric language in  -35-    3/31/87  the policy directive and would not move the dollar to a more prominent place in the directive itself   Then you get a different directive   Let me speak against that a bit If we start to tighten up now and are unsuccessful at holding the dollar where it is at the present time, I think we will not see any improvement in the trade and current account balances, especially in view of the situation abroad Then as the bad data continue to come in on the trade front, the markets will say Well, the current level is clearly inappropriate for the exchange rate They will test us, and we will not be able to sustain the current exchange rate So I think it is probably more prudent to let the exchange rate drift down a little until it is at a level where we can see an improvement in the current account and the trade account Then if you spend your ammunition you have a chance to convince the markets that you will hold it   Well, okay But take, for instance, the one suggested sentence in the operational paragraph that says "In light of the recent instability of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, particular emphasis will be placed on conditions in these markets in operational decisions" That [conveys the] feeling that we should be holding the going exchange rate with monetary policy   I would like the funds rate where it is, but I wouldn't want to push it   I think they want to flatten it out  -43-    3/31/87   I like what Bob Parry said We don't want to look just at foreign exchange markets, and say everything else is secondary, which is what this phrasing says as it is written I don't think we want to do that either So what Bob is suggesting--taking out the first phrase--gets us there   A lot more than on the domestic conditions?  -46-    3/31/87   Bob, it is better than missing our cone   I prefer six   I would think the 3 to 7 percent conveys that we are tightening After all, the midpoint of 3 to 7 percent is 5 percent Five percent is really alternative C, and there were not many people who were speaking in favor of alternative C So, implicitly, we're changing the thrust of what people around the table have said   Then you should be wanting to vote for alternative C   If you argue for "C" then I think 3 to 7 percent would be appropriate; but if you don't argue for "C"--   Well, for growth rates of the Ms it says 5 and 5-1/2 percent   I am not concerned with that either; but I am concerned with our taking policy actions to get it down there   I think we need to make that clear in the language   I prefer 4 to 7 percent, though, to 6 percent or less That really tilts it; that lets it get to zero if you want it   Well, how about doing it like that Use the first sentence and then say "This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period of around 6 percent" And then say "Somewhat greater restraint would be appropriate, depending upon foreign exchange markets" and so forth   If we move the sentence up, we have a consistent directive up front and then we have our exception that follows   I think switching the sentence really makes a big difference   Mr Chairman, I think that's where I see the difference If the third sentence says "This approach is consistent with growth in M2 and M3", then that surmises both sentence one and sentence two I would rather have it the other way around and say we are implementing a policy of the existing degree of reserve pressure and this approach is consistent with M2 and M3 growth And then I would say if things in the foreign exchange market happen, then we could have a bit more restraint  -54-    3/31/87   The original draft that Mr Kohn produced is a good draft, in a way You have taken out that sentence that's in all caps, but otherwise that basically hits what we are really trying--   And why is it coming about? There is a big difference whether it comes about--   If you change the words--the way you said it I would be happy   Will you explain the differences between the 6 percent and--   This is Bob Heller We have discussed financial markets a lot, and I certainly agree with the summary that we probably needn't do much or shouldn't do much But I think we also have to keep in mind the real side of the economy If you look at the last quarterly numbers business fixed investment is still going down by 128 percent; residential structures are down 7 percent; and consumer spending is down 04 percent If you look at the inflation indicators, there isn't much change on the wage front; everything seems to continue to be rather well behaved compared to a year ago-- somewhere between 3 and 4 percent increases and the union side is much better behaved If you look at commodity prices, they're essentially going sideways with the exception of oil and the precious metals; certainly, the experimental index is moving sideways And the aggregates, I guess, are continuing to come in at the bottom of their ranges--there not being a range for M1, which might show a big boost My view is actually very strongly that Germany and Japan [unintelligible] should be expanding faster and not doing something to contract So, doing nothing is certainly agreeable to me   Sayonara  END OF SESSION     I find myself much more in agreement with the numbers in the Greenbook than with the general tenor of the discussion here Looking at the numbers, first of all, we have a sharp downtrend in GNP from 43 percent to 22 percent in the third quarter Domestic purchases are going down to 09 percent in the third quarter and 13 percent in the fourth On the inflation front, so much pessimism has been expressed, but the GNP deflator is actually declining to 26 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and nominal GNP is cut by about 1/3, from 78 percent in the first quarter to 55 percent in the fourth quarter So both the real economy, as well as the aggregate inflation numbers, are trending downward for this year Next year it goes the other way As we all know, production in March and April was rather dismal in every single category except defense, where it was flat Inventories were up sharply in the first quarter Consumer credit was slowing down a lot Thank goodness, in a way, there was  -21-    5/19/87  also less federal stimulus The one area where I disagree with the Greenbook is that I think it is probably a bit too optimistic on the very sharp swing in exports and the improvement in the trade performance it projects It projects an export swing from a growth rate of minus 16 percent in the first quarter to plus 17 percent in the fourth quarter The aggregate numbers go from a minus $134 billion to minus only $46 billion by the fourth quarter of next year In other words, by the end of next year, 2/3 of our trade imbalance would have been eliminated In view of the slow growth abroad that has been noted by many other speakers, I am rather skeptical that we actually will be able to achieve that   No, they are real numbers; they are 1982-base real numbers In addition, we have a real interest rate, as we were told yesterday, of 4 to 5 percent, which incorporates a bit of the extrapolation of current expectations And we continue to have our problems in the financial sector Overall, I come out on the rather subdued side, if not outright pessimistic   I agree largely with what Mr Black just said; I am also in favor of "B-minus," especially in view of the fact that M2 is lying at a level substantially below the target cone and M3 is just at the bottom end of the target range Like Mr Black, I am also in favor of variant II, moving the foreign exchange language further down in the priority list  -29-    5/19/87   The aggregates are thrown out too   M2 runs low   But when you say 10 percent or less, what are you taking as the base?   In March you have a very low--   You're pushing way above the 10 percent   Going from existing levels   From 4 to 8--   Sam, do you see any changes in the pattern of the inflows of foreign capital?   Well, I meant mainly geographically--the Japanese versus the Europeans who--   And the stock market in Japan, probably?   Otherwise, you are always counter steering with your adjustment borrowing and that's the variable that gets squeezed   The question is whether you have enough confidence in your seasonal factors to do it with any degree of precision If you don't, then you're better off--   Is that seasonal borrowing also concentrated in certain institutions?   I'm not sure You asked where we were would differ with the forecast; let me focus on that I think the Federal government deficit number of $168 billion is probably on the pessimistic side I would expect that the tax reform which has taken place, and which is clearly difficult to model as far as econometric models are concerned, would result in a considerable broadening of the tax base and, therefore, that the tax revenues would be running higher than the projections indicate That would be the one factor that I would argue would relieve some of the pressure in the financial markets and thus would yield lower interest rates in an overall economic environment where there is relatively slow consumption growth--with which I agree--and a lot of underutilized capacity and, therefore, lower investment But the commodity markets still have quite a bit of excess capacity, on a global basis at least I think that is the framework in which we could see interest rates staying roughly where they are, or maybe even drifting lower, and not having that inflation rate surge that would accompany the projections that the staff has here Overall, as far as the level of economic activity is concerned, I'm roughly in agreement with the Greenbook But as far as the financial implications are concerned, I'm not as pessimistic; and therefore, unless we do something to drive interest rates up, I think we can see probably the same level that prevails now, if not lower   Yes, but capital goods, autos, that whole area--   For once, I agree with everything that has been said so far, more or less   A lot depends on what happens to your Federal government deficit, and obviously, the difference between what the staff has said and what other people say   I would be hard pressed between alternatives I and II, but with the 5 to 8 percent modification I would go for alternative II   We have had that situation many times before in reverse--where we have overshot and then we still adopted a lower growth range and there wasn't necessarily any change in policy implied by that   There is really no expectation that we should change the range The world isn't waiting for us to make a decision on changing or not changing We have never changed an M2 or an M3 target So, if we let the target--   Lowering the targets this year, I think, would be interpreted as a signal that we want to be tighter than we were before And with the dollar rising at the present time, I see very little reason to tighten right now Why do it at the present juncture?   1987   Because now you are saying that I am going to change my ranges; I am going to be tighter than I intended to be before   If we suddenly announced lower targets--   Which we have never done before, right? Then we suddenly give a signal that we want to be tighter than we were before   I think the 4 to 8 percent is really going too far First of all, it's a very, very broad range Because then we [unintelligible] just fuzzy things over We are not giving a real message there Talking about the bottom end of the range, I disagree with the implications of the 4 percent growth for M2, certainly for next year Actually, if we use the 4 percent growth as a matter of policy and get an unintended velocity change, where would we be? If we have anywhere near the inflation that is projected, we'd have either zero or 05 percent growth That is all that's left for the real economy So 4 percent growth, I think, would be too tight; 5 percent leaves some room to grow   Yes; that's really speculative You're looking at the M2 velocity as it is projected on those handouts It is almost horizontal--just a tiny bit higher for M3, a tiny fall for [M2] I have never seen anybody who can project velocity with any great degree of confidence   We can ask ourselves whether 5 percent or 4 percent is more appropriate in conjunction with the economic outlook that we have presented And push it to a [unintelligible] You are really talking about an outlier of an outlier there   I know--which is [unintelligible] the bottom of the range, again Otherwise, you have a hard time explaining why we would be able to achieve the lower end of the target cone   No, you need 7-1/2 percent arithmetically in order to be able to reach it   Yes Right; one may be above and one below it   That's right; put it in there   Are we really planning to do that still? We're in the second half of the year Are we really going to start targeting Ml?   We may as well drop the whole sentence   Can I follow up on that one? Both in Germany and Japan, do you see the run-up in rates as mainly a result of policy actions taken or do you see it as a result of general economic conditions in the country changing?   Michael, in the federal deficit reduction to $123 billion that the Administration is projecting, can you provide us with more details? Is it mainly on the expenditure side or the revenue side?   On your handout, there is a drop from $158 billion to $123 billion, and then you say with policy action--   Thanks   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think the overall numbers, which are rather satisfactory, are good not because the aggregate economy is really good, but because the sectors which have been weak so far are the sectors that are picking up If you keep that in mind, I think the inflation picture also will look a little different than it does when looking at the aggregate economy as a whole We are eliminating the sectoral imbalances in trade and in the government sector as well as in the regional sectors that were pointed out before Overall, I think that makes for a healthier economy because, in essence, we are pulling the weak sectors up without really hurting the strong sectors at the present time Consumers are still moving forward but at a rather subdued 4-1/2 percent pace in the overall forecast And I agree with what President Morris said earlier that the investment picture may actually be a little better than the numbers of 38 to 42 percent next year suggest I'd be slightly more optimistic there, but not all that much On the export front, I think also that our growth will be sustained in the double- digit area; 12 percent in the Greenbook is certainly sounding good  Turning to the price area, because we're having that pickup in sectors that previously were very subdued, we should not experience the burst in prices that would be associated with an overall Phillips curve Therefore, I also think the employment gains which have been achieved are in areas and in sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, that were previously very, very depressed indeed Overall, I think the producer price index, as has been pointed out, is rather stable And I agree with what Mr Corrigan just said the final user prices, the GNP prices, are drifting up at a 45 percent rate But then again we have to ask ourselves--this really should be reserved for the next part of our discussion, but let me bring it up-- if we're having monetary growth right now of 5 percent and we're having price increases of 4 to 5 percent, what does that mean for the real economy if you want to make that equation square? I certainly disagree with the view of the world that we're having a zero growth So something else will have to give Either we have to produce a lot more money or price increases will not be sustained at a very healthy consolidation phase of the economy; and I don't really see very major risks on either side   Got the message?   Basically, I am for no change, as I said earlier I believe that we are in a period of sectoral catchup and the monetary growth is very subdued at the present time So, I would like to keep it at alternative B with a $500 million borrowing target and I would do two changes 1) I would upgrade the importance of inflation, and maybe give it sole prominence in the first sentence; and 2) I would downgrade the dollar, as Presidents Forrestal and Black mentioned earlier We are way above the lows that the dollar reached earlier, and to say that we want to react now to weakness in the dollar would probably be inappropriate   Let me speak on the other side I don't think we're writing here for the press release only; we're talking about the operational paragraph If we have the dollar right up front, as soon as we get the kind of weakness that we are getting now, if sustained for another day or two, it could be seen as an indication that we have to tighten monetary policy And that is not what the majority, at least of the voting members, was agreeing to So, I agree with the Chairman in moving the dollar to a lower position Let me note that it still is in the same sentence We haven't split it into two sentences, as we have done many times before So, it's a very modest downgrading; it's just the order in which we are reading it rather than a cardinal distinction   As long as we don't read a move to 3 to 6 percent as an indication that we are aiming for 4-1/2 percent, or something like that, and that is where the policy should be directed   I think that this is something we should consider sometime in the future That 4 to 8 percent is such a barn door; it's very wide At some future time we may want to narrow that down a little   Wrong direction   $525 million    8/18/87   $536 million is the average!   If you start out with a base of $600 million and then you have the language with the tilt, it gives you a very different environment than if you start with a base of $500 million and have the tilt in $500 million with a tilt in it gets you right to the range where everybody may well want to be--in the $520 to $550 million range, or whatever--while $600 million with a tilt in it would get you a lot closer to--  -36-    8/18/87   Roughly unchanged   Mike, you spoke about the sharp increases in business equipment spending How does that break down between additional capacity and efficiency enhancing?   Wait a minute You say that interest rates wouldn't be rising; but you can also come up with that scenario of a continued stable dollar that comes about because we are raising interest rates in this country Then, how would your answer be different?   I still think the hallmark of the recovery is really a better balance in the economy as a whole The sectors that have been strong in the past are not growing quite as rapidly, or are actually shrinking, and I think that is something that we should keep in mind If you look, for instance, at the projections in the Greenbook for 1987 and 1988, you still see quite a few minus signs Durables are contracting this year at a 23 percent rate; nondurables are only up 08 percent; nonresidential structures are -27 percent; residential structures are -55 percent; and federal spending is -32 percent So, there are quite a few sectors that are certainly not characterized by boom conditions, while others like agricultural, business equipment, and so on, are doing quite well As a result, you get that better balance Also, as many speakers pointed out, the great improvement in federal revenues, together with the restrained federal spending, really does a lot on the fiscal deficit side and brings a better balance on that score I think it would be a mistake to hold up the dollar with further tightening of monetary policy, because we would be inviting a slowdown in those sectors that, at the moment, are really carrying the economy real estate would be further depressed, and the capital sector would slow down And, we also need the exchange rate change that is projected in the Greenbook in order to get that improvement in the trade balance that we are all hoping for  Turning to the the long-term bond question, I agree with most of the things that have been said before, but let me add one additional factor If you look at the increase in interest rates that we have had over the last year, you see that there were noticeably sharper increases in the long-term Treasury bonds than in long-term mortgage bonds and long-term corporate bonds I would put a lot of that, which amounts to 50 to 100 basis points, at the door of the many  -30-    9/22/87  debt moratoriums that we have had, or the nonrenewal of the debt ceilings, in the last five months I think there have been four of those episodes; and that certainly must have a chilling effect, particularly on foreign investors who are looking at the United States with a jaundiced eye and putting us in the same league with countries that can't service their debt So, that certainly has been a factor contributing to higher long-term Treasury rates in addition to the real increase and the high inflationary premium we have had   I fully agree with these last remarks I think we are at $500 million and, therefore, we should probably stay around $500 million rather than do further tightening Let me make one further remark some data that I have just scratched up indicate that, yes, there have been [similar] episodes before As a matter of fact, there is a precise duplication of our current situation as far as the exchange rate changes are concerned And that is that Germany and Japan, between 1980 and 1985, had exactly the same drop in exchange rates What was their policy? The discount rate was lowered in Japan from 7-1/4 percent in 1980 to 5 percent in 1985; in Germany it dropped from 7-1/2 percent to 4 percent in that period of declining exchange rates Interest rates on three-month money dropped from 11 to 6-1/2 percent in Japan and from 9 to 5 percent in Germany As for the one thing that we all worry about--inflation--the CPI in 1980 in Japan was 8 percent and in 1985 it was 2 percent; in Germany it went from 54 to 22 percent So, I don't think that the exchange rate really should be driving our policy And in Germany and Japan, which successfully navigated that period, the exchange rate certainly wasn't taken as a cause to tighten monetary policy   In real terms what?   They what?   Real interest rates you are saying? I haven't looked at real rates; so far they have always been--   So taking that into account--and for me it is important not to get overly tight on the exchange rate question--I would go with the $500 million, which is current policy, I would argue  -35-    9/22/87   Mr Chairman, did you have symmetric language in there?   I didn't catch it   Are they both "somewhat"?   I agree with what both Governors Angell and Johnson have said and I think we also need to watch the fed funds rate in that environment As long as we are where we are, I think we are in good shape; given the fact that Treasury bill rates have dropped so much, we really have some room in that arena So, I'm agreeing with our press statement this morning That's what we said we would want to do, so let's do it   Let me go back for a second to Germany I think you are quite right There has always been a split between the    11/3/87  Finance Ministry and the Bundesbank The Finance Ministry, as well as all the regional presidents of the State Central Banks, has always wanted to have a strong dollar because they were more concerned about the employment effects, while the Bundesbank clearly was more concerned about inflation I think it is questionable whether President Poehl would have a majority on that council if he wanted to have a policy that would defend the exchange rate at the present time So, in essence, he has to give in to a majority on his governing board As far as the dollar is concerned, however, I disagree with you a little, Jerry The danger of the dollar falling out of bed has been very substantially reduced during the last week because we now have [an exchange rate against the mark of about] 170, and not even the [unintelligible] that will go below 160 When you are on the high perch, the danger of falling is not much higher; so a freefall becomes less and less of a likelihood because the markets will support the dollar at some level I think we are getting reasonably close to that level   Like the stock market, I think it's going to bounce back   One number that surprised me a little in the Greenbook--especially the contrast between the 1988 number and the 1987 number--was the capacity utilization in manufacturing, which is inching up If you look at producers' durable equipment, it is still going up at a rate that is in excess of real GNP The unemployment rate, as you pointed out, is leveling off Is the driving force just the composition of imports--that they have such a heavy weight in manufacturing? Or what explains the increase in the utilization rate?   But that's higher than your GNP number That's precisely the point   At the last meeting, I argued that we were moving toward a much better balance in the real economy and I think that is still on track I think we now are moving also toward a better balance in the financial economy While there is uncertainty around, we have eliminated some of the excesses that Frank Morris was taking about a minute ago If you look at the stock market, after all, we came from a high of over 2700, so the glass has been drained by about 25 or 30 percent but it is still three quarters full And that is not a bad position Essentially, we are back to where we were at the beginning of the year In one fell swoop, we have wiped out inflation, or sharply reduced inflationary expectations, and that has given us a lot more breathing room on the interest rate front as well And now I think what's in train is a better balance in the world economy as well, with exchange rates now getting very close to levels that would be sustainable on a long-term basis; and the imbalances in the world economy will be reduced, as a lot of people have talked about before By the way, on the budget deficit side, the lower interest rates also clearly will help in holding the budget deficit to approximately current levels And nobody has been talking about the threat of protectionist legislation; that has also gone away, I think, to a large extent So, I think there are a couple of bright spots in a gloomy situation that we shouldn't overlook I agree that there is all this uncertainty but, if we keep following that path, I think we will see the light of day pretty soon   I'm also in favor of "B" and I like the Corrigan language Like Mr Keehn, I'd go with the asymmetrical version But on the fed funds rate, I think we should narrow it just a bit You know, 5 to 9 percent--that's a barn door I think the old practice of centering it around the expected value is useful So if we narrow it a little--and everybody seems to be saying 6-3/4 percent--and insert 5-3/4 to 7-3/4 percent we have a 2 percentage point range rather than a 4 percentage point range Maybe that gets a little of that feeling in there without moving to a very narrow fed funds rate specification   Well, I'm in favor of making policy clear rather than obfuscating   It's a very minuscule point in the draft directive with the brown [Class I] cover, lines 20-21, we say "business capital spending was strong in the third quarter and forward indicators pointed to continuing gains" I think that's a little strong It's certainly getting a lot slower Maybe we could just drop "forward indicators pointing to continuing gains"   Yes, "pointed"   Yes but pointed to continuing gains, though   Well, I certainly misread it and I think others may misread it too   Well, mine is not a strong feeling but I just thought there was a--   I think it sets the wrong tone a little; that "continuing gains" is what bothers me Maybe you want to say And while forward indicators pointed to continuing gains, this is no longer true   Well, 4 to 8 is closer to zero   Well, I found it a very interesting paper and helpful to have the options in front of us, some of which we haven't discussed for the last year, at least The current period clearly is a very important period as we are coming off pegging the funds rate It is the same sort of thing as taking off wage-price controls You have to ask Where do we go from here? I was wondering why you didn't give consideration to a broader array of options such as targeting total reserves, or targeting nonborrowed reserves, or other techniques that have been used in the past Maybe you did and you rejected them In particular, I'm wondering about this because during the last three quarters of the year--I think at virtually every FOMC meeting--we have had projections for increased reserve growth and we have had projections for increased M1 growth and in virtually all of those cases the projections haven't come true So, maybe there is something in our operating technique that doesn't get us where we want to go I was wondering whether the other techniques might be more suitable to get us to the targets that we actually want to reach Obviously, a lot of people here have been through the periods when targeting total reserves or nonborrowed reserves was the technique and, being new to the game, I was wondering why you rejected them   Not necessarily You can also argue that your general path for nonborrowed reserves might be 5 percent, say, but you would be willing to tolerate quite a bit of variation to mitigate interest rates swings that would be implied in following it week by week right down to the "T" One probably can make compromises along that line, too, but it brings in the broader issue of the Humphrey- Hawkins testimony and setting targets Why do we go through the motions if it isn't something that we take seriously?   But, the other way around would work, too I'm not arguing for it, but if you fix the fed funds rate and then you see the borrowing fluctuating, that also gives you information   Well, in view of the fact that we are funds rate targeting anyhow, we can't possibly confuse the market by changing our procedure right now So I think that argument doesn't hold at the present time David, I read the paper a long, long time ago You said it targeted only adjustment borrowing and there was no significant difference in the fed funds rate Now, I know it wasn't significant, but which direction was it actually moving?   First of all, in view of all this impressive evidence, I was wondering how people used to conduct monetary policy before we had all these high-speed computers   Right I'm looking at your chart 18, which in a way talks about what you can call the efficiency with which you know of the various measures Especially for the first year or two, or the first six to eight quarters after your shock, M1A seems to be so much more superior to M2 than M1   Yes One could argue that that is a very powerful argument in favor of M1A, especially over a horizon of a year or two I was wondering, first of all, why you don't give a lot of emphasis to that particular measure And, second, would you address the argument that the narrow aggregates are more closely under our control and therefore particularly suited as targets, rather than as broader indicators of what is going on in the economy?   Yes, but I think Tom wouldn't argue that you would stick to the target in the German situation right now He would say that if circumstances make you believe that the demand for money has increased, you would be willing to go above the target You would set a series of short-range targets so that you would accommodate that increased demand for money--an increase in demand for central bank money, in that particular case I think that's what I heard Tom say to handle it not in a rigid way by saying "here's the target and you are playing along with it", but to adjust it in the light of circumstances as you see the economy and prices evolving, and so on   Except that he says that some of that we can control more readily than the broader numbers   Si, are you counting on me to come in tomorrow?   It probably happened when we started our monetary targeting, because according to Goodhart's law, anything you want to control will get out of hand But that isn't my question According to your projection, the deficit is going to worsen by about $20 billion to $165 billion According to the Administration, it's going to improve by about $20 billion to $123 billion I was wondering what would happen to your forecast if the Administration were right   Mike, your forecasts are quite far apart on the expenditure side, too Some of that is cyclically related, so you wouldn't see much of a weakening of the economy if the budget cutters actually succeed in [unintelligible]  -49-    12/15-16/87   What are your inflation rates? You said they were increasing?   Is that dollars or volume?   I was quite surprised to hear the high degree of optimism from all parts of the country expressed around the table here I was surprised because an awful lot of people talked about their agreement with the Greenbook And if you look at the Greenbook, the next quarter's GNP is down 11 percent consumption is negative; durables and nondurables are negative; industrial production is down to a 10 percent increase; housing starts and auto sales are at the lowest levels since 1983 Yet everybody is extremely optimistic   Martha hasn't spoken yet? Well--   The optimism is also in contrast to what I would almost call a barrage of visits and letters that have been coming in here during the last couple of weeks and days Curiously, many of the remarks by those representing the national associations--often of the industries that some of you were talking about--were very much on the pessimistic side Obviously, we have some problem here of looking at the trees versus the forest And, having lived off Coricidin for the last three or four days, I really don't know how to sort it out I come down with Mike Prell, who says I see a lot of good things and I see a lot of bad things, and I really don't know which way the evidence is pointing But there is a marked contrast between the optimism that seems to be being picked up in the anecdotal evidence    12/15-16/87  and the outlook that I would argue is not at all optimistic, according to the Greenbook Also, if you look at some of the monetary statistics, we have a real money supply that has been falling now since May, and reserves are flat So, if all that optimism is out there, I'm still curious why people don't hold that money Those are also some of the remarks I seem to be hearing, at least from our Desk people They say, well, the demand for money just isn't there So, I'm puzzled Obviously, I hope it will turn out the way the vast majority here describe it to be, but I think that there are a lot of reasons for unease in that optimistic outlook, because I think some of the more macro forces may not be all that sanguine   I'm essentially for "B" but a bit split as far as the timing is concerned, maybe along the lines that Bob Parry was just talking about Through the year-end, and as long as the dollar is under pressure, I would stick to the fed funds rate at 6-3/4 percent If the pressure on the dollar eases, and once we get through the choppy weather of the year-end, I would switch more towards a (3) type policy with emphasis on the borrowing again I would be asymmetrical in the easing direction, too, so that might allow the fed funds rate to drop a bit Probably a normal borrowing target of $300 million would be appropriate for that   That's right   Then borrowing at $400 million could be associated with fed funds trading above 6-3/4 percent   It would not be the case Okay   Well, there was quite a consensus, though not a total consensus, for symmetry; there was a very substantial minority that was asymmetrical toward easing Implicit in that view was [an understanding] that the fed funds rate would come down from the 6-3/4 percent level rather than go up as we move to a borrowing target That was implicit, at least in my mind   No, but which way are you moving? As you get up to the 6-3/4 percent and you move to a borrowing target we all figure that the 6-3/4 percent is associated roughly with $300 million, right?   Currently And, as you move toward the $300 million--   For the rest of the period, where would you see reserves and the fed funds rate in the absence of any additional fires?   So, back to 6-3/4 percent?   And the borrowing then would be--   No, I mean for the rest of the period, from now on   For the rest of the period, from now on, it would be $350 million--is that right? Or $400 million?   $300 million?   $300 million    1/5/88   I largely agree with the staff forecast for the first half of 1988, but I do have a couple of doubts on the bounce- back, and the basis for the bounce-back, in the second half Just to review a few of those things the government [sector forecast] for the year as a whole is a -13; consumption is slow; residential structures are flat; business investment is 1 to 1-1/2 percent; and export growth--which is the driving engine of the economy at the present time--is slowing significantly For instance, if you compare there was 238 percent growth in the third quarter of 1987 and only 128 percent growth is forecasted for the third quarter of 1988 which, after all, is the opening quarter for that second half bounce-back So, I really don't think that the forces that are going to generate  -24-    2/9-10/88  that bounce-back in the second half will be in place First of all, as the Chairman mentioned already, much of the forecast is based on a drop in the saving rate--something that we really don't want to see, for the reasons that Jerry Corrigan just mentioned Second, once that first-quarter or first-half slowdown hits, I think there will be a lot of businessmen who will be revising their own forecasts, and then their investment decisions, for the second half Third, the leading indicators, although they're not all that reliable, have been solidly down for the last three months And, finally, nobody has mentioned-- Martha Seger was skirting around the issue, I think--political uncertainties Let me do it anyhow As we get close to the election, the political uncertainties and the new programs that will be discussed--on the tax side, on the federal government spending side, and in general--will also not be exactly forces that will lead to rejuvenation of investment spending before the election So, plans will get postponed; that's something that we have experienced in [election] years before Overall for the second half, I would see a weaker economy than the staff sees, and most of the risks there will be on the downside I'll leave it at that   I could go along with alternative III as well, but the problem that I really have is with the path, as Governor Angell already started to address First of all, I think it is very clear that last year, as Governor Angell pointed out, we consistently undershot our short-term targets We undershot the various targets that we established by 1 percent for the lowest undershoot and 39 percent for the maximum undershoot I think it's very important that we don't do that again this year, because we are getting in the danger zone on the downside So, I hope that we draw the bottom half of that  -33-    2/9-10/88  target cone--the lower band--with a very thick pencil and with the intention not to go through it on the bottom side  As far as the base is concerned, I think we again had very special factors at the end of this year, which were very different from the special factors that we had at the end of last year I think the reasons detailed in the Bluebook, in exhaustive detail, are very compelling indeed So I have a lot of sympathy for what Governor Angell is saying about changing the base period around somewhat In particular, if you look at the chart for M2, for instance, you see that for the proposed parallel bands for 1988 the upper limits are an exact continuation of the bottom part of last year So we're saying that we are lowering ourselves permanently down for one reason only-- and that's the accident that January 1st happens If we had two-year targets, we would now be in a position where we would say, "Well, we have an awful lot of catching up to do" Or if the [target] year had begun in midyear, we would have started out, let's say, in June-- that's the time where the point of my argument is better--then again we would be at the bottom end of the cone and we would probably be arguing that we should be moving more towards the middle of the cone To ratify permanently the very temporary factors that were in effect at the end of last year, I think, would be a mistake And I would support the new target ranges only with the proviso of rebasing  On how to rebase, I think there are two options open to us One would be to go to the bottom end of last year's target cone-- that's roughly where the solid line and the dashed line intersect on the graph--and start this year's target cone there So, we would be working with an area of some overlap instead of zero overlap between last year and this year The other alternative--one that may be a compromise to what Governor Angell is suggesting--is to base towards the second half of 1987, taking a midpoint there Eyeballing it, you can see that you are getting a bit of an overlap at least, instead of virtually zero overlap So, with a rebasing proposal along one or the other line, I'd be happy to go along   Don, if I follow my earlier desire to somehow or other ignore the November and December artificially low figures-- looking at the table on page 14 [of the Bluebook], there are growth rates from November to March and December to March If I calculate a growth rate from October to March--I've been doing it here on the back of the envelope--is 57 percent about right for alternative A and 54 percent for alternative B?   M2   As I said before, in contrast to many of the members, I don't feel that the second-half strength is a foregone conclusion It's not in the bag and the risks are still there that it will not come about As far as the short-term monetary growth is concerned, I see January mainly as a bounce-back after the very weak November and December numbers If you take the number from October to March, as has been just supplied by Don Kohn, our current targets only imply 5-3/4 percent M2 growth under alternative A and only 5-1/2 percent growth under alternative B So there would be very slow growth, indeed, compared at least with the numbers that we see in front of us here--the 8 percent number that's the implied growth [under alternative B] from December to March So I see both "A" and "B" as pretty restrictive policies I certainly would favor somewhere in between--I'd say right on the line between "A" and "B"--with a borrowing target just as it exists right now, maintain continuing pressure And following Peter Sternlight, I'd say continuing pressure is $150 million and the trading range for federal funds probably would then be 6-3/8 to 6-1/2 percent, broadly   Existing borrowing, existing pressure--so it would be $150 million  -58-    2/9-10/88   Well, I interpret it--   Well, I was going more with Peter Sternlight's number of $150 million That's the actual number, and the actual pressure existing right now, and I want to maintain that actual pressure   Yes If it goes down to 6-1/4 percent, that's fine   As I said earlier, I'm still in favor of rebasing, with a 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent range; or 4 to 8 percent is also fine with me I really don't have a strong feeling on that as much as the rebasing   Deciding now, 4 to 8 percent for both?   7 to 11 percent then   May I ask a question? What are the numbers you're penciling in for the M growths?   Monetary Ms?   Right   No, not if you're lowering--the old borrowing target implicit in "B" was $250 million, right? So--   You shouldn't have a little--   6-1/2 percent, yes   How about "the current approach remains appropriate"   You mean before that you were less normal   Well, it's a public statement   Yes, but that says the current approach remains appropriate  -72-    2/9-10/88   Just scratch it   Thank you I also have very much enjoyed reading the papers But I think there's a semantic unresolved conflict that becomes apparent--in the paper itself, too--that's at the bottom of what both Manley Johnson and President Black have been talking about For instance, if you look at page four, it is very clearly stated that fluctuations in the funds rate can at times "lead to a misperception of the Federal Reserve's intentions" That's at the top of the page And on the next page it is argued that "Movements in the federal funds rate can convey information to policy makers about expectations and other aspects of financial market conditions" And then it says a little lower down that "A narrow focus on the funds rate tends to smother such market-generated reactions" Either we see the fed funds rate as a signal to the markets or we see the rate as a signal to us If we are trying to get both types of signals out of the same number, or we perhaps get the two of them confused, I think that we do have a bit of a problem  The second point is that I find it very difficult to believe that a $200 million or $250 million borrowing target is something that is so precise that we can steer the entire economy with it It is something that is so minuscule in comparison to the markets that I continue to marvel at the good job that we are doing on it The seasonal factors and the other things that influence our required reserves are just overwhelmingly large compared to that small number And then we are arguing here in the Committee about going from $200 or $225 million--you know, it's just something so small in the entire economy that I find it difficult to believe that that is really the entire fulcrum on which we can influence what happens in the country at large There's also the problem that the reluctance to borrow sometimes--I guess you can have the converse as well--would very strongly influence the $200 million dollar number, as we have seen in the last couple of weeks and months in connection with the Texas situation  Overall, I must say that I'm very satisfied with what has actually happened And so I'm torn here We have a procedure, but I don't really fully understand why it is producing the good results-- results that I like There hasn't been a convincing argument, I think, as to what brings that about On the other hand, I'm reluctant to say let's get rid of this procedure if it will continue to produce these good results But I'm not convinced that it will actually do that Suddenly, we may be off the track and we may be flying that airplane right into the ground And we'd still be wondering what happened, because we had such a nice borrowing target, but somehow or another the whole growth path of the aggregates isn't doing what we'd like it to do  Now, there are really two papers in front of us--one by Ms Meulendyke, in which there is a nice quick discussion of the procedures that existed in the 1970s It says the FOMC "instructed the Desk to raise the federal funds rate within a limited band if the monetary aggregates were well above the tracking path or lower the funds rate within that band if the aggregates were below the tracking path" It sounds an awful lot like what Mr Melzer has proposed, except that he was talking about the monetary base instead of the aggregates But there isn't a lot of discussion about why that  -13-    3/29/88  procedure was abandoned It just says factually that in 1972 modifications were made and, like many of us, I wasn't there I'd really like to have heard a bit more about why that particular procedure would be an unsatisfactory one I guess that's perhaps something Mr Sternlight can enlighten us on   Because there was a reluctance to adjust in order to--in essence, we were not following this early 1970s procedure the way it was laid out?   So, it wasn't a bad procedure, you would argue It was sort of a lack of moral fiber that--   "After you, fellow", right?   Well, you're talking about slightly different things I think Jerry is talking about getting rid of the monetary growth targets totally, right?   And you're thinking that, too?  -20-    3/29/88   You're keeping it, right?   So you have that little thing that goes up and down It's like a little boat, and you have enormous waves bobbing it up and down We don't know; we say as long as we stay two feet above water, we're fine   You have the shortest commute   If I look at the chart here correctly, in 1985 there were 10 changes in the borrowing assumption Were they all phone calls? They weren't all FOMC meetings; were they phone calls?   Yes   And they're plotted here as official changes?   But how can you have an official change without a vote being taken?   Oh, I see   Yes   Yes, the box   And what is plotted here?   Borrowing assumption by the Committee or by the Desk?   Without a Committee vote?   No, no, I just--  -32-    3/29/88   I was just asking for the facts; I wasn't trying to criticize anything I was just trying to find out the factual information as to whether the line here reflected Committee votes or whatever you actually put into the path   What was actually in the path   Well, I was looking at the chart because I thought these were Committee votes   But there's a difference between long-run and short-run policy, too I think Jerry was addressing that earlier If you're setting your long-run monetary growth targets, and in order not to change your long-run policy you're making a short-term adjustment-- let's say in borrowing targets--to get closer to that, you can argue that your long-run policy is unchanged, and therefore, you've got to change your short-term tactics I think that's where the ambiguity comes in   I think I would agree with the pretty satisfactory description of the overall economic growth picture, of unemployment, and the good investment outlook as well Some people have pointed to some weakness And, while we are making enormous strides in the external sector, let's remind ourselves that we still have a long way to go there Therefore, we can't let the domestic boomlet get totally out of hand, because we have to shift resources to the export sector in the years to come to get that external imbalance removed On inflation, there is one number that nobody has really talked about much--I'm glad I was able to look over Mike Kelley's shoulder and take it away from him--   The Producer Price Index hasn't moved at all for the last half year, and I think it's important to keep it that way The price pressures that others here have been talking about are certainly there--for example, in the metals sector Monetary growth is higher than we have targeted and the dollar is under pressure So, while I am very satisfied with the overall operation of the real economy, I think it is important to keep it that way   Let me just ask a quick question, which has to do with the same problem I was talking about before We have fed funds rates still at fairly high limits I'm not talking about current policy now, but what if you wanted to have a fed funds rate around 3 or 4 percent? If we're close to that [unintelligible] barrier, as far as the borrowing is concerned, what's going to do it?  SPEAKER(?) Discount rate   Yes   Well, yes But I always--   I'd like to get back to the middle of the target range for the monetary aggregates--not do it instantly, but gradually I fully agree with the Chairman's views alternative B with asymmetric language and $100 million on borrowing   At some point--you feed it in slowly   It's drifting up   Yes, that's good   Are you talking about the Committee or the whole group?   Two weeks ago   I found both papers very interesting and really helpful I think it would be very confusing to the public at large, and especially to Congress, if we had two different types of monetary control procedures--one a target and the other one a constraint If  -22-    5/17/88  we ask ourselves why monetary targets were introduced in the first place, they were certainly not introduced or requested by Congress because they thought those were just some guidelines that we could flop over and under There was clearly the intent that they be some kind of constraint, however binding And if we suddenly introduce a second set of numbers--one set a constraint and one set a target--I think the public legitimately will ask what we are doing Which one do you really take seriously? So the confusion that would result, I think, would be great I think it would be useful, however, to include the monetary base among the other monetary targets, but I'd treat it on the same level as the existing targets And one thing that's important, too, is what Don Kohn was saying--namely, that the behavior is likely to change once you introduce it as a target For certain, once you introduce it as a constraint, the old statistical relationships probably won't hold anymore In any case, that's where I would come out I'd treat the two the same I'd be in favor of having something on the short end, and because M1 probably misbehaves a little more than the base, the base is the better candidate at the short end of the spectrum   Well then, let's rename all the targets; let's call them all constraints or something like that You know, I take the range seriously as [the growth rates] get closer to the borders, it influences the way I vote on the current monetary targets But I don't take them as an absolute, if all other things would indicate going the opposite way As President Morris was saying earlier Would you go voluntarily into a recession that would otherwise not be necessary only to stick to that constraint? And the answer would be no Immediately, you already set up these escape clauses too So, I think they are very much the same as the monetary targets; and if they're not the same, then we should take the monetary targets as seriously as we take the constraint I'm in favor of looking at it; among the various options that you have there, I would be strongly inclined not to call them two different things   Yes, Mike is saying you look at the first month, but then you're really--   But the demand for money has gone through--  -35-    5/17/88   Thank you Well, let me start with a report from my district, which goes all the way from Dulles airport to Constitution Avenue   Also part, or a subsector The unemployment rate in the area is 1-1/2 percent, which is almost on [unintelligible] with the Japanese conditions, depending on your view I haven't noticed any strike activity--that doesn't mean it isn't going on--but people seem to have some trouble hiring As far as wage pressures are concerned, my own wage hasn't changed for 1-1/2 years but the Board seems to--   It won't change next year either, thank you But the President seems to have some trouble filling empty seats on the Board But, after a year and a half search, he seems to have succeeded now, although there are still some obstacles in the way  Now, let me point to the national picture I think the only forecast I can really follow is the Greenbook forecast And while I'm a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast, I think there are some features in it that are already feeling pessimistic The Greenbook has the growth rate dipping a year from now--that's the second quarter of 1989--to 17 percent Domestic purchases at that time will be growing at a rate of 03 percent; the unemployment rate is up to 58 - 59 percent; investment is growing only at 1 or 2  -33-    6/29-30/88  percent; both the personal as well as the industrial structures are solidly in the minus column; the Federal Government is solidly in the minus column; capacity utilization is dropping With all that happening, plus the low monetary growth that we've seen in the last year--and as I pointed out yesterday, we're still below the bottom end of last year's target cone--I don't see the big surge in inflation that some people expect Governor Johnson has already pointed out very clearly what I think is happening that past monetary policy really has helped to break that inflationary impetus that we have seen building up Governor Angell, I think, said the same thing The yield curve is flattening, long rates are coming down, the dollar is going up, and you see two sort of opposing trends in commodity markets On the one hand, you have the effect of the drought; on the other hand [unintelligible] prices have been dropping very sharply in the last couple of weeks and that's often a fairly good inflation indicator, too So, to sum up, I think we are already on slowing trends We see the results of the tightness of policies that we instituted last year and in the early part of this year And I would expect that inflationary expectations are on a downward trend Thank you   But Don was still applying monetary restraint at that moment Right?   You're still stepping on the brakes and that produces the high interest rates   I'm for maintaining the current 1988 ranges and the 1989 ranges that go with II, essentially for the same reasons that Governor Johnson expressed I think we should proceed slowly and save, if you will, some of that ammunition for the final determination of the ranges in February I'd rather keep going forward at that point, like Governor Angell was saying, than having to backtrack early next year and then going to a higher range some time next year I think it is more important for us to meet our targets and to show that we want to make some continuing progress   How about half way--3-1/4 to 7-1/4?   Like President Morris said a) it is very difficult to go back on what we have done; b)--   Then we are moving in the wrong direction In that sense, it sends bad signals to the market, especially if you make some progress and you're getting lower interest rates And then you say, well, now we are going to increase our monetary growth   I'd be very reluctant to reverse myself later on, having voted for it now   Can you read it again?   I think, Mr Chairman, that the problem will go away anyhow, now that we're getting them down to a range--you know,  -46-    6/29-30/88  the midpoint is 5 percent--which Professor Friedman has always advocated as a permanent growth range from now until eternity So, I think in the near-term future we won't have these problems any more  SPEAKER(?) Is that Ben Friedman? [LAUGHTER]   We can go back to a one-day meeting! [LAUGHTER]   Mr Boehne said it pretty well There is good reason to maintain the current posture, especially in view of the high dollar that we're seeing at the present time If you see a marked turnaround in markets, international or domestic, then I'd say in two or three weeks, or whenever that occurs, we can have a conference call and change our policy posture as may be appropriate at that particular time So, I'd be for the $550 million borrowing assumption and a conference call I don't know whether a conference call means we are asymmetric or not I think I'd rather have the Committee take action than have the Desk automatically do it   Yes As long as that's before it happens and the phone call is not a reaffirmation of action That's what I'd like to see I'd be glad to go along with the asymmetrical language, with a phone call   Another $100 million then or--   I think it has effected a slowing in the economy   I think the last time they did   Yes, I have one more comment I think it was Mr Forrestal who suggested a slight re-ordering in the operational paragraph Wouldn't it be appropriate on the bottom of page 19 in the last sentence, "taking account of" to move that "conditions in financial markets" [further down in the list] to be together with the reference to the foreign exchange markets? So that would read on the next page "developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets" That's not our top concern clearly and I'm open to whether you want inflation first or the business expansion first I'd be happy to go along with Mr Forrestal to put inflation first, business expansion second, and then the financial and markets together   Good point I agree with that   That's also good   But that's really taken [into account]; even maintain means consolidating   What if you make it a very slight increase?   Mr Truman said part of what I wanted to say, but I think there's an important distinction between the types of intervention The kind that just dribbles $50 million in every day, which seems to me at least to have virtually zero effect, is the kind of intervention that shows up in the Jurgensen Report as having very little effect On the other hand, if you're hitting a one-way market with a certain relatively large intervention, then you really get the market impact that you're talking about But I think what you've got to ask is whether by doing that you're also creating uncertainty I think you are And by creating the uncertainty you're reducing the incentive to take positions, because they're built on the one-way certainty Then you've got to ask yourself the broader question of whether a central bank is contributing to increasing or decreasing the uncertainty Clearly, we like to think that we are moving the market towards the ultimate equilibrium, thereby somehow or other reducing fluctuations But I think that is really tough to substantiate econometrically because you're dealing by necessity with small samples and periods that are very difficult to compare   Yes, but, Sam, that is not the relevant number for intervention purposes What is relevant, I think, is the size of the open position in the market   And clearly no one knows, but that's what you're trying to do   Did you say bond markets were down 3/4?   I was wondering whether Ted Truman could say a few more words about the economic, and particularly the monetary policy, assumptions that he has underlying the dollar forecast in other countries, especially Japan and Germany?   What they will do in the future or they--   Thanks   Let me start out by observing that there's an enormous difference between the tone of this discussion and the tone of the discussion that you would hear, for instance, in the OECD economic policy committee or WP3 When foreigners are talking about the United States these days it is generally with admiration Gee, I wish I were in your shoes--with the possible exception of the Japanese I listen to this discussion here, and it is probably the most pessimistic discussion I've heard for the last two years around this table I'm not exactly sure what accounts for that difference except that people look a lot more skeptically at their own future  Overall, I still think everything is going more or less according to plan If you look at the various components of GNP, we continue to have the best progress in the export sector and the investment sector, and that's exactly the way it should be We had growth last quarter of gross domestic purchases of 11 percent If you look at the projections out--23, 14, 27, 17, and 12 percent-- they are all in that ballpark range So, certainly it's not going to be a runaway economy in any sense of the word Yes, there are certain    8/16/88  areas where we do see shortages; quite a few people have talked about skilled labor shortages But I fail to see how a tight monetary policy will produce more skilled workers to alleviate that particular shortage  Actually, I saw a very interesting article produced by the Chicago Fed research department that was arguing essentially that the wage pressures wouldn't be as pronounced as many people were going to expect I don't like the PPI increases any more than anybody else; I think that is a worrisome index indeed But on the other hand, as Governor Angell just pointed out, the commodity prices which are even further down the pike, are again very well behaved and roughly on the level that they were exactly one year ago I think the difference between the GNP deflator and the fixed-weight price index isn't only due to base periods and things of that sort It's due to the fact that Americans are smart and they are shifting away from the expensive products to the less expensive products As a result, actual inflation is less than the inflationary pressures which are emanating from some sectors  The dollar continues to be strong as well I think overall if you have to make a judgment on whether you really want a much stronger economy, you would say no Do you really want a much weaker economy? I certainly would say no And, therefore, I've come up with the conclusion that we shouldn't tinker all that much   If you're looking at the Federal Reserve index, it's within a fraction of a percentage point from the level a year ago Is that correct?  -26-    8/16/88   Especially some indexes that are weighted   Domestic   Obfuscation   I think the problem that a lot of people perceive--and that's why it's on the table for a third time I guess-- is precisely the problem that Joan was describing earlier, where the market was perceiving one thing and then the Federal Reserve was almost led along the path by the market And unless we chose to do the opposite, in essence, we were caught And that, I think, made some people uncomfortable  I think the other problem is that quite often you do have these technical problems Recently, there haven't been any technical operating problems; but get a computer failure or encounter rainstorms in certain areas of the country, and borrowings are all over the map, and as a result, it gets difficult to really see what's going on In addition, as Don Kohn was talking about, the reluctance of bankers to borrow or maybe a tighter administration of the window--which has not been suggested recently, but had been raised earlier--was perhaps influencing the amount that was actually being borrowed  I think overall I'd be in favor of moving closer, as President Melzer said just a minute ago, to the reserve targeting, because that's what we ultimately want to do Obviously, there are problems [with that approach] too So, if we can devise a procedure that gets us to a 5 or 6 on Ed Boehne's scale, I'm certainly willing to listen But technically I haven't exactly figured out what that procedure would be   But, Mr Chairman, the one thing that you can't fail to wonder about is why the relationship is better again than it used to be Maybe it is because we are doing something close to fed funds targeting And in that environment, you may see the money supply and GNP relationship being reestablished And [perhaps] as soon as you start controlling "M" again then that relationship will tend to break down the famous Goodhart's law   Yes, but in a short-term operational sense   When I joined the Board somebody told me that alternative "B" was always the correct one I'm grateful to the staff that there are alternatives "B" and "C", so "B" is still the correct one   You've got to make it easy I'm happy to support alternative "B" And I think the Ms are right in the middle of the target range; that's very good I think we should avoid  -39-    8/16/88  adopting a stop-go policy so we are not overdoing it on the tight side and see that danger would be there I think I'd go along with Governor Angell on giving the monetary aggregates a bit more prominence I'm not sure I want to move it to the first spot, but somewhere in the middle is fine I think that that would be very good in front of foreign exchange and domestic financial markets Overall, I support $600 million borrowing and I'd prefer symmetric language but be happy to go along with asymmetric   You say 3-1/2 and 5-1/2?   I agree with your recommendation   Keep us [unintelligible], right?   The sandwiches aren't made yet   We'll take it!  END OF MEETING       But, Mr Chairman, as the discussion right now shows, I think it's very difficult to make a judgment on the appropriateness of the program in the absence of a briefing on what's going on in Mexico I for one would have very much appreciated either to have a briefing like that or to have a background paper so we can form some considered judgment as to whether these are appropriate measures in the current Mexican situation As it is now, I'm happy to go along with it, but it's blind faith  The second point I would like to make is in the press release I'm [not] exactly sure what it means at the end--that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are prepared to develop a short-term bridge loan depending on the development of loan programs by Mexico with the World Bank and IMF I mean, they've got to do those programs first, then we do the bridge loan, or is it--?   Wasn't there a whole series of them? One is in place already and does the second one roll in?   Can I make a comment?   You know the dollar is falling, and it's now [blamed] on the weak US economy Late last year, the dollar was falling and it was blamed on the strong US economy because it meant that more imports were being sucked into the country and therefore the  -12-    11/1/88  dollar had to go down I'm getting a little confused, not by what Mr Cross was saying but by the way the world is reacting One day undoubtedly the dollar will be falling, and we will be called upon to tighten policy which undoubtedly will send the economy a little bit further down, and presumably the dollar will go up   It's probably the differential between the two larger--   Probably it's the differential between the two that counts, right?   I think the only thing I meant to say was that we shouldn't overdo it It's all that Mr Cross and Mr Truman were saying earlier also in response to Lee Hoskins I really agree with the way you present the case We shouldn't overdo it as far as the  -15-    11/1/88  strength of the economy and the dollar are concerned And I think one very important factor in the current dollar slide clearly was the disappointing trade numbers released a month ago I'm not sure whether the slide started on that day or roughly a week or-- I think it started a day or two earlier because there were some reports that the numbers were going to be bad   But your 1 percent market limit must limit it to some extent, even to less than 50   Do you have an idea where that--   Well, that's different   Well, it's getting pretty late, and I really have nothing to add, so I'll pass Thank you   Don, how long do you think that that slowdown in Ml and also to an extent in M2 can be sustained without really having an impact on the real side? You talked a bit about velocity, but if you're looking at M1, we're really looking at zero growth out for the period that you're talking about   You can argue the other way around, too You can stretch a rubber band only so far, or you're taking up the slack that really exists there   How about the takeover activity, how does that affect the--   Thanks   I can certainly support that suggestion You didn't say anything about the federal funds rate associated with it I would hope that would be back into the middle of the range that we  -45-    11/1/88  had anticipated for the federal funds rate when we approved the last directive   Thanks   What I'm really saying is supporting the funds rate at somewhere, well at about 1/8th   Abstain   Turn it sideways, maybe   Well, on previous occasions I've said that I was always amazed that $100 million changes could move the economy around like a [unintelligible] I think the current [unintelligible] shows that it is very difficult to have a stable relationship between something that small and something that large It's sort of like having a big pyramid standing exactly on its tip Making minute adjustments at the bottom can balance the pyramid, but it's not at all clear that that will always avoid major movement of the pyramid either In any case, like Mr Johnson said, as soon as we see some instability there, we are ready to abandon the operating procedures that we have, and we immediately go back to federal funds targeting  I sent around a paper from the OECD and last week [at the OECD meeting] there was a topic of discussion indicating that virtually every single country represented around the table had an operating procedure that was focusing on a federal funds rate equivalent On the other hand, a number of the countries typically used a monetary growth range for various aggregates as medium-term targets And, on balance, I think that is probably as good a combination as one can get You know, use the fed funds operating target itself and then have a medium range monetary growth objective in mind and steer the federal funds rate in order to attain that target That allows for deviations like those specified in Don Kohn's paper That's a very good paper, a very thorough discussion These velocity changes that we can assess and predict with pretty good accuracy [unintelligible] might be amazed in that respect [unintelligible] take that into account As a result, I think we could have a very consistent package that would allow us to attain the targets with a higher degree of precision than the borrowing target procedure allows us What I would do with borrowings is use it as an indicator variable, a variable to watch along with the others Then you would get the market signals, the market feedback, that you could still take into account and incorporate along with the other things that we are watching, but you would do so in a systematic and explicit fashion Thank you   But if you wanted to formalize that--I mean all your targets--in the directive, wouldn't you squeeze the fed funds rate clause down to 50 basis points or something like that?   Mr Chairman, with due respect, I think the better way to describe it is that it was broke, it is broke, and we are continually fixing it   What's the snow forecast?   Just on that point, that's why I would be in favor of having alternative forecasts One with, let's say, the interest rates going up and one with a different policy forecast So, then you can really tell it apart, and I think that would fulfill what you wanted   And I think it would help a lot with making the proper policy judgments you want to make   Well, I would think it's a lot less damaging if you've got three different forecasts out there rather than having one, because any outsider can say now that here is the Federal Reserve  -31-    12/13-14/88  forecast Otherwise, he just has the policy options, and he still doesn't know which one is the right one   Well, but not everybody is as smart   Almost everything has been said, Mr Chairman Let me make three points briefly First of all, I think we've got to continue to make progress on the inflation front We have seen a 1/2 percent increase in wages and a 3/4 percent increase in total compensation That is unacceptable and will lead exactly to what Bob Eisenmenger was saying was happening in the 1970s, a continuation of the slow upward creep of inflation What I find troublesome about tightening policy, in particular, is the ill effect on investment; the staff forecast has a 0 to 1 percent growth in investment for 1990 If we are worried about capacity constraints and things of that sort, certainly we are not going to be building any additional capacity in that environment What makes me feel a little better about tightening is that I think there is a lot of unexploited potential in the export area A lot of American manufacturers really are not yet focusing on that at all And so I'm a bit more optimistic than the staff forecast as far as continuation of export growth is concerned at going exchange rates A lot of speakers have mentioned that we have to be aware of the fragility in the financial system I think that's certainly an important point But I would say that we can't design monetary policy to avoid any difficulties in various sectors In the first place, we've got to focus on inflation and if something goes wrong then you can address those problems very much in a manner in which we have addressed them in the past--for instance, after the stock market crash last year, through a quick adjustment in policy So, I'm also in favor of a tightening of policy But just in case you feel too good about the whole thing and you haven't read Paul Erdman's "The Crash of 1989", and you still haven't ordered your Christmas present, if I remember correctly the opening sentence of that book is, "It was early December 1988; the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington and there was a chill in the air" The rest is history   I think that was the sentence   Thank you, Mr Chairman I broadly agree with that strategy as the right strategy Where I may differ a little is on the tactics Like you, I find it very encouraging that long-term rates have remained sort of stable That has certainly been a very good sign When it comes to choosing between the alternatives "B" and "C," I think this time around we see quite a bit of a gap between the alternatives the way they are specified Usually, they are almost touching each other This time there is a considerable gap The way I read it, the federal funds rate associated with "B" is about 84 - 85 percent; with "C" it's about 89 - 9 percent And so there is that considerable hole in between I think the right policy is right in between that I'm very much in agreement with you that where we want to get is to a funds rate of 87 - 88 percent Now, as far as the tactics are concerned, I certainly think your--   Thank you for this--one small step at a time The discount rate versus tightening by raising the level of borrowing I think we all agree the announcement effect right now that we are tightening would be stronger with a discount rate move, and I think I would lean toward doing it with a stronger announcement effect just to make it clear, to put the marker out there that says the Fed is tightening It's not a snugging exercise but a move to stay ahead of the curve We'd also put ourselves in a position to be ahead of the EMS--I mean, all the European currencies--which we probably will not be perceived as being if we do it in a gradual escalation of the borrowing requirement It can be read much more that we know the dollar will be coming under pressure and the Fed is reacting to those pressures in the exchange market If you move with a discount rate right now when clearly there are no pressures, you forestall that kind of a constellation And finally, the spread between the fed funds rate and the discount rate is very large It will become larger if we just tighten, and then the market clamor will continue about when the discount move finally is going to happen So, we won't get over that particular psychological hurdle; we will still have that hanging behind us So, to sum up, I probably would go with a discount rate increase right now of 50 basis points and then some additional  -53-    12/13-14/88  tightening if it's necessary late in the period to come out exactly where you want to come out with the federal funds rate   Well, I don't know what the borrowings--   I'd just do it in rates, right?   No, 87 to 88 percent   6-1/2 to 10-1/2   How about 7 to 10?   Well, (a) a lot of us thought that would be a good thing to do; (b) it gets us to that midpoint that you want to get to, a midpoint of 8-1/2 percent   I have a couple of questions First, you are showing compensation going up rather rapidly in 1990--plus 6 percent-- but then you are showing personal consumption expenditures going up only 09 percent What's happening there--the saving rate?   The 6 percent?   No, no From the charts it looks like compensation is going up 57 or 58 percent--whatever it is, I don't know   The second question was Foreign prices are falling rather rapidly in the forecast in 1990, and in view of the fact that foreign monetary growth right now is a lot higher than it is in the United States in virtually all countries except Switzerland what's their magic?   Okay The last question On chart 18, the next to the last chart, you have a lot faster growth abroad under the unchanged dollar forecast Presumably that would mean higher US exports, yet the current account gets a lot worse?   But the two US growth paths are exactly the same   No I'm sorry, I don't get it   More exports?   So imports--  SPEAKER(?) Net exports are falling a lot faster than the current account [unintelligible] US GNP is held on track by offsetting [unintelligible] export increase with the exception of investments due to lower interest rates But the real [unintelligible] decline of exports [unintelligible] increase of foreign real exports, but raise the GNP level They measure this from--   I'm ready to give up    2/7-8/89   It all goes on the price effects?   Sorry I thought I heard you say initially that exports were up   Now you're saying exports are [not] up--   Okay   I find it hard to see, but--   Well, it certainly succeeded   Thank you I think we should probably look a little at the longer horizon because we have to set up long-run targets In the outlook projected in the Greenbook, about a year from now you see a very, very [pronounced] weakening of the economy in  -18-    2/7-8/89  virtually every single sector except exports, which are still holding up Growth slows down to the less than 1 percent range, close to a zero rate The simulations that we've run also show that that holds true as a pattern even if you hold current policy very much constant I agree with the comments made earlier that we are not behind the curve as far as the financial markets are concerned We have a very strong dollar; we have some significant commodity prices actually dropping; we have a yield curve that points to low inflationary expectations So that, combined with the very low monetary growth, which Governor Angell already talked about at great length, makes me think that we're actually looking at a significant slowdown a year from now, or for the horizon that we can still influence--the next quarter or two being in the bag I have one other observation and that relates to foreign concerns, especially in Europe There's a lot of concern about our tightening probably too much and the dollar becoming too strong over the immediate period ahead, thereby impairing the external adjustment process that is important for that Thanks   I agree with the Chairman I think we should consistently, gradually, lower the targets We shouldn't try to fine tune the long-term ranges So I'd be in favor of the tentative targets, alternative "I"   What if you just drop it?   Yes We didn't have a Ml, so--   Yes, repeated many times   So just drop it   The capitalized language   Well, just "its decision"   "To lower"   Well, since we're discussing it, don't we want to move that further to the front end of that sentence?   Well, just to make it consistent   No, let that discussion finish first I have no question but--   I just want to support the same position, basically I think real rates are already very high Money growth is slowing and we should be patient to see that through The one area where I may disagree with you just a little, if I heard you right, is that you were expressing disappointment that investment wasn't slowing faster than it actually is   Capital investment isn't slowing faster   Actually, I like to see high capital investment because that fills the additional capacity that will hold down inflation in the future   I think that's good GNP and the more of it the better it is Otherwise, I fully agree with what you said   Yes   And that's good GNP   You woke us up   Peter, I heard you use a term a little earlier that I think I have never heard used before the indexed level of borrowings   No, I understand that But it is not formally indexed or linked to any other variables   Okay I thought you had some construct there   Thanks   So move  -11-    3/28/89   If you look at many models in their unadjusted state--just running the pure models whether they're monetarist or  -15-    3/28/89  [unintelligible]--over a fairly broad spectrum they tend to come up with a negative growth rate in the first half of next year And then you judgmentally massage the models The main difference that I can see is whether the conditions that are implied tend to have no recession How confident are you that the no recession scenario is judgmentally right--that it will prevail over the simple unfettered models?   How low do they get there?   How would you describe the path at the beginning?   And real?   Well, the skepticism is whether the errors will average out over the--  -16-    3/28/89   Thanks, Don   A lot of that activity is in the District of Columbia as well   Mike Kelley wants to speak   I think the general reluctance, Mr Chairman, is indicative of the fact that we all like where we have been and we don't like where we are going Maybe Mike Prell said it best when he said we're in danger of overshooting the runway and when you overshoot the runway you tend to get stuck in the mud or something So, with regard to the general picture of the economy that's unfolding here, I'm not particularly fond of the declining investment activity, which doesn't build additional capacity nor of the export picture not being as good as it could be, although we continue to make progress I see the export picture mainly as a problem of different regions in the world economy and relative exchange rates rather than our absolute exchange rate levels towards Europe We are in an approximate balance now or actually are running very, very small surpluses, but [not] toward Japan and Korea; obviously that's where the problems are located And I'm not sure that exchange rate changes are the right way to go at that particular problem So it isn't going to be very pleasant But it's all we've got, right?   Sounds better than anything else, right?   I think President Black gave my speech; I'm for "B," asymmetric   Thank you First of all, I think it is a good time for us to accumulate reserves We are not--well, I don't want to speak about what's going to happen later today--but I certainly wouldn't think that we are ready to ease in a very major fashion at the present time Neither are the Germans and Japanese ready to tighten Those policy moves would be counterproductive as far as helping the international adjustment process is concerned, which is still a very major problem confronting the world economy So, while the basic principle that one shouldn't undo with the right hand what the left hand is doing is certainly valid, I think we have a classic situation here where we have an external problem on the one hand and various domestic problems on the other hand that call for different policies With intervention you can overcome some of those difficulties and try to reconcile those conflicting goals But I do have also a very quick question In the data, Mr Cross, you have    5/16/89  Japanese yen holdings of $11 billion; does that include the special transaction with Japan? Is that already in there?   Okay, thanks   Sorry, I meant to say also that I'm in favor of Ed Boehne's suggestion to give a broader limit   Mr Chairman, what is the proper way to go for the $18 billion? Should we amend that motion now?   Okay, I'd like to amend the motion to $18 billion   Ed Boehne doesn't even second the amendment  SPEAKER(?) He can't vote   That's all right   Aye   Nevertheless, we got the votes   Going back for a second to the primary dealers In total, how many are foreigners and do you have any idea about their rough market share as far as trading volume is concerned?   Associated or whatever?   Mike, what did you say? I didn't hear you By the end of the year--   Thank you, Mr Chairman I don't have much to add on the US economy but let me just call your attention to developments abroad because they do have a significant impact Overall, I think you can say that after a surprisingly strong 1988 foreign economies are now slowing down as well In particular, you see a significant weakness in industrial production in our major trading partners where about half the monthly changes now are in the negative range among the 10 leading industrialized countries At the same time inflation abroad has been higher than expected, which is leading to a tightening of policies by many of our trading partners And that is partly due to the oil price increases and partly due to the exchange rate deterioration that they have seen in the past Add to that weakness abroad the rather strong dollar at the present time and I think we will see a significant slowdown in export growth While last year we were comfortably in the double-digit range as far as real export growth was concerned, it is probably going to slip to something in the 3 to 5 percent range by early next year So, that means that our strongest single sector in the economy will be a lot weaker than it has been in the past Combine that with the tight monetary policies and low M growth and I think we'll see a very, very shallow expansion indeed   Excuse me for asking the question maybe in a slightly different way from the way it has been asked before The Greenbook built in a 3/4 percentage point increase in the fed funds rate   You're putting in a $100 million technical adjustment in the borrowing   And yet you are projecting a rather significant turnaround in monetary growth Would you tell me what brings that about? I don't quite get it Maybe that's an easier way to answer the question about what caused the very significant drop in the Ms, especially Ml, that we were seeing before and the flatness and more recent drop in M2   I'm sorry, that still is my question, in a way Now we're going to increase the fed funds rate more   The Greenbook--   The Greenbook is the same as the "C" alternative   Endogenous, right?   What?   Okay, thanks   I'm a little confused about what current restraint means Does it mean the fed funds rate or does it mean the money growth that is currently underway or does it mean the borrowing, which it has been suggested should be revised upward? I favor alternative B if it means keeping the fed funds rate at about 9-3/4 percent, with symmetric language I would not throw in the $100 million more [on borrowing] if it could possibly be interpreted as meaning a move up in the fed funds rate  -41-    5/16/89   No, but I mean if it could be interpreted by the Desk as leaning toward restraint Mr Chairman, you indicated earlier in your remarks that this was the time to watch the Ms carefully You also said that you didn't want to change the order [in the directive]; but if the order means anything, then I think this is the time to give the aggregates a little more prominence, maybe   It goes inflation, then expansion, then the Ms   How about adding--   How about adding "and in particular the behavior of the monetary aggregates"?   Well, but you keep the order and then give it some additional emphasis   Sure   But that doesn't get published, right?   Oh, that Okay   Mr Chairman, why don't we change it to $550 million?   I think the Committee's exactly down the middle   [Unintelligible]
