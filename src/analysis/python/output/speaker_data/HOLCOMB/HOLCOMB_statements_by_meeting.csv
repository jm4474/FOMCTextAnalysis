7395,2004-11-10,"  Thank you very much    Thank you  I appreciate the opportunity to represent the Dallas Federal   Reserve Bank here today  It has given me the opportunity to have some very high quality meetings   with our economists over the three short weeks since Bob McTeer indicated that he was leaving the   Bank   First, looking at our District economy, over the period since the last FOMC meeting   economic growth in the Eleventh District appears to have continued at a moderate pace  Payroll   employment in June, July, August, and September showed quite modest gains  Like the nation,   other indicators showed more strength than the payroll numbers  Consumption, as reflected by   sales tax receipts, is growing at its most rapid pace since 1998  Personal income is up for the   seventh consecutive quarter, and surveys of business leaders across Texas show that business   confidence is gaining strength   However, these positive statistics seem to be somewhat at odds with the anecdotal reports   that we have received from our head office and Branch boards of directors  For example, I   mentioned that consumption has shown considerable strength, but from our directors we’ve heard   numerous stories about the damping impact of higher gasoline prices on consumption  One of our   November 10, 2004 50 of 107    El Paso directors is a rancher  He offered a story about how the four cowboys he hires all showed   up to work last spring, each driving his own pickup truck and pulling his own horse trailer  The   same group showed up a few weeks ago, but all four shared a ride in one pickup and pulled one   trailer for all of the horses  [Laughter]  They said that the cost of gasoline made the difference  I   can assure you that in West Texas no one worries about running out of street space      That’s as close to a Bob McTeer story as you’ll get from me  [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?)  It’s better than some of his!  [Laughter]    Actually, higher energy prices have had a positive impact on the oil and   gas sectors of our District economy  Earlier this year, oil and gas activity had been expanding very   sluggishly in response to the higher energy prices  In the last two months, however, we see growing   evidence that this is changing  Exploration and improvement projects have been announced in   recent weeks by both the majors and the independents  Energy production is even expanding in the   Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area, a region where output has been virtually shuttered for the last   eighteen years  So it is beginning to appear that supply forces are finally responding to today’s   prices   Let me note two additional sectors where the tone of the regional economy has improved    The office markets in Dallas and Austin are finally showing declining vacancy rates, confirming a   sense of optimism that began last summer  And commercial loan activity at Texas banks has grown   nicely in the last two quarters, hopefully reflecting improved business confidence and the beginning   of expansion activities   Finally, our directors and Beige Book contacts report an absence of wage pressures but   some modest uptick in price pressures  I’d like to mention one development that we’ve heard about   that may alleviate price pressures over the next few quarters  In 2002, Texas voters approved a   November 10, 2004 51 of 107    $250,000 cap on non-economic damages in medical malpractice suits  As a result, thirteen   companies providing malpractice insurance have reentered the state, and malpractice insurance   premiums have dropped by 8 to 17 percent in the last year  This development has the potential to   restrain medical cost inflation in Texas as it has done in other states   In looking at the national economy, we’ve been struck by how well it is doing and how well   it is expected to grow over the forecast period in spite of the long list of headwinds it must   overcome  We listed six headwinds that concern us, and I think most of them have been mentioned   already  First, consumer confidence has sagged recently  Second, businesses seem somewhat less   confident than at the beginning of the year, at least as evidenced by surveys from the National   Federation of Independent Business  Third, energy prices remain at a high level  Fourth, we’ve had   four consecutive declines in the index of leading indicators  Fifth, the bonus depreciation of   equipment and software will expire at year-end  And sixth, demand growth in the rest of the world,   while solid, is expected to slow somewhat  Each of these headwinds exerts a small effect, but in   combination they add up  The primary tailwind in the economy is coming from monetary policy    And the strengthened balance sheets of the business sector, along with good profitability growth,   provide another tailwind that can and should support higher investment spending in the future    The inflation outlook is mixed and hard to assess  The decline to a mere 06 percent in the   annualized CPI inflation rate over the last three months and to an even lower 02 percent for the   PCE is set against a year-over-year inflation record that is less sanguine  Core measures of inflation   are in the 15 to 2 percent range and have been on a mild uptrend since the beginning of the year    One-year inflation expectations range from 23 percent to over 3 percent, depending on the source,   and long-term inflation expectations are anchored at or above 25 percent   In reviewing and evaluating this information with our economists over the last few weeks,   we encountered some difficulty in reaching a consensus regarding whether the Committee should   November 10, 2004 52 of 107    pause in raising rates at today’s meeting  Several held the view, as did the majority of our directors   when surveyed, that it was the right time to pause  However, after reviewing last Friday’s   employment report, we have moved from somewhat sitting on the fence to favoring a continuation   of measured tightening  The most recent indications of strong employment growth, the level of the   real federal funds rate, and market expectations are the more compelling factors in our   consideration    Well, I thought maybe my silence could serve as assent, but I do support   your recommendation  And our expectation is that there will be a need for pause and that at the   next meeting the language might need to be changed  "
7419,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the last meeting, there is more   evidence that the Texas recovery is solidly on track  October employment growth was the strongest   since the end of last year, and the most recent Beige Book confirms increased optimism in the   business community  This tone of optimism was reinforced by comments from our directors at last   Thursday’s board meeting  That was a meeting of all four of our boards, and this positive view was   seen across almost all regions of our District and the many industries represented by our directors   So far this year, through October, Texas employment is up an annualized rate of 13 percent,   slightly less than in the nation  Temporary employment jumped sharply in October, mirroring a   trend that was seen in the nation  That bodes well for the recovery as a leading indicator of future   job growth  Indeed, Beige Book contacts reported an unusual number of temporary workers finding   permanent positions  In addition, our directors reported increased hiring by various sizes of firms    December 14, 2004 40 of 118           Reports from the high-tech sector have been mixed  There continue to be a number of layoffs at all   types of high-tech firms, including semiconductor production, telecommunications, and computer   services  However, this appears primarily to reflect continued reorganizing of the industry  A   director representing the tech sector reported improved profitability in the industry and an   expectation of a manageable and sustainable growth rate of 5 to 10 percent in 2005  Continued   restructuring of the airline industry is providing headwinds for the Texas recovery  The state has   three major air carriers reducing employment and wages  This represents ongoing restructuring of   the industry as well as specific plans aimed at offsetting high fuel costs  Housing sales and prices   softened slightly over the last six weeks, although some areas of the state have seen no slowing in   residential construction  Our housing industry contacts are optimistic for next year but say that a   stronger rate of job growth is needed to meet sales expectations  Office markets have continued to   improve over the last six weeks   Energy drilling activity has continued to improve in the District, with the industry reporting   higher prices, growing backlogs of work, and some shortages of workers and equipment  Global   demand for oil has not been sufficient to sop up the increase in world oil output  Slowing economic   activity in Europe, Asia, and Latin America is expected to continue to put downward pressure on oil   prices, as noted earlier, unless OPEC is able to curtail output  Mild weather in the natural-gas-  consuming regions of the nation has pushed natural gas prices below $600  Natural gas inventories   are very high  If we have a relatively mild winter, natural gas prices could fall further  The Texas   leading index was down in October but has increased strongly over the last three months  The index   is forecasting 2004 employment growth of just under 15 percent and 2005 job growth of about   19 percent  These rates are below historical levels but reflect the improving trend that will allow   job growth to finally meet or exceed that of the nation   December 14, 2004 41 of 118           We are in basic agreement with the Greenbook forecast of continued growth during the   upcoming year  The Blue Chip consensus forecast paints a similar picture, although it has a   somewhat slower pace of growth  The fall of the index of leading indicators over five consecutive   months is becoming a minor source of concern  Historically, declines of this size and duration have   been associated with growth slowdowns  But given the absence of signs of a slowdown elsewhere   in the data, the Dallas research staff has discounted the signal from the index of leading indicators    Of some concern also are recent developments on the inflation front, most notably the monthly   numbers on core CPI inflation in September and October  Survey and market measures of inflation   expectations, both short-term and long-term, remain a bit higher than preferred  Given the expected   inflation trajectory for 2005 and 2006 shown in the Greenbook, recent inflation does not set off   alarms   On balance, we favor a continuation of the recent monetary policy path with an increase in   the funds rate at this meeting  Since the real federal funds rate is still below its long-term neutral   level, we recognize that some tightening will be needed  Ultimately, two months of higher core CPI   inflation numbers and a small uptick in the core PCE numbers are not likely to be a problem  But if   the markets see us pausing in the face of those numbers, that could create a problem  And since the   economy appears to still be on a solid growth path and monetary policy remains accommodative,   this is not the time to pause    I support the recommendation  "
7445,2005-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is only the third FOMC meeting that   I’ve had the privilege of attending, and I cannot help but notice how much the US economy has   improved in that short time  [Laughter]   I think luck has a lot to do with it   Following a pause in upward momentum last autumn, which may have reflected energy   developments or election-related uncertainty, most economic indicators have firmed over the last   few months  Monthly job gains were healthy during the fourth quarter  Durable goods orders   showed good gains in November and December, and retail sales ended the year on a decidedly   positive note And despite the FOMC’s five successive hikes in the federal funds rate, long-term                 February 1-2, 2005 98 of 177  mortgage and corporate bond rates have edged lower, perhaps adding to the financial tailwinds   driving the economy   With this information as a backdrop, I sat down with several Dallas Fed economists to   prepare our set of economic projections for the coming two years  All of us were confident that real   GDP growth would fall in the 3½ to 4 percent range Indeed, the point estimates that we sent in   were extremely close to the Greenbook forecast  The Dallas staff’s projections for the   unemployment rate were also quite close to the Board staff’s outlook  Where we differed was on the   trajectory for the core inflation outlook The Dallas economic staff suggests that core PCE inflation   will rise to 18 percent this year and hold at that level in 2006   A few factors account for the difference First, the Greenbook incorporates several   assumptions that give rise to the benign inflation projections, namely, that domestic profit margins   will continue to narrow, that foreign firms won’t try to rebuild their squeezed profit margins, and   that benefit cost increases will remain moderate  If we relax any of these assumptions, the risks are   tilted toward higher inflation and more rapid output growth  When we consider the results of the   special Beige Book survey on capital investment plans, which confirmed that many companies are   planning to increase their spending because of strong demand and emerging capacity constraints, the   question arises of whether the capacity will come on line in time to relieve the inflationary pressures   that have emerged in the last year  It seems that too many assumptions must work out just right to   get the low inflation envisioned in the Greenbook   As I said earlier, prior to yesterday I had only participated in two FOMC meetings  As a   highly interested observer as well as a participant, I observed a notable difference in these two   meetings  In November, the Committee was still focusing on headwinds confronting the economy,   while in December the discussion had shifted to tailwinds  I note this because basically the same   thing has happened at the Dallas Fed’s board of directors meetings  In November, the directors’   economic reports were uniformly downbeat  In December, the directors were decidedly and                 February 1-2, 2005 99 of 177  uniformly upbeat At our January board meeting, the positive tone of the economic reports   underscored and reinforced our view that a turnaround had occurred in mid-November    As of yet, however, most of the data available for the Eleventh District haven’t quite caught   up with the anecdotes Texas employment growth has strengthened but remains below that of the   nation The Texas unemployment rate ticked up in November and December and remains above the   national rate Almost all sectors of the Texas economy are gaining employment and the sluggish   recovery is broad-based   Following a record-breaking year in 2003, 2004 turned out to be the best year ever for new   and existing home sales in Texas  Despite this good news, the Texas housing market likely has   peaked but at a high level Prices remain flat  High inventories of existing homes and rising   inventories of new homes caused builders to pull back on starts in the final months of 2004  On a   brighter note, office vacancy rates have finally begun to decline in the last few months, thereby   confirming the anecdotes about an improving office-leasing picture that we began to hear last   summer  Hopefully, the economic statistics for the District will soon begin to reflect the recent   reports from our directors, which noted an increasing willingness to hire and to make capital   investments for badly needed capacity  These reports also noted some increases in pricing power   In thinking about policy options, it seems that most of the inflation risks are on the upside    The “tech wreck” and geopolitical headwinds have died down Over the last couple of months, the   expansion has gained considerable momentum  Core inflation rates have turned up, mainly   reflecting that goods prices have stopped falling and are now on the rise The Committee has raised   the funds rate by 125 basis points since last June These rate hikes have not pushed up real, let alone   nominal, yields on corporate bonds and fixed-rate mortgages  And there are risks that the dollar   could fall further, adding to inflationary pressure  As I mentioned before, pricing power seems to be   increasing All of these factors suggest that the expected course of policy is on the right track, with   another 25 basis point increase in the funds rate at this meeting and expectations of continued   tightening over the year Thank you                       February 1-2, 2005 100 of 177  I support the recommendation  "
7470,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy in the Eleventh District has   been gaining strength since last November  The most recent data, in combination with anecdotal   evidence, point to improved growth in January and February and to a brighter outlook in the months                    March 22, 2005 51 of 116  ahead Importantly, the recovery in Texas employment growth is becoming more broad-based   across the major sectors of the economy  In addition, 2004 marked the first year since 2000 that the   private sector showed positive job growth   As might be expected given the surge in energy prices, the Texas rig count and support   services for oil and gas are expanding briskly The Texas rig count has roughly tripled since 1999   and is up about 30 percent in the last year alone In spite of the high demand for rigs, our directors   report many instances of rigs lying stacked in the field  With experienced rig crews in short supply,   concerns about legal liabilities have caused oil companies to leave some rigs idle  Our contacts also   report shortages of drilling pipe, because, in their words, China is sucking up every ounce of steel   At our last directors’ meeting, one of our banker directors reported the first oil and gas activity in his   area in 30 years An additional sign of the market’s responsiveness to the anticipated strength of   energy prices is a resurgence of institutional money seeking out energy exploration deals in the   Unites States and Canada   Both our directors and members of our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture   report a sharp increase in demand for cattle ranches in rural Texas and for extremely high-end   apartments in Dallas and Houston  Several members of these two groups spoke of a paradigm shift   taking place, away from holding financial assets toward holding tangible assets, such as land, cattle,   oil, and housing They all noted an abundance of money flowing in, often in cash deals  Another   director noted that the flow of venture capital to Texas farms has picked up     Turning to the national economy, I’d like to provide support for the Greenbook’s conclusion   about the extra positive thrust in the economy by noting that congressional hearings have been   focusing on the use of steroids in major league baseball rather than the economy  [Laughter] If   you’ll permit me to stick with this theme, we agree that the economy is stacking up to have a pretty                           March 22, 2005 52 of 116  good season in 2005 for all the reasons that have been enumerated  A key question is What will be   the impact when the removal of last year’s monetary policy steroids stimulus shows up with the   usual lag?   Given the outlook for energy prices built into the Greenbook, as well as the higher fed funds   path, it seems that the growth slowdown in 2006 could be greater than anticipated, particularly if   financial conditions weaken, as in the higher bond premium scenario in the Greenbook  At the last   Dallas board of directors meeting, in response to the Chairman’s testimony about the long-term bond   rate conundrum, there was some discussion of a somewhat different scenario  The directors were   concerned about the potential for a very flat Treasury yield curve, given the market’s anticipation of   a much higher fed funds rate by early 2006  While the Dallas research staff noted that the slope of   the yield curve doesn’t have the predictive power it used to, our directors, nonetheless, felt uneasy   about this situation The run-up in Treasury yields over the last couple of weeks has probably   reduced their concerns, but this scenario has made them cautious about continued tightening     Our information supports the Greenbook’s projection that business investment in equipment   and software will hold up well this year  Over the last six months or so, the Dallas directors have   been discussing the extent to which the very low level of investment spending over the 2000 to 2003   period has reduced the level of effective capacity in their industries A few of our directors believe   that some operations may have become economically obsolete, need to be written off, and ought to   be replaced with newer technology   It seems clear that the Committee will be considering holding a retirement party for the term   “measured pace” in order to increase flexibility going forward  We would support giving “measured   pace” a gold watch after a career of serving the System well  While there is sufficient rationale for   continued tightening at this time, the Greenbook assumption of a 35 percent fed funds rate by year­                                  March 22, 2005 53 of 116  end would require a pause for a meeting or two in the cycle of raising rates, and the current wording   is an impediment to doing so     For today’s policy action, I would support a ¼-point increase as a further step in getting to   neutral As for the more difficult question of determining when we have reached neutral, I will leave   that to Mr Fisher Thank you [Laughter]   I’ll whisper in his ear before he comes to the meeting  [Laughter]   Thanks I really appreciate it   Sure I do support your 25 basis point recommendation and your   proposed language The need for a more flexible directive has been discussed at each of the four   meetings I’ve attended, so I’m looking forward to seeing how you resolve it in May and whether or   not I can understand what you did when I read it [Laughter]  "
8715,2010-04-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will attempt to speak on behalf of   President Fisher without really having had an opportunity to speak with him specifically about   his views  If Richard were here, I believe that he’d argue for an approach that leaves the   Committee with greater flexibility to determine the best pace for asset sales as economic   conditions warrant  In addition, as he has stated, he is in favor of moving expeditiously to return   the balance sheet to normal  I am not sure that there is an option on the table that is fully   consistent with his views, but option 3 seems to come the closest   We are sensitive not only to the need to allow the Committee flexibility to gauge its   approach to changing conditions, but also to the need to understand better the implications of   shrinking and changing the composition of the balance sheet  Given the unprecedented nature of   the current situation, until greater experience has been gained, these implications are largely   unknown, and it will remain difficult to determine the optimum speed at which to shrink the   balance sheet, therefore arguing for greater flexibility   Finally, Richard has been concerned about the institution of rigid rules to determine the   Committee’s actions, even if the rules have contingency wording built in  I believe he would   want to avoid making strong commitments at this point  So, given the desire to preserve   conditionality for the Committee, yet move forward forthwith, I believe that option 3 is closest to   or perhaps I should say least far from, our views  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Eleventh District economy does not   appear to be uniquely distinct from the US economy  Like the nation, the Eleventh District   economy seems to be on an improved and improving trajectory, obviously, from a low base    This view is reflected in the economic projections submitted by Dallas for economic growth   averaging just under 4 percent this year and next, and 45 percent in 2012, with declining   unemployment and subdued inflation  I’m told that our economists have a higher level of   confidence in these projections, all the more so for having put them in writing   April 27–28, 2010 102 of 206                   Since the March FOMC meeting, economic conditions in the Dallas District have   continued to firm up  As you heard, Mr Chairman, when you visited Dallas three weeks ago, the   outlook in the District is guardedly positive, or, to use the term you introduced in summarizing   your discussion with our directors, there is “constrained optimism”  New data, as well as   anecdotal evidence, suggest continued strengthening in the District  District employment has   increased for three straight months, and most measures of economic activity, with the exception   of commercial real estate, continue to improve  Factory output is expanding, drilling activity is   strong, consumer confidence is edging up, and Texas retail sales and exports are rising  Our   Texas leading index continues to show gains, and our April manufacturing survey shows further   acceleration of business activity, with most of the current activity and labor measures reaching   their highest levels since before the recession   The main concern that we have encountered is a lack of confidence that the   improvements will continue  Our directors in particular have expressed concern about the   sustainability of these trends  Most of our directors have been providing somewhat upbeat   reports about their companies, their industries, and their local economies, but are concerned   about the impact of the withdrawal of government life supports  This has constrained their   willingness to make capital expenditures  In addition, several directors indicated that their   companies have right-sized during the downturn, meaning that they will not hire back most or all   of the employees that were let go, even when times improve, because of new efficiencies that   were introduced into their operations  As you can imagine, it’s difficult to constrain optimism in   Texas  But, for now, that’s where we are  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In looking at policy options, it’s   somewhat easier for me to speak on behalf of President Fisher because, as Governor Duke   reminded me yesterday, his views are not unknown to this group  [Laughter]  Were he here, I   believe he would speak strongly and advocate for a policy approach consistent with that   expressed in policy alternative B  In addition, he would favor the approach represented in the   second alternative for paragraph 4, which would stop reinvestment of maturing Treasuries  The   only caveat, however, and I’m advised that I may sound somewhat like a broken record, is that   Richard would prefer removal of the “extended period” language and substitute “for some time”   as is used in alternative C as a way to set up changes to come  Finally, Richard would appreciate   the opportunity to participate in the Committee’s further discussion on redemptions and asset   sales  Thank you  "
