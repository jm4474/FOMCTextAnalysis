 The last sentence was “Separately, the Committee indicated that it plans   in January to make a public announcement about future adjustments to its disclosure policy   and the so-called ‘bias’ statement”   One reason to include it in today’s statement was to make sure that the   market understood that there had been no change in policy today and that the changes would   be announced later   Our stance then, when we’re asked about the Committee’s decision, is to   say that we have nothing to announce, period?     May I collect the drafts?     This is Lynn Fox  We have a bit of problem with absences in the pressroom   between 1200 and 100 pm and, obviously, we want all of the major wire services to get this   news at the same time  So we intend at this point to get to the wire services at a few minutes   after one o'clock and have it run on the wires by 115 pm    Yes     The problem, President McDonough, is that even if we call starting now there   already are going to be empty seats in the pressroom  And this news is conveyed best if all of   the wires move promptly together at the same time  If I call and give them a heads up to go and   collect everyone, then I've told them the story and we can't do that  Our best judgment in terms   of disseminating this information is to do it right at one o'clock  If others believe, as you do, that   we might not be able to hold onto it for an hour, I can be convinced otherwise     What I'll do is call the pressroom at one o'clock  It will take them 10 or 15   minutes to go through the process     Yes  So it still effectively will be on the wires at around 115     Thank you both for saying that  I think everybody already has said the right   thing, which is to refer monotonously to this public statement--to use those words over and over    They become a mantra and then everyone gets the same story all the time   If I might, I wanted to add a couple of details about what we plan to tell the press that I   think you ought to be aware of  In addition to providing the written statement to the pressroom,   we're going to tell the press a couple of things just to save a lot of phone calls and some   confusion  First of all, we are going to tell them that the FOMC met at 11 o'clock this morning    Secondly, we're going to tell them that the Committee voted on the rate decision, and astute   reporters will know that it is rare to have a vote on an intermeeting move  In fact, I think it has     1/3/01 27  only been done once before in the Chairman's tenure   We're simply going to say that given the   nature of the action, the Chairman felt it appropriate to have a vote  We will say those things   straightforwardly and on the record   By way of background we will be spending some time   explaining the two separate votes on the discount rate  We are going to make clear it's a process   issue We will do it on background  Don't be surprised if there's confusion  I think there will be    We'll just handle it as it comes    We are going to be very dull  We have a manual on how to be dull!  There's   another thing that I would tell you that might be of assistance in dealing with reporters and   market participants  We can't forget that market participants talk to you and then talk to   reporters, so then we have all kinds of convoluted third-hand and fourth-hand reporting  So, if   market participants or reporters call you with questions that are sensible technical questions, just   refer them to us if you like or to your own public affairs person  I suggest that because taking   you out of the equation sort of reduces the impact of whatever information is conveyed  Now,   the reporters are going to be very anxious; they're going to be in a long queue  You're going to   be called over the weekend  We are in town and we have beepers and cell phones and   everything else  Please take advantage of us if it is at all helpful  And though it is awkward to   consider this a true blackout period because, as President Minehan noted, she and others have   public speeches planned, you can certainly use the blackout rules as an excuse  You can simply   tell reporters that the Committee has informally agreed insofar as possible to follow the normal   rules associated with policy decisions     Actually, the sentence can be modified to say that the change is   effective in the Districts noted and is effective for St Louis the next day  Maybe that   would be better    In those Districts the change is effective immediately  In St Louis,   the change is effective tomorrow     1/30-31/01 191   We usually say this when St Louis is included  I don’t have a   strong feeling about it    Let’s just take it out  If people have questions about it, we can   answer them     Given the work that needs to be done, we should be able to call the   pressroom around 10 o’clock  It may take them a little longer than usual to process this   since it’s going to be a bit of a surprise  I’d say that the statement will be on the wires   sometime between 1000 and 1030 am    We will move as quickly as we can    This is Lynn Fox  The press actually has become quite familiar   with this process with respect to discount rate actions and they understand that almost   immediately the other Reserve Banks will be in  I doubt very seriously that we’ll get   close questioning on the topic But if we do, we’ll point out that this is a time of fast   moving events and that all the Banks will be in soon  And we’ll put out press releases,   obviously, as we get your announcements
