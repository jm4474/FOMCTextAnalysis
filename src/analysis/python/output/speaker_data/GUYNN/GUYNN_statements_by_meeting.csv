190,1987-12-15," This is my first time here, and this process is fascinating Economic development in the Southeast appears to be very similar to what I've heard others comment on in the national picture Manufacturing and trade-related activity--and in our case that includes textiles and chemicals--clearly are doing better In Texas and Oklahoma the oil and gas industry is finally showing some signs of life Yet, I think there's a little concern that some of the projects that are still on the shelf and that haven't been restarted could be discouraged, or at least put off further, if the price of oil does fall back or stay at lower levels So, that's a minor concern in that oil patch of ours in the paperboard packaging business, reports backlogs have grown and he can't even shut his plants for normal maintenance So somebody, somewhere, thinks that business is going to be good Very much like I've heard others say around the table, our retailers also report that their sales have come in close to expectations But we've had a number of people point out that they had scaled back their expectations for the last half of this year even before mid-October, so I don't think we would use words like strong We've even had a few retailers, as Tom Melzer indicated, point out that they have a little concern about the early part of next year, after we get past the Christmas season Finally, with regard to the region, at our last board meeting a bit of uneasiness about the early part of next year was expressed from Tennessee, which has become kind of a mini- Detroit with a lot of automobile and consumer durables-related businesses But Tennessee has done well and they are looking through that and see that it is only a temporary problem with a little disappointment perhaps in their minds for the early part of next year  Nationally, we, too, are comfortable with the Greenbook forecast; our differences are marginal We might see modestly less improvement in the trade deficit but we see the prospects for manufacturing investment perhaps being even a little stronger than indicated, as Frank Morris suggested; so, those tend to balance out  -64-    12/15-16/87  Overall, we are reasonably comfortable that we will get moderate growth in 1988 I am a little concerned that perhaps the downside risk in the early part of next year might be a little stronger than the upside risk "
191,1987-12-15," Basically, I favor no change in policy at this time, although I must confess that I have a nagging gut feeling that we could be in for a little disappointment in growth in 1988 Because of that, I have a very mild preference to tilt the directive very gently to suggest that we would ease more quickly than we would tighten I don't profess, after one meeting, to know whether maintaining policy is $300 million to $400 million borrowing in normal times I, too, would favor shifting back at the first opportune time to targeting borrowings rather than fed funds If that can be accomplished around year-end, I would be in favor of that I assume that would imply some tolerance of more fluctuations in the fed funds rate, but I would not want to let the fed funds rate gyrate to a great extent over year-end We have a great deal invested in trying to keep things calm and stable; if that means stretching out the adjustment back to borrowings into next year, I'd be in favor of that "
3950,1995-12-19, Thank you very much 
3951,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Southeast continues to grow at a rate that appears to be above the national average Thus far, no sector appears to be overextended Wage and price pressures are stable Our District's pretty extensive manufacturers' survey shows no net movement in either input or final goods prices The scattered labor shortages that we saw earlier this year, particularly in the Atlanta and Nashville markets, appear to have abated without any persisting effect on wages This time of the year we, like everyone else, have been watching retail activity For our District, retail sales have been quite good compared to last year and to expectations, especially for high-end goods like jewelry and home furnishings That pattern has been pretty even across our District Of course, auto sales have been noticeably weak, as others have indicated for other parts of the country I might mention that commercial construction in the Southeast is also quite strong; that construction activity is concentrated in the retail sector While we are seeing some speculative building of retail space, mostly in Atlanta and Miami, that is not yet at a worrisome level We also are seeing expansion of office and industrial building, but most of that is on a build-to-suit basis We see very little speculative building in the office market As one might expect, Olympic-related building and public projects are adding measurably to activity in both Atlanta and surrounding cities that are getting some draw from the Olympics Overall, the Sixth District is expanding smartly, although activity has slowed noticeably from this time last year Still, it remains hard to find problems that are widespread or worsening in either economic activity or in pricing practices  As far as the national outlook is concerned, the Atlanta forecast on the surface is remarkably similar to the Greenbook's It includes moderate growth in consumer spending, strong but decelerating business fixed investment, little net contribution that we can see in either direction from net exports, and fairly stable inflation near the 3 percent level Neither forecast sees serious imbalances Nevertheless, there are differences in interpretation between our forecast and the Greenbook that have implications for our policy discussion I will say more about that during the policy go-around We interpret the relatively benign inflation environment as being in large measure the outcome of the last fifteen years of tough inflation policy The Greenbook does not seem as confident on that change But I would also underscore the point that Gary Stern made toward the end of his comments about some of the fundamental changes that have taken place and the reasons that one can be optimistic about the inflation outlook We do not see the current forecast as a rigid limit on potential growth In our view, moderate additional growth would likely have no effective inflation cost In that way, our outlook is somewhat different from the Greenbook and somewhat different from the other comments that have been made around the table Thank you, Mr Chairman "
3952,1995-12-19," As my earlier comments suggested, I prefer alternative A I think 25 basis points and a symmetrical directive are the right construct I don't think I can add to the arguments that already have been made and will spare you a repetition of those arguments "
4001,1996-01-30," I prefer Alternative I as well I would echo the arguments that have already been made about the danger of sending the wrong signal, particularly the comments of the Vice Chairman about the danger of being misunderstood in the context of our recent easing and the prospect that we may need to ease further in the period ahead So, I favor Alternative I "
4002,1996-01-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy of the Atlanta District is still growing at a moderate pace and maintains its advantage over the national growth rate, as best we can tell But we, too, are seeing signs of deceleration Nonetheless, while cyclical factors at the national level may be damping growth for our part of the country, the Southeast economy is likely on balance to enjoy moderate growth throughout 1996 The Southeast continues to benefit from some longstanding secular trends in-migration of population and corporate relocations driven by rapid growth rates and relatively favorable cost factors We do not see this abating any time soon This feeds retail trade, services, and construction, all of which are generally healthy in our region at the present time  Construction is holding firm, and this is not just the Atlanta Olympics effect buttressing the region's overall indicators The most active component is industrial construction dominated by warehouse and distribution centers Inventories of unsold houses  -24-    1/30-31/96  remain extremely low and multifamily activity remains strong, although vacancy rates recently have begun to rise and we expect to see a slowdown in multifamily construction later this year As you know, we have a concentration of construction-related manufacturing in the Southeast So, while industrial production continues to weaken, the slowdown is less pronounced in our region of the country, and it has been cushioned by the continued migration of auto-related production to our southeastern states This growth has continued even though that in the auto industry as a whole has slowed Al Broaddus and I are beginning to steal some of your auto jobs, Mike! I don't know if that is for better or for worse, but they continue to move to our part of the country, not only the assembly jobs but all of the support activities Even so, Sixth District job growth decelerated in the fourth quarter Weakness in our area is particularly noticeable in the nondurable manufacturing sector Still, our region's year-over- year job growth outpaced the nation by a considerable margin in 1995 We see no discernible evidence at the present time of acceleration in overall wages or prices Our manufacturers' survey indicates less price pressure on finished goods but some increase in pressure on input prices  Turning to the national economy, overall I see the economy continuing to move forward without major impediments, but also without the momentum that we saw earlier Our outlook has not changed substantively for a number of months As has been the case recently, the Atlanta forecast and the Greenbook are fairly close Atlanta has personal consumption growing more slowly than the Greenbook, but we have stronger business fixed investment and net exports Both forecasts show real GDP growing close to 2 percent over the next two years, and each has inflation continuing at a rate not far from recent experience although we have the CPI on a very slow deceleration course Neither forecast sees much change in the expected unemployment rate The difference between our outlook and that of the Board staff is in the interpretation of potential Our reading of the Greenbook is that it shows an economy expanding near potential and that faster growth will inevitably result in accelerating inflation We see potential as probably somewhat higher Importantly, we believe that the current modest and steady inflation environment is a result of 15 years of anti-inflationary monetary policy; it is not some spontaneous reduction in inflation expectations but a rational response to a less inflationary environment Of course, this is something that I can't demonstrate categorically, but I believe that evidence from both the labor markets and the financial markets tends to support this view "
4003,1996-01-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman Like others around the table, I would not like to see us step back from our tough, long-term stance against inflation I would not support a further easing at this time unless the risks were quite clearly on the side of further weakening in economic growth or we judge that we have a much more favorable inflation setting and see an economy that may be growing somewhat below potential Although most of us see only moderate growth in the period ahead and some recent data suggest the need for added caution about how things may unfold, I do not yet have the sense that we are about to see a major stalling of the expansion, although the risks clearly seem to be greater on the down side At the same time, I am increasingly convinced that we have achieved a much more favorable inflation environment that gives us some latitude for a modest additional easing without any substantial risk of a prospective deterioration in inflation As policymakers, we must always try to differentiate between temporary and longer-lasting influences In my view, there is a good deal of evidence that the favorable changes that we see in inflation expectations and behavior are indeed persisting On that basis, I would support a modest easing of 25 basis points at this time "
4062,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman Looking through the anomalies of the last several months, it appears to us that the Sixth District continues to grow at a moderate pace The bad weather is likely simply to have increased the amplitude of the seasonal pattern in activity rather than to have exerted some lasting effect on overall performance When we look beyond these distractions, we think that the Southeast will continue to outperform the rest of the nation, but probably by a smaller margin than has been the case in past years As before, this improved performance is based on continued migration of both businesses and people into our region  -12-    3/26/96  Retail sales grew very unevenly in the District during the first three months of the year, with a notably slow start early in the year, especially in the northern part of the region where weather was clearly a factor More recently, sales of many goods, particularly apparel and autos, appear to be much improved  Home sales in our area have been particularly brisk in early 1996 after a slow fourth quarter Much of the acceleration is reported to be in starter homes at the low end of the market Both residential and nonresidential activity remained surprisingly resilient throughout the bad weather period Commercial real estate markets continue strong throughout our region Outside of Atlanta, the industrial market is the most active, with lots of construction of warehouse and distribution facilities The retail construction component finally seems to be slowing in some areas that have reached saturation, and that is something we have been anticipating for some time In Atlanta as you might expect, Olympic activity has kept construction at a very high plateau, starting last year The entire town is a mess Bulldozers and paving equipment have the right-of-way over cars and people We promise to be ready when the time for the Olympics comes, but if you can avoid it, please don't visit us until later in the summer  According to our regional survey of manufacturers, manufacturing activity actually eased off a bit in February, but at the same time expectations for the next six months are reportedly improved In our District, the strongest sector is durables, while nondurables, especially paper, are lagging, and the apparel industry continues to shrink In fact, the apparel industry is in secular decline and has lost almost 35,000 jobs nationwide over the last year We don't expect those jobs to come back any time soon  Payroll employment expanded moderately in January following three months of only modest growth But for the last 12 months ending in January, payroll growth in our region was 34 percent, more than double that of the nation There continue to be scattered reports of wage pressures and labor shortages, and those are in isolated pockets in our District At the same time, both our manufacturing survey and business contacts report minimal price increases in both raw materials and finished goods  As far as the national outlook is concerned, the unusual circumstances of late 1995 and early 1996 certainly have muddied the waters considerably and left us with more uncertainty than would usually be the case On balance, however, I believe the economy has been relatively resilient after taking account of those special factors early in the year So, our forecast of continued moderate growth and moderating inflation is essentially unchanged From where I stand, I see pretty solid underpinnings for moderate growth in household spending and investment, a return to inventory balance, and good export demand  Except in the details, our outlook is very similar to that of the Greenbook After a modest first quarter followed by a bounceback, I would expect a resumption of moderate growth in the 2 percent range I still think that 2 percent is probably a little less than potential, so it may not come as a surprise that I am more optimistic than some with regard to inflation In fact, I think there is a reasonable  -13-    3/26/96  prospect that inflation could moderate over the next two years It is unlikely that the moderation will be particularly dramatic or smooth, but I think there is a reasonable chance that the CPI could move closer to the 2-1/2 percent level rather than the 3 percent level that some seem to expect I continue to believe that our policies and other factors have combined to create a more favorable price-setting environment that is both genuine and persistent Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4063,1996-03-26, I concur with your recommendation as well 
4106,1996-05-21," Mr Chairman, the Southeast has continued to grow moderately this spring, led by strong and broad-based activity in two of our states, Georgia and Florida, where over half of our District's income is generated Employment growth in the District has been at a rate of almost 3 percent so far in 1996, nearly double the national average But, of course, we were spared the bad weather and the GM strike that affected other parts of the country earlier in the year The fastest income growth has been in Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee  -12-    5/21/96  With this good income growth has come excellent, although somewhat uneven, consumer spending There has been particularly noticeable strength in home-related goods like furniture, appliances, and carpets, and noticeably weak apparel sales Housing activity has remained generally good for longer than we expected In fact, there are reports of shortages in inventories of single-family houses in Nashville and Birmingham Multifamily building is still growing at a rapid pace Construction of commercial buildings apparently has accelerated throughout the District, but we don't see worrisome speculative kinds of building in that sector of the construction industry  Manufacturing activity in our region has picked up some in the last few months, but the outlook has softened a bit despite increased orders for production Wage and salary pressures remain about unchanged Recently, employers have been more concerned about possible wage pressures, but at the same time we see or hear no substantial evidence that actual labor costs are accelerating In fact, I have just completed a round of meetings with small groups of business leaders in various cities in our District One story that I believe got told by someone in each meeting, with expressions of agreement from other people at the meetings in almost every case, was how difficult it is to push through price increases in contrast to their past experience Someone described the situation at one of those meetings last week as one where almost every customer was acting like Wal-Mart or Home Depot in saying to their suppliers, here is what I will pay; don't tell me about prices  Finally, there is some good news from our Louisiana oil patch, which has been through some really tough times over the last few years Drilling activity has picked up moderately The improvement is not so much in response to recent world price increases but rather is attributable to some new technology for three- dimensional seismic testing, which makes it easier to pick the places to drill, and to deeper drilling capabilities than were available in the past  With regard to the national outlook, while I would not dismiss the role that special events have played so far in 1996, I would continue to argue that it is important to focus on those influences that will prevail beyond the next few months In doing that, our outlook is not much changed since late 1995 We are now forecasting GDP growth of about 2-1/4 percent We anticipate that the somewhat stronger-than-expected growth in the first half of the year will be damped in the coming months by the higher long-term interest rates that we have already seen, a slowdown in housing and related spending, some deterioration in consumer balance sheets, and the persisting uneasiness among workers that people have talked about for a long time  We now expect the CPI to average about 3 percent for the year That is about 1/4 percentage point above our forecast of a few months ago and reflects all that we now know about oil and grain prices We expect the impact of higher oil and food prices to be moderate in the near term and to dissipate by later next year In particular, the oil price increase was comparatively modest and should be reversed rather quickly I think it is very unlikely that the price changes that we have seen will become embedded in expectations  -13-    5/21/96  and general price-setting behavior without some decision on our part to accommodate it If I am confident of anything this morning, it is that we will not do that  Our forecast of economic growth into next year differs at the margin from that in the Greenbook, but the differences are not substantial Those differences are somewhat greater near the end of the forecast horizon where we see a bit slower growth and the inflation rate coming down somewhat more quickly Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4107,1996-05-21," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for alternative B, and for the reasons that Ed Boehne articulated I, too, would prefer a symmetrical directive Being last or near last to speak, I won't repeat all the arguments that already have been made One of the things that got a good bit of discussion in the earlier go-around was the run-up in oil and grain prices, their impact on the CPI, and how much weight to give to that On that point, I have had to remind myself over the last couple of months about an important feature of the CPI--namely that, as a fixed weight index, it tends to overstate inflation when we get the kind of relative price changes that we have seen recently Since a fixed weight index does not capture short-run substitution effects--and someone talked about that briefly during the earlier go-around--such an index does tend to show prices going up quickly We know that what really happens is that some substitution effect will hold down the increase, although sometimes with a lag On that point, I would therefore give somewhat less weight than do some others to the run-up in both oil and gas prices  In preparation for this meeting we talked some about what we can learn from the yield curve, a subject that also came up this morning There are a lot of interesting questions there, but I still am not persuaded that the steepening in the yield curve that we have seen recently provides sufficient evidence that an unchanged funds rate constitutes an accommodative shift in our policy In sum, I would prefer to stand pat, observe developments very carefully over the period ahead, and be ready to move at our next meeting or before if we begin to see some of the inflationary pressures that people around the table have noted could happen "
4166,1996-07-02," Mr Chairman, I would join those who argue that the risk of an unintended signal effect from a change at this time, even though the probability may be very low, is a risk we just do not need to take At least for the moment, that argument substantially outweighs in my view the argument for a technical adjustment So, I would support leaving the ranges where they are "
4167,1996-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Southeast economy continues to grow moderately, slightly outperforming the nation by almost all measures Georgia and Florida particularly are doing extremely well Although much of that can be attributed to the Olympics, the District would still be performing quite well even without the Olympics There are a few imbalances and those that exist are not surprising Tourism throughout our Southeast region would have to be characterized as spectacular, as it should be going into the Olympics Florida tourism is having a record year Manufacturing activity is steady Employment and orders were up just a little in recent months Apparel remains weak Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia have lost almost one-third of their apparel manufacturing employment over the last four years That loss is occurring in regions where the  -23-    7/2-3/96  new southern automobile industry is moving in, and it is a perfect example of the mismatch between the qualifications of many of the jobless who are leaving the apparel industry and the qualifications needed for the new jobs in the automobile industry Single-family housing activity generally remains good, with inventory shortages of single-family homes reported in some of our areas Multifamily occupancy remains quite high and building of such units continues Commercial real estate activity is strong except for the retailing sector Labor shortages and wage pressures now exist in several markets in low-skilled and unskilled positions, primarily in retailing and construction But it is our sense that those should abate as we get past the Olympics and as housing and other construction slows as we expect  There is a lot of discussion and we get a lot of questions about the economic impact of the Olympics Our judgment is that the macro impact will be quite small Only foreign tourists who would not otherwise have come to the United States will make a net contribution to GDP Everything else is a substitution or a change in timing and by that I mean the building of facilities a little early to have them open in time for the Olympics Our best guess is that total construction that would not have occurred were it not for the Olympics totals less than $1/4 billion Also, our best guess on the employment gains that can be expected during the Olympics is that 60,000 to 70,000 jobs will be added at the peak That peak falls between two employment survey periods Our guess is that the July survey will pick up about 40,000 of those Olympic jobs and most will be gone by the August survey Our sense from talking to people in the community is that many of those jobs are second jobs or retirees who are coming out of retirement just for a few weeks and have no intention of staying in the workforce Our best estimates are that the gains will contribute about $5 to $6 billion to the District over five years, the bulk of that coming about now So, on a regional basis it certainly is a big deal  As far as the near-term outlook for the national economy is concerned, the Atlanta forecast and that in the Greenbook are almost indistinguishable Both see a spurt in activity in the second quarter; both show a slowing in the second half of the year based on expectations of a deceleration or outright decline in housing activity combined with the already observed moderation in the growth of business fixed investment Each forecast also shows the CPI at about 3 percent and little change in the unemployment rate Notwithstanding these similarities, we have a somewhat different interpretation of recent events I contrast our outlook with the Greenbook's not by disputing that demand is relatively strong but by noting that recent history shows that increases in demand and increases in relative prices that accompany it very quickly elicit increases in supply, which sharply reduce upward price pressures If we have learned anything from the last five years of expansion, it is that a focus on demand to the exclusion of supply and competitive pressures may not tell the whole story Importantly, the change in the dynamics of demand and supply relationships makes traditional measures of potential price pressures, such as capacity utilization and the unemployment rate, less reliable in our view than in the past Against this broad framework, we do not believe that we have already accommodated an increase in demand Consequently, common observations about the strength in current and prospective activity lead me to  -24-    7/2-3/96  temper my interpretations of at least overall price pressures beyond the forecast horizon Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4168,1996-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I indicated in the earlier go-around, I, like most others, expect the economy to slow in the coming quarters, leaving us with a rate of growth without increasing price pressures that perhaps can be achieved with our current policy stance I would like to give things a chance to play out a bit more Certainly, this position requires that one be of the view that our current policy position is not accommodative Unfortunately, like many of the other issues we have faced and talked about in the last two days, we cannot demonstrate that categorically Based on my review of information from financial markets as well as competing forecasts, I am not convinced that current policy is adding fuel to the current inflation environment As Don reminded us this morning, it is equally clear that we probably are not reducing general price pressures at the moment except to the extent that a continued experience of slow, relatively stable inflation works to temper concerns about our commitment to a low inflation environment I would prefer to see us keep policy unchanged for the moment I, too, would be comfortable with an asymmetrical directive as long as it is not an irreversible leaning, making us feel compelled to move at the next meeting even if conditions do not seem to support that move Thank you "
4229,1996-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy of the Atlanta District remains moderately strong The big news over the last six weeks, to no one's surprise I'm sure, has been the impact of the Olympics Some businesses in Atlanta and other Southeastern cities were somewhat disappointed by the spillover effects In general, the level of spending during the Olympics was in line with expectations of about $4 to $6 billion spread over six years While that spending was a nice bonus for our region and it left behind some really desirable infrastructure that will be lasting in its impact, it was really small potatoes when compared with just the Georgia economy which generates over $160 billion in income per year  District residential real estate markets generally can be characterized as healthy though activity is now slowing after a one- year growth spurt Multifamily and commercial real estate markets remain strong I mention that because continuing growth in each of these markets at both the regional and national levels bodes well for the Southeast manufacturing sector, where the production of construction materials and durables is significant While the forecast for durables production remains fairly good, our region's important apparel industry continues to hemorrhage In the second quarter, year-over-year job losses totaled 42,000 for the combined apparel and textile industries While the goods-producing sectors are expected to produce some new jobs over the last half of 1996, as will be the case nationally, the majority of the new employment positions will likely come from retail trade and services The pockets of labor shortages and related wage pressures that have continued to be reported in parts of Georgia and Tennessee should be alleviated somewhat by the tens of thousands of individuals previously committed to Olympics-related construction and services As those people seek alternative employment opportunities, which clearly exist in the District, we think we should have a smooth and rapid transition into the post-Olympics period  My outlook for the national economy has not changed materially since our last meeting While the economy seems to be running with little slack in the labor markets, as evidenced by the low unemployment rate and relatively high participation rate, productivity seems to be high when we take account of anecdotal information Hence, any wage pressures can reasonably be viewed as reflecting those productivity gains rather than an inflationary threat that necessarily will be passed on to prices At the same time there are signs of the deceleration in activity that we have been  -19-    8/20/96  forecasting, although they may be preliminary at best Many fundamentals point to slowing investment and there are signs that the predicted slowdown in housing is finally being realized The earlier buoyancy in consumer spending seems to be moderating and the saving rate is edging up, at least marginally I have to admit that inventories are lean and consequently to the extent my expectations for slowing in demand growth are disappointed, we will likely see an immediate impact on domestic production All things considered, I still think we are in an enviable position with no major imbalances Real GDP growth will, I expect, average a little over 2 percent this year and probably under 2-1/2 percent next year, and this is with the broader-based measures of inflation continuing in my view under 3 percent As at our last discussion, I'm unconvinced that our policy stance currently is tending to make inflation worse So, the favorable news on employment and output is less worrisome to me than it might be otherwise My inflation forecast continues to show no acceleration for 1996 once we take account of the effect of earlier oil price increases, which seem to be playing out as we had expected Unlike the Greenbook, when we examine the likely effects of the minimum wage legislation, we see no serious impact on inflation expectations when we take account of recent evidence of the substitution of capital for labor, productivity gains, competition, and job restructuring Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4230,1996-08-20," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation Although it is difficult to judge the stance of policy with any great precision, it is still my sense that with our current policy and the slowing of economic activity that we are beginning to see, we likely will be able to sustain a pace of moderate growth without a pickup in the broader-based measures of inflation Consequently, I would have a preference for keeping the current funds rate of 5-1/4 percent in place and giving things a chance to play out a bit more I am certainly comfortable with the asymmetrical directive  Having said that, I again would like to join those who continue to urge us to do additional study and debate, both inside and outside the System, on the costs and benefits of a policy aimed at moving inflation rates still lower Current circumstances and those likely to be immediately ahead may in fact provide us an excellent opportunity to pursue such a policy  -42-    8/20/96 "
4280,1996-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman In my view, the recent economic data and anecdotal information show an economy that is operating at a healthy pace In fact, coming off a surprisingly strong second quarter, GDP growth is averaging just under 3 percent on a year-over-year basis and is exceeding my earlier expectations As others have observed, the growth is both broadly based and without serious imbalances Job growth, which has gotten so much attention and discussion, underscores the strength of economic activity Although labor shortages are not widespread in our District, I am hearing more complaints in recent weeks and months about both the quantity and the quality of available workers Fortunately, investment spending seems to have kept capacity utilization within a reasonable range The slowdown that I had expected in the pace of activity has been slower in coming and is still less obvious than I had anticipated Some signs of slowdown, which we thought we saw in the data in earlier months, were either revised away or reversed For example, after sorting through the mixed signals that Mike Prell reviewed on housing, it looks as though that sector has continued to be surprisingly strong and that has brought with it strong spending on consumer durables The most recent data on retail sales may signal some slowing in consumer spending, but it seems to me that the underlying fundamentals of job and income growth provide a continuing source of strength Our revised forecast for the remainder of 1996 and into 1997 is for a continuation of good growth but with some moderation That moderation, again, is not coming as soon nor to the same degree as we had earlier forecast  Despite the greater than expected pace of growth and the low rate of unemployment, price pressures appear to remain modest While the special effects of the increases in energy and food prices are working their way through the price indices, economy-wide measures of prices remain low At the same time, I am hearing more and more concerns anecdotally about wage pressures Some business people I have talked to are actively weighing the costs and benefits of trying    9/24/96  to hire more qualified workers, and with that they seem to be developing a clear intention to try to pass through their higher costs by increasing their output prices At the same time, we continue to hear stories of intense competition that limits price increases across almost all industries, sometimes causing price increases earlier in the year to be rolled back Finally, in my conversations I continue to try to gauge expectations for both growth and inflation While it is hard to find folks who want to argue that growth is too strong, the one plea I almost always get when I have serious and in-depth discussions is for a policy that optimizes the chance of keeping inflation at moderate levels That is something that people would like to be able to take for granted in their decision-making and negotiations  In the Southeast, we have continued to see growth at a moderate pace in August and September Retail sales remain strong and, in fact, exceed last year's levels Tourism, which is so important to our District and especially to Florida, has been somewhat mixed, but the outlook is mostly positive Consumer confidence remains unchanged, while manufacturing continues to expand at a moderate pace The declines in the apparel and textile sectors that I previously talked about at these meetings continue to show up Part of that loss is being made up by the expansion of the auto industry in our region Single-family home sales were mixed throughout the District, while builders noted that new home sales and construction remain healthy but flat As Al Broaddus observed for his region, class A office space is in short supply in several of our markets, and we are beginning to see some speculative projects, notably in Florida and Atlanta District bankers report moderately strong loan demand and some decline in credit quality Payroll employment increased in June and July Scattered reports of localized labor shortages are more common Despite those, there are few signs of increasing wages and only spotty reports that the increases are affecting market prices Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4281,1996-09-24," Mr Chairman, I could support a decision not to change policy at this time, and if I had a vote this year, I would vote ""yes"" As Governor Rivlin noted in the earlier go-around, we can take great pride in the low inflation and the strong real activity that we have achieved At previous meetings, I was among those who argued in favor of letting this thing play out I think that has been the right thing to do  Having said that, I have come to the view that a modest increase in our fed funds target rate is probably desirable now or sometime soon In my view, we do need to continue to wonder about whether the hope for a slowdown over the rest of this year and into next year will materialize, at least to the degree that we expect it Our previous forecast plainly suggested the need for such a slowdown However, my concern is now rooted in the belief that the rate of growth that we have seen in recent quarters--unless we get a very substantial slowdown--combined with the recent pace of job creation, tight labor markets, and relatively high labor force participation are incompatible with stable inflation over the longer run This raises a special concern that monetary policy may be accommodating those trends The current stable inflation performance suggests to me that over the short run, policy may not be too expansionary Nevertheless, few if any of our forecasts conclude that inflation will moderate under the current policy scenario Indeed, most forecasts including my own suggest that inflation is most likely to stabilize at its present level or even accelerate slowly I am convinced that the risks of inflation are now predominantly on the up side  I believe with Tom Melzer that we currently have a unique opportunity to solidify the gains that we have made in recent years on limiting inflation A growing number of us around this table and others outside the System are coming to the view that the risks of higher inflation, a small uptick at least, have increased We have a chance to send a very credible and unambiguous signal to the economy and financial markets about our commitment to stem inflation and perhaps to bring it down further over time The economy's current strength combined with the fact that markets have been expecting a policy adjustment for some time suggest to me that some change could be made at this time or sometime soon without causing either a large deceleration of real economic activity or a disruption to financial markets Again, while I do not think the timing is critical, I think  -36-    9/24/96  the time is now or sometime very soon to move against the inflationary uptick that we are seeing I clearly would prefer an asymmetrical directive if we decide to hold policy steady "
4337,1996-11-13," Mr Chairman, many of us indicated at the last FOMC meeting that we were still waiting for the forecasted and hoped- for slowdown in the economy, but as of that time there were only a few scattered signs of a slowdown I do not think that is the case any longer Indeed, while the Sixth District does not exactly mirror the national economy, many of the same trends that we are seeing within the District are now appearing in the national economy as well Our District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, although I no longer would suggest that it is leading the nation Signs of a slowdown are beginning to appear, particularly in residential construction and manufacturing Tourism, a mainstay for our District, particularly in Georgia and Florida, continues to be extremely strong Retail sales exceed year-ago levels, and retailers we talk to are optimistic about the upcoming holidays Our real estate contacts report that the single-family market has begun to slow, albeit from an historically high level, as both sales and construction activity flattened in October At the same time, multifamily and commercial construction continue strong Loan demand remains steady, with consumer loan demand described as flat and commercial as mixed Banks in our region tell us they are beginning to pay closer attention to credit quality  On the labor market front, we continue to get reports of localized shortages, which are in fact becoming more and more common across the District At the same time, we are hearing of only scattered wage pressures and, as Mike Moskow and Cathy Minehan indicated for their Districts, there are almost no signs that this tightness is being passed through to consumers in the form of higher prices We get few reports that there will be any direct impact from the increase in the minimum wage, but some of our business contacts indicate that certain wage contracts are indexed to the minimum wage and hence we will be watchful on that front  Our outlook for the District calls for moderate-to-strong growth well into next year We look for some signs of possible slowing due to diminished demand Although consumer confidence remains strong, we see a slight drop in the willingness to buy big- ticket items And the regional decline in loan quality suggests the possibility of tighter loan standards and weaker loan demand in the future Similarly, regional capital investment may slacken unless manufacturers stop revising their capital expenditure plans downward  On the national front, we see things about the same as everyone else does The reported drop in third-quarter GDP growth and other more recent monthly data seem to be signalling the slackening that we were looking for, especially in light of the evidence that growth in consumer spending and business investment may be slowing Despite the evidence of some slowing in the expansion, we still expect forward momentum to continue at a good level, with most of the economy's fundamentals remaining essentially healthy  We see three key question marks for the forecast, essentially the same as those discussed in the Greenbook The first concerns consumer demand and specifically when it will pick up and by how much We think there are some upside risks here As Al Broaddus just noted, personal income has been up, savings have been up, debt burdens were reduced slightly in October, and the run-up in the stock market has given consumers' holdings of financial wealth an added boost The  -12-    11/13/96  second question relates to inventories, which we have already talked about Looking at the data closely, we feel that a large part of the increase in inventories was not a result of an unanticipated drop in sales but rather stemmed in most cases from attempts to replenish stocks Inventory-sales ratios remain moderate to low by almost any standard Of course, the third factor is the labor markets How long can we continue to have the current job growth and unemployment environment without the resulting tightness beginning to put upward pressure on prices? We think we have been fortunate with developments in this area for some while now, but it is not likely that reduced increases in benefits can continue to offset wage increases indefinitely Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4338,1996-11-13," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for an unchanged and asymmetrical directive In fact, I think the asymmetrical directive that we have had in place, and would retain, sends a very important signal of this Committee's intention not to let inflation creep higher I only hope that we are prepared to move if in fact the upside risks that we have talked about materialize "
4389,1996-12-17," Peter, you talked about the expected performance gains Can you say anything more about the magnitude of those gains by going in earlier?   Do you have any quantitative sense about that? "
4390,1996-12-17," I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and like Cathy Minehan I would associate myself with the understanding of asymmetry that Vice Chairman McDonough enunciated  -37-    12/17/96 "
4445,1997-02-04," I also prefer staying with the provisional ranges and getting there by  the left leg of Brian's tree that we talked about After sitting at this table for a year and working  through the short-term options meeting after meeting, I guess I have gravitated toward wishing  for a better sense and a crisper view of our collective long-term strategy So, I am glad to hear  that kind of discussion  One other comment about our external constituencies I don't know about the rest of  you, but I have been running into more and more complacency among business groups, including  directors, with regard to inflation I think our success has left people feeling that we have won  the war against inflation All the debate in the last few months about the reconstruction of the  CPI has undermined the arguments for an anti-inflationary policy even more People are not sure    2/4-5/97  that they know, or even that we know, where we are with respect to inflation, though there is a  feeling that we are probably better off now than earlier That attitude certainly makes it harder to  sell the notion of pushing inflation still lower by 1/2 or 1 percentage point So, I would argue  that we have the ongoing job of doing whatever we can--and whatever you can, Mr Chairman--  to sharpen the external understanding of our focus on inflation There is an awful lot of  complacency, at least in the groups I talk to "
4446,1997-02-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman The burst of year-end 1996 economic  activity that shows up in the national data and that people have already mentioned around the  table is not reflected in either the most recent data for our southeastern region or the anecdotal  reports that we are getting from directors and other people we talk to While we would still  characterize our regional growth as moderate, we clearly are seeing some slowing from the pace  that we saw earlier when our region led the nation in job growth  In manufacturing, I have reported at almost every meeting on the weakness and the  significant loss of jobs in the textile and apparel industries, and that weakness continues We are  now seeing weakness in both pulp and paper And as housing construction appears to have  peaked, we also are seeing some slowing in the production of home-related products like lumber,  carpets, and appliances That in fact is a cyclical development that we have come to expect  because an important part of our manufacturing sector feeds off the national housing industry  On the other hand, our relatively new and quietly growing southern auto industry is showing    2/4-5/97  some modest strength, and the prospects are for more of the same in the period ahead Reports  of less robust capital spending plans by manufacturers in our region also suggest some  deceleration in the pace of growth in the period ahead  In construction, single-family home sales and construction have both slowed  noticeably in our region and multifamily activity is now clearly past its peak Retail construction  also has slowed At the same time, commercial construction remains strong, particularly that of  office space where vacancy levels have gotten quite low We are seeing some speculative  building in Atlanta and some other southern cities but not yet at a worrisome level for a region  that needs space to accommodate companies moving into the area  Retailers, who are coming off what they characterize as generally satisfactory  year-end 1996 sales, are telling us that they are comfortable with their inventory levels and their  outlook for sales in 1997 The well-publicized freeze of vegetables in Florida was severe, the  worst in seven years, with most of the crops damaged and losses around the state estimated at  $250 million Crops like corn and beans can be recycled in 45 to 60 days, but imports of food  from Mexico and other Latin American countries are reportedly taking up some of the slack  Finally, labor markets remain tight in our region I would characterize the change  since our last meeting as indicating somewhat less pressure and somewhat fewer shortages in  certain skills like those in construction, but at the same time new geographic areas in the region  are reporting tightness Even with continuing tightness, extraordinary wage pressures are still  isolated and do not yet appear to be spreading  At the national level, like almost everybody else, we underestimated the strength of  the economy in the fourth quarter Like the Greenbook and others, we anticipate more moderate  growth in 1997 and on into 1998 We are among those who see somewhat slower growth in    2/4-5/97  1997 than is projected in the Greenbook, and consequently we do not expect the unemployment  rate to move quite so low as in the staff forecast The good balance we continue to see is  encouraging and happily it leaves the economy in a position that is less vulnerable with regard to  the inevitable shocks that will come along In my view, the risks to such an outlook for  economic activity are slightly to the upside and--as others have indicated--consumer spending  represents the greatest risk If, despite the deterioration in consumer balance sheets, strong  income growth and confidence fuel consumer spending beyond our estimates, we certainly could  get increased overall demand pressures In particular, if consumers add to their spending by  lowering their saving rate or capitalizing on their increase in wealth, the pressures on resources  will be exacerbated  Of course, the tight labor markets that we have talked about and are watching closely,  as well as the scenario that Ted Truman mentioned in which oil prices linger at higher levels,  could among other things create pressures that feed through to higher price inflation if  accommodated by monetary policy As is always the case in judging inflationary risk, we must  make judgments about the current stance of policy While the recent experience with the growth  of the monetary aggregates raises some questions, other measures of policy including real rates  of interest do not suggest to me that our policy is clearly in an accommodative stance Given  that the broader measures of inflation and the adjusted CPI continue to hold at moderately low  and relatively steady levels and are not projected to show any significant deterioration until  1998, we appear to be at a point where we can feel reasonably good about both the outlook and  current policy Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4447,1997-02-04," Don, have you run any simulations, other than those reported in the  Bluebook, with NAIRU specified at some lower level, perhaps the 53 percent rate that we have  been at for some time? Even if you have not, do you have any sense about how sensitive the  inflation path is to some lower NAIRU?   It would?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, am comfortable with the way you  laid things out and I support your recommendation It became clear to me as the go-around  proceeded yesterday that I am at least a bit more optimistic than some around the table in terms  of how the wage pressures may play out My view may be colored by the nature of the economy  in our region, which has topped off, and my expectation that a similar development may begin to  show through elsewhere in the nation as housing and other sectors of the nation's economy begin  to slow I also want to associate myself with those who say that there is a good bit to be gained  by preparing our constituencies for a policy move in the period ahead I am not thinking just of  the financial markets and Congress but the broader constituency I think it can be very helpful to  our long-term credibility to prepare the public, given where I believe people think we stand at the  moment So, I support the recommendation for no change and an asymmetrical directive "
4504,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, am an old COBOL programmer  If you go into business, I hope you will give me a call; I would love to be your partner   The economic picture that emerges in the Southeast has many  parallels to what is going on nationally At the same time, as I reported at the last meeting,  the overall rate of economic expansion in our region has settled back somewhat from what it  was earlier in the expansion When I talk about some slowing, it is from relatively high rates  of economic growth As elsewhere in the country, retail sales in our area were stronger than  expected during the mid-winter period Retailers are optimistic going forward to Easter, and  inventories seem about right to them We are seeing some signs of a slowdown in real estate,  both residential and commercial Exceptions are in Nashville and Atlanta where, for the first  time in this cyclical expansion, a few of my contacts in real estate and banking are expressing  some concern about developers who seem to be forgetting the lessons of the 1980s I will  save the stories that go with that observation, but I have heard some very interesting stories  that make the point I certainly will watch that closely Some bankers in Atlanta also  commented recently to me that they think the multifamily market in Atlanta may be close to    3/25/97  being overbuilt The good news is that they are going to pull back their lending to that sector  Manufacturing, too, seems to have slowed somewhat from earlier in the expansion Our  own survey of manufacturing showed declines in the proportion of firms reporting increases  in production, shipments, and new orders Employment, the average workweek, and the  index of expected business activity six months out also declined, and expectations of future  capital spending have dropped off some since our previous survey  As Tom Hoenig mentioned for his area, oil and gas activity is strong--in Louisiana  in our case That activity not only has pushed the rig counts to high levels, but it has brought  demand for crew boats and other kinds of support spending to higher levels We reported at  the last meeting on signs that energy prices would decline, and that has happened, as you  know One of our directors who is close to the natural gas business noted that supplies have  now been rebuilt after the drain from last year's harsh winter, and that should continue to put  downward pressure on energy prices, particularly natural gas, in the period ahead Shipyards  along the Gulf Coast report good orders One yard in Mobile is particularly excited about  getting the first order from Chinese interests; it is for four large container ships  To be sure, labor markets remain tight in our area, with pressures now evident  almost uniformly across our entire region The extraordinary pressures that we saw in the  Tennessee area have lessened somewhat We still get very few reports of unusually large  increases in wages, and we still see almost no signs of cutthroat attempts to steal workers  from other companies We are picking up some reports in our manufacturing survey, and I  would underscore ""some,"" of increasing pressures on input prices in the sense that they may  be beginning to see some of that also in finished good prices However, there still is no real  change in most retail prices    3/25/97  Finally at the regional level, we have two new directors this year from the retail  automobile industry--one associated with a group of moderate-size dealerships and another  who ran the Alamo car rental company until it was recently acquired by one of the new  conglomerates Those directors suggested at our last meeting that we are seeing what they  call a ""seismic"" shift in the retail auto business as the consolidations that are under way  continue They think the consolidations will bring significant efficiencies in operations and  an important change in the bargaining power that dealers have with manufacturers, all of  which they think should bode well for the prices that consumers will pay for autos down the  road  At the national level, we like almost everyone else have been surprised by the  persisting strength in the economy early this year We continue to expect a slowdown in the  expansion later this year and we hope we will not be disappointed We have not raised our  fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter growth forecast appreciably We expect growth in  expenditures on housing and consumer durables to be measurably slower as we move into the  rest of the year We do not expect unemployment to drop quite as low as is indicated in the  Greenbook On the other hand, and probably as a consequence, we also are not quite as  pessimistic with respect to inflation, whether measured by the CPI or the deflator We still  see few signs of stress, excesses, or imbalances except for persistent tightness in labor  markets Having said that, it is my judgment that the risks are now somewhat greater on the  upside My view stems mostly from the greater-than-expected consumer spending that we  can readily see, fueled by either more borrowing, lower saving rates, or as Mike Prell  reminded us again this morning, the possibility that we will see some additional kick to  consumer spending from the stock market wealth effect    3/25/97  One offsetting risk on the downside, as Cathy Minehan also mentioned, is our  view that the outlook for exports could change Should the dollar not fall back or even rise  further, and we think that is certainly possible, growth in exports could be less than is  currently built into the forecast There also remains the strong and growing probability of  increased wage pressures, although we are less sure than some that those will be fully fed  through to price inflation But again, on balance, I think the risks are considerably greater on  the upside Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4505,1997-03-25," I, too, am comfortable with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I came to this meeting with a preference for an asymmetrical directive, and even after the  discussion, I still have a slight preference for that But you and others have argued very  persuasively that it is not a big deal in present circumstances, so I am comfortable with a  symmetrical directive "
4547,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman Like everybody else, I continue to be  amazed and pleasantly surprised by the strong performance of the economy and the lack of  evidence of imbalances and dislocations, both regionally and nationally Our southeastern  region now looks very much like the nation as a whole after slowing a little over the last  couple of quarters from the greater-than-national pace that we were seeing earlier We also  have one of the best balanced economies I can remember, and that balance extends across  both the geographic areas and the various industries that make up the diverse economy of our  Atlanta region  Like Jerry Jordan and Tom Hoenig, I traveled a good bit during the last eight  weeks One of the most interesting regional stories that continue to emerge relates to what is  going on in the oil and gas industry Both Bob McTeer and I have reported before on the  excitement in that industry over the new 3-D seismic technology that has fundamentally  altered the economics of exploration Bob mentioned it again this morning At a breakfast  meeting with a small group of business people in New Orleans three weeks ago, an  independent driller told me that the break-even point has now dropped from about $16 a  barrel to about $4 a barrel Not only will this keep the Louisiana oil patch engaged in a more  steady pace of exploration as the price of oil goes up and down, but it also is having a major  spillover effect on the supporting businesses like rig construction and crew boat  manufacturing The Gulf of Mexico, which the local people referred to as the Dead Sea  when the price of oil was in the $20-$25 range, is now a beehive of activity with the rig  count up to 218 compared to 166 just a year ago This is putting some pressure on the  support industries in the short term; daily rates for crew boats are almost double what they    5/20/97  were a year ago Judging by the backlog of barges and crew boats, it currently takes a much  longer time to complete the planned construction of an oil rig, but my guess is that this  technological breakthrough should help hold down the long-run cost of oil and petroleum  products  The other very positive story in our region is tourism Both current and future  bookings are strong, and that is driving the construction of large hotel projects in several  cities and very strong demand for workers in the hospitality industry Manufacturing, an  industry where we thought we were seeing some slowing at the time of the last FOMC  meeting, recently has shown signs of some pickup back to a moderate pace Construction  activity, despite some indicators of future slowing, is still at a generally high level As others  have noted was happening elsewhere, there are more reports of speculative projects, at least  in the Atlanta market  Labor markets remain tight across our region and across a growing number of  skills We are still hearing sporadic reports of increased wage pressures and some stories of  nonconventional forms of compensation, as also described in the Greenbook For example, a  fast food operator came up to me after a recent speech and told me that he had issued over  one hundred W-2s for tax year 1996 for a staff of 13; that reflects a 600 percent turnover rate  On some days he had to choose whether to operate the drive-in window or the sit-down part  of his restaurant Also, he was now paying employees for 40 hours of work, but having them  work only 30 hours as a way of keeping them on his payroll instead of someone else's  On the national level, the broad outline of my own outlook over the rest of 1997  into 1998 is very similar to that of the Greenbook and that of most private forecasters I see  considerably stronger-than-expected growth for 1997 on a year-over-year basis, a slowing    5/20/97  expansion as we move into 1998, and a modest upward drift in inflation While many of us  have been making a very reasonable forecast of slowing growth in final demand, and we are  beginning to see some signs that may be happening, there also are some not insignificant  risks on the upside Consumer spending continues to be the greatest risk on my worry list as  the underlying fundamentals to support continued strong spending still seem to be there  good job and income growth, record high levels of confidence, and the wild card kicker that  we have talked about before--the rise in the value of assets that have not been appreciably  drawn down Although less likely, a pickup in export demand and even further inventory  building, which Mike Prell alluded to as a possibility, could contribute to greater than  expected growth For me, the risks are still on the upside  Recent inflation remains low by all conventional measures, lower I think than  almost all of us expected As all of us have noted before, there is growing evidence that  underreported productivity gains and broad resistance to price increases are the biggest  factors that have restrained general price advances in this cycle compared to those that we  have seen in the past At the same time, my own forecast, as well as those of most private  sector forecasters and the Greenbook, shows a gradual upward drift in inflation at the end of  1997 and into 1998  Obviously, the central policy question continues to be whether the stance of policy  is too accommodative and, given the persistence of robust demand, how strongly we feel  about not risking a loss of the ground we have gained in keeping inflation low With the  economy having gotten to a point where it must be near full employment, if not beyond it, we  have a unique opportunity with little downside risk to lean a bit more against the expected  upward creep in inflation that most of us are forecasting and, in doing so, to underscore our    5/20/97  resolve and credibility in the minds of financial market participants, -business  decisionmakers, and the general public I also find myself wishing we had been more  successful collectively in making the case for low, perhaps even lower, levels of inflation so  that our various publics would be supportive of such a tightening move Thank you, Mr  Chairman "
4548,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I have a preference for an additional 1/4  point tightening, but I can support your recommendation for today In any event, I certainly  would support an asymmetrical directive In view of the hour, I will not repeat all the  arguments The possible payback of staying ahead of inflationary pressures that many of us  think are probably building weighed against the very small downside risk of a modest  tightening in a fully employed, solid economy leads me to conclude that a somewhat less  accommodative policy would be both reasonable and explainable  I would like to add, as we talk about policy options, that we always seem to be  constrained by insufficient focus on the longer run Without a better defined and better  articulated goal, whatever we decide that goal needs to be, each meeting becomes an exercise    5/20/97  in judging the latest data in the context of a short-term forecast While I would not want to  give up our individual and collective judgments, especially in a period of fundamental  changes in the way the economy may be working, our current approach to policy without a  clearly understood anchor makes it very difficult to build the kind of understanding and  support for policies that promise long-term gains but entail short-term costs I hope we can  get back to that debate in July or sometime soon Thank you "
4595,1997-07-01," As the person who may well have spent less career time puzzling over  these issues, I probably have learned more than anybody around the table from this exercise I  have come to the simple conclusion that the differences among the primary indices that have  been studied are quite small compared to our ability to control inflation and hit some price target  I may be the most cynical of all the members who have spoken on the question of the  public's understanding of our inflation goal In my view, we are well short of any ability to  explain why we need to squeeze out the last bit of inflation I don't think we've gotten to first  base in terms of achieving a general public understanding of the benefits of lowering inflation  even from 2-1/2 percent to 2 percent When I make speeches or talk to smart business people  about it, their eyes glaze over As persuasive as you are, Mr Chairman, I don't know whether I    7/1-2/97  would like to see you try to explain to Congress in your upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony why it is desirable to push inflation down even 1/2 percentage point from its current  level, much less to get all the way to price stability I may have missed the sermon, not having  been at the table for as long as most of you, in terms of having gotten this religion, but I know in  my heart and everything I ever studied that moving toward price stability is the right thing to do  Unfortunately, the current state of public understanding of this concept, or even of pushing  inflation somewhat below its current level, is so minimally advanced that I cannot imagine us  being in a position to use that as a justification for our near-term policy actions without engaging  in a great deal more educational effort Again, I know I come to this debate later than many  other people, but I do not think we can underestimate the need to talk about this   That's what I am trying to say   I, too, Mr Chairman, would prefer to stay with the current ranges I  think the most important consideration for the moment is the signal effect, and in my view  raising the ranges would risk sending the wrong signal I have some notes from yesterday's  discussion that I wanted to work into the conversation I was going to save them for the next  go-around, but let me just relate at this point my personal observation about how difficult we  found it yesterday to make the argument for low inflation My comment about how far we have  to go certainly did not mean to imply that we should not work as hard as we know how to  achieve our inflation objective I think the comments that Jerry Jordan made yesterday and Bill  McDonough and you made this morning about better ways to communicate clearly indicate the  right direction I am very supportive of our collectively trying to make that case in a better way  than we have in the past I wanted to weigh in on that as well "
4596,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman As was the case the last time we met, the  economy of our southeastern region also looks very much like the nation's, after having led the  nation for five plus years earlier in the expansion Sixth District economic growth appears to  have moderated somewhat during the second quarter, primarily reflecting some softening in  manufacturing and to some extent in the single-family real estate sector Our regional survey of    7/1-2/97  manufacturing indicates that the proportion of firms reporting increases in production and  shipments declined significantly, and there was a sharp falloff in new orders Looking ahead,  however, expectations were for increased orders and backlogs Reported plans for capital  spending over the coming six months also declined Underscoring the comments Ed Boehne  just made, I too am struck by the frequency with which corporate CEOs continue to tell me that  their investment spending is driven by the pursuit of gains in productivity and efficiency to  protect their margins rather than to increase capacity Regional retail sales, while on average  slightly above year-ago levels, seem to have slowed somewhat or at least to have paused At the  same time, we are told that inventories are at desirable levels, with only a few retailers reporting  somewhat higher levels The tourism and hospitality industries, which are particularly important  to our region, continue their solid growth Near-term bookings in our major tourist cities are  now reported to be up between 5 and 20 percent For example, the huge Opryland complex in  Nashville, which added 20 percent capacity just recently, stays essentially full with spillover to  other hotels in Nashville Wage pressures across our regions are mixed The tightest markets are  those with the highest percentage of high-tech employment and the hospitality industry, which  has been tight for quite a while now Stories about the role of competition in holding down price  increases do not seem to change very much from those we have been talking about for more than  a year, although I recently had several CEOs tell me that they are beginning to see pressures on  margins, and they are expressing doubts that they can continue to get the productivity gains they  have seen recently  Our view of the national economy is very similar to that of the Greenbook this time It  is now quite clear that the expansion slowed significantly in the second quarter We, too, look    7/1-2/97  for the pace to pick up again in the last half of the year, pushing year-over-year growth to about  3-1/2 percent Like others, our best guess is that the slowing is likely to turn out to be a pause or  catch-your-breath period rather than a fundamental slowdown The ingredients for renewed  vigor in consumer spending seem to be in place and, absent a significant correction in asset  prices, we could get a sizable surprise on the upside  What concerns me most, consistent with what others already have observed, is that our  own forecast and most other forecasts show a gradual upward drift in inflation at the end of 1997  into 1998 and even into 1999 If we are really committed to a forward-looking preemptive  approach to policy and if we are satisfied that we have corrected for what has been an  overestimation of inflation in most of our forecasts in recent times, then in my view we probably  will need to adjust policy further sometime soon We will need to do so to hold our inflation and  credibility gains before we get behind the curve, as we have so often in the past In my mind, the  risks of being wrong in our forecasts and getting somewhat slower-than-expected growth and  lower inflation seem quite small Accordingly, a forward-looking preemptive approach to policy  is quite consistent with our longer-run objective for controlling inflation that I hope we will  embrace more firmly as we talk about these issues during the remainder of this meeting  Obviously, a preemptive approach to policy to guard against an expected upward drift in  inflation, which is present only in our forecasts and cannot yet be seen in our current data,  increases the burden on all of us to provide skillful explanations of our policy actions Thank  you, Mr Chairman "
4597,1997-07-01," I think the suggested rewording raises enough issues that it's not  worth the trouble it might bring us if we introduced it at this time I would leave it alone for  now   I also support no change, alternative B I have a reasonably strong  preference for an asymmetrical directive on the basis of either of two interpretations people  might put on it First, although I am not sure we have fully corrected for our past tendency to  overestimate inflation, I certainly don't know any more than anyone else how to take account of  some of the fundamental changes that are taking place My best guess is that we are likely to    7/1-2/97  face a situation that we will decide is unsustainable and we will tighten Second, we do not  circulate our individual assumptions about policy for the Humphrey-Hawkins submissions, but I  want to confess that my own submission was based on the assumption that we will in fact decide  that we are experiencing unsustainable rates of economic growth Accordingly, I have built into  my submission some moderate tightening over the period ahead I also would be comfortable if  others want to interpret our asymmetrical directive as a commitment and resolve to hold the line  on inflation So, either of those interpretations of an asymmetrical directive would be just fine  with me Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4656,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economic picture and outlook for the  Southeast also have not changed very much over the last seven weeks We still have a very  favorable and balanced picture, mirroring and reinforcing what we see at the national level The  Southeast is still ""humming along,"" Mike  Picking up on Cathy Minehan's comments on tourism, our region's hospitality and  tourist industry, which offers some insight into discretionary spending, is operating at or near  capacity in most of our major tourist cities Future bookings are well ahead of a year ago Even  with the new capacity that has come on line--and more is coming--hotels are offering fewer off-  season discounts, and there is no noticeable impact on occupancy rates Cruise ships and airline  flights in South Florida are essentially fully booked, so if anyone is planning a speech in South  Florida, make your reservations early!  We, too, see continuing evidence of some slowing in residential construction activity, but  one must look beyond very high levels of activity in cities like Atlanta Expansion of construction  activity in the commercial sector, mostly office buildings and hotels, is taking up some of the slack    8/19/97  But even with speculative prices still holding up, leasing activity has slowed somewhat in those  sectors and we expect announcements of new projects to moderate in the period ahead  Manufacturing activity is more difficult to read, but it appears to have recovered a little  since the last meeting While our latest regional manufacturing survey showed that current  production had eased slightly, shipments, new orders, back orders, employment, and the workweek  all rose in the last report Also, picking up on Bob McTeer's comments, oil and gas activity  continues to be strong in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast, with the number of working rigs  remaining high Orders for new ship construction are booked several years out  Labor markets in our region also remain tight, an old and familiar story by now Pockets  of special tightness include information technology and skilled crafts in areas like marine and oil-  related work At the same time, we still cannot find any evidence of a systematic run-up in wages,  and wage increases reportedly are continuing to hold below the 4 percent level In fact,  in the paper industry told me last week that his company is continuing to get concessions  from its unions to protect jobs at lower productivity plants Employers are telling us that they are  not spending significantly more to pay workers but are spending considerably more to recruit,  screen, and train new employees  Our surveys have turned up no new evidence of unusual developments in prices While  our latest manufacturing survey indicated that prices received increased moderately, 75 percent of  the respondents in that survey expected no change in the period ahead Prices paid eased slightly,  with 70 percent reporting no change Consistent with Tom Hoenig's comments, we too hear with  greater frequency reports of sharper increases in health care costs  One area of special concern in our region is the Florida citrus industry where growers are  battling the medfly for the first time in many years While current estimates of damage are only in    8/19/97  the $20 to $26 million range, those estimates are doubling every couple of weeks, and we are  mindful of the last experience in California where losses hit some $200 million So, we could see  some run-up in fruit prices late in the year  Our view on the national picture is very similar to that laid out in the Greenbook and  discussed by Mike Prell this morning We, too, expect a slower second half of 1997, with GDP  growth at perhaps 2-1/4 percent and a similar pace in 1998 We also think it likely that we will lose  some ground on inflation over the coming period My feeling is that we need to remain vigilant,  and with the risks still skewed somewhat to the high side an anticipatory anti-inflationary policy  move in the future is still quite likely Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4657,1997-08-19, Agree 
4706,1997-09-30," Thank you, Jerry just asked the question I wanted to pose   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our Sixth District economy looks much the  way it did six weeks ago, and District activity finished the summer at a pace that looks much the  same as that for the nation The regionally important tourism and hospitality industries could not  be stronger, and this is despite the added capacity that I reported at previous meetings At the same  time, we have seen some impact on tourism from a stronger dollar Traffic from Europe, especially  Germany, is down, but that has been offset by a pickup in visitors from other areas of the world  such as Latin America Manufacturing seems to have slowed somewhat after a strong summer  Activity remains solid in shipbuilding and energy Further expansion from present levels in the oil  and gas drilling business is limited by the availability of rigs, many of which are being refurbished  after having been written off earlier as unusable Our people tell us that inventories remain in good  balance for the most part There is growing anecdotal evidence suggesting that continued strength  in investment spending is motivated more by the desire to cut costs and improve productivity than  the desire to increase capacity in anticipation of future growth In Alabama, where many small    9/30/97  towns dependent on apparel manufacturing have been hard hit in recent years as I have said at a  couple of meetings, we have seen a welcome influx of light manufacturing, especially electronics  and high-tech Much of that seems to be driven by the new southern auto industry in that part of  the country Residential construction in our area appears to be moving sideways rather than falling  off to some extent as we expected would occur by now Retail and industrial construction has  passed its peak, but office construction is still showing some acceleration in the Southeast Retail  sales were good in July but slowed again in August  No one is surprised that labor markets in our region remain tight, although I would not  characterize them as tighter than a year ago Perhaps that is because our growth was relatively  stronger early in this expansion An interesting story that matches some others comes from one of  our businessmen in a very small meter-reading business He said that he was having a very  difficult time recruiting young people with good driving records to run around the community and  read meters His solution was to hire two people in the place of one a retiree with a legitimate  driver's license and a good driving record who needed something to do and a young person with  good legs to do the running between the houses He said the experiment has worked quite well  This is an interesting way to get around the labor shortage in that area Despite tight labor markets,  we still are not hearing any reports of significant wage increases Retailers continue to tell us that  they expect to get no meaningful price increases over the next six months And while  manufacturers say that their margins continue to narrow at least a little, even small increases in  prices are tough to pass on, a now-familiar story  At the national level, we see the picture much the same as most of those who have  commented this morning higher-than-anticipated growth and lower-than-anticipated inflation  Like the Greenbook, we too expect economic growth to slow in the latter part of the year and into    9/30/97  1998, partly due to inventories but also reflecting moderation in the growth of investment spending  and in the contribution from exports We are not anticipating any significant new price pressures in  the near term, but we do expect an upward drift next year to the extent that energy prices increase  and we lose the moderating effect they have exerted this year  I am not looking at Ed Boehne's notes, but I too believe that we continue to be in a  period where we should allow ourselves to enjoy the happy combination of developments that have  occurred, even if we do not fully understand them My instincts, like almost everybody else's,  indicate that the risks are still somewhat on the upside and that we are still likely to need to tighten  at some later point down the road If I were more confident that the economy would play out as  laid out in the Greenbook, I would be beating the table for an early policy move I believe that  what probably has been at work is not just the good fortune of positive shocks but rather the more  subtle and hopefully more lasting effect of some years of good monetary policy and, in more recent  years, of better fiscal policy and expectations of more of the same I think there is at least a  reasonable chance we could continue to be happily surprised for a while longer Thank you, Mr  Chairman "
4707,1997-09-30," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
4751,1997-11-12," Mike, I may have misread the analysis in the Greenbook, but I got the  sense that you placed a great deal more importance on the wealth effect in your current forecast  for household consumption I compared that analysis to your earlier assessment of how much  the wealth effect would affect spending as the stock market rose sharply Is this simply a matter  of an asymmetrical response to a market correction downward as opposed to what you thought  the wealth effect would be when the market rose sharply? Is there some new work underlying  your current analysis or have I, in fact, just misread the importance that you attach to the wealth  effect in explaining a falloff in the growth of consumer spending?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Since the last meeting, the new data and  anecdotal information from our region seem to confirm that the Southeast is now settled into a  pace of economic growth that is very similar to that of the nation That is occurring after our  regional economy had led the nation for several years I suspect that experience colors our view  of the world, since we have watched our business people work through tight labor markets for  some years now  Retail sales in the region have been very uneven, but much of that seems attributable  to the change in the opening dates of schools and some unusual weather We talked to retailers  about the upcoming holiday season They now describe their outlook as one of cautious  optimism, and that is a retreat from the unguarded optimism that they were expressing in late  summer Manufacturing activity has slowed in the District Not surprisingly, apparel continues  to be the weakest segment According to our survey of manufacturing in the Southeast, which is  to be released tomorrow, production in October was little changed from September The backlog  of orders has risen for two consecutive months On the other hand, outlook indices for  shipments, new orders, and backlogs will be reported as having declined after large increases in  September The anecdotal reports that we had been getting prior to that survey were more  positive, with pulp, paper, and building materials leading the way and with extremely strong    11/12/97 66  reports from the aerospace and oil-related industries Speaking of oil, and building on what Bob  McTeer reported, oil and gas exploration continues to expand in Louisiana The already high rig  count rose somewhat more in October In fact, the pace of oil field leasing and exploration has  caused the day rental rates for rigs and service boats to increase by 50 percent over the last year  or so  Residential construction in the Southeast has now slowed somewhat, but there is a  noticeable shift in commercial construction from office and industrial structures toward retail  space Commercial space remains tight Tourism continues to be one of the District's strengths,  with tight bookings both for hotels and cruise ships District job growth was marginally less  strong than the national average in September I believe this is the first time job growth in our  region has been below the national average during this business expansion Wage and price  pressures remain modest, and expectations regarding future increases have not changed  significantly since the last meeting In fact, we have seen some easing of compensation  premiums in construction in some areas While the Southeast has lost jobs in the apparel  industry, the displaced workers have been able to move to higher-paying, although low-skilled,  jobs [Laughter] That is a true story!  Nationally, I see a continuation of the good growth we have observed in overall  employment and modest price movements Clearly, consumer spending is going to bear  watching, and I think it is yet to be seen how much the wealth effect or uncertainty concerning  financial markets will damp spending in the fourth quarter and beyond Our own reading of the  evidence sees somewhat less of a wealth effect behind consumer spending than is reflected in the  Greenbook and hence less sensitivity to stock market changes over the forecast period    11/12/97 67  Investment spending has remained stronger than I expected, but anecdotal reports link more of  that spending to projects that substitute capital for labor, motivated specifically by the rise in  labor costs rather than the anticipation of increases in productivity or sales One would probably  expect to see this pattern when labor markets are tight and labor remains relatively more  expensive than other inputs To the extent this investment pattern is widespread, we may see  stronger investment spending for a while longer than might be suggested by the capacity  utilization numbers and commensurately greater GDP growth in the near term than might  otherwise be the case  On the inflation front, I see the outlook for prices, as measured by the implicit GDP  deflator, about the same as the Greenbook, but that is without assuming a 75 basis point increase  in the funds rate and without a major stock market correction While I feel strongly that we  should not lose the inflation gains that have been made, I am not quite as certain as the  Greenbook that we are on an imminently inflationary path I see little hard evidence to date that  this is the case or that immediate and aggressive policy actions are necessarily needed to get us  back on path Indeed, the forecasts of the broader indices of inflation show less acceleration than  does the CPI The CPI, we have to remember, reflects the effects of the energy price swings in  1996 and 1997, which lowered the CPI earlier during that period, leading to greater projected  relative upticks going forward  Of course, any judgment on the probability of deterioration in inflation depends on an  assessment of the current stance of policy While the monetary aggregates have been somewhat  expansionary over the past two years, the evidence for the past couple of months is that growth  of the aggregates has declined somewhat Moreover, real interest rates, as we interpret them, do    11/12/97 68  not seem unusually expansionary, at least by historic standards, nor is this signaled in the  exchange rate movements With policy not accommodative, the individual price movements,  including wages, should be viewed as relative price changes that need not necessarily feed  through to higher price inflation  As has been discussed this morning, the wild card in the economy at this time is, in  fact, the volatility in the financial markets worldwide Our own estimate, done before we got the  Board staff's work, also suggests a 02 to 03 percent markdown of real GDP growth I remain  concerned, as does Cathy Minehan I believe because she explored this risk to the expansion  when she questioned Ted Truman about the secondary spillover effects, especially from Japan  Less well publicized, even in Japan, until the last couple of days has been the pressure on the  Brazilian and Argentine currency and equity markets I believe the Brazilian market actually has  declined more than the Hong Kong market over the last four or five weeks This point was  driven home to me last week when I had a visit from Argentina's ambassador to the United  States Should there be significant problems in Brazil, the fact that over 30 percent of  Argentina's exports are to Brazil could put additional pressure on the Argentine economy I see  the risks not only in how much our real GDP growth may be marked down, but also in the  possibility that the United States will have to step in and support the economies of one or another  of those countries Mr Chairman, these are certainly interesting times Thank you very much "
4752,1997-11-12," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I agree with those  who say we have not given up terribly much today by allowing ourselves a little more time "
4806,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Sixth District economy continues to  expand at a moderate rate Tourism remains a real strength for us, with flights to Florida already  booked up earlier and faster than last year and with above-average attendance at tourist  attractions for the holiday period In particular, the influx of tourists from Latin America is  reportedly boosting retail sales in south Florida Hotels, car rental companies, cruise lines--all  indicate that current and advanced bookings are strong Similar patterns prevail along the  Mississippi and the Gulf Coast Production and new manufacturing orders have declined  somewhat recently in our area, according to both anecdotal evidence as well as our December    12/16/97 34  regional manufacturing survey However, expectations are for a pickup in both production and  new orders looking six months out Not unexpectedly, orders for textiles and apparel are  reported to be declining Also, the rig count in the Gulf slipped back a tad in the last month  The picture for housing has changed very little since the last FOMC meeting Home  sales remain mixed, and housing inventories are reported to be in good shape Single-family  home construction has been essentially flat and multifamily construction has begun to slacken  Occupancy rates are expected to stabilize by the first of the year As was the case at the time of  our last meeting, commercial real estate markets remain healthy, as evidenced by increases in  both occupancy and rental rates However, the industrial real estate sector has shown some signs  of a slowdown Overall, both developers and real estate agents remain optimistic about the  period immediately ahead  With regard to the now familiar story that everybody is talking about, labor markets in  our area remain tight Reports of wage increases have been occurring with some greater  frequency recently In certain hot areas like Atlanta, finders fees are being offered to employees  who recruit family and friends Overall, however, prices generally are remaining steady There  are scattered reports, some coming from our District manufacturing survey, of a slight rise in  materials prices  The impact of Asian problems on our region does not appear to have been great to  date Like President Parry, we have reports of citrus shipments, mainly grapefruit, that are either  being cancelled or are down considerably, especially to Japan Port contacts in both Miami and  New Orleans report some decline in the overall volume of shipments to Asia, while the port of  Savannah indicates a slight reduction in shipments of wood pulp The big Georgia Pacific    12/16/97 35  Company states that it has seen some slowing in shipments of pulp and paper to the Pacific rim,  but the company had expected a seasonal slowdown in any case  As for the national economy, the consumer sector is a little stronger than we expected  at the time of the last FOMC meeting Because of the deepening difficulties in Asia, the foreign  sector has been a bit weaker than we anticipated Business investment spending has been  maintained at strong levels longer than we had forecast I continue to be heartened by the good  balance we continue to see in the economy and the fact that inflation remains moderate and is  showing a slight downward trend  Four developments have led us to modify our projections the stronger-than-expected  November employment report, the decline in energy prices, the surprising upward revisions to  rates of growth in industrial capacity, and the view that the weakness in Asian economies may be  greater than initially was thought As a result, we project the consumer sector to be somewhat  stronger, the international trade sector somewhat weaker, and capacity utilization somewhat  lower, with inflation marginally more subdued in the near term Both our judgmental forecast  and our VAR policy model suggest that real GDP growth will be a bit smoother than that  reflected in the Greenbook, with near-term growth being somewhat lower and longer-term  growth somewhat stronger but with an inflation path closer to the Greenbook alternative with no  stock market decline Indeed, our VAR model, which does not consider the effects of the Asian  flu, implies that if one wanted to hold the rate of inflation at about current levels, a small  temporary increase in the federal funds rate would be necessary sometime next year  Considering that to be a warning signal and in light of my desire not to lose the gains we have  had in bringing inflation to its current level, I regard the likely drag that the Asian problems    12/16/97 36  imply for the economy as equivalent to a slight policy tightening, but with a more immediate  short-run impact on the real economy, an outcome that seems desirable at this time Projected  results should take some of the heat off both production and labor markets and may even have  the desirable effect of taking inflation down another notch Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4807,1997-12-16," Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation for no change this  morning After trying to sort out the crosscurrents we have discussed in the last three and a half  hours, I still have the sense that the Asian shock represents something of a substitute for a  modest policy move I, too, could support a symmetric directive, but on balance I would be a  little more comfortable with an asymmetric directive for a while longer to make sure that the  strength in the domestic economy is not overwhelming the drag we are getting from  international developments But, again, I can support a ""B"" symmetric directive "
4856,1998-02-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman Over the past year, the performance of  the Sixth District economy generally has paralleled that of the nation, and with few  exceptions that continues to be the picture that we see Today, rather than run through a  detailed commentary sector by sector, I thought I would concentrate my remarks on a few  important differences and concerns that I have begun to note  First, the Asian situation has had only a marginal impact on our District so far  Shipments to Asia have moderated, especially shipments of fertilizer, pulp, paper, and  citrus A large chemical company in our region experienced some cancellations of  shipments to Asia but reportedly was relieved because it was unable to meet those    2/3-4/98  shipments anyway due to a lack of available rail cars People in our aerospace and  defense industries also have begun to express concerns about potential declines in orders  from the Asian part of the world At the same time, some interesting asymmetries are  appearing One shipper reported recently that his firm had added capacity in anticipation  of increased trade with Latin America, but the firm had to divert that capacity to meet its  customers' demand for more shipping to bring imports from Asia to the United States  Finally, doing business in Asia is clearly more difficult for District firms The owner of  an upscale retail sunglass chain with over 2,000 outlets, including 19 in Asia, reports that  his Asian sales are off some 70 to 80 percent The bottom line for the District is that the  overall effects from Asia have been minimal so far, with declines in our region's exports  to Asia mitigated by stable growth of exports to Latin America  Second, after their recent decline, prices of oil and natural gas are now  approaching their historic break-even levels that in the past would have caused domestic  drilling and extraction to begin to shut down However, we see no evidence of that  pattern this time around, and in fact the rig count remains at very high levels The new  drilling technologies that I talked about in past meetings have truly brought break-even  prices to much lower levels Hence, we don't expect to see the slowing in that sector that  we would have in past cycles  Third, real estate activity, especially residential, is more mixed in our region than  appears to be the case nationwide Commercial construction is strong, especially in  grocery and class A office space, and this should balance the weakness we are seeing in  residential construction One cautionary note, however, is that I am starting to get    2/3-4/98  numerous expressions of concern that pockets of excessively speculative commercial  construction are emerging, notably in the north Atlanta market  Fourth, we are getting mixed signals from lenders Consistent with the loan  officers' survey, credit still seems to be available and competition is fierce When lenders  are asked whether credit standards are slipping, the response is generally no, but lenders  then go on to say that because of competition they are apt to grant loans at lower rates  than in the past This seeming disconnect between their perception of the links between  credit standards and pricing for risk is something we should be concerned about  Fifth, with respect to wages and prices, like everyone else we continue to get  reports of labor shortages, and firms are either going to great lengths to hire qualified  workers or they are curtailing production For example, shipbuilders in New Orleans are  resorting to hiring workers from overseas to fill the need for welders, shipfitters, and  other workers One national trucking executive reported idling 10 percent of his  equipment because he has not been able to find qualified drivers Despite such problems,  however, wage increases in our region appear to have been held to moderate levels, and  this also appears to be the case with prices In our most recent manufacturing survey, the  portion of firms reporting that they are paying higher prices for materials decreased, as  did the proportion of firms indicating that they received higher prices for finished goods  At the national level, we see an economy that continues to ""hum along"" with few,  if any, of the signs of slowing that many of us have been forecasting for several meetings  now However, as others have observed, I do not believe that we have yet seen much of  the slowing effects from the Asian problems and what they hold for the United States Of  course, the threshold question is how great the negative impact eventually will be It does    2/3-4/98  seem clear that the Asian shock will forestall the need for any policy tightening move in  the short run Clearly, the economy will not continue to get the boost to GDP from net  exports that the recently released report suggests we got in the fourth quarter  Stepping back, it does seem to me that the risks to any forecast have changed in  two respects since our last meeting They have gotten more symmetric and they have  gotten greater I guess one could say the distribution of risks now has fatter tails than it  did the last time we were together For me, the wild cards continue to be related to Asia,  the consumer, and investment spending While one certainly can argue that all these  sectors will slow in coming quarters, there is also a significant probability that all may not  slow For example, it isn't difficult to anticipate that the increased disposable income  that households may generate by refinancing their mortgages to take advantage of lower  interest rates will stimulate and help maintain consumer spending Similarly, the reports  we get are that much of the recent surge in investment spending is motivated by the desire  of US businesses to cut costs so as to maintain profit margins in the face of competition  from lower import prices Clearly, this downward pressure on prices will continue as a  result of the Asian crisis, and this could help maintain investment spending at higher  levels than would otherwise be expected  Finally, of course, as others have suggested, the impact from Asia may prove to be  either substantially more severe or substantially less severe than our most likely scenario  indicates On balance, as I hope my comments have suggested, I think we continue to be  in a period of very satisfactory economic performance, but one where the range of  potential outcomes is even wider and more uncertain than when we last met While the  Asian shock and its fallout may give us significant slowing in the economy's expansion    2/3-4/98  and a further respite from price pressures, I think it is equally likely that we may find  ourselves by late fall or early winter of this year with almost the same set of policy  questions that we faced in November and December of last year Until we see the Asian  effects play out, I would say again that I hope we can allow ourselves to enjoy the  moment and use this period of time to talk out our long-term policy preferences We  should continue to make the point that low inflation is also pro-growth and  pro-employment, and that is something that not only central bankers should get excited  about Thank you, Mr Chairman   I am fine with alternative I also I actually came to this meeting  with a willingness to change the M3 range if that would make people comfortable But I  think the wisdom of leaving it alone and not calling attention to the aggregates probably  still is the prevailing view, and that would be my thought    2/3-4/98 "
4857,1998-02-03," Don, what can you say about the GDP path associated with your  first long-run alternative? What kind of output loss is associated with that path to virtual  price stability?   One can do the mental calculations   It comes very close   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
4906,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would characterize the overall growth of  our region's economy as moderate, at least by our District's standards, in that growth in our  region has fallen back to national trends in the last several quarters after leading the nation  through the early years of this expansion With a couple of notable exceptions, I currently see  few signs of imbalances in our regional economy  Housing activity continues to be mixed but at a high level, with increases in sales of  single-family homes offset to a substantial extent by declines throughout the region in the  multifamily sector We have generally healthy commercial real estate markets, but to repeat a  comment that I made at the last two meetings, I continue to see some worrisome signs of  speculative commercial development in Atlanta Planned expansions in Atlanta are estimated to  be about double the current absorption rate for the coming year I would emphasize that this real  estate activity is concentrated in Atlanta and is not representative of the region as a whole  Nonetheless, it is a development that I think I need to continue to watch  Tourism in our major tourist centers is very strong One measure of just how strong is  the unavailability of airline seats on most flights into Florida, where hotel and cruise ship  bookings are quite heavy into the future    3/31/98  Like others on the Committee, I continue to look hard for signs that the Asian  problems are affecting our regional economy One piece of tangible evidence shows up in our  District's pulp paper industry Two pulp paper companies in Alabama were forced to shut down  for two weeks About two-thirds of their hardwood output and about one-half of their softwood  output is sold to Asian customers Pulp obviously is a volatile industry and periodic shutdowns  are not unusual, but this is the first attributable to developments in Asia Beyond this, there are  as best I can tell only fragmentary reports so far that individual companies have been adversely  affected In the aggregate, the reported Asian impact in our region appears to be negligible at  this time  It is also becoming clear that there are both positive and negative impacts on the  domestic economy from Asia A positive example comes from one of our directors who builds  roof trusses for houses and small commercial buildings He reports that because of the very wet  weather, it has been nearly impossible for heavy equipment to get into southern forests to harvest  southern yellow pine, and the price of such lumber has increased significantly However, the  price run-up of pine lumber resulting from the supply squeeze has been muted by the influx of  West Coast spruce and fir The drop-off in demand from Asia for that West Coast lumber and its  diversion to our region has come with price cuts of about 25 percent  Lastly, as far as the region is concerned, I would be remiss if I did not add our  perspective to the current availability and cost of labor To no one's surprise, labor markets in  our area also remain tight and continue to press employers to look even harder for opportunities  to substitute capital for scarce labor To add one more story of productivity gains, on a swing I  made through north Alabama two weeks ago, who manages an agricultural  conglomerate told me about a new piece of equipment The equipment is configured so as to    3/31/98  allow each pass of the equipment through the fields to till or harvest 12 rows instead of the  previous 10, a very appreciable increase in productivity, part of the resulting  savings was retained by and part was used to raise the hourly wages of the workers by  about 15 percent I continue to get similar reports from almost every industry contact that I talk  to It is clear that efforts to achieve productivity gains are still meeting with some success  As far as the national outlook is concerned, our judgmental forecast is extremely close  to the Greenbook's this time and similar to others that already have been laid out around the  table I agree that the near-term outlook is good to excellent Given this agreement on the near  term and the lack of immediate policy action that it seems to suggest, our focus should continue  to be on the longer term over which many forecasts have inflation rising after 1999 Here we  must acknowledge that we have tended to over-forecast inflation and under-forecast growth  during this decade Speaking for myself, this is the type of error I can live with if it does not lead  us into policy missteps, which I think we have avoided so far Still, seeing the past pattern of  forecast errors, I am concerned that we may be lulled into discounting the current inflation  forecast too much and risk waiting too long before the required policy move is made  I suspect that many forecasts implicitly assume that the FOMC will behave as it has  in the past, and if we do, I think inflation certainly should be expected to rise Our Atlanta  baseline model forecast explicitly assumes that we will behave as in the past, and it indicates that  on average we have tended to ease policy when growth was in the range we are now forecasting  for a substantial period ahead and when inflation was low and falling The model shows that  later, but not much later, inflation has tended to accelerate, demonstrating the kind of policy  mistake we need to guard against    3/31/98  I think this history cautions us to be leery of suggestions that the recent low inflation,  whatever the source, provides an opportunity to ease policy This leads me back to thinking  about how much to discount the current inflation forecasts, which tend to show an acceleration  several years down the road, something almost all of us have said we find unacceptable Our  model suggests that if we stick to our current policy position and do not repeat the pattern of  easing when growth seems to be slowing and inflation to be declining, then I think we can  comfortably discount the forecast of worsening inflation It is for those reasons that I think we  can afford to wait for a while to see if the disruptions in the real economy do or do not  materialize Thank you "
4907,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, support your recommendation and I  am pleased with the return to asymmetry I take heart, as I guess everyone else does, from our  resolve not to wait too long  Just to finish that thought, I guess it is obvious in what has been said by Bill Poole,  Gary Stern, and others that not only do we not have a way to signal our move to asymmetry  today, but the minutes that will come out in a couple of days will show us in a symmetrical  stance at the February meeting This development seems to cry out for some kind of mechanism  to correct what I think will be a misimpression that we would prefer not to give in the next  couple of days  SPEAKER(?) That's right "
4958,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman On balance, the pace of expansion in our  Southeast region appears to have accelerated somewhat since our last meeting Retail sales that  were soft in March picked up throughout the region in April Manufacturing, which was exhibiting  some slowing seven weeks ago, has come back strongly as measured by production and shipment  data reported in our latest regional survey Our aerospace and defense sector has been boosted by  several important new contracts involving General Dynamics in Tallahassee, Pratt & Whitney in  Palm Beach, and Boeing in Huntsville Somewhat offsetting those areas of strength and adding to  Bob McTeer's comments, the drop in oil prices has resulted in some contraction in onshore drilling  activity, and orders for onshore drilling supplies are reported to be off some 20 to 30 percent  Offshore drilling has been less affected Also, the record-breaking bookings at our regional tourist  attractions have come down from their earlier blistering pace But new attractions are coming on  line, like Disney's new Animal Kingdom, and are expected to keep tourist spending at high levels  Commercial real estate activity remains healthy, but we continue to watch for signs that undesirable    5/19/98  speculative activity is beginning to emerge Other than pockets in Atlanta and perhaps too much of  a good thing in a couple of Florida markets, we do not detect such problems There continue to be  reports, as Al Broaddus suggested, from various sources of large amounts of money looking for  deals Although we hear hints of relaxed lending standards, they always involve the other lender  and our examiners have not yet uncovered any serious problems  The interesting stories about coping with tight labor markets continue At an earlier  meeting, I reported on a Tennessee trucking firm that had idled 10 percent of its fleet for lack of  drivers Over this past period, we have been told that Wal-Mart has postponed some plans for  expansion in south Florida for lack of workers There is a shortage of some 8,000 welders in the  Louisiana oil patch and 2,000 more at the Avondale shipyards in New Orleans Consequently,  ship-building and steel structure manufacturing schedules are being pushed out substantially The  oil exploration slowdown should help relieve that bottleneck a little I find it interesting that these  firms in large measure are passing up the opportunity to expand output rather than bid up wages  and erode their margins In a related development, reported that the hospital  said ""no thank you"" to a major health care provider that was demanding still more  cost concessions Generally across our region, unusually large wage increases continue to be  primarily in certain skills  Finally, the Asian effect watch still is not uncovering any significant, negative effects  in our area There are modest losses of business in various industries The hardest hit by far is the  pulp and paper business A number of paper plants have shut down for several weeks to adjust  production One plant in Georgia with a large volume of Asian business is contemplating shutting  down permanently In addition, the port of Baton Rouge saw its tonnage go down 50 percent in    5/19/98  March compared to a year ago and much of that was lost pulp and paper shipments All sectors and  all geographic areas considered, our region continues to exhibit good growth and good balance  Turning to my views on the national economy, as everyone else has observed, we find  ourselves with a rate of growth that is measurably stronger than all of us expected Strength in the  first quarter, especially with the upward revisions we expect, was well beyond what I was looking  for Aggregate demand remains strong and the sectors where I have been looking for some  slowing--consumer spending, housing, and business fixed investment--have not fallen back as I  expected Had it not been for the drag from net exports, we would have blown the doors off, as the  kids say The Greenbook and my own staff's forecast once again lay out the rationale for some  slowing Should that materialize, it seems likely to produce an inflation path with little or no  upward movement I would find it acceptable to maintain a core rate of inflation near the one we  have been experiencing  My personal judgment as to what lies ahead is tempered, however, by our virtually  consistent underestimate of growth in recent times I also am influenced by the sense that I get  from talking with directors, a member of my Small Business Advisory Council, and others around  the region That sense generally is one of ""damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead"" Given the high  levels of confidence, continued low levels of interest rates, and readily available credit, I conclude  that the probability of getting the slowing that we have in our forecast is not as high as we would  like, at least not without a modestly more restrictive monetary policy Among the people I talk  with, I sense stronger and stronger support for a low inflation monetary policy While we have  heard a lot of voices recently suggesting that we leave well enough alone, I think a preemptive  move based on our best forecast and judgment would reinforce our commitment to price stability  It would come to be accepted as prudent, forward-looking policy Thank you, Mr Chairman    5/19/98 "
4959,1998-05-19," Mr Chairman, my view is that the sky probably is not falling yet  Certainly, there is some probability that we can slip by without a tightening of policy, but the odds  appear to be growing on the other side With all the comments I heard in the first go-around, I  think I identify most vividly with Bill Poole's assertion that inflation expectations, while subdued,  are fragile and that people really are counting on us to do the right thing, even if they squeal and  holler at the time we do it Although I feel that we should tighten today based on domestic  considerations, I certainly defer to you and others who can better judge how much weight to give  the fragile international situation Having said that, I come back to your reminder that that means    5/19/98  we may well have to do more later I presume it is our judgment that the international situation is  likely to be more settled and less fragile at the time of the next meeting or perhaps two or three  meetings down the road and that it will then be able to cope with a more aggressive US monetary  policy move if that becomes desirable at that time I support your recommendation and the  asymmetrical directive "
5014,1998-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would join those of you who argue  against making any changes in the current ranges Presidents Minehan and Poole made the  arguments the way I probably would have made them I will repeat only one of those arguments,  and that is that I do not see anything about the current construct that takes away our ability to  give whatever weight we wish to give to the aggregates we have selected for our ranges In fact,  I would argue that having money growth trending above what we consider to be the price  stability ranges keeps the issue in front of us to a greater extent than would adjusting ranges to fit  experience So, I very strongly prefer retaining the current monetary growth ranges, and I would  not tinker at the current time with the range for debt Thank you "
5015,1998-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Sixth District economy is still  operating at a high level, but recent growth appears to have been slightly slower than that I  reported at the last FOMC meeting Retail sales have posted only modest gains above those of a  year ago, while the stories on manufacturing are mixed, with strong reports from some areas and  problems from others For example, layoffs at Motorola are expected to have an impact on  employment in Huntsville, Alabama and at two plants in Florida, and prospects are gloomy at a  Nissan auto assembly plant in Tennessee The GM strike has already idled 5,000 autoworkers  across our District, and a report last week from  was very pessimistic about the likelihood of a  prompt settlement Building on what Cathy Minehan said, other signs of labor activism are  showing up negotiations are going on at Bell South, where wages are a very big issue, and at  Lucent Technologies, where benefits and job security are highest on the list of issues  Housing activity continues at a strong pace in the District, with single-family home  construction and sales being the strongest The only area of softness is in Louisiana One sign  of how strongly the tourism industry in the District is affecting housing markets is illustrated by  a report from one of our directors at a recent meeting He indicated that entire single-family  home developments are being built in Florida and sold with the idea that the homes will be  rented for a week or month or more to tourists Office markets remain healthy while multifamily  construction, which we thought had peaked, now appears not to have done so and is certainly  doing better than we expected Nevertheless, with the exception of Orlando, we continue to  believe that most of the big cities in the District are on the verge of being overbuilt At the last  meeting, I indicated that the torrid pace of tourism, one of our region's major engines of growth,    6/30-7/1/98  had slowed a bit But as new attractions have come on line in Orlando, we have seen some  rebound in tourism  On the wage and price front, the stories seem to be much the same Unusually large  wage increases remain tightly targeted on just those fields where scarce skills are in high  demand, and firms are continuing to report a determination to resist raising prices With labor  markets tight and perhaps even a tad tighter in recent months, I am hearing more reports of hiring  bonuses, retention bonuses, and other one-time compensation increases Like others, I am  hearing increasing talk of companies adding benefits Small companies are adding  hospitalization; large and small companies are adding childcare benefits It is not clear to me to  what extent those nonwage benefits may have found their way into the traditional measure of  overall compensation costs  Not to be outdone, I have brought along with me a copy of an Atlanta newspaper from  last week that tells my favorite tight labor market story for June It was reported that a small  high-tech firm in suburban Atlanta had just leased a BMW for every one of its 40 employees,  from the receptionist to the programmers, as an added inducement for people to stay with the  company It is reported that they are even paying for the auto insurance to go with the BMW  SPEAKER(?) How long is the lease?   I'm not sure [Laughter]   As long as they stay On the national front, like others, I see an  economy that is divided into two very divergent sectors the international sector, which is  looking weaker and weaker, and a strong domestic economy, where growth was paced in the first  quarter by robust gains in consumer spending, business investment, and inventory expansion It    6/30-7/1/98  seems to me that there is little one can do directly with monetary policy to affect the international  sector After taking account of the damping effect it is having on overall domestic real growth, I  would argue that we should not allow international developments to divert attention unduly away  from any developing imbalances in the domestic economy Fortunately, I don't believe that is  happening, at least not yet To be sure, consumer spending continues to pace the domestic  economy Last Friday's spending and income numbers continue to suggest that the consumer is  not yet spending beyond his means Consumer debt burdens remain somewhat high, as do  bankruptcies, but appear to be manageable so far Corporate profits remain strong, increasing  but at a decreasing rate Whether this will damp investment and whether the recent buildup in  inventories is planned or unanticipated continue to be key questions in my mind  Our forecast for the next two years is similar to that in the Greenbook and to many  other forecasts Like the Greenbook, though with some difference in composition, we see some  slowing in coming quarters due primarily to a slackening in investment spending and a pullback  in inventory spending We see consumer expenditures remaining strong We anticipate that  inflationary pressures will be modest over the forecast period, with the expected pickup in  inflation being due primarily to an unwinding of the favorable effects that recent declines in  energy prices have had on prices rather than a surge in underlying inflationary pressures To be  sure, the risks to this forecast, as others have said, are different depending on whether one looks  at the domestic or the international components Clearly, as Peter Fisher has laid out and others  have commented, problems in Japan and elsewhere in Asia could worsen significantly and the  ripple effects could be quite alarming However, I think the risks to the domestic economy  remain on the upside In my view, it would be premature to take down the caution flag in that    6/30-7/1/98  area quite yet We have continually been surprised by the strength in investment and consumer  spending, and those patterns could well continue for some time Thank you, Mr Chairman "
5016,1998-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman Your comments and those of others this  morning and in yesterday's discussion certainly have reinforced my sense that we are seeing  some signs of a slowing expansion and can identify some new, larger downside risks than we  could at the time of the last meeting At the same time the slowing in coming quarters that most  of us are forecasting for the domestic economy is far from certain in my mind Moderating  developments have been in our forecasts for a long time without materializing If we continue to  get the kind of strength we have been experiencing along with other indications that policy may  be too accommodating, obviously I too would be concerned that we are taking too great a risk of  an uptick in inflation Until we get more confirmation of the direction in some key sectors of the  domestic economy, I also would be more comfortable with an asymmetrical directive It would  continue to serve both as a reminder to us of the upside risks in the economy and as a signal to  others that we are not interested in giving back any of the ground that we have gained on  inflation over time Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have been the beneficiary for many years  of the wisdom and experience of Ed Boehne and Mike Kelley, and it is with some uneasiness  that I come out on the other side on this issue I am most comfortable with the kinds of  comments that Al Broaddus and Bob Parry made for the following reasons First of all, I would  agree with Alice Rivlin that at the minimum we certainly should be able to find a way to redefine  and recast the language relating to the tilt We did it in the first sentence of the operational  paragraph relating to the federal funds rate, and I have to believe that somebody can in fact win  that Nobel prize We should try again  Second, I guess the unspoken assumption is that there is no turning back once we  liberalize our disclosure policy We will be stuck with whatever additional disclosures we go to  I just mention that because I do not think anybody has focused on this explicitly  I also start with an underlying bias that more transparency and more information are  better than less I would argue that serious observers in financial markets and elsewhere of our  policymaking are sophisticated enough to understand the nuances when we announce the tilt and  they also are able to interpret changes in the economy between the announcements just as we  have to  The other argument that I would underscore without repeating all of it is that  announcing the tilt would avoid the misinformation that spread just a couple of meetings ago I  believe that is going to happen again It was most unfortunate at the time We all struggle with  how to deal with misinformation, and I think that avoiding it is worth something I think David    6/30-7/1/98  Clementi's comments last night suggest that the Bank of England's early experience with  delayed information has given them the same type of problem So, announcing our decisions  does in my view avoid the risk of what I call ""slips,"" not ""leaks"" I would prefer to put a more  charitable spin on that and assume that we simply from time to time may say something we  wished we had not That cannot happen if we already have made the announcement  I also agree with the comment that any small step we can take that reduces the sense of  secrecy that surrounds our activities is in our long-term interest as an organization We simply  need to move a little further in that direction I don't believe we can make these announcements  on an ad hoc basis at one meeting and not at another I think it has to be a routine that we use for  every meeting The cleanest and simplest way would in fact be to release the operational  paragraph of the directive It takes care of announcing the tilt and it also accommodates Al  Broaddus's proposal to announce our fed funds target at every meeting, not just when we have  changed it This is not a ""slam dunk"" issue, but I have a modest preference to come out on that  side of it Thank you, Mr Chairman "
5075,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman Because the Sixth District economy is little  changed since our last meeting, I will try to keep my remarks shorter than usual this morning  Over the summer, the Sixth District has continued its steady but modest expansion Retailers  expect sales growth to persist, and a significant number of new plant announcements bode well  for capital spending There have been some recent signs of slowing in our regional manufacturing  sector They showed up in the decline in our latest index of manufacturing activity and in, as  expected, the export orders component This information, which came in after the Beigebook was  prepared, is supported by anecdotal evidence However, the overall prospects going forward are  for the Southeast economy to continue to operate at a high level I see the outlook for growth in  our area as only slightly less positive than at the time of the last FOMC meeting  A number of special negative factors in the District have received a lot of nationwide  publicity, but in fact they have had no appreciable impact on the overall level of regional  economic activity It is true that the drought has caused substantial losses in farm receipts in our  District, but our agriculture sector has become a much less important part of our regional  economy, the sort of development that Bob Mcteer indicated also has occurred in Texas The  fires in Florida caused a temporary slowdown in the state's important tourism industry However,  the losses from postponing the Daytona 400 stock car race because of smoke from fires are greater  than all the other losses due to drought and fires in the region The only other noteworthy  intelligence, and this also has been commented on by Bob McTeer and Gary Stern, is that we are  receiving an increasing number of reports of significant increases in wages and benefits  However, there is still no indication that companies are able to pass those higher costs on to their  customers    8/18/98  On the national front, it seems to me that the overall risks to the forecast have  increased, as almost everyone has commented The uncertainties relating to the net drag from the  international sector, particularly Asia and Russia, are being realized and are proving to be more  negative than expected However, and again I join others in making this comment, the strength of  domestic demand based on continued strong growth of income and employment and what now  appears to be considerable momentum in domestic consumption and investment are important  sources of upside risk to the inflation picture  The recently released revisions to GDP by BEA have impacted our forecast to a greater  extent than recent market developments They have caused us to raise slightly our forecasts of  sustainable economic growth, personal consumption, and investment, and they leave me  marginally less concerned that the past pattern of growth in the monetary aggregates will be  translated into future inflation Our real GDP growth forecast for the rest of this year is slightly  more optimistic than that in the Greenbook Furthermore, there are other differences in the  forecast They relate to the extent to which the hypothetical risks that I mentioned previously will  be realized In that regard, they are mainly that we see less of a decline in business investment  and consumer demand than the Greenbook As a consequence, we are slightly more pessimistic  about the inflation outlook  Finally, I continue to believe that policy is not seriously out of line, nor is it allowing  inflation to accelerate though we are predicting a slightly worse inflation performance over the  second half of 1998 and into 1999 Most of the price acceleration that we project reflects the  expected reversal in the previously favorable behavior of energy prices Having said that,  however, I do believe that the overall inflation risks continue to be slightly more on the upside and  that now is not the time for us to relax or to let the depressing effects of the international sector    8/18/98  divert our attention from the projected strength in the domestic economy or our ultimate goal of a  stable, low inflation environment Thank you, Mr Chairman "
5076,1998-08-18," I prefer alternative B as well I am at the same place as Governor  Kelley I have a slight preference for continuing the asymmetrical directive, at least for a while  longer It seems to me that given the extraordinary visibility and publicity of the Asian and  Russian problems, we could give too much weight today to those issues before we have some  greater assurance that domestic final demand will slow to a pace that is consistent with no  deterioration in inflation I also have some concern about the confusing signal effect of our  delayed announcement of the symmetry in the directive, and I would feel more comfortable with  moving to a symmetrical directive today if we were on a regime of announcing that decision  promptly after each meeting However, I do not feel strongly about the symmetry issue "
5130,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, I share Tom Hoenig's views pretty much down the  line I come to this, as I said last time, with a sense that the more information we can put out  promptly, the better The more quickly markets react, the more the policy uncertainty premiums    9/29/98  that might otherwise get built into markets are reduced So, I would favor both announcing the  tilt immediately after each meeting and releasing the minutes sooner   I think it is important as we continue this discussion to be sure that we  all have the same objectives In my view, the first and foremost objective is to make our intent  clear I think the staff does a really nice job on page 2 of their memo where they express their  sense of what we mean by the tilt, namely that it reflects the Committee's thinking about the  balance of risks That is my current understanding of the primary reason for the tilt language I  believe the secondary intent is to continue the practice of giving the Chairman the authority to  act for the Committee in extraordinary circumstances I assume those are the two things we are  trying to accomplish  I do not think that announcing the tilt would have a negative effect on the Committee's  discussion, although that is an issue raised in the staff memo In fact, I would argue that it might  even strengthen the discussion in that those who favored action at a meeting when none was  taken would at least have the benefit of the tilt being announced immediately, with whatever  effect that might have on the market I also am satisfied that Fed watchers and others who pay  attention to the tilt are smart enough to realize that circumstances may change as events unfold  after a meeting Thus, they will not expect our next action always to be in the direction of a tilt  I also share Tom Hoenig's view on releasing the minutes I assume that we should be  able to publish the minutes sooner than a few days before the next meeting as suggested in the  staff memo Since the minutes elaborate on the reasoning behind the tilt, I think the sooner we    9/29/98  release them, the better we are served I also share Tom's preference for simpler language on the  tilt, and I would incorporate the simpler language in the staff memo with the changes that Tom  suggested I also would reword the lead sentence to indicate that the Committee seeks conditions  in reserve markets that are consistent with its mandate to foster longer-run price stability and  sustained economic growth  Finally, I wonder whether we should consider dropping the last sentence of the  operating paragraph, which references growth in M2 and M3 That sentence may suggest that  the Committee has those aggregates as a policy objective, and I question whether it is relevant in  terms of the way we currently conduct policy However, this may be an issue that we don't want  to open at this time   I accept that! Thank you, Mr Chairman "
5131,1998-09-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman In one sense, it is difficult to find much of  significance that has changed in the Sixth District since the July and August meetings Our  District's economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, but with signs of some modest  slowing Indications of some slowing showed up in the manufacturing survey where production  slumped in August and fewer respondents indicated that they expect new orders or production to  rise in coming months Single-family home sales in our area are slightly weaker than this time a  year ago, and the multifamily sector now seems to have passed its peak Our commercial real  estate sector remains quite healthy, but for the first time in this cycle our examiners report that  some caution is being exercised by commercial real estate developers, largely attributed to a  pullback by the REITs as sources of financing  As a couple of other members already have indicated, perhaps the most noticeable  development over the intermeeting period has been a decided shift in confidence and growing  unease about the future; I see that among almost all my business contacts The spread of world  problems to Latin America, which is much more important economically to our region than is    9/29/98  Asia, clearly has heightened concerns We still can find only pockets of activity that have been  affected thus far by international crises Hardest hit have been pulp and paper forest products  and the energy sector Echoing Bob McTeer's comments, the lower oil and gas prices have  discouraged drilling The Louisiana rig count declined to 170 in August, down from 184 in July  and a little over 200 a year ago Some producers are telling us that they are now shutting down  production to wait for higher prices; they argue that oil is worth more in the ground right now  International trade winds are helping some and hurting others in our District A Mississippi  chicken producer reports that the collapse of the Russian financial markets has devastated  poultry exports and disrupted shipments of 70,000 to 80,000 tons of frozen chickens; these will  now be dumped on the domestic market with commensurate implications for domestic poultry  prices Ironically on the positive side, tobacco products are doing well Cigarette demand  abroad apparently is holding strong despite weakening economies The Brown and Williamson  Tobacco Company is planning a $500 million expansion in Macon, Georgia and indicates that  nearly half of that production will be supported by foreign demand  Looking forward, we expect more of the same in our District's economy We  anticipate a modest deceleration in the rate of growth, albeit from a relatively high base One  sector of our economy that may be vulnerable is tourism While it has been quite strong and is  not yet showing any significant falloff in future bookings, visitors from South America are an  important part of that business and problems in that region are likely to begin to show through  We still are not seeing significant signs of price pressures Our manufacturing survey indexes  for prices of materials remain negative for the fifth month in a row, but we now are picking up  more incidents of escalating wage costs due to continued tightness in labor markets Whereas  wage increases were in the 0 to 4 percent range earlier, our contacts now report them to be in the    9/29/98  4+ percent area for many companies However, there is no inication that the higher wages are  being passed on in the form of higher prices  On the national front, we see a relatively strong domestic economy over the near  term, and the prospects are for only moderate but clear downward revisions in our third-quarter  forecast We are now projecting third-quarter GDP growth in the 18 percent range We think  that the fundamentals have changed only marginally on the domestic side but that the risks are  now slightly to the downside on net Of course our chief concern, as it is for others, is the risk to  continued growth due to turmoil in international markets and how much developments in those  markets will feed back to the domestic economy Compared to our previous read, affected  countries appear to be in worse condition and are less poised for a turnaround than previously  expected We are getting increasing evidence from surveys of expectations, declines in  corporate earnings, and the pullback in confidence that the risks from the international sector  have increased and are now posing a significant downside risk to GDP growth going forward  The main question marks are how these developments will ultimately affect consumer spending,  inventory accumulation, and business investment, all of which have been sources of strength  over the past year At this juncture, the outlook for a slowdown is still prospective rather than  reflecting strong evidence that some slowing is currently in hand Nevertheless, I believe the  risks clearly have shifted since our last meeting and are now asymmetric to the downside in my  view Thank you, Mr Chairman "
5132,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, I agree with the proposed 25 basis point easing move  and I would prefer no tilt for the reasons that you articulated with regard to that choice and that  Gary Stern reinforced in his comments Thank you "
5194,1998-11-17," Mr Chairman, I found working through this issue much like eating the  first raw oyster I ever ate The more I chewed on it, the bigger it got and the harder it got to  swallow [Laughter] Our discussion this morning has not made this issue any easier to  swallow I certainly agree with others who say that Option 2 is an improvement over the  language that we have today I came to this meeting with a preference, and I think I still have it,  for the language in Cathy Minehan's option I say that because I think that adding a reference to  the risks to the outlook, although that creates some ambiguity, avoids what Option 2 seems to  imply, namely in the minds of at least some people a forecast of the next policy move That may  be providing more information than we really intend So, I would be more comfortable with  Option 3, but Option 2 would be an improvement over what we have today Thank you "
5195,1998-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman Signs of moderation or at least a leveling  off in the rate of growth have begun to emerge in our District also While some of that can be  traced to international developments, perhaps more reflects a pause or a respite in a maturing  expansion People clearly are being more cautious in their spending and lending I am hearing  economic activity described as good, or very good, or pretty strong as compared with the  extraordinary adjectives that we were hearing a few months ago  Reflecting the moderation that I referred to, retail sales increases in our region have  been more modest recently and inventories have risen slightly Our most recent manufacturing  survey and industry contacts indicate that factory production, new orders, and employment have  increased only modestly At the same time, strength in our tourism and hospitality industry  continues to help stabilize the regional economy; and despite the short-term adverse impacts of  Hurricane Georges, bookings are strong and theme parks are expected to be packed over the  Christmas holidays  To be sure, there are pockets of special difficulties in our region For example,  regional steelmakers have recently announced layoffs and are seeing inventories build Someone  remarked recently that steel has gone from just-in-time inventory management to just-put-it-  over-there [Laughter] We are also seeing some definite indications that housing may have  peaked in our area, and there is evidence that the very strong commercial real estate sector has  begun to soften In South Florida, there are concerns that weakness in South America and Asia    11/17/98  may begin to have a significant impact on tourism, but we have not seen that in any meaningful  way yet Hardest hit in our region have been the pulp and paper, forest products, and energy  sectors Lower oil and gas prices have discouraged drilling, and the rig count is now the lowest  that it has been in three years Finally, despite continuing tight labor markets, employers still  seem to be resisting wage increases, and we continue to get fragmentary reports that labor  shortages have delayed the expansion plans of some firms  We made a special effort to determine what, if anything, we could detect about  prospective corporate investment spending plans and found that the evidence is mixed Some  firms are cutting back, some are being more cautious, and some are simply continuing to expand  Our manufacturing survey outlook index for capital expenditures declined nearly 3 percentage  points, yet we found numerous examples of firms continuing their investment plans In general,  we learned that cutbacks are being planned exactly where one would expect, in the traded goods  area that is being adversely affected by international problems, while expansion is continuing in  service industries and domestically oriented production  We also, like others, made some attempts to assess whether there has been significant  change in the availability and terms of credit Reports that we get from talking to lenders  indicate that the credit adjustments seem to have been dictated by prudence rather than a pulling  out of lending markets The one area where funding seems to have dried up has been in REIT  lending for development in the Southeast Overall, I would not characterize these financial  market developments in our area as a credit crunch By contrast, our people on the ground in  Latin America continue to come home with reports of severe contractions in lending, including  trade loans, in that part of the world    11/17/98  On the national front, I'm a bit more optimistic about the pace of growth in the period  ahead than is the Greenbook Certainly, recent data suggest that the US economy has  considerable resiliency and remains relatively strong, perhaps stronger than many of us  anticipated Looking beyond the near term, I agree that a slowdown, but a gradual one, seems to  be in the offing While employment has softened a little, early pessimism for holiday sales  seems to be abating While we certainly see some slowing in investment spending, especially in  the goods-producing sector, it is my sense that spending on productivity-enhancing equipment  will continue to be strong and that those businesses in the service area and those producing  primarily for domestic markets will continue to invest  In hindsight, our intermeeting policy move was timely, and financial markets, as  everyone else has observed, appear to have calmed considerably The adjustments that have  taken place in lending standards and terms are probably a good thing Echoing President  Minehan's comment, the rationing of credit for real estate development in markets that had  become a bit frothy should help damp the boom/bust cycles that we have seen so many times in  that industry In the spirit of letting markets adjust, we should also be comfortable to let equity  markets adjust to underlying fundamentals  Clearly, we remain vulnerable to further international shocks The more I learn about  Japan, the more I realize that a big turnaround there is not likely to come very soon As the part  of the country that is most closely attached to Latin America, I clearly understand how unsettled  things are there We have enjoyed a number of weeks now without a big, bad development or  revelation, and it is difficult to judge just how fragile our economic psyche is at the moment    11/17/98  All that said, with acknowledgement of the downside risks, it seems to me that we are  in a period where we can afford to be a bit cautious and patient and let things play out Thank  you, Mr Chairman "
5196,1998-11-17," Mr Chairman, although I understand your arguments, I too would be  most comfortable with no policy change today Respecting the clock, I will not repeat the  arguments that Presidents Broaddus and Minehan made I want to underscore the point that  President Poole made, wishing that we had had our discussion about an early announcement so  that we could tell the world that a symmetric directive is in place Thank you "
5258,1998-12-22," Clarification, Mr Chairman I may not have listened carefully enough  but I am not clear Would this be a statement from the Committee and would the statement be  reviewed by the Committee at the meeting after which it is to be released?   Yes, please, if I may Mr Chairman, I support the compromise  primarily because it represents more transparency and more information I also want to identify  with Al Broaddus's comments This is not going to be without risk and agony, going back to our  earlier discussion I would hope that the small majority that favors the full step can continue to  work with the rest of the Committee and that we can build a bigger majority over time as we gain  experience with this Thank you "
5259,1998-12-22," Mr Chairman, over the past six weeks, the Sixth District has  continued to grow at a healthy but slower rate than was the case earlier this year We expect that  same pace to continue into next year The big stories this time around in our District are tourism  and energy  The outlook for Florida tourism has been noticeably less upbeat than it was earlier in  the year Negative fallout from the turbulence in foreign markets has adversely affected South  Florida and the Gulf Coast Particularly, there has been a falloff in Latin American tourism and  there is concern that the middle-income tourist especially will opt not to come to Florida this  year as evidenced by the bookings information at some moderately priced South Florida hotels  Although occupancy rates are up 1 to 2 percent from last year, 3-month forward bookings are off  some 6 percent There is further concern that a weak Canadian dollar will keep away tourists  from Canada, a particularly important market for the west coast of Florida and the panhandle of  the state Even small declines in tourism are significant because of the sheer size and importance  of the tourism industry, which dwarfs the entire economies of several smaller states in our  District  Declining energy prices are having depressing effects on Louisiana and other oil-  producing parts of our District State revenues in Louisiana are down significantly because of  the drop in oil and severance taxes It has been reported that the price of a barrel of crude is only  25 cents less than the price of a barrel of gasoline, and a gallon of gasoline now costs less than a    12/22/98 33  gallon of bottled water! The result has been a steep decline in drilling activity The rig count in  our area is down to 150 from a high of about 210 It is having its effect on supply boats and  other support activities There also is concern about the merger announced between Exxon and  Mobil, which could put as many as 10,000 Louisiana jobs at risk And yet, Bob McTeer, those  jobs are likely to show up in the State of Texas  Finally, although payroll employment growth has slowed, labor markets remain  extremely tight There is still concern about rising wages but the bigger concern, as others have  said, relates to the availability and quality of the remaining workers The only area where there  is significant evidence of price increases is in health care where costs are expected to increase at  a double-digit rate for many large employers  At the national level, our broad outlook, like others, is not markedly different from the  Greenbook but with some differences in composition I expect some slowing in consumer  spending, business fixed investment, and housing, but to date there is little concrete evidence that  those trends are beginning to develop Indeed, the near-term outlook is more positive now, given  the revisions to the estimated third-quarter GDP and the likelihood of a strong fourth quarter as  well  My view is that the more pessimistic forecasts may be giving too much weight to  further deterioration in the international sector and its implications for US growth It is my  sense that we probably have already experienced the brunt of the declines that will take place and  that our domestic economy remains quite strong Employment growth continues at a strong  pace; unemployment is down; consumer incomes are up; and energy, steel, and other commodity  input prices continue to come down The view that declining corporate earnings projections will  both damp investment expenditures and depress share prices, thereby cutting back on consumer    12/22/98 34  spending, implies stronger impact multipliers than we have seen to date Interestingly, some of  our recent research shows much less of a direct relationship between corporate profits and real  GDP growth than one might intuitively expect  Additionally, the effects of the past three rate cuts have not yet fully worked their way  through the economy Our model simulation suggests that only 40 percent of a policy move's  total effect on GDP occurs within two quarters and that it takes some six quarters before 80  percent of its effect is reflected  As others have suggested, the largest downside risk seems to be in Latin America  Clearly, a major key lies in whether there is further financial turmoil in Brazil, whether  authorities there can engineer an orderly depreciation of the real, which would permit an easing  of interest rates, and whether any currency depreciation will be supported and accommodated  peacefully by Brazil's multilateral creditors However, should Brazil experience another crisis,  the regional outlook will suffer if contagion spreads to other Latin American markets  Putting everything together, I think we have a good chance of a moderate slowdown in  near-term growth going forward Despite the fact that the risks to the economy remain large and  may even be larger because of recent events, I see the risks as being relatively balanced and  symmetric at the current time Thank you, Mr Chairman "
5260,1998-12-22," Mr Chairman, I also favor ""no change"" with a symmetric directive  today I think the case for that has been made very well around the table As I was reflecting  during the break, I was struck by the number of people today who in the earlier go-around  identified and quantified the upside risks, certainly to a greater degree than was the case last  time I would associate myself with those who have encouraged us to be as ready to move on the  upside to tighten policy as we were very recently to ease on the downside I think such behavior  would reinforce and preserve our credibility for the next rainy day But I am very supportive of  ""no change"" and a symmetric directive today   I, too, favor option 3 and would delete the last sentence on the  aggregates I would leave ""in coming months"" in for the reason Governor Meyer articulated I  would delete the last sentence for the reasons that President Poole referred to I hope that helps  in reaching a consensus [Laughter] "
5319,1999-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Sixth District has begun 1999 on   a moderate growth path, consistent with a healthy and balanced expansion Residential   building has moderated, at least for the moment, but that should be offset by a healthy   commercial real estate sector Factory activity was sluggish again in December, and new   orders and production are soft compared to a year ago However, the outlook indicators   from our latest survey are positive The strength is in the high-tech area The exceptions   are apparel and paper, which continue to be weak, but that is not a new story   As for our important tourism industry, in recent meetings I have noted some   sluggishness in future bookings but the outlook is promising this time While there was   some disappointment regarding the traffic over the year-end holiday season and some   continuing concern about a falloff in Latin American visitors, the Super Bowl provided a   big shot in the arm  And domestic tourists with money to spend fleeing the cold weather   in the North should ensure a strong first quarter Airline flights to Florida and the Florida   resorts are fully booked through February, and the cruise industry is bullish on 1999 due   to strong bookings   Low energy prices continue to pose a problem for Louisiana The rig count   declined still again in December and now stands at 147, the lowest since August 1995   The only clues about capital spending plans in the region come from our December   manufacturing survey It showed that expected capital expenditures six months out were   more positive than in November About one-third of our respondents said they expect an   increase in capital outlays over the coming period   Consistent with the national price data, price inflation in the District generally   remains subdued However, as others have said, labor markets remain tight; and we are     2/2-3/99 57   now getting reports of growing wage pressures, with increases in the 15 to 20 percent   range being necessary to retain key employees with certain specific skills It is not clear   to us whether these wage gains are being fully picked up by the ECI data because many   of the increases are in areas other than regular wages, such as incentive pay, premium   pay, and bonuses The only other area where we continue to get reports of price increases   is health care, as others have noted   Brazil’s problems have worsened the outlook for the District’s exports to Latin   America, damping earnings prospects for regional companies investing heavily in that   part of the world Although not huge in the total scheme of things in 1997, companies   based in the Southeast exported $26 billion to Brazil, accounting for about 20 percent of   the value of the nation’s shipments to that country  We think Florida is the state with the   largest exports to Brazil, with about two-fifths of the value of the state’s shipments   attributable to computer equipment, electronics, and transportation   At the national level concerns clearly remain about the international sector I will   turn to that in just a moment I suggested last time that I saw a danger in having our   attention diverted from the stronger-than-sustainable growth and the inflationary   pressures that may now be building within the domestic economy I am no less   concerned now than I was at the last meeting Although our judgmental forecast, like   that of the Greenbook and most others, sees some slowing in the pace of growth over   1999, as of yet there are few measurable signs of that slowing Our concern that growth   may once again turn out to be stronger than expected is further influenced by the   projections of our Bank’s econometric model That new VAR model, which has tracked   the performance of the economy quite well over recent years, is now suggesting a   significant upturn in inflation during 2001 to a rate approaching the 4 percent level as   measured by the CPI Importantly, that model also suggests that a significant increase in   the federal funds rate--to a level above what we may be comfortably willing to   contemplate--will be required to keep inflation at even a 3 percent pace   While I am not campaigning for a monetarist label, I would also note that the   growth of the monetary aggregates shows no signs of abating and in fact continues to   accelerate The longer that continues, the greater the risks may be of an outbreak of   inflation I expressed the view last time that with the lags that we know exist, the     2/2-3/99 58   implications of this relatively long period of strong money growth may not yet have   shown through in our inflation measures   Governor Rivlin also made some observations about lags at our last meeting,   suggesting that for a number of reasons we may now have the luxury of waiting longer to   institute needed policy changes because the economy has become more responsive to   shocks than it was previously That hypothesis piqued our curiosity and we attempted to   investigate it a bit We did so by examining differences in the impulse responses in our   model, estimated over different periods of time Indeed, as was hypothesized, that   modeling work does suggest a faster response recently to real side shocks than was the   case previously, although the quantitative response to those shocks appears to be smaller   At the same time, we found no evidence that there was any change in the economy’s   response to monetary policy shocks, which continue to work with long lags, requiring   over two years for 80 percent of the total response to be reflected in measures of   inflation Obviously, we have a limited number of recent data points from which to do   such modeling but, in addition to the other reasons I suggested for caution, the results of   that work are flashing caution lights for me   Turning very briefly to international developments We have followed recent   problems in Brazil with special care, given the ongoing bank supervision work we do in   Latin America, working with central banks and other supervisory authorities Early in   the year my staff was telling me that the major key to possible developments in Brazil lay   in whether authorities could engineer an orderly depreciation of the currency and whether   it could be accommodated peacefully by Brazil’s multilateral creditors We did not   expect that the depreciation would come so soon or that the value of the real would   decline by 40 percent or more The good news, it seems to us, is that there has not yet   been much spillover effect to other countries as might have been expected After initial   declines, the Mexican and Chilean pesos have recovered somewhat Argentine   authorities have assured that peso/dollar convertibility would be maintained, and   Venezuela does not appear to be under substantially more pressure than it was prior to the   Brazilian problems Moreover, trade ties with Brazil and the rest of Latin America,   except for Argentina, are relatively limited     2/2-3/99 59   In summary, the international situation certainly remains fragile, and we could   have to contend with the shock of worsening problems in Brazil, added contagion from   the Brazilian problem, or both Having said that, I don’t think we should give undue   weight in our policy deliberations at this meeting to what could happen in that part of the   world and too little weight to the still very strong domestic economy, given inflationary   tendencies that have been identified by both the Greenbook and the independent work at   some of our Reserve Banks Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5320,1999-02-02," Mr Chairman, I like your recommendation, including the   handling of the symmetry issue I hope, like others, that you will use the Humphrey-  Hawkins setting to put people on notice that we are in fact prepared to tighten if   circumstances suggest that is appropriate   I was particularly pleased that you resurrected the notion of “preemptive”   policymaking this morning, something we have gotten further and further away from as   we have gotten caught up in the euphoria of good experiences recently Last night I was   reflecting on yesterday’s discussion and I was struck by how many of us have fallen back   on our models recently I know we have all been using them, but we talked about them   more yesterday than in the past I think we did that perhaps as a second check on our loss   of peripheral vision, as a check against just going on our instincts Those models, even   with their flaws and possible missing variables--and you gave them another licking this   morning--do serve to remind us that there is a danger of making the mistake of waiting   too long to tighten policy and that there is in fact a price associated with that So I am   pleased that we at least have left the door open to a preemptive move Thank you  "
5379,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman For the past couple of meetings, I   have reported that the Atlanta District economy has been on a slightly lower expansion   path than the economy as a whole However, now it looks as if the District economy has   once again edged ahead of the nation and is expanding at a robust rate While reports for   retail sales have been mixed, showing mainly better sales for discounters relative to   traditional department stores, manufacturing according to our Southeast manufacturing   survey improved in February Notable gains were reported in current production,   employment, the factory workweek, and also in the outlook indicators With regard to     3/30/99 26   the latter, capital investment for six months out surged in February Tourism and travel   remain healthy, with substantial additions to hotel and cruise ship capacity planned   Construction prospers despite shortages in wallboard   The main negatives in our region are trade, agriculture, and energy; none of   those negatives is surprising or new The trade gap at our District ports over the last year   rose from $5 billion to $12 billion, almost six times the rate of deterioration nationally, as   exports through those ports declined and imports increased   Latin America is in our backyard and has special implications for our region   Because of that I would like to offer a few brief observations about Brazil, which has   been given so much play recently Our people spend a lot of time in that region and I had   the benefit of paying a personal visit to Brazil since the last FOMC meeting I talked   with a number of domestic and foreign bankers and business leaders about what is going   on in the Brazilian economy   It is the case that Brazil has made some progress on both the financial and the   fiscal fronts But I must say I came away with three broad impressions that caused me   some worry First, I sensed that the depth of Brazil’s fiscal problems and the political   difficulties the country faces in addressing them are more serious, longer term in nature,   and more difficult than one may appreciate from reading the popular press Second, I did   not detect the broad-based sense of urgency to address those problems that might have   been expected Interestingly, a number of Brazilian businessmen and bankers told me   that they knew how to continue to operate profitably should Brazil return to an   inflationary environment, and thus they could muddle through Finally, I found that   several large US companies headquartered in my region are more than a little uneasy   about their investments in Brazil They are uneasy because of the reneging on some   concessions, including tax forgiveness, that were made by Brazilian authorities at the   time those investment decisions were made That kind of environment does not   encourage additional investment I would guess that we have not seen the end of   troublesome developments in Brazil     3/30/99 27   The decline in domestic energy production that I have reported on previously   continues As Bob McTeer indicated, rig counts are down; Louisiana’s seasonally   adjusted rig count is down to 138, the lowest level since June of 1995 To emphasize the   ripple effects of this decline in energy production domestically, the largest oil drilling   service company notes that their benchmark supply boat, which last year rented for   $10,000 a day, is now going for $2,500 per day Labor markets continue to be tight; and   while there are scattered indications of wage and benefit increases, there are few new   signs of overall price pressures   I might mention a conversation I had last week with one of the largest, if not   the largest, commercial builders in the Southeast who is doing work for us He reported   that the fees they are now able to charge as a percent of the project cost have gone from   2½ to 3 percent to 3½ to 4 percent; that’s a 25 percent increase in the fees they can   charge In addition, he says they can now extract additional fees for doing up-front   consulting work during the design phase This may be a regional phenomenon, but given   the fact that his company does work across many markets in the Southeast, I find it   interesting that he has been able to get those kinds of margins Two other smaller   commercial builders on our board of directors reported that they have quit bidding on   jobs and will only entertain work on a negotiated basis So, the commercial construction   sector, at least in our region, is very strong   At the national level, I continue to see some downside risks stemming from   international developments, as does everyone else, despite the recent period of relative   quiet and more settled conditions Brazil, China, Japan, Russia, and other nations we can   name are candidates for new, negative developments At the same time, and deserving   much greater weight in my view, we have a domestic economy that continues to surprise   us with its strength and staying power and apparent resistance to inflation It appears that   our economy very likely is operating beyond sustainable levels at the moment We have   to continue to watch for the strains and bottlenecks that may be associated with that   Despite the absence of a smoking gun in the data, it is the case that our near-  term inflation outlook shows some pickup This is due to relative price changes as     3/30/99 28   energy and commodity prices return to more normal levels More troublesome for me,   however, are the longer-run inflation paths in the Greenbook simulations and our own   Bank’s modeling work The simulations, as well as the charts on inflation-targeting rules   contained in the most recent financial indicators package supplied in connection with this   meeting, all imply that a significant increase in the fed funds rate would be required to   keep inflation even close to its current path The implication also is that the longer we   wait, the higher interest rates will have to be to accomplish this task   It is hard to know whether we should take back right now at least a portion of   the rate decreases we delivered last fall or whether we should wait a while longer But it   is my guess that Y2K concerns may make consideration of a policy shift more difficult as   we move into the latter part of the year, unless the case is compelling or we face some   very unexpected developments For me, that is another reason to be ready to move   sooner rather than later I find myself leaning at this point toward at least a tilt toward   tighter policy And I would like for us to talk at least about the possibility of using our   newly initiated change on disclosure of the tilt in the directive in order to lay the   groundwork for future policy moves This would give us more flexibility to make a   policy move before late in the year without either surprising market participants or   committing ourselves to a policy change if it proves not to be needed Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5380,1999-03-30," Mr Chairman, as is evident from my comments during the   earlier go-around, I am a little less comfortable with waiting to have obvious inflation “in   our faces,” as the teenagers say, and I am perhaps at least a bit more inclined to support   forward-looking and preemptive policymaking Having said that, if I had a vote this   year, I would support your recommendation today because I don’t think the case for a   move is compelling, or at least compelling enough That said, I am going to continue to   worry and try to weigh the consequences of erring on both sides of what will turn out   after the fact to have been the optimal policy I think there is a chance that we are   underestimating the importance of good policy and the payback from the low inflation   expectations that we have helped engender in this current policy environment And I   hope we will continue to stay extremely alert and be willing to revisit this issue if the   need for tightening becomes more obvious Thank you, Mr Chairman     3/30/99 63  "
5424,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Southeast economy continues   to operate at a very high level of utilization and that constrains us from experiencing the   kind of growth rates that we saw earlier in the expansion Recent retail sales gains in our   area have been modest, and single-family housing activity has been up only slightly At   the same time, office and other commercial construction has been a bit stronger since our   last FOMC meeting Manufacturing has picked up Our important tourism industry   continues to do well, especially along the Mississippi Gulf Coast where another huge   gambling casino has just opened That grand opening and the associated demand for   another 5,000 casino workers have given rise to the latest tight labor market story The   casino operators reportedly bought or leased a complete apartment complex to house     5/18/99 38   workers they are now bringing in from other less tight labor markets throughout rural   Mississippi   Of the specific areas of regional weakness that I noted last time--namely,   energy, agriculture, and trade--problems in our energy sector have moderated slightly to   the extent that wells are no longer being capped; but we have not been experiencing   increases in production and drilling yet There is no sign of a turnaround in the District’s   trade deficit with Latin America or with Asia for that matter, and agriculture continues to   suffer from low commodity prices   Anecdotal information on regional price pressures is quite similar to what I   have been reporting, as have others Labor markets are clearly tight Business people are   complaining about finding workers Our directors and other contacts continue to   emphasize the growing role of nontraditional compensation--bonuses, signing bonuses,   and incentive pay--with those non-base salary types of compensation being pushed   further and further down the organizational level in many firms One director reported   that truck drivers are being paid a $5,000 signing bonus in order to get more trucks on the   road Benefits are also being made more widely available, especially in small companies,   but at the same time some companies are restructuring some benefits, notably medical, to   control their costs   Two final observations from our regional contacts First, one large regional   retail chain has reportedly scheduled several van loads of spring goods from China for   delivery two months early as a hedge against possible Y2K disruptions; and secondly, to   build on Al Broaddus’s comment a few minutes ago, our bank examiners tell me that they   see some evidence of a deterioration in credit quality From their field work they have   found that lenders are concerned about over expansion in the hotel/hospitality industry   and some relaxed credit standards and increased credit risks in the health care sector   At the national level, like others, I have continued to enjoy observing and   talking about this good ride that we are experiencing That’s something that someone at   the last meeting reminded us all to take the time to stop and do Like others, my staff and   I continue to think through the arguments for why some slowing of the pace of growth   and consumer and investment spending should begin to show through Compared with   the construct of the Greenbook, we’re inclined to attribute a bit more of the strength in     5/18/99 39   consumer spending to current income, some of which we suspect we may not be fully   capturing and measuring, and somewhat less to the wealth effect   Although I would not argue that the fundamentals have changed significantly   since our last meeting, I find myself still, and perhaps increasingly, uneasy about the   inflation outlook My staff, most other forecasters, most other people who have spoken   around the table this morning, and now it appears the bond markets see some gradual   deterioration in core inflation looking ahead to 2000 and 200l The perceived recent   improvement in inflation by some measures has to be viewed in the context of the   technical adjustments that have masked some of the upward pressures   It seems to me that there is good reason to be concerned about the inflation   outlook regardless of which economic model one subscribes to We are already seeing   some reversal of the favorable trend in commodity prices, and some part of that very   likely will begin to feed through to prices sometime soon Labor markets are very tight   and unemployment is below even recent estimates of the natural rate The money supply,   as several people have already noted, has been overly expansive for the past two-and-a-  half years, and that may begin to show through in inflation pressures   The seesaw pattern of productivity gains over recent decades, even allowing   for the sea change that may have taken place most recently, leaves me at least somewhat   cautious about counting on the extraordinary productivity gains we’ve experienced most   recently to offset most or all other upward cost pressures Of course, the trick is to know   when to say when, as the commercial suggests It seems to me that if we come to a   shared sense that it is time to begin at least leaning in the direction of tighter policy, we   have a window of opportunity to do that right now The international situation is at least   somewhat less fragile than it was the last time we contemplated a tightening The US   economy is still sufficiently balanced that a tightening move is not likely to be terribly   disruptive If we were to move today or lay the groundwork for a possible move at our   next meeting, we could get ahead of what I think we will come to see as a problematic   period later in the year, when I imagine we will give considerable weight to preparing for   Y2K uncertainties and possible volatility and will prefer policy stability Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5425,1999-05-18," I support your recommendation as well, Mr Chairman, and I   would echo the comments that President Boehne has just made I also identify with   President McDonough’s comment that we may get an added kick from the announcement   effect since it will be the first time that we inform the public about a change in the tilt     5/18/99 61   immediately after a meeting In addition to the arguments that you made, I am pleased   that such an announcement will not leave all of us vulnerable to having our individual   public statements or even our body language picked apart over this next period I think a   leak would be a most unfortunate way for people to learn about a change in the tilt, and I   see that risk as a very important reason to make the announcement Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5478,1999-06-29," Mr Chairman, I agree as well In addition to the arguments   people have made, another matter is the timing We may be in a period--we’ll see in a   few minutes--where we want to underscore our commitment to a low inflation policy   And to raise the targets at that same time might send a message to some people that we   have a greater tolerance for-­   I certainly agree  "
5479,1999-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman As is usually the case, conditions in   our region have changed only at the margin between meetings Retail sales remain quite   healthy A number of retailers are actually telling us that they expect the third quarter to   be as good as or even better than the second quarter   As I’ve noted before, tourism is a particularly interesting part of our economy and   an area where we often get early signals of a turn in activity or of people’s outlooks In   the tourism industry bookings remain strong; they are not growing quite as fast as they   were a year ago but are still at very high levels This is the first time in a while in our   surveys of the District’s tourism people that we haven’t heard grumbling about the falloff   in visitors from Latin American, Canada, or Europe There is a growing sense that there   may have been some overbuilding in new tourist attractions in the Orlando area If you   haven’t been in the area for a while, come on down! [Laughter]   Construction is still at high levels We are seeing some slowing in the rate of   growth in single family permits, but that’s offset by quite strong nonresidential   construction We’ve recently heard new concerns about overbuilding in commercial   projects in Orlando In oil and gas, the higher oil prices that have prevailed for a while   now have shown through in a modest uptick in drilling activity after a long period of   decline That should pick up further if oil prices continue to hold at their current levels   Our manufacturing activity, as measured by employment growth, may be a bit   less robust than for other District reports included in the Beigebook Our import-  sensitive industries like apparel, paper, and primary metals have seen declines At the   same time, there’s an optimism that we will begin to see, or may already be seeing, some   turnaround as the economies of our trading partners begin to improve   An old story Labor markets are still tight, and outsized wage increases are still   being reported, mostly in certain high-skilled jobs A recent example of noticeably large   increases was at Ingalls Shipyard, where a three-year contract provides for a 163 percent   increase Pricing pressures seem to have increased a bit at the margin since the last   meeting As one our directors put it, many of the business people she talks to are   increasingly determined to pass on their cost increases Health care is a good example in   our region It’s an area where pressures are great and where we are seeing some   relatively large upward price adjustments who is a major     6/29-30/99 42   homebuilder in the region, also reports that he has been able to pass through many of the   cost increases that he’s seen in the building trades   On the national front, real GDP growth is still outpacing my expectations Other   than the effects of oil and energy costs, measured inflation is not yet showing the upward   drift I thought we might see by now Nevertheless, there have been some marginal   changes to the outlook in my view, suggesting our assessment that the inflation risks are   on the upside was in fact correct Our GDP projections for most of the recently   depressed Latin American and developing Asian economies have been revised upward   While the turnarounds have not yet been reflected in increases in US exports and   commodity prices or in capital markets, we expect that the demands for and prices of real   goods and services and productive inputs will rise This should reverse many of the   favorable shocks that have slowed US real GDP growth and temporarily reduced the   rate of increase in prices Furthermore, I see little on the domestic side to suggest that   there will be a significant slowing in domestic demand during the rest of this year   Employment remains strong and consumer income and spending are up Business   investment spending may slow some, but it appears likely to continue to run ahead of past   experience in a mature expansion   Should the reversal of the positive external shocks occur as expected, that raises a   fundamental question about the overall stance of monetary policy Would the associated   run-up in measured inflation reflect embedded inflation that has been temporarily masked   by a series of favorable events?  Or would the increase be temporary due to the nature of   the fixed-weight inflation measures and the fact that only relative prices of energy and   commodities have increased?   In general, relative price movements aren’t inherently inflationary and they   should be permitted to play themselves out Such price pressures would dissipate quickly   as real and financial resources are reallocated, as long as our policy stance prevents these   relative price adjustments from being passed on through the economy as a general price   level adjustment However, if we persist in maintaining interest rates below what I   believe is likely to be their pre-shock equilibrium levels, we may inadvertently be   pursuing an easier and inherently inflationary monetary policy Thank you, Mr   Chairman     6/29-30/99 43  "
5480,1999-06-29," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of a ¼ point   tightening My thoughts on symmetry mirror Bob Parry’s very closely and the views   Larry Meyer and Al Broaddus expressed earlier I judge the sentiment around the table,   certainly my own, as a judgment that one 25 basis point tightening is probably not   enough to deal with what is likely to be coming So I still think the probability of our   needing to tighten further is fairly high To me it is more intellectually honest and more   credible to go ahead and tell people that, rather than to try to back into it with a   symmetric directive   I also am afraid that moving back to symmetry mutes our policy move and makes   it too timid My two-year-old granddaughter when she finishes eating says “all done”   and has this cute hand signal to say she’s finished I am afraid that not only financial   markets but lenders, builders, and others will get the sense that we saw the need to tighten   further as only a tiny threat and will quit helping us in trying to lean against what we see   coming Also, to me, moving back to symmetry suggests that we’re smart enough to     6/29-30/99 105   make one small ¼ point tightening move and fine-tune with a precision that I don’t think   we have   Finally, I’m concerned, despite the reminders that we frequently have made a   policy move from symmetry, about the view that we can tell markets “so be it” if we   decide we need to move Just as we have created a new device with the symmetry/   asymmetry announcement, I think we have created--either intentionally or unintentionally   --an expectation that we will try very hard, perhaps harder than in the past, to let people   know where we are headed I am concerned that even though the data may begin to   nudge us in the direction of additional tightening, we may want to cycle back through and   move to an asymmetric directive and then to a tightening move later That would push   the move to later in the year than is necessary and--as Larry Meyer reminded us and as I   said at the last meeting--will get us into the period when I suspect we will prefer not to be   meddling in markets while the Y2K situation is in play So I would have at least a   modest preference for an asymmetric directive  "
5536,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman Growth in the Sixth District remains   healthy Our regional economy seems to be expanding at approximately the same rate as the   nation at the current time, although I continue to expect some slowing in housing   Residential construction is relatively stronger than the national numbers suggest, perhaps   because the inventory of available housing units remains low Permits are up even more   strongly than in the nation Reports of materials shortages and scarcities have pushed up   housing prices and may act to damp both demand and supply growth somewhat But the   strong permits data suggest that this may be a temporary development Regional industrial   production was up, according to the latest Southeastern manufacturing survey, hinting of the   strength in the national statistics And while shipments and new orders were off slightly,   respondents indicated that production is expected to increase over the coming months   Regional consumer confidence, as measured by the Florida Consumer Confidence survey, is     8/24/99 51   high; the index is only 2 points below its all-time high of last February This is reflected in   robust District retail sales Prospects for the Christmas season look especially bright,   gauging from the extremely strong buying reported at the Atlanta Gift Mart Christmas   Show, where both regional and national retailers come to do their looking and buying for the   upcoming Christmas season   I have been expecting some pickup in the Gulf Coast oil and gas industry Based on a   substantial run-up in crude prices and the lower extraction breakeven point now prevailing,   one would have expected drilling to rebound It still has not and we interpret that as saying   that the drillers are less confident than most economic forecasters that the cartel’s   production quotas and, consequently, pricing will hold Long-term prospects for that   industry in our region just had a big boost from BP-Amoco’s announcement last month of   the largest deep water find ever in the Gulf, an estimated 1 billion barrels of oil a mile down   and some 124 miles southeast of New Orleans   To retell an old familiar story, District labor markets remain quite tight Our regional   year-over-year payroll growth of 26 percent is outpacing that of the nation The District   unemployment rate has now declined by another 02 percentage point to 39 percent, and   that rate is the lowest in some 20 years However, despite that tightness, we still see little   evidence of general broad-based wage acceleration Similarly, prices for raw materials and   finished goods also remain stable, with the exception of prescription drugs and selected   building materials, whose prices have increased, as others have already mentioned   Turning to the national picture, my interpretation of the most recent incoming data,   combined with anecdotal information, is that the economy is maintaining substantial   forward momentum Fundamentals of job growth, income growth, and confidence remain   quite favorable The improving economic outlook for the economies around the world that   Karen Johnson talked about should begin to spur exports And the propensity of   government to increase spending may provide marginal stimulus in the period ahead   Although one can point to some signs of slowing or potential slowing--including the effects   of higher mortgage rates on housing and related industries--I share the view that the sharp   downturn in GDP growth in the second quarter will be reversed in the current quarter and   over the forecast period     8/24/99 52   Of course, for us the crucial question is whether the expected pace of growth can be   sustained without increasing inflationary pressures Our Bank’s own judgmental forecast   and our VAR modeling work, like most other forecasts, suggest an upward drift in expected   inflation of nearly 50 basis points next year and somewhat more beyond that With some   humility, which others have already expressed in previous meetings, I acknowledge that we   have had such forecasts for some time now, and measured inflation has continued to defy   those forecasts   So the difficult question for me is what underpins those forecasts of higher inflation   and how much confidence we should put in them this time around After sorting through   what seems to be happening and pressuring my own staff for evidence, I conclude that the   probability of inflation trending upward is high enough, and higher than it has been, that we   should continue to lean against it For me no one factor or development makes that case   Rather, the cumulative probability of pressures from various sources, including the reversal   of favorable commodity prices, the more positive outlook for Latin American and Asian   economies, the expected boost to US exports, and rising import prices from a decline in the   value of the dollar, all point in that direction I do not consider myself a Philips curve   devotee, but I think very tight labor markets and a low unemployment rate are at least   signaling that policy remains somewhat accommodative   Finally, I do not think we should always feel compelled to validate financial market   developments But should we decide not to provide the modest policy firming that is now   widely expected and apparently priced into the market, we may lose some of the market   discipline and caution that is in play and instead get a dose of added stimulus that we don’t   want and don’t need I see this as a unique opportunity to take out some additional inflation   insurance at little or no cost Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5537,1999-08-24," Mr Chairman, I think a ¼ point tightening is the right move today,   and for all the reasons that have been articulated I think a symmetric directive is the right   place to rest until we can sort this issue out   I also want to comment, although it is not to be decided by this group, that I hope the   Board will consider a catch-up increase in the discount rate It is part and parcel of our total   policy posture A catch-up in the discount rate would help to underscore and anchor, at least   to some extent, the policy adjustment that we made at the last meeting and the one it appears   as if we are about to make this morning Thank you  "
5589,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman Although the overall pace of growth in the   Southeastern region appears to have moderated, our economy still seems to be on a path that is   slightly above that of the nation as a whole Our important and thriving Florida tourism industry   dodged the Hurricane Floyd bullet with only a modest temporary impact, including the closing of   Disney World for the first time in its 28-year history Perhaps I should publicly apologize to my   friends in North Carolina for wishing the storm would go somewhere else and having it end up   there    Our energy sector finally seems to be responding to the higher oil prices   with some pickup in oil and natural gas drilling, but the increased rig count has not yet had much   trickle-down effect on the boat-building and other support businesses Our contacts in that industry   still say, however, that the major players in the business are giving higher priority to drilling in   other parts of the world and are somewhat distracted by their mergers   The moderation in our region is coming from a couple of places Single-family residential   home building and sales have slowed measurably in all of our areas except Florida Manufacturing   activity is a mixed bag A regional survey of manufacturers in August showed some slowdown in   both current activity and in the outlook This is reflected in our port activity, which is still very   unbalanced, with imports continuing to flood in while exports have been slow to respond   One more time Labor markets remain very tight Some say they are even a bit tighter than   earlier in the year Unusually large wage increases still seem primarily confined to services at this   point As has already been commented on by a couple of others, reports of large health insurance   cost increases have become more prevalent, and people in that industry say, “Get used to it” One   of my Rotary Club colleagues told me yesterday at lunch that if we are waiting to find the flow-  through effect from higher oil prices, he clearly sees it in the added cost of his asphalt business     10/5/99 23   Our staff members who talk to contacts just before each FOMC meeting were struck by, and   remarked on, the noticeable lack of comments this time around about competition holding down   price increases That had become a very predictable message And it gives me some pause to think   that these competitive pressures, perhaps attributable now to rising prices for some competitive   imports, may be abating and fueling the hope for some long postponed price increases   On the national level, as others have already observed, most of the current data surprises   have once again been on the upside, and the overall strength of the economy has been much greater   than I expected at the time of our last meeting The Greenbook does a good job of highlighting   where that strength is coming from   I found myself during most of the intermeeting period getting more comfortable with the   notion that large productivity gains are very likely still ahead of us In the absence of compelling   data to make that case, we have pressed our 44 District directors for two months now for their   sense of where those productivity gains are coming from and what is ahead Almost without   exception we are told that we may have seen only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the long-term   potential of inexpensive computers and communications technology We have been given   examples of the opportunities that are still ahead for all kinds of businesses, large and small   Having said publicly that I was skeptical that we could fully count on the continuation of recent   large productivity gains, I am getting more comfortable that higher productivity and, therefore, a   higher rate of economic growth may be more sustainable than we thought   I also began to take some comfort in the unfolding inventory story Here again, we have   turned to our District directors for some business insights into what is really going on   Interestingly, the overwhelming consensus is that the recent inventory rundown is likely   permanent The reasons given are heavily dependent on the spread of technological advances in   communications and the broad use of more sophisticated analytical approaches to inventory   management Equally interesting was the fact that most of the people we have been talking to   about this feel that the process is not nearly complete These insights suggest to me that we may   not get large additional stimulus in the period ahead from inventory building and that we may be   less burdened with an inventory overhang following any correction in the future   These comforting insights into productivity and inventory management, taken along with   the direct and signal effects of our two recent tightening moves, were giving me the sense that we   might have some breathing room with policy for the moment However, the FOMC meeting   preparation period this time has rekindled my uneasiness about what may lie ahead I do not like     10/5/99 24   the run-up in inflation forecast in the Greenbook I do not like the same run-up in inflation forecast   in my own staff’s analytical work, including the signals of higher inflation given by our VAR   model--even adjusted for the extraordinary energy price increases And these forecasts based on   the analytical work are not inconsistent with the unfolding story of continued strength in so many   sectors of the economy We see continued strong job and income growth, continued strong   consumer and investment spending, persistent strength in housing, an improving outlook for   exports, prospects for higher-than-expected government spending, and indications of price   pressures in some recent data and anecdotal reports Monetary policy may still be too   accommodative, so we have a more difficult, more interesting, and more important policy   discussion ahead this morning than I thought likely just a couple of weeks ago Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5590,1999-10-05," Mr Chairman, I identify most closely with the comments Cathy Minehan   just made and those of Ed Kelley and Ned Gramlich earlier In my earlier comments, I indicated   that I came into this meeting with the notion that I would be comfortable with another modest   tightening move today Even after discounting our forecast and our genetic tendency to worry--and   even factoring in your reminder about productivity--I think one could still make the case that   another modest tightening would perhaps be the cleanest, most honest, most expeditious way to get   policy to the appropriate place But I can be comfortable with no policy action today  As my   colleague across the table reminded us last week, and as others have commented, the world is not   going to come to an end between meetings--especially if we’re open to considering a policy action   again in November   I also came to the meeting thinking that the worst of all worlds was some kind of   asymmetric directive As Don Kohn first ticked off the alternatives and then you ticked off the   alternatives, I was thinking that if there were a box labeled “none of the above” I would have   checked it because none of them feels right   Having said that, and having listened to the discussion, I have changed my mind a bit   during the course of this session My sense is that we see some inflation risk, and I think we ought   to go ahead and communicate that concern I, too, am uncomfortable with the notion of     10/5/99 68   introducing still another way of trying to convey that to the markets As badly as we handled it the   first time, I would rather try again very straightforwardly to see if we can get the words right this   time to explain an asymmetric directive and be done with it Thank you, Mr Chairman    I had the same reaction It seems awfully limiting to hang all of our hats on   one item     10/5/99 70    One more comment People continue to pound me with the question What   is it that you’re looking at?  The way this is worded, it essentially tells people to watch that one   statistic and that one part of the economy, and whether that behaves or misbehaves will guide our   actions I think it’s more complicated than that I wouldn’t want to limit ourselves by having that   appear to be the only thing that will trigger a tightening move later on  "
5637,1999-11-16," In the interest of time, I’ll echo Gary Stern’s comments I also   strongly prefer alternative I I think there’s less chance of the statement being seen as a tentative   policy decision I, too, would like to see us be as explicit as possible in finding the right words   for the Chairman’s authority I would emphasize the desirability of consultation with the full   Committee whenever feasible, and I would hope that that would be the case in almost all   instances I, too, stumbled over the words about the New York Fed and consultation with the   Chairman I hope we will look at that some more  "
5638,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman Overall growth in the Southeastern region   remains healthy, but with some unevenness across sectors For example, manufacturing, which   as I reported was a bit soft at the time of our last meeting, has bounced back, with current   production and shipments higher and the outlook viewed as optimistic as well Tourism, on the   other hand, appears to have slowed, but a closer look reveals very large increases in capacity in   hotel rooms and cruise ships, and thus the maintenance of past occupancy rates is difficult   Housing in our region continues to show some slowdown, mirroring the national reports, and that   is being attributed to the rise in mortgage rates Several large banks are reporting that their   mortgage loan originations are off as much as 50 percent from six months ago Other lenders tell   us that the volume of refinancing is running less than 10 percent of the volume this time last   year Single-family new construction is flat and both nonresidential and multifamily   construction has slowed somewhat     11/16/99 30   By contrast our energy sector continues to reverse earlier declines in drilling, with the   rig count up still another notch from a month ago Lenders report that corporate loan demand   continues at a high level but is moderating Interestingly, our international examiners tell us that   they are now seeing significant capital flight out of Venezuela and Colombia, and some from   Ecuador Some of that money is going into second homes in south Florida And some   Colombians have moved their families to Florida and are commuting to and from Colombia each   week   Our overall regional unemployment rate is below the national average, but the very   tight labor market still has not yet resulted in widespread wage pressures The most notable   large price increases reported once again, as others have observed, are in health care   This month we asked our directors to probe hard in three areas  for evidence of   potential liquidity problems at financial institutions and among their customers over the coming   year-end period, for signs of a Y2K-related pull back in investment activities, and for evidence   of credit quality problems At this point, there is just no grass roots evidence of Y2K-related   liquidity problems, as everyone seems to have locked in their financing needs for the end of the   year Indeed, we often heard that many still are expecting to see a significant inflow of funds   into the United States, particularly from Latin America, over the remainder of the year As best   we can judge, Y2K is just not a big deal for people we talk to in our region Our directors tell us,   and our bankers confirm, that credit quality generally seems to be improving There are   exceptions in the health care industry and agriculture, and we have reports of a few isolated   problems at community banks   On the national front, moderate inflation and further advances in employment,   together with a recent upward revision in the GDP statistics, make the economy’s performance   even more remarkable when assessed against the historical record We read the new data as   suggesting at least a somewhat greater likelihood of continued strength in the consumer sector   that will carry the expansion forward The broader definition of personal savings suggests that   consumer balance sheets are not as weak as some may have feared Newly revised data on   consumers’ debt burdens suggest that consumers are carrying less debt relative to income than   they did in the peak periods of the 1980s Finally, bankruptcies appear to have leveled off I   think the fundamentals are still in place for strong growth     11/16/99 31   Despite the good news and favorable data on the price front, I think there are still valid   reasons to be concerned about the inflation outlook My own staff’s judgmental and VAR model   forecasts are similar to those contained in the Greenbook Our work suggests only a small   probability that inflation will average below 2 percent in 2000 and a not insignificant probability   that it could move to slightly more than 3 percent On a percentage basis that would be a very   large and worrisome deterioration   In addition to the identified price pressure points that a number of people have referred   to, I would note again that other than productivity many of the safety valves and mitigating   factors that might have continued to cushion inflationary pressures have one-by-one turned   against us World economic growth is improving, exchange rates are responding to the US   trade deficit as expected, import prices are increasing, and energy and other commodity prices   have reversed their moderating effects   Our policy choices today seem to me to be quite similar to what they were at our last   meeting We still have a good window of opportunity to provide modest additional low-cost   insurance that will improve our chances of locking in our good inflation performance and   tempering inflationary expectations Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5639,1999-11-16," I can support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
5700,1999-12-21," Roger, of the two options presented, I rather strongly prefer Option 1   as recommended by the majority in your Working Group In fact, I’m very uncomfortable     12/21/99 75   forecasting policy actions, which the second option implies, as Mike Kelly, Ed Boehne, and   others have commented   What Bill Poole’s dissection of Option 1 did for me was not so much talk me out of   it but expose what I would refer to as fundamental flaws--Gary Stern used the term fatal   flaw--or shortcomings in what we are trying to do here, even in my preferred option And   those flaws relate to Bill’s point number 2--that we come here with forecasts, on which we   base our judgment of the risks, from very different models And if nothing else, that’s going   to lead to continued debate, the Chairman allowing it, about the statements we put out and   the language we use to further describe the balance of risks   Actually, more fundamentally troublesome is the fact that each of our respective   outlooks is conditional on the assumptions we have made about the stance of policy and   future policy actions That has been demonstrated very vividly in our Humphrey-Hawkins   discussions; we have made very different assumptions at this table about future policy that   are embedded in the forecasts we provide at Humphrey-Hawkins meetings It always   troubles me to see those added up and averaged to come up with numbers that purportedly   reflect the Committee’s outlook, when we admit that we have made very different   assumptions   The final fundamental flaw or shortcoming in Option 1, which I still prefer, is that   we have no formal target--no formal inflation target or GDP target or whatever--along the   lines of Ned Gramlich’s comments today That leaves open the question of risks related to   what We have not been able or willing to answer that question So, in my view, there are   some fundamental problems--fundamental may be too strong a word--with even the good   work that the Working Group has done I, for one, think there is a high probability that,   even after these repairs, people are going to find the repaired process still substantially   flawed In fact, I feel so strongly about it that I think we may want to re-open the question-­  either at this point or after we’ve tried these repairs--of whether at the end of the day we   have made a contribution, as we were trying to do, in terms of transparency I think it is still   an open question   Finally, I have just a couple of quick comments on Al Broaddus’ remarks I want to   swim upstream a bit with Al on that issue I, too, share the thought that we are all trying to   understand exactly what authority we have delegated to the Chairman Even though the     12/21/99 76   Working Group has responded to one of my comments and tried to fix the language to   address my concerns, I still would like to see the circle drawn a bit tighter around that   delegation It’s very likely that if the Chairman were acting between meetings he would be   responding to developments we could not possibly foresee at our previous meeting or, in   fact, we would have dealt with them I suggested words like “extraordinary,” or some other   term to emphasize that this authority would only apply when something very out of the   ordinary--some very short-term problem not related to the long-term objectives of the   Committee--had emerged I would be most comfortable with a delegation of that kind as   opposed to a more open-ended delegation, which I’m less than completely certain could be   fixed after the fact I just think it would be better to do that Thank you for the chance to   comment  "
5701,1999-12-21," Mr Chairman, I’m not sure I want to follow that! And I would also   like to reserve a little time for the later discussion, but I won’t trade away all of my time   The beat goes on Growth in our region remains strong and relatively balanced, and   our contacts across almost all of our geographic areas and industries are expecting more of   the same in the period ahead Consumer spending during the important Christmas buying   season is now reported to be quite strong after a slow start prior to Thanksgiving High-end   items, including expensive jewelry, are reported to be hot Big Box and other discounters   are reporting sales increases of more than 5 percent on a year-over-year basis As has been   the pattern in recent years, sales at traditional department stores are not quite as strong   As I’ve reported at other recent meetings, real estate activity in our region has   flattened noticeably While current inventories of unsold units are at reasonable levels, one   major builder in whose judgment I have a great deal of confidence told us recently that he   expects to begin to see the first signs of overbuilding in some of our markets in coming   months   Manufacturing in the region continues to increase at a modest pace, except for   apparel, which is experiencing a long secular decline Our latest manufacturing survey did   suggest some caution in investment spending plans in manufacturing in coming months   International trade from our region continues to suffer from the weak growth in Japan and   Latin America, which account for 10 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of our region’s   total exports Our examiners report that loan growth, except for mortgages, continues to be   strong There is more evidence of credit quality problems in health care lending, and   substantial loan loss provisions have been made by several of our large lenders recently It   has also been suggested that after the year-end liquidity concerns abate, we could see a pop   in investment and credit extensions as that money is put back to work     12/21/99 25   The major threat to continuation of strong growth in our region is the availability of   labor, which historically has been very dependent upon substantial in-migration to support   our above national trend growth And the pool of additional workers has dried up The   most notable price pressure points remain the same health care, pharmaceuticals, and some   commodities   At the national level, I continue to be amazed at the raw strength of the continued   expansion Clearly, the consumption numbers and the anecdotal information indicate that   the economy is carrying significant momentum into the first quarter Like the Greenbook,   both our judgmental and our VAR model forecasts show some slowing in the coming year-­  for somewhat different reasons--but upside surprises have become the norm  While we may   have some unusual patterns over the Y2K year-end period, there now appears to be enough   momentum and perhaps pent-up investment spending to counter the early 2000 slowing we   expected earlier If anything, the economy looks even more resource constrained now on   the labor side and is likely on a unsustainable growth path regardless of one’s views of   productivity and the NAIRU Moreover, there are few signs that our previous rate hikes   have yet begun to bite except for the moderation in housing As others have suggested,   higher real rates may be necessary to get a comparable degree of monetary restraint in the   current environment   Like the Greenbook, our inflation forecast shows some gradual rise in measured   inflation in 2000 and beyond Like others, I find myself re-calibrating my expectations for   productivity gains and reassessing other developments such as expanded world trade and its   implications for the supply side and for pricing power While I am comfortable building   into my outlook and policy thinking some new views about sustainable increases in the   potential for the economy to grow, I am not comfortable betting that all of the new-era   phenomena are everlasting Were it not for the special year-end considerations this year, I   would be trying to develop the case more fully this morning for another snugging policy   move In my view, such a move would improve our chances of staying ahead of   unsustainable developments that could threaten our gains against inflation and lead to a   deterioration in inflation expectations Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5702,1999-12-21," I prefer symmetry as well I hope that won’t be interpreted as any   lack of enthusiasm for getting back to our work after the first of the year I think all the   arguments have been made To change from symmetry at this point and give people even   six weeks to try to figure out why we did it and whether we anticipate doing something   different soon after the first of the year is, in my view, a distraction that we just don’t need     12/21/99 57   I’m part of the “Happy Holidays” camp as well  If we could get by with doing that, I would   like it very much  "
5760,2000-02-01,"  I would like to join Bill Poole and Al Broaddus on the comments that   you just heard  I, too, see considerable merit in moving in the direction of a more explicit   inflation target  I don’t know whether we are going to talk about that some more this morning or   not  But particularly in the absence of such a target, I believe it is much smarter to leave the   ranges alone for the moment  I think it could be distracting  We have some much more   important policy work to do and I don’t think we ought to confuse the message that we are   sending to the public at the moment  "
5761,2000-02-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our Southeast region is healthy and the   balanced expansion continues  The final data and the conversations that we have had with   retailers tell us that the holiday selling season was a blockbuster one that clearly exceeded   expectations and even the early estimates that we had  Tourism often gives us a good reading on          60  discretionary spending  As reported in the popular press, there was a measurable slowdown in   tourism over the special year-end period, but advanced bookings for the spring are quite strong,   suggesting that the strength we had been reporting in that sector will resume We hear mixed   views from people we talk with about just how much of a slowdown we have been seeing in   housing  Certainly, our tightening moves and the rise in mortgage rates have had some effect,   but in most of our markets housing construction remains at high levels and the inventory of   unsold units is quite low  Nonresidential construction has actually increased somewhat  Overall   manufacturing activity in our region has shown some pickup in both production and new orders,   but that strength is attributed to domestic demand rather than to a significant pickup in exports    Despite the recovery of many economies around the world, we are still hearing about sharp trade   imbalances as we talk to people who run our ports  They are saying the lopsided cargo trade has   caused operational problems and surcharge fees on outbound containers that are being sent back   to the US empty   Our regional payroll rose to 2-1/2 percent year over year, which reflects even more   strength than the national numbers, and labor markets feel tighter and tighter  Just last week a   new restaurant owner was telling me he had been operating at half capacity for several weeks   because of his inability to hire enough cooks and servers  And the general manager of our                                               told me he was now very concerned about being able to maintain their high   quality of service and their top rating because of the marginal staff he has had to hire  At the   same time, we are still being told that most employers are stubbornly trying to hold the line on   broad-based wage increases   Over the period since our last meeting, one gets the sense that more prices have been   edging up  Prices of construction materials are up to 2 to 5 percent; copper prices are up 10          61  percent; and red meat prices are up 7 or 8 percent because of herd liquidations over the last two   winters  And those kinds of price increases are on top of the more talked about double-digit   increases in energy, health care, and pharmaceuticals that are getting people's attention and are   now working their way through the indexes  The regional economy is strong and resource and   price pressures seem to be building   Nationally I see much the same picture  Late last year it was clear to me that the   national economy had great momentum  But the latest data, once again, have been even stronger   than I expected  I don't see much evidence yet that our earlier policy tightening moves have   more than dented the very strong consumer demand in the economy  And as most of us have   noted, the now relatively strong growth elsewhere in the world seems sure to put more pressure   on domestic producers  In addition, the Congressional temptation to spend pushes in the same   direction   I don't like the direction of price movements reflected in the Greenbook’s baseline   forecast  Our own VAR forecast paints a similar picture  Our forecast suggests that CPI   inflation will approach 3 percent this year with virtually no probability that it will be below 2   percent  And both forecasts suggest that even several more tightening moves won't damp the   upward drift in inflation to any great degree  I believe and would even argue that we are   beginning to see the whites of inflation's eyes, and I think a further tightening is called for  It has   clearly been priced into the markets  And while validating market expectations is not our task,   this is one of those instances where not doing so would undermine our credibility  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
5762,2000-02-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I came into the meeting with the intention   and inclination to argue for a 50 basis point tightening, and I think the staff presentations we   heard yesterday and the comments made around the table would certainly support that  I believe   there is evidence of mounting inflationary pressures  The probability of inflation moving up has   clearly increased in my view  My biggest worry was that if the consensus was to go with a 50   basis point tightening, there would be an inclination to slide back to a balanced risk statement    And as you eloquently pointed out, that is not where we want to be   I can support ¼ point tightening today with the balance of risks on the side of   inflationary pressures  I guess you already answered this question, but let me just say that I, too,   would really like to see the Board consider a discount rate increase  I think that gives our   directors some ownership in this policy action and reinforces the action we are taking  And in   my view there is a reasonably high probability that we will have to step up the pace in terms of   further policy actions in the meetings to come  But I support your recommendation  "
5822,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Growth in the Southeast remains   reasonably well balanced and appears to have moderated just slightly from the very strong pace   and high level I reported six weeks ago  The modest moderation we sense is most obvious in   real estate where not only is residential activity below year-ago levels but we are now seeing the   first signs of some slowing in nonresidential markets  In both cases, though, activity is still at   quite high levels  The agricultural sector remains distressed, and problems are being   compounded by a drought that is now projected to extend into the summer months    Manufacturing activity is at good levels but not quite as strong as in January  Some signs of new   life are showing up in the energy sector where the rig count is now at the highest level since the   summer of 1998, but activity is not as strong as we would expect given spot prices  The major   firms are reportedly focusing more on stock buybacks and related merger activities rather than on   domestic drilling   Two important sectors that are not showing any signs of slack or slowing are retail,   where sales have continued to exceed expectations, and tourism, where current and future   bookings are quite strong  Loan demand remains quite high and we're not picking up any signs   of broad credit problems  In fact, bankruptcies in the District are actually 12 percent below year-             - 52 -     ago levels  I was bothered by a comment made to me last week by a large commercial real estate   developer in South Florida who said he and his competitors have recently been getting more   unsolicited knocks on the door from people wanting to push money at them   Labor markets are as tight or even tighter--if that's possible--than ever  Wages are   reportedly up 3 to 5 percent, with noticeably more reports of higher increases in certain skilled   labor areas  There seem to be more reports of emerging price pressures on the imports side but   that has been the case for a long while  Competition is limiting the pass-through of virtually all   cost increases, including energy  I detect a bit more frantic tone in the continuing quest for cost   savings and productivity gains to protect margins, profits, and stock prices   At the national level, I read the data as suggesting that we've seen little, if any,   slowdown in the first quarter  I won't be surprised if first-quarter GDP comes in even higher   than the Greenbook forecast  Indeed, virtually all drivers of aggregate demand remain strong,   and productivity gains have so far been sufficient to keep supply in reasonable balance  I have   the sense that business people are looking hard for some early signs--and are expecting--a   slowing in economic activity, given our tightening moves  But, like us, they are not finding   much evidence   Contrary to those wishing to forestall further policy tightening, when I look at the   various inflation measures, including the broader chain-weighted measures like the implicit   deflator and the PCE deflator, I see the prospects of a gradual upward creep  Our Bank’s   forecast shows a further deterioration although, since our model is not as dependent upon an   historical-based NAIRU or uncertain output gap measures, our outlook is not as pessimistic as   the Greenbook's  As always, there are lists of unknowns and risks  The slowing in construction   may turn out to be just another pause; aggregate demand may again be even stronger than we              - 53 -     expect; and the price of oil and its implications is the new wild card  I believe the risks are such   that a still tighter policy is called for  Our staff's latest work suggests that getting the funds rate   up to 6-1/4 percent or so by the third quarter may be sufficient to get inflation headed back to the   level I believe we would like to see  Financial markets are clearly expecting some more   tightening and should we not deliver that in this case we almost surely will get an unwanted “it’s   party time” response  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5823,2000-03-21,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, but I would also like   to see a 1/4 point increase in the discount rate as a way to reinforce the message that we are   trying to send  Thank you  "
5870,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall economic conditions in our   Southeast region are little changed since March  Growth continues to be moderately strong    We can still find only scant evidence in either the regional data or anecdotal reports of any   significant slowing as a result of our earlier tightening moves  Consistent with the national   data, residential construction in our area is now showing some signs that rising interest rates   are beginning to bite  But even in that sector there are pockets of continuing strength  In   contrast, nonresidential construction might actually be picking up somewhat  We see no signs   yet of obvious overbuilding  In Atlanta 5 million square feet of new space were absorbed in   1999 and reportedly another 2 million square feet have already been absorbed in 2000       47  Tourism is quite strong, with good advance bookings  Exports from our region are up from   the early months of the year, led by a pickup in demand from Canada and Mexico  And   exports to Brazil from Florida, that state's top export market, were up 7 percent from last year,   as Brazil emerges from its slump     Labor markets continue to tell the most compelling story of resource constraints    They now have to be characterized as extremely tight  Regional employment expanded   another 07 percent in the first quarter of 2000, matching the pace of the fourth quarter of last   year  And a recent survey that I saw listed Atlanta as the fastest growing large metropolitan   area in the nation  Those ever-tighter labor markets are fueling an endless string of  “have you   heard"" anecdotal stories about how employers are coping or trying to cope  Some of the   quirkiest include a raffle for a new car for those employees working extraordinary amounts of   overtime, concierge services, including laundry drop-offs and pickups, and even pet sitting--a   new one that someone mentioned to me last week  At our directors meeting last Friday, one   director reported that his                                  had been offered and had accepted a $250,000   signing bonus to re-up for an additional 10 years  Even the government is getting into the act!   Underscoring a point that Al Broaddus made, I too am hearing more people suggest that these   nontraditional forms of compensation and concessions are not being picked up in the   traditional compensation measures          At the national level, we see the Greenbook as having done a particularly good job this   time in capturing the current situation  The pace of economic activity remains quite strong on   almost all fronts and inflationary pressures are now more obvious  Consumer spending not   only continues to be strong but, given high levels of confidence, consumers appear poised to   continue to spend at a good pace  Investment spending bounced back markedly in the first      48  quarter; and though it will surely settle back to some less dramatic rate of growth, the signs   point to considerable strength  The generally positive picture among our trading partners   suggests growing demand from the foreign sector  And the apparently even stronger-than-  thought federal tax revenues would seem to encourage higher federal spending  So, it is hard   for me to see where moderation in demand might come from   I think the inflation outlook has clearly deteriorated  For some time now we have   observed a number of developments that appear to be creating conditions in which   inflationary pressures could likely begin to build, and we wisely have been at least modestly   preemptive in trying to stay ahead of those developments  Now I think most of us, including   me, would say that we are seeing an upward drift in measured inflation, whatever one’s   preferred index  And almost all forecasts, including the Greenbook, our own Bank   simulations, and those of most private forecasters, envision a further upward drift over coming   quarters   Perhaps the most troubling of all to me is the apparent deterioration in inflation   expectations  We have worked too hard and others in the economy have paid too high a price   in the past to let our collective commitment and credibility be eroded  While there are some   risks in both directions, I believe the time has come to be a bit more aggressive in our policy   response  I think the economy has enough strength and enough momentum to absorb such a   nudge without great risks  In a vein similar to Jerry Jordan’s question to Mike Prell earlier,   our most recent modeling work suggests that if we remain appropriately preemptive, we may   not have to raise rates quite as high as otherwise nor hold them at relatively high levels for   quite so long  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5871,2000-05-16,"  I strongly support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I think all   of the right arguments have already been made  Thank you  "
5919,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would now characterize economic   growth in our Southeast region as moderately strong, with some emerging signs of slowing  Let   me first indicate what is different and what feels different from the situation at the time of our   last meeting  The most obvious and persistent signs of slowing are in our residential   construction industry  That industry is extremely important to our region  In fact, two of our   states, Florida and Georgia, are among the five states that produce 40 percent of the nation’s   new housing units  Both the data and anecdotal reports from directors and other contacts   confirm a slowdown in the pace of construction, which is most pronounced at the low end of the   market  Other industries in our region that feed off the regional and national housing industry--  carpets, appliances, and building materials, for example--are also feeling some impact from the   slowdown in construction  While less of a trend at this point, our contacts are now also   reporting some noticeable falloff in consumer spending for big ticket, high-end products     Our financial institutions are telling our lead Bank examiners that their best days in   terms of credit quality may be behind them and, consequently, there are more reports of   tightening credit standards and more cautious and less accommodative lending  One banker           48  noted that fortunately there seem to be few signs of stupid competition  There has been a   noticeable pullback in lending to marginal companies, including real estate deals where the   tenants are to be dot-com companies  In contrast to these signs of some moderation, other   sectors where we continue to see good to very good growth include tourism, most   manufacturing industries, including auto makers and auto suppliers in our region, ship building,   oil production, and commercial construction     While our regional employment growth continues to outpace the nation’s and our   labor markets remain tight, we are getting a number of reports of some emerging relief in the   sector where we first saw tightening, the construction trades  My developer and builder   contacts say that subcontractors who were often too busy even to return phone calls are now   beginning to call in search of future work  The new tightest area for skilled workers seems to   be nurses  The points of greatest price pressure remain the same  Clearly, health care costs,   including pharmaceuticals, are escalating at a faster pace and that is expected to continue  And   prices of petroleum-derived products and transportation surcharges have clearly risen  Basic   wage increases are still generally constrained, although I continue to hear many people say that   the soft costs of various perks and concessions to workers are probably not being fully   measured     On the national front, I see some of the same early signs of moderation  Those   appear to me most obvious in residential construction, where the pace has leveled off or even   slowed  Two weeks ago I had occasion to make a presentation and to stay for a candid   roundtable discussion among the directors of the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing   Studies, which is part of their School of Government  That group of some 50 CEOs and other   top officials of the largest national homebuilders and their suppliers reported a marked slowing           49  in the pace of building and future commitments to build  Again, the slowing is most evident at   the low end of the market  That group also reported some evident relief in the availability of   labor and the perception of some new buying power over their suppliers of construction   materials   I’m also encouraged to see some evidence that consumer spending is slowing, at least   somewhat  But if income gains and confidence remain strong, and if asset values do not erode   further, it is not likely that consumer spending will drop precipitously  Business investment   spending, at least for equipment including computers and telecommunication equipment, is   likely to remain strong  And the relatively positive outlook for most of our trading partners   suggests to me that demand from the foreign sector could offset some of the slowing in   domestic demand  For me, as others have already suggested, the key questions today and   tomorrow are whether the tentative signs of slowing we see are likely to persist and where we   are in terms of the lagged response to the tightening we’ve put in place over the last year  It’s   my sense that the 50 basis points of tightening that we did at our May meeting got people’s   attention  A moderation in some sectors and some less accommodative financial conditions are   now showing through, as some of our models had predicted and as we had hoped to see    While I remain concerned about the apparent upward drift in most measures of core   inflation, I continue to think we’ve been at least modestly preemptive  Moreover, our Bank’s   latest modeling work suggests that we should get a significant further bite from the tightening   we’ve put in place  While there is probably a better than even chance that we’ll need to tighten   at least a bit more, given the upside risks, our staff work does not indicate the need to take rates   quite as high as the Greenbook suggests or to hold them so high for so long  I think we could   reasonably stand pat tomorrow and not tighten further, allowing us time to get a better read on           50  where policy is, so long as we don’t inadvertently signal that we’ve concluded tightening and   that our work is done  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5920,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just note very briefly--I should   have added this yesterday, perhaps--that in our discussion of different models and various ways           117  of looking at how the economy is working at this time, I would have joined those yesterday who   expressed some uneasiness about the NAIRU construct  Like our colleagues in Minneapolis,   and I believe some from other Reserve Banks, we have been using a VAR model to try to gauge   different inflation paths given different fed funds assumptions  Our modeling work suggests   that the restraint we have already put in place is going to deliver an inflation path that is close to   100 basis points lower than we would have had without that tightening  We also ran an   experiment last week after getting the Greenbook and we used the same amount of substantial   additional tightening as assumed in the Greenbook  Our VAR model suggested that such an   aggressive degree of further tightening would involve considerable risks to the real economy    So there are risks on that side as well, it seems to me     I would join those who have underscored the importance of maintaining the bias in   our balance of risks statement this time  As we have heard each other say, we are seeing not   only the direct effects of the higher rates but maybe even more importantly a sense of caution   and prudence among the people we talk to, as a result of the tightening we have put in place    And I think it is absolutely essential that we keep that in place and not lose it at this point    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5971,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in our Southeast region remains   sturdy, but it’s clearly expanding less rapidly than earlier in the year  I sense a growing caution and   noticeably less exuberance on several fronts  Obviously, the moderation is most evident in housing    That slowing is now even showing up on the west coast of Florida, which has been so hot for so   long  Moderation in the residential housing markets now has to be considered convincing and not   just a one- or two-month phenomenon like we’ve seen earlier  Retailers also are giving us a   somewhat different reading this time around  They tell us that while sales generally continue to   meet now-lowered expectations, there are growing instances where sales have come in below   expectations   Perhaps most interesting of all to me are the comments we have been getting from our   bankers over the last six weeks  There’s an amazingly consistent report from our larger banks of a   falloff in loan demand across the region, and it’s reported to be across borrowers from many sectors    One banker reported that his bank cancelled its most recent loan review meeting because of no       34  agenda  Bankers tell us that a number of projects and spending plans have been put on hold until   their customers can assess where things are going  I’ve had similar reports from large contractors   who say they are seeing some projects delayed as owners have become more cautious     Some things have not changed in our region  Tourism activity and future tourist bookings   remain strong, although history tells us that's one of the last places people adjust their spending  The   oil and gas industry is finally responding convincingly to higher oil prices, as rig counts are now   substantially above year-ago levels and close to all-time highs  And our labor markets remain   stretched with few signs of easing, especially for skilled workers  Despite this, wages and prices   generally are not showing a large movement except for the passthrough of higher oil prices and   pharmaceutical health care insurance program costs     On the national front, I would agree with the Greenbook that there is evidence,   particularly from the more interest-sensitive sectors, that activity may be moderating  And if one is   willing to look hard enough, there are other tentative signs of moderation such as in the jobs   numbers  Overall, I still judge the economy to be strong, as evidenced by the strong GDP report and   the continued strength in business investment  Although I think we all would like to have locked in   the very low inflation numbers we saw earlier, I view recent price movements as generally   constrained  Having said that, I would join those who observe that were it not for the continued   acceleration in the application of technology and the associated productivity gains, I do believe we   would be facing a more troublesome set of inflation numbers and outlook than is evident today    While I think we can conclude that our policy moves helped nudge the economy in the direction of a   more sustainable pace, the question remains on the table as to whether we’ve done enough to damp   aggregate demand and better align it with supply       35  We’ve experienced numerous shocks on the inflation front  first, the damping effects of   the Asian crisis; and second, the rise in energy prices  Together these factors seem to be working   their way through the economy without yet engendering acceleration in trend inflation  I’m also   convinced from our model simulations that we did pay a price for our earlier reductions in rates   during the Asian crisis, and that has been a factor in the upward drift in prices since 1998  I would   say again that I still believe in preemptive policymaking  And if I fully believed the forecast in the   Greenbook and some of our own VAR modeling work, I would be more anxious to get at least   modestly more restraint in place sooner  As we continue to sort out our views on reasonable   assumptions about future productivity and to identify what portion of the general price pressures we   are seeing and forecasting is related to the run-up in oil prices--directly or indirectly--I think it’s   reasonable to let things play out a bit more  At the same time, I think it’s very important to indicate   that the balance of risks is on the side of potential deterioration in inflation, as a reminder to both   ourselves and to others that our work may not be done  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5972,2000-08-22,"  Mr Chairman, I’m comfortable with and support your recommendation    Absent some big surprise, I think we have the luxury of letting this play out  I would just underscore   Bill McDonough's comments about not doing anything to detract from the notion that we are on   watch and are prepared to move when we need to  "
6018,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would now characterize growth in our   Southeast region as moderate  While conditions have not changed materially since our last meeting,   we are seeing some further signs of slowing in the pace of growth, and I will mention just a few   More retailers than before are acknowledging that sales are falling below plans and those   expectations had already been adjusted down  The trade imbalance is very obvious in our port cities   where imports are expanding at twice the rate of exports  And we may be seeing the first hints of   some slowing in the pace of tourism  Fall bookings in our major tourist markets are just slightly   ahead of last year and growth in casinos along the Mississippi Gulf Coast has slowed markedly  The   latter may be at least partially attributable to saturation and some environmental controls over   development   We try to keep an especially close eye on real estate since it has been our region’s   Achilles heel more than once in past cycles  Although the FDIC recently included Atlanta among      40  cities where it has concerns about overbuilding in commercial real estate, our economists and bank   examiners have not yet seen the telltale signs of trouble  Office vacancy rates remain in the 10 to 15   percent range in the District’s major metropolitan areas  And commercial industrial vacancy rates in   all but Orlando have remained stable or declined in the past year or so  One area we are watching in   Atlanta is the dependence of the office market on high-tech companies  In 1999 high-tech tenants   accounted for 80 percent of the net absorption of new office space, although a good share of that was   established mainline high-tech companies and not the more volatile dot-coms  We also note a   growing sense of general caution as the pace of economic activity has moderated  Our larger banks   report that loan demand has declined noticeably from year-ago levels  And there is evidence that   financing terms are now more stringent, especially for second-tier borrowers  I also hear more   stories of projects being put on hold until the future path of the economy becomes clearer   As I noted when we last met, there are a few places where labor markets are a bit less   tight, but our regional unemployment rate is still a tick or two below the national level and labor   availability remains an issue  We detect no specific areas of new price pressures other than a general   concern about higher energy costs, their future path, and the longer-term implications   As far as the broader national economy is concerned, we see further confirming evidence   of the moderation we talked about in August  As has already been noted, in addition to a slowing in   housing and autos, manufacturing, especially outside of high-tech, continues to moderate  Our   modeling work suggests that the moderate rate of growth will likely continue  Like others, we have   spent considerable time trying to assess the implications of the run-up in oil prices  And I would   echo the comments of others that the staff papers we got on that subject were particularly helpful    While clearly there has been some modest impact on GDP, it does not appear to be large  Perhaps   the most important implication may be the effect on inflation expectations, as the most recent run-up      41  works its way through the headline inflation measures and as consumers begin to get their winter   heating bills  If the higher oil prices turn out to be short-lived, as futures markets believe to be the   case, then this may turn out to be only a modest shock   We are encouraged by the generally benign inflation data, although when one decomposes   the current inflation path into the energy component and other components, there remains an upward   tilt in core prices that should not be discounted  I think we have to be pleased with the moderation   we are getting in economic activity and the more sustainable path the economy seems to have settled   into  At the same time, I believe it would be premature to adjust our much-watched balance of risks   statement  For me at least, there are a number of upside risks on the inflation front  Those include   the uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of the recent very large productivity gains and their   implications for unit labor costs, the possibility of a more stimulative fiscal policy, and the real and   expectational inflation effects of higher energy costs still working their way through the pipeline  I   think we are where we want to be, at least for the moment  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6019,2000-10-03,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  The argument has been   well made  "
6067,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth in our Southeast region   continues to be very healthy, although since our last meeting we have seen further evidence of               32      moderation  Retail sales did actually strengthen somewhat in October and we’ve been told that   they now appear to be on plan to reach last season's levels  At the same time, most retailers   remain nervous about holiday sales--a concern that is reflected in more frequent and earlier   discounting and a cautious approach to inventories   As in the nation, residential real estate activity in our area clearly has slowed  It is   now below year-ago levels  Until very recently that slowdown had not reached Florida,   especially the booming southwest Florida coast  But that has now changed as well  A Nashville   director reported that 270 homes are now listed for sale for $750,000 or more in that market   compared with only 10 at this time last year  The nonresidential real estate market, especially for   office structures--where vacancy rates have been low and declining--has been stronger than the   residential market  Also, our important tourism industry is now anticipating a slightly slower   season than a year ago due to the impact of the slowing pace of economic growth, higher   gasoline prices, and the strong dollar   Areas of notable strength in our region include, not unexpectedly, the oil and gas   sector but also some old-economy manufacturing industries like autos and shipbuilding  The   auto industry and its suppliers continue to move south, and the backlog of orders for our   shipbuilders includes high-speed passenger ferries, large multi-deck, double-hold barges, missile   cruisers, destroyers, and even a cruise ship     Dave Stockton already commented on this at the national level, but I've been   particularly struck by the reports from our field staff of bank examiners since our last meeting    They see a measurable slowdown in loan demand across most types of business loans and a   further tightening in credit standards  Some banks tell us that commercial loan deals are               33      evaporating early in the underwriting process and that the loan pipeline is almost dry beyond 60   days  There is reduced lending to problematic sectors, including textiles, health care,   communications, and theaters, and higher pricing and a more selective granting of credit for real   estate and to nonprime borrowers  I take this information as evidence that markets are working   On the price front, the pressure points remain the same, although we are hearing an   occasional comment about the slightest--and I underscore both “occasional” and “slightest”--  relief in some labor markets  The availability and quality of labor remain a major constraint    Labor costs, especially with the renewed pressure from rising health care expenses, are still   widely perceived as a major threat to profits  We continue to get reports of new fuel and   petroleum-related surcharges but we do not detect, as others have also said, any fundamental   change in the ability of businesses to pass on most input cost increases  Profits are often the   shock absorber   Turning to the national economy, I think the Greenbook has done a good job of laying   out my own view of the likely path of the economy in the period ahead and of pinpointing the   areas where we should get some moderation  It does seem more likely now that the moderation   will persist, but our past experience reminds us that the expected pullback in investments and the   constraint on government spending could easily be reversed  Although one could take some   comfort in the recent inflation experience and the inflation outlook by focusing only on core   measures, I do not think this is the time to let down our guard  In my view it is likely that unit   labor costs will come under pressure as tight labor markets and rising health care costs intersect   with productivity gains that may well fall off to at least more moderate levels as output growth   slows  Until we have evidence in hand of the expected retreat in energy prices, I think we have               34      to watch for still more pass-throughs of direct and indirect energy costs as businesses feel the   profits squeeze   Summing up, many of our own staff forecasts, as well as those of most commercial   forecasters, suggest that inflation risks remain on the up side  Clearly, the path of oil prices and   what happens to productivity will be critical  I now believe the risks to real GDP growth have   shifted toward the down side, but there is considerable uncertainty about that  Several of us have   suggested at recent meetings that our next key policy decision may be about when to ease or   when to signal a more balanced view of the risks, but I don’t think we are yet at that point  I do   sense, however, that we might soon be facing a situation where a policy shift may be called for at   just the time when short-term indications of inflation may be on an uptrend and real growth is   slowing  Explaining a policy shift at such a time will be our challenge  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
6068,2000-11-15,"  Mr Chairman, I'm comfortable with the proposition you’ve   put on the table, subject to whatever editing of the press statement we decide to do  I’ve   scribbled a whole page of notes in support of no change in the bias, thinking that we were   going to have that level of discussion  But I’ll spare myself and everyone else the   arguments     My concluding thought, though, was going to be that I believe the long-term   consequences of a further deterioration in inflation would be a far more serious and more   damaging economic outcome than any short-term loss of output  And in response to your   comments, I hypothesized that inflation expectations haven’t moved because, according   to surveys, people are expecting us and counting on us to cap inflation at the levels we’ve   had or even move them lower  I would like to reserve the right to come back and make   my longer arguments if, during the course of the next few minutes, the weight of opinion   shifts toward the side of a balanced statement  I'm very comfortable with where you are   and with the proposal you've put on the table     If it turns out in the course of the go-around--      I'd like to come back and give you the rest of my arguments in   favor of retaining the bias, if in fact it comes to that               93     "
6113,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The evidence is now clearer that the pace of   growth has slowed in our Southeast region, although some sectors continue to perform quite well    Single and multi-family housing permits, units under construction, and home sales are flat to down   slightly from year-ago levels, although still at respectable levels  Builders tell us that traffic is down,   inventories of unsold houses are up somewhat, and price concessions are now more common  And      33  that softness is spilling over to many of our region’s related industries like lumber and appliances    Autos are showing the same pattern and that, too, is affecting the many local suppliers that feed that   industry  Commercial real estate markets have remained relatively strong across much of our   District  Neither office nor industrial markets have shown much evidence of excessive speculation   and vacancy rates are little changed  Reports indicate that fewer projects are in the pipeline, and   caution has put some plans on hold, including an in-town residential project that is planned for part   of the leftover property we recently sold that was adjacent to our new Fed building    In manufacturing, overall activity continues to moderate, with cutbacks in hours as well as   some temporary and permanent plant closings  Lumber and steel production declines are clearly due   to lower demand and to foreign competition, while cutbacks in the paper industry we've seen   recently are the consequence of consolidations and restructuring  However, all is not bad    Shipbuilding continues to expand and the Louisiana oil and gas industry is back to pre-1999 levels,   which is benefiting rig fabricators and pipeline makers  And despite the current inventory problems,   there are labor production adjustments  The auto industry continues to make long-term investments   in new and more modern plant and equipment in our region    Retail sales were reported to be moderately strong over the Thanksgiving weekend, but   colder weather may have provided a bit of a boost  Inventories are reported to be reasonably in   balance  Retailers tell us that their expectations for the holiday period are more modest than a year   ago  Tourism is a bit more mixed this time, with recent reports of continuing strength in some areas   and new weakness in others  The cruise ship business is feeling the effects of substantial new   capacity brought on-line in recent years and Florida is suffering a bit of a hangover from the pullout   of the Bush and Gore lawyers  [Laughter]   Somewhat slower growth appears to be moderating   pressures on labor markets just a bit, but scarcities in nursing and other technical skills remain       34  Finally, price pressures remain in check for the most part, despite the headline news about winter   natural gas bills that are up to triple year-ago levels     Our bankers are telling us that loan growth has slowed considerably across all business   lines  Some borrowers are reportedly complaining about the shrinking syndicated loan markets and   having to pay higher prices to generate interest in their debt issues  There has been considerable   public discussion about deteriorating credit quality, especially at large banks  While nonperforming   assets have grown at our banks this year, they are still at modest and manageable levels   Turning to the national economy, I share the Greenbook’s broad view that the slower pace   is now more obvious and evident across almost all sectors  But I continue to remind myself and   others that the degree of slowing we are seeing has to be viewed with the realization that the sky-  high levels at which we were operating simply weren't sustainable  Of course, our policy actions of   a year ago were intended to help create conditions that would discourage excesses and bring the   economy back to more rational and more sustainable levels of activity  Now that those adjustments   are taking place in autos, in equities, in credit markets, and in other areas, we should be neither   surprised nor discouraged  In fact, many of the developments we are seeing--the better control over   inventories, the better and quicker rationing of money to the construction industry, the more prudent   adjustments to credit availability generally based on borrower risk--are all positive in my view and   hopefully will help damp cyclical swings  Markets really do work   Our job now is to judge whether the path we are on is measurably below potential and is   likely to remain so  Looking forward, if investment spending slows further and inventory   investment continues to subtract from growth, if credit availability actually begins to bite, and if   companies continue to report undershoots of their earnings forecasts, then we really will have   something to worry about from a policy perspective--especially if unemployment picks up      35  measurably and spending declines further  However, our Bank's latest simulations are consistent   with a slowing of real GDP growth to only about recent estimates of trend, and our projections are   not as pessimistic as the Greenbook's  At the same time, I can easily imagine a combination of   developments that would leave us at subpar levels of growth and quite vulnerable to any negative   shock that might come along  The most recent inflation data have been generally good, although I   think the inflation risks we've pointed out before are still there, even if somewhat diminished   My overall sense is that our next move will likely be to relax policy sometime soon, at   least marginally  I'd be most comfortable at the moment, however, letting things play out a bit more   in terms of the important adjustments that are taking place and that we want to see continue  At the   same time, it would seem to me prudent and responsible to adjust our press statement coming out of   this meeting to reflect the fact that while inflation risks remain and we have not let down our guard   on that front, there are now significant risks that the rate of growth may be below what we consider   optimal  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6114,2000-12-19,"  Mr Chairman, I would prefer not to ease today  I don't know how you   scored me on your note pad, but in the go-around I was trying to convey that I came with a view that      77  a balanced risk statement would be the proper first move  My staff would tell you that we were   debating until I left for the airport whether the slowdown was as broad as we were beginning to   sense and whether the uneasiness was as great as we sensed and, therefore, whether the   recommendation you made would be the appropriate move   Vice Chairman McDonough captured my view that an easing today--although I suspect   that's where we are headed--is too much too soon  To the extent that part of what is going on is that   people are recalibrating from expectations of 5, 6, and 7 percent GDP as related to housing and autos   and cruise ships or whatever, I think that's something we ought to let play out  So I think your   recommendation is the right one  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6164,2001-01-30,"   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As Mike Kelley often says, at this   point of the go-around everything has been said  So I’ll try not to repeat it all just for the   sake of adding weight to the argument  Before I proceed, I also would like to commend   the staff for these terrific papers     First, I want to associate myself with those who would like to go to whatever   lengths we can to avoid directly acquiring private sector assets  In my view, that’s not   the preferred way to go  That having been said, there are only a few asset markets,   mainly mortgages and certain agency debt, that are sufficiently deep to accommodate the   type of operations the Desk has to do  I would agree with Tom Hoenig’s suggestion that   GNMAs seem to offer a reasonably attractive alternative     1/30-31/01 44  Contrary to Cathy’s comments just now, I’m a little uncomfortable with   expanding our involvement with agencies such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae  To me   they raise some issues that we ought to think long and hard about  I, too, would be   comfortable with continuing to use RPs and expanding their use in the way we have   discussed in the past  I think the arguments about the two-party nature of those   arrangements are well taken     I also am reasonably attracted to the ACF discount window facility  It has   some desirable attributes  I’m not as concerned as the authors of some of the papers   about the baggage that comes with that  At least as far as monitoring the financial   institutions, I think we have a fairly robust system in place for tracking and understanding   the health of our financial institutions     In connection with that, Mr Chairman, you started this discussion by inviting   questions as well as comments and I have a question about the degree to which we bump   into the Home Loan Banks’ lending programs with the type of lending that may be   involved in the ACF facility  That may be essentially a political question  But I wasn’t   sure that I got from my staff a sense of just how much the ACF would put us head-to-  head with the Home Loan Banks   I’d make two other points  One is, as we’ve talked through the various   alternatives this morning, that some significant accounting issues and questions have   surfaced concerning the adequacy of the System’s capital and surplus, which need to be   addressed as we move to a different kind of risk profile for our assets  At some point that   needs more discussion, though maybe those are implementation issues  And finally, I   appreciate the point that some people made that this problem may go away or be     1/30-31/01 45  substantially less awesome a year or two from now than it appears to be at the moment     However, we ought to be careful not to take little incremental steps along the way and   end up some place that we don’t want to be  We ought to have thought about the   endgame, at least in terms of where we’re going, as we start down this path  We should   be sure that we’re going to be comfortable with where we will come out  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
6165,2001-01-30,"   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in our   Southeast region continues to slow in many sectors, although by most measures overall   activity remains at a very high level  Retailers were generally disappointed by the flat   holiday sales compared to last year, and many expressed concerns about the impact of     1/30-31/01 137  widespread discounting on profits  A number of merchants tell us they are revising down   their expenditure plans for 2001, and some--including Sears, Office Depot, and Walden   Books--are scaling bank operations or closing stores because of weak sales  Continuing a   trend observed for several months now, manufacturers across the District reported weaker   conditions  Lumber and chemical firms continued to report sluggish activity  Paper mills   are operating far below capacity or have gone to temporary shutdowns because of weak   market conditions  Auto and light truck producers and their suppliers are cutting   production but our relatively newer auto facilities in the South seem to be less affected   than the older plants elsewhere   There are some brighter spots in our region  It will come as no surprise that   our energy extraction industry is strong  The drilling fleet is nearly fully utilized and day   rates are beginning to reflect that  In New Orleans investment in new drilling rigs,   production platforms, and wellhead equipment is increasing but oil field service   companies report that a shortage of labor is slowing investment  And new military and   private contracts continue to boost the shipbuilding industry in Louisiana and Mississippi    News from our hospitality sector remains mostly positive, although there has been some   measurable falloff in business at the big casinos and in New Orleans  There is also some   concern that as the travel season and convention dates get closer, we may see some   cancellations and falloff in business   Since our last meeting we’ve had a rash of announcements of worker layoffs   and plant closings, many among technology and Internet companies  As best we can tell,   so far those workers seem to be having no trouble quickly finding jobs with other   employers at many of the old economy companies  With the exception of medical and     1/30-31/01 138  energy costs, prices generally remain in check, and producers indicate they are still   unable to raise prices because of stiff competition and now reduced demand   At the national level, I, too, continue to be surprised by the extent of the   adjustments that clearly are taking place and the speed with which they have come on us    Like the Greenbook, I find it difficult to judge with great certainty just where we are in   that adjustment process and to forecast with any great confidence how long it will take    Everything we know about new inventory control systems would seem to suggest a   relatively quick, although dramatic, inventory correction  And I still have considerable   confidence that the great promise from technology across almost all industries and all   sizes of companies argues for an early return to substantial investment spending  My   staff’s work continues to point toward a high probability of a good bounce back to a   moderate pace of growth later this year     Having said that, I still see a number of downside risks, including the uncertain   petroleum and energy situation--punctuated by the problems in California which my   contacts in that industry say could show up in other states  While we probably can’t do   anything about the prospects for the first quarter, the rebound in the second half of the   year predicted by nearly everyone is contingent upon further declines in the funds rate in   the near term  With the real rate still higher than seems appropriate and with a very   favorable inflation environment, I think we can and should move decisively and quickly    There would seem to be little value in keeping people guessing and adding to financial   market uncertainty  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6166,2001-01-30,"  Mr Chairman, I certainly agree with your recommendation    While we have reminded ourselves over and over, including in the comments you just   made, that we can’t do anything about the short term, I think we can shore up attitudes   and expectations about what’s likely to unfold  In the notes I had written out on policy,   my final points were related to the statement that we make, which is where you ended   your remarks  While I would agree that the markets won’t be surprised by our action   today, I was surprised after our last meeting at how some business leaders and consumers   on the fringe did have the sense that perhaps things were worse than they had thought  I   believe that danger is still there, even given the expectations in financial markets  So I   think we have to choose our words as carefully as we can and try to eliminate some of the   fear that people might read into another 50 basis point move quite so soon  Nevertheless,   I certainly agree with the recommendation  "
6220,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The slower pace of economic   growth in the Southeast persists, but one gets the sense that things may be bottoming out    This overall perspective masks some very different stories by sector as well as substantial   differences in the economies of our largest and strongest states, Florida and Georgia, and   the smaller and less vibrant economies of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee    Manufacturing in our region has continued to slide, with cutbacks and layoffs at high-  tech, chemical, steel, and pulp and paper companies  Aerospace is also slowing and may   slow more since the big rocket program at Lockheed Martin apparently has suffered a     3/20/01 50  cutback  Our auto industry, which is now substantial, has not completely escaped the   industry adjustments but, with a large proportion of our auto production represented by   foreign manufacturers with relatively newer and more efficient plants, the adjustments   have been less severe  In fact, our director from Nissan reported that his company and   others are continuing to make very large investments in new plant and equipment in the   South  Energy and shipbuilding continue to be bright spots as well    A big change has been the situation in the public sector  Significant revenue   problems now exist in Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, reflecting the divergent   growth paths I mentioned earlier  Large cutbacks in education spending are being   imposed and Tennessee is imposing an across-the-board reduction  Tourism remains   about the strongest sector in our District, with almost no reports of slowing  The   snowbirds have been flocking to Florida in record numbers and expectations are for a   strong spring break as well  Perhaps most importantly, future bookings still look quite   favorable    Residential construction in January and February was at about the same   respectable level of a year ago  Inventories of unsold homes appear relatively balanced,   although some of our contacts in Atlanta, and in Tampa and Bradenton, Florida indicate   some overbuilding in the high end of the market  Commercial construction has slowed   but remains relatively healthy  A major architect told me last week that there was   noticeably less new work in the pipeline, especially in high-end hotels, as lenders are   demanding more and more equity in such projects  I was also told yesterday morning   that three major tenants in the Atlanta market who had been shopping actively for large     3/20/01 51  blocks of new space have put those plans on hold as the chief financial officers of their   companies have taken the upper hand and are working to restore margins   Labor markets have loosened somewhat in certain markets and skill areas    Unskilled workers have become more available in recent weeks, but critical shortages   remain for health care workers and information technology specialists  Finally, at the   regional level I would note that a combination of weaker demand and competition   continues to hold down prices except for the now familiar pressure points of health care   and energy costs   On the national front, the slowdown in the real economy--as opposed to that in   the equity markets--appears to be stabilizing at a low but probably still positive rate of   growth  I continue to find it difficult to judge exactly where we are in the inventory   adjustment process; the breadth and depth of the high-tech adjustment, with all its   tentacles seems problematic and likely to be more drawn out  And clearly, our somewhat   weaker economy is more vulnerable to shocks of one kind or another  My own sense is   that the rebound I still expect later this year is now less likely to be the sharp V-shape   some people are talking about and more likely to be at least somewhat more protracted   and a bit more moderate  My thinking is colored by my expectations for consumer   spending and investment spending    While consumer spending seems to have been somewhat resistant to the sharp   deterioration in consumer confidence, I would cite several arguments for why we should   see considerable moderation in consumer spending in the period ahead  After the   spending binge of recent years, debt levels have risen measurably, as highlighted in the   Greenbook                                                          runs a very large consumer credit     3/20/01 52  counseling service that sees 35,000 to 40,000 debt-saddled individuals across a wide   range of incomes each year,                                                                        that it seemed as if   the consumer hit the wall late last year  Her organization was bombarded very suddenly   and very unexpectedly with a 23 percent year-over-year increase in calls for counseling   sessions in December                                                              she reported that the increased   pace of calls had continued in January and that her colleagues in similar businesses   elsewhere in the country had had a comparable experience  When I asked her to follow   up with her counselors regarding what was driving people to seek help, she reported back   that it had been the combination of higher winter heating bills, higher gasoline costs,   reductions in overtime pay, and the fear of job losses                                                          underscored how quickly and how completely   the overtime pay had been eliminated in that industry  He also noted that the autoworkers   are very explicit in saying that it was the overtime income that had fueled their aggressive   discretionary spending  And, however one might view the wealth effect and its downside   impact now, one has to assume that the erosion of net worth will surely interrupt the   consumer’s recent practice of spending all--and in some cases more than all--of his or her   current income  So, consumer spending seems likely to grow only moderately   Likewise, I now think investment spending on equipment will rebound more   moderately and less quickly than I had thought earlier  Buyers can and likely will put off   their next round of expenditures on new technology until they repair their margins and   need more capacity  I’m hearing that whatever spending does go toward new technology   will be directed even more at cost control and cost reduction  Suppliers of technology   had their own excesses to work off, with a ripple effect down the supply chain  I still     3/20/01 53  believe very strongly in the promise of technology and the positive things that will come   with it  But I think it will take a while before we again see the type of investment binge   that helped the economy achieve the high rates of growth we had in the recent past   So, I would urge some caution regarding the outlook for both consumer and   investment spending  And I would note that the Greenbook as well as other forecast   simulations suggest that reasonable assumptions about the impact of aggregate demand   shocks--such as further cutbacks in consumer or investment spending--principally will   affect the output path over the first half of 2001  More importantly, these adverse shocks   only moderately affect the forecast for the second half of 2001 and into 2002  To me the   inference one can draw from this simulation is that a substantially easier monetary   policy--or maybe even outsized easing moves--would have a minimal impact on real   output over the near term  This means that our policy focus should be on the last half of   2001 and into 2002 rather than on the early quarters of this year, which we have little   ability to affect  I’m bothered by the growing perception that monetary policy can and   should cure all the economy’s aches and pains and do it almost overnight  Jerry, perhaps   the story behind the demand for hot tubs is that they cure pains!  [Laughter]   Our recent experience serves as a reminder to us that even a new economy can   and will develop excesses and imbalances that have to be worked through  And we need   to resist the thinking that we should try to fix the problems that invariably come from   unrealistic investments  Although monetary policy can provide a cushion during such   periods, it cannot and should not prevent necessary adjustments from taking place  Using   outsized policy easing to attempt to prevent those adjustments would only take our sights     3/20/01 54  off the longer-run consequences for inflation and for future growth that might stem from   a too accommodative monetary policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman       "
6221,2001-03-20,"  Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation,   particularly the first part of it  I must confess to being even more thrown off than   President Broaddus was in thinking that you were taking us someplace very different than   you did  I spent the first three-quarters of your presentation making frantic notes about   how to disagree gracefully!  I was thinking that a move to validate market expectations   and further confirm the moral hazard associated with not letting the market adjust would   be the worst possible outcome     I must admit that I substantially share Cathy’s and Al’s concern about the   second part of the recommendation, namely to hint that we would be inclined to an   intermeeting move  I don't view that as necessary  In fact, I believe we could make   matters worse for ourselves by doing that, though it’s hard to judge without seeing the   language you have in mind  So I would hope that either now or after we see the proposed     3/20/01 99  language we could talk a bit more about the wisdom of including that as part of the   decision today  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6264,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As best we can judge, economic activity in   our Southeast region has not changed materially since our March meeting  A general sense of   caution and uneasiness about the yet-to-be-seen signs of improvement probably best characterizes   the sentiment about the economy  Overall growth in the region continues to be underpinned by   our largest and strongest economies, Georgia and Florida  But even there, recent state revenue   data suggest some softening in activity  As elsewhere, subpar performance in manufacturing   continues, with some further employment reductions  Our regional auto industry, including our   now significant number of assembly and parts suppliers, is dealing with a slow April after having   experienced relatively more strength in earlier months of the year     5/15/01     41   We, too, made a special effort again this month to probe, through our directors, the   strength of investment spending  The clear message is that it remains largely sidelined  A private   breakfast meeting I had with the CEO of the large                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  drove home for me how business   executives are thinking and behaving  That CEO told me he simply was sitting on several large   and very strategic investment spending proposals that were on his desk  They involved spending   for long-term infrastructure that the company will clearly need, but he just wasn’t going to turn   them loose right now  He went on to say that a year ago he would have gone ahead with that   spending without any hesitation  Generally, what we’re being told about investment spending is   that it’s not being postponed while waiting for further interest rate reductions but rather for signs   that past rate reductions and other adjustments will revive demand  As one director explained,   people are simply saying, “show me the orders”     Consumer spending has posted only sluggish growth, but we’re not hearing any   substantial concerns about inventories at the retail level  And our bankers, while continuing to   worry about additional syndicated credits, are not reporting any new concerns about consumer   credit quality   Homebuilding continues to be one of the big engines of economic activity in our   region   A recent report showed that the 17,000 building permits issued in the Atlanta MSA in the   first quarter eclipsed by more than 5,000 the next largest permit growth among MSAs around the   country  And residential construction so far has remained relatively strong  Having said that, and   despite the fact that the inventory of unsold homes has not risen materially, we are now hearing   some concern about a falloff at the high end of the market  In South Florida, real estate markets     5/15/01     42   are being buoyed by the influx of buyers from Argentina and Columbia who are coming to the   United States because of fears of economic turmoil and/or political instability in their home   countries  Those immigrants represent significant drains of both human and financial capital   from those two countries   In commercial real estate, the level of speculative activity remains low  We’re also   seeing some pressure on the office space market; some space has been turned back as companies   tighten their belts  More than 2 million square feet of space have reportedly come back on the   market recently in the Atlanta area alone  A large national commercial real estate broker and   leasing agent with a regional headquarters in Atlanta reported that several large customers   recently just called off their search for additional space  And the lead partner in that real estate   firm told me that despite his own firm’s recent merger and their need for more space, he has   decided to hunker down and make do with existing space for a while     Our important tourism industry remains reasonably upbeat, but our contacts are   reporting some slowdown in business travel and some concern that future bookings may be flat   and not sufficient to fill the substantial new capacity brought on in recent years   The picture is obviously bright for our energy sector, but a large majority of the rigs at   work are engaged in natural gas exploration and extraction rather than oil drilling  Interestingly,   the support businesses of the oil and gas industry do not seem to be sharing fully in the energy   boom since new exploration and extraction processes are more efficient and less labor intensive   and, therefore, can do more with less     Finally at the regional level, labor markets have continued to loosen and price inflation   remains subdued with exceptions in a few areas, including nurses’ salaries, pharmaceuticals, and   health and insurance costs generally--areas we have heard about before     5/15/01     43   At the national level, like others, I continue to push off until later in the year any   significant turnaround and I now anticipate a longer-than-expected period of very slow growth    In addition to the inventory correction that still continues in some sectors and the dramatic   investment funk that shows no sign of turning around quickly, we’re now seeing an employment   slowdown, and its implications for consumer spending are of concern  Of course the flip side is   that the accumulating postponement of spending must be building a growing amount of pent-up   demand, which will show itself at some point  Indeed, most of our forecasts as well as those of   others outside the Fed look for a significant pickup late this year and early next year  And surely   the very substantial and very aggressive easing that we’ve put in place over the last four months   will help to fuel that rebound  Despite our continuing skepticism about whether fiscal policy   actions can be timed to contribute to additional stimulus at the right time, that still appears to be at   least a possibility    I think one has to conclude that the near-term downside risks remain significant and   probably have increased marginally since our last full meeting, and the Greenbook simulations   did a nice job of helping us to think about those risks  Nevertheless, there seems to be little   disagreement in the forecasts about the likely path beyond the next couple of quarters  While our   longer-term inflation forecasts have not been anything to brag about--and I recognize that   inflation is not many people’s chief worry at the moment--I think we may soon find ourselves   back to a more balanced set of risks  To be sure, the prospects for external shocks persist  Core   inflation by many measures has continued to drift up and, given the liquidity that has been   injected into the financial system since the first of the year, we may well have to give more   weight to inflation risks as we contemplate our next policy moves  Clearly, there are arguments   for still another aggressive easing move today, but a case can also be made that it might be the     5/15/01     44   right time to make our next easing move more measured and more modest  And at least for the   moment, I am in that latter camp  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6265,2001-05-15,"  Mr Chairman, I’m most comfortable with the comments of Al, Cathy,   Tony, and Gary  I actually would prefer to come out of today’s meeting with some clear signal   that we have slowed the pace of easing--not that we’ve stopped easing but that we’ve slowed the   pace  I did not read the announcement of our intermeeting action a month ago as signaling that   we clearly were going to move another 50 basis points today  I, too, thought about how we could   give a signal coming out of today’s meeting and concluded that we could not change to a   balanced risk statement  But it seems to me that a 25 basis point easing would be a cleaner,   preferable action  It would call for fewer words in our press statement and cause less confusion     5/15/01     92   than the other approaches that have been suggested  I’m not sure how we go from five 50 basis   point easing moves to cold turkey withdrawal from the easing process  So, I was of the view that   a 25 basis point easing today would be a clean way to get on a different trajectory for the reasons   discussed around the table that we may need to do that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I’ll echo that  "
6313,2001-06-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman  While our Southeast economy is still   showing modest growth, it has slowed further since our last meeting  We continue to look for   some first signs of a rebound, but have not seen them yet  The economist who led off the   regional part of my briefing for this meeting started his presentation with the remark “It looks   like a bummer of a summer”  Retailers seem to have grown more weary with the now sluggish   pace of sales  While sales are generally in line with lowered expectations, retailers are   pessimistic about the months ahead  For the first time since the disappointing Christmas season,   many are expressing concern about inventories being above desirable levels  Manufacturing   continues to contract, with weakness now showing up in apparel, textiles, aluminum, steel,   petrochemicals, trucks, and luxury boats  On the other hand, despite our general concern about   the pace of investment spending, companies in our growing southern auto industry, including   Nissan, Toyota, Honda, and Saturn, are proceeding with major new investments and expansions    Should over-investment result or auto sales falter, our expectation is that cutbacks would not be   at these new, more efficient facilities but rather would be borne by older plants in other parts of   the country   Reports have also been a little less positive on the outlook for tourism, one sector that   has been on my list of positives until now  While bookings are slightly below year-ago levels,   the strong dollar and higher fuel prices are both seen as cutting into business  And the fires in     6/26-27/01 84   Florida are keeping some people away  Excess capacity is also contributing to tourism’s woes, as   a host of large new cruise ships and luxury hotels are coming on line at just the wrong time     Trade in our region depends, more than in other parts of the country, on a healthy and   growing Latin America  Karen Johnson has already touched on some of the negatives in that part   of the world, but I would like to underscore the observation that developments in the important   economies of Argentina and Brazil do not bode well for the short-term outlook in South America    Argentine authorities have de facto begun to devalue the peso and have abandoned their dollar   peg under the guise of an export subsidy  In my view, that is unlikely to spur economic growth   and may well be the precursor to increased financial instability in the region  In Brazil, the   emergence of electric power crises virtually halved the outlook for real economic growth in the   short term, and further foreign investment in the region may be threatened  The two largest   economies are not the only trouble spots in Latin America, and the deteriorating overall outlook   in that region only adds to the potential for a drag on both our Southeast economy and on the   US economy more broadly   One other negative development is the deteriorating fiscal outlook for several of our   Southeastern states Revenue collections are down in Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, and   Tennessee, and spending has already been cut   The bright spots in our region remain the same  In addition to autos, which I have   already mentioned, construction is holding up amazingly well  Residential building is about flat   on a year-over-year basis but still at a very high level  Commercial construction continues at a   respectable pace but we are now seeing some slack develop, as large blocks of office space come   back on the market for subleasing and developers become more cautious  While more slack is   appearing in our labor markets, employment growth at l-1/2 percent continues to outpace that of     6/26-27/01 85   the nation by a considerable margin  Loan activity has slackened, and that is only partly due to   tighter lending standards Funds for qualified borrowers continue to be available but credit   quality concerns remain  Indeed, information from Visa--passed on by one of our directors who   manages a large credit counseling business--indicates that they have raised their estimate of the   increase in bankruptcies this year from 12 percent to 26 percent if the bankruptcy reform   legislation passes and to 20 percent if it does not  Having highlighted those concerns over credit   quality, I would observe that our bank examiners are still expressing confidence in our banks’   ability to deal with the present level of stress  Finally, the pockets of significant price increases   remain mostly the same--health-care insurance, asphalt, and trucking rates  Lumber prices have   joined that list for some special reasons   At the national level, my sense of where we are and what is likely ahead is not   appreciably different from the Greenbook's  The economy continues to stumble along, with little   evidence that the 250 basis points of policy easing that we've done this year is yet having much   noticeable effect on key sectors of the economy  Although I continue to say both privately and   publicly that I do expect to see more encouraging developments by year-end, it's hard at this   point to see where a quick shot of broad new momentum is going to come from  Our patience is   about to be tested I share the view that major new investment spending does not seem imminent   and that it's not just high-tech firms that are being cautious  The chief financial officer of UPS,   whose corporate headquarters are in Atlanta, told us earlier this week that they are holding off on   the purchase of new trucks and airplanes until business resumes  The story we hear over and   over again is that it's not lower interest rates but rather increased sales that will trigger a new   round of investment spending  Consumer spending other than for houses and autos is now more   subdued, and the underlying fundamentals other than the expected stimulus from the tax cut do     6/26-27/01 86   not suggest to me that basic spending is likely to pick up over the near term  The deteriorating   employment outlook pushes in the other direction  With corporate earnings and stock prices   languishing, there's no wealth kicker at work  And we are not going to get any push from exports   or from state and local spending over the near term   So where do I think this leaves us?  As I suggested earlier, I believe we are at a point   where we need to grit our teeth, muster up some patience, have some faith in our forecast, and   help others to do the same as well  While we are almost certain to get more disappointing data in   the months immediately ahead, it is also clear that the adjustments from the excesses that   developed earlier are well under way Furthermore, our aggressive monetary policy easing, with   its lags, and the fortunate timing of the tax law changes can reasonably be expected to kick in at   about the time the economy gets back on track for its own fundamental reasons    We’ll have our policy discussion in a few minutes, but I have a few broad lead-up   thoughts on that It's my sense that most Fed watchers have come to believe that we will   continue easing, perhaps in big 50 basis points steps, until we see concrete evidence that the   economy has turned around and has new upward momentum  That is not what I think we intend   or want to do My sense is that it is not still lower interest rates that will cure the remaining ills,   but rather some fundamental adjustments that others in the economy need to make and in fact are   making  While I recognize that not everyone is a believer at this point in the growing risks of   inflation in the outlook, I have to give some weight to those forecasts, including my own Bank’s   modeling work, that suggest it is time to give those risks more weight  Piling on still more easing   is very likely to make our job even more difficult when we need to reverse policy  Substantial   downside risks remain  One more smaller easing move now so as not to disrupt market     6/26-27/01 87   expectations at such a fragile point, along with a clear “all done” message and a reminder of the   lagged policy effects, might be our best contribution at this point  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6314,2001-06-26," Don, if I followed Governor Gramlich's comments, he was trying to   reconcile the apparent inconsistency between the expectation in financial markets of a very   prompt, quick, and fairly substantial reversal of policy early next year and the consensus forecast   for the economy      If I interpret Chart 1 following page 1 in the Bluebook correctly, the   markets expect a reversal in short rates of about 75 or 100 basis points beginning early next year    That expectation is overlaid with a consensus forecast that growth will still be picking up--and   might not even be at potential--unemployment may still be increasing, and inflation, if it comes,     6/26-27/01 137   may not yet have shown itself  Are financial markets trying to tell us that they see that degree of   inflationary pressure out there and that they think we would respond that preemptively to that   kind of phenomenon?    That’s helpful, thanks    I hope they’re right    Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation  I wish I could be more   comfortable with the balance of risks statement  I hesitate to reopen that issue even a crack  I   hope that the signaling effects of your statement will work  I find myself a good bit in Bill   Poole's camp in having the sense that the market and many of us perhaps are reading the time   dimension in the statement as a very short-term horizon  And if market participants translate that   into the view that more weak data will mean more cuts in the funds rate until the data turn   around, I don't think that's the outcome we’re looking for  I think we are going to have to come   back at some point and talk about the time dimension of the balance of risks statement  But for   the moment I support your recommendation and I hope it has the effect that you think it will  "
6374,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Last time I reported that the head of my   regional economics group had suggested that it looked as if it was going to be a “bummer of a   summer” Unless you’re a homebuilder in our region, he was about right  I'm finding it harder   and harder to find just the right adjectives to describe the degree of slowing that we are   observing in our area While I had hoped to be seeing at least a few more positive signs by now,   the overall situation is not materially different than at the time of our last meeting   Let me highlight a few recent developments  One strikingly common story now   emerging to explain what is keeping sales growth at least modestly positive can be summed up in   one word--discounting All the anecdotal reports on retail sales, auto sales, tourism, hotel   occupancy, cruise bookings, and airline traffic indicate that deep discounting is being used to   bolster sales, with obvious implications for prices and profitability  Let me cite just a couple of   examples to underscore that point  Hotel rooms in Orlando near Disney World can now be   booked for $40 a day Delta Airlines senior executives tell me that while deep discount leisure   traveling is holding up well, there is a substantial drop-off in business travel, which combined   with higher energy prices compared with 1999 and 2000 is causing their negative returns    Trucking firms are reportedly engaged in cutthroat competition, slashing mileage charges to get   freight business And concern is now being expressed that a significant number of trucking   company failures seems all but certain  Of course, retailers and auto dealers have been resorting   to sales discount programs and rebates to liquidate excess inventories   We are also getting more and more reports that companies are cutting perks and other   discretionary expenses to protect profits  Cuts are even hitting executive entertainment  Some of   you may know that bird hunting is one of the longtime favorite sports of good old boy executives     8/21/01 29   in the South; it’s a favorite executive ritual when it comes to entertainment  One of the preferred   places to go quail hunting is a plantation in Florida that caters to executives of Fortune 500   companies  Occupancy rates at that plantation typically run 98 or 99 percent and reservations are   booked a year in advance Cancellation rates for repeat customers usually are less than 6   percent But this year I'm told that cancellations have nearly doubled to 12 percent and are   reportedly coming from cutbacks by steel and chemical industry executives and their guests  Of   course, those two segments have been among the poorest performers and those industries have   been particularly adversely affected by the appreciation of the dollar   While it's true that growth has slowed, it’s also true that growth is decidedly more   uneven across industries and among different states in our region  Florida's economy is both the   largest and strongest and Georgia is holding its own, while Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama,   and Louisiana are suffering Tennessee is experiencing another year of very serious budget   problems and the governor and the legislature can't agree on a budget again this year  Someone   recently remarked in frustration that Tennessee is fast becoming the Argentina of the United   States   The District continues to see contraction in technology jobs  This has resulted in   additional commercial lease space coming back on the market, adding to an already excess   supply Manufacturing firms continue to cut jobs; and this is especially hurting Mississippi,   whose economy is more manufacturing dependent than other states in the District   Finally, there are indications that our aggressive policy easing moves have had very   little impact on business investment spending  At the same time, companies such as Delta   Airlines and some of our trucking contacts indicate that they have not curtailed their investment   plans significantly in terms of canceling orders for new planes or vehicles  In fact they say they     8/21/01 30   are using this period of slow sales to accelerate the retirement of older equipment, which   suggests to me that the existing stock is becoming more efficient  A similar story holds for   utilities in the Southeast, whose investment plans have not been affected so much by rates;   however, they have accelerated the phase-out of older plants  More utility capacity is being   brought into place than is warranted by prospective new demand, reportedly because regulatory   constraints are less than in the West   Not all is bad, however Besides the relative strength in single-family housing, we’re   beginning to pick up some hints--and I emphasize that these are only hints--that the decline in   activity may have begun to bottom out  Some bankers, for example, are reporting that their older   and more traditional customers are beginning to consider new spending and are making inquiries   at least about the possibility for additional funding   On the national front, it's easy to become impatient waiting for our previous policy   moves to have their desired effects One has to be concerned about the uncertainty regarding   where the forecasted rebound in GDP, which as others have said is being pushed back to the first   and second quarters of next year, will actually come from  Clearly, with capacity utilization   continuing to fall, investment--except perhaps investment in new power generation--is unlikely   to make a sharp rebound  Nor does a rebound in inventory investment seem imminent  It’s also   hard to imagine a sudden spurt in consumer spending, which is already reasonably healthy   relative to the underlying fundamentals  Finally, given the slowdown abroad, much of which is   itself a fallout from the pause in our own economy, we can’t expect much help from the foreign   sector My conclusion is that the risks remain on the downside  The recovery appears to be   more gradual than we had hoped and is not likely to be led by any one particular sector   This brings me to my policy concerns  The near-term outlook is still not pretty and a     8/21/01 31   good case can, and I’m sure will, be made for further easing  At the same time, I think a good   case can be made for patience and caution  I remain bothered by the rapid growth in the   monetary aggregates, which is not fully explainable  And I believe that we have already put   sufficient liquidity into the system to support sustainable consumer demand and to bring the   economy back to a desirable growth rate without too much inflation risk  But my fear is that   we’ll get trapped into following an implicit policy rule that says we’ll keep cutting rates until the   real economy turns around   That is not what I believe we should do for two reasons  First, as we have all   reminded ourselves as well as others, monetary policy is a blunt instrument  Accordingly,   succumbing to the temptation to try to adjust problems in one segment of the economy--in this   case high-tech and other business investment--may in fact over-stimulate other sectors, causing   additional imbalances to appear I interpret the surge in home prices over the last year as an   indication that consumers’ liquid funds have been shifted toward that sector   Second, I’m also concerned that a lower federal funds rate and considerable liquidity   in the banking system have added to the high proportion of loans leveraged by housing collateral    This lending has been stimulated by the perceived high value of homes and the lower rates on   home equity loans  Lowering rates further may simply encourage more home equity lending and   more sub-prime lending to marginal borrowers most at risk to lose their jobs should the   downside risks in the economy materialize  In short, I believe there is real risk of putting too   much ease in the system And I fear, as others have already suggested, that circumstances may   make it difficult to reverse course quickly  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6375,2001-08-21," Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation  I think the   arguments for another modest easing move have been made around the table  I would say that I   --and I suspect others who have offered some arguments on the other side at the June meeting--  had revised those arguments coming in today’s meeting  I wanted to make the same point,   though, that Gary Stern, Cathy Minehan, and Al Broaddus made  And that is that I’m not   comfortable yet, even with your response to Al, that we have quite figured out our exit strategy     We need a way to convey that, not only internally but externally, before we have to do too much   explaining Al, you made a sale with me!  I don’t know whether the answer is a phrase in the   statement or what  But if we continue to ease and continue to have the balance of risks statement   the way it has been, I’m not sure how we will get off that treadmill as quickly as I suspect we’re   going to want to    I hope that’s the way it’s done  "
6418,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Atlanta District’s economy   continued to weaken during the third quarter even prior to September 11th And like   elsewhere, activity has weakened further in most sectors since that time  Auto sales are   off and commercial real estate markets continue to soften  The most noticeable effects of   the attacks are being felt in Florida, which had been our region’s growth leader  As   widely reported and as almost everyone has commented already this morning, uncertainty   and perceived travel risk have hit tourism and the hospitality sector particularly hard    Tourism spending in Florida is reportedly down by about one-third, or $20 million a day    Disney World in Orlando has shortened its operating hours, eliminated overtime, and   reduced vending activities Several large South Florida hotels have cut staffing by as   much as 30 percent  And the excess cruise ship capacity I mentioned in my reports   earlier this year is now sinking parts of that industry  Reflecting the decline in travel, our   largest airlines, Delta and AirTran, have engaged in different mixes of very aggressive   cost-cutting measures including job cuts, lower management bonuses, and reduced   retirement contributions  And in some instances pilots have taken voluntary pay cuts   Employment cuts will especially affect Georgia, which may actually see some   decline in jobs in the fourth quarter for the first time since the 1990-91 recession    Reflecting the job situation, requests for consumer credit counseling in Georgia were at   record levels in August One of our Atlanta directors who runs a very large statewide   consumer credit counseling organization reported that appointments for counseling were     10/2/01 51   up 5 percent in September from the month before and jumped another 15 percent after   September 11th There’s also little change in the trajectory of the District’s   manufacturing sector, which continues to contract  Investment plans reportedly are still   very much on hold until the signs of a pickup in new orders become apparent   District auto producers reported that unit sales are around 15 to 20 percent   below plan following September 11th, even with the introduction of new incentive   programs and new models  Tennessee-based Nissan is revising down its sales and   production projections for the remainder of the year and has eliminated all overtime for   the foreseeable future  Auto parts delivery problems experienced by plants in our area   immediately after the attacks have now been resolved   State governments now face another round of budget difficulties because of   declines in sales and income tax revenues  Reflecting the slowdown, bankers report   slowing loan demand across all business lines, some tightening of credit standards, and   some deterioration of credit quality  Finally, I’d note the unusual report from several   sources that major corporations who had made previous charitable financial commitments   have begun seeking ways to gracefully shift their gifts to next year or to pare them back   significantly   On the bright side, retail sales and residential real estate markets are our best   performing sectors  While commercial markets continue to soften, single-family real   estate remains reasonably strong  Few significant imbalances in either residential or   commercial markets are appearing  Many companies are cutting hours for temporary   help Wage pressures are reported to be significant only for health-care workers      10/2/01 52   Likewise, substantial prices increases are generally limited to the health-care sector and   to liability insurance premiums, which have risen sharply of late   On the national front, as almost everyone has said, uncertainty is now the   dominant consideration whether one focuses on financial markets or the real sector  It’s   now clear that significant slowing was evident in the third quarter even before September   11th All things considered, I am a bit more optimistic than some that the shocks from the   terrorist attacks will be relatively less pervasive and less long-lasting, aside from the   obvious effects on areas such as travel and tourism  Having said that, uncertainty has   clearly increased and markets are expecting a further drop in our target funds rate at this   meeting  A further temporary drop in rates seems appropriate--but I emphasize the word   “temporary”--as a short-term effort to provide liquidity and attempt to reduce uncertainty    Unlike the economic situation preceding the Gulf War, we’ve already dropped   rates eight times and significant stimulus is in the pipeline Arguably the real funds rate   is now very low and will be approaching zero according to some measures, if we make   another large reduction today I don’t see a clear argument for pursuing such a low real   rate policy at this time as an intermediate policy path, given the current best guesses   about the likely course of the economy, except to temper further short-term uncertainty    Nevertheless, this does not seem a good time to add to uncertainty by not relaxing rates   further as the markets expect   My concern about the policy path is heightened by the belief that more fiscal   stimulus than already enacted seems quite likely and will take hold about the time many   forecasts indicate that the economy will begin to grow again  Current perceptions in   some quarters seem to be that the White House, Congress, and even the Fed will do     10/2/01 53   almost anything to try to avoid a recession or a prolonged slowdown  Quite candidly,   this worries me more than a modest recession itself  For these reasons, should we move   again at this time--and I believe we should--we need to look for ways to explain that it’s a   temporary response that will likely be reversed when uncertainty declines and markets   are more normal  Absent such an explanation, I’m concerned that the policy path will put   the economy at significant longer-term inflation risk, with all the costs and difficulties   that we understand will be associated with that  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6419,2001-10-02," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  "
6465,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The negative economic trends in our District   that reappeared in the third quarter now extend into the fourth quarter  Some sectors have continued   to deteriorate as the risks and uncertainties directly attributable to September 11th play themselves   out In particular, tourism, rental car activity, and airline traffic, although now improving slightly,   continue to be well below pre-attack levels  Airline flights are off 25 percent and planes are reported   to be only 40 percent filled Rental car companies are “defleeting” and also have canceled new fleet   purchase orders Miami’s cruise industry has been hurt by a large number of cancellations and   Renaissance Cruise Line has filed for bankruptcy  Hotel occupancy in Miami is down; hotels whose   bookings typically run at about 75 percent of capacity are now at 45 percent In Orlando, traffic at   Disney facilities is running about 75 percent of normal  Disney reportedly has asked employees to   volunteer for a 20 percent cut in hours and pay In contrast, business at casinos and hotels along the   Mississippi Gulf Coast has come back to about 90 percent of normal levels  The difference in the   experience of the two areas appears to be due to the greater dependence on air travel for most of   Florida’s customers   Turning to other sectors in the region, new and existing home sales appear to be slowing   except for continued strong growth in South Florida  Inventories of unsold homes are reported to be   too high in Tennessee and in northwest Florida  While the pace of single-family construction   remains only slightly below year-ago levels, both multifamily and nonresidential construction have     11/6/01 42   weakened further Merchants report heavy discounting and are anticipating a weak holiday season   based on “early bird” shopping While full service store sales are especially disappointing, discount   chains like Wal-Mart and Target are posting solid year-over-year gains  Auto sales dropped   precipitously in the early fall but, as others have pointed out, they picked up at the end of September   in response to extended warranties and zero percent financing  In October sales have been extremely   strong and are arguably, as the Greenbook points out, at unsustainable levels  Manufacturing   continues to be weak and contacts note falling productivity, as more resources are diverted to   heightened security  More lumber mills are closing and high-tech firms are reducing payrolls   further After having been able to report job growth better than the national average in meeting after   meeting, we are now also feeling the employment pinch  Only Florida actually posted significant   job growth in the third quarter Prices remain subdued, though we hear continued reports of   increases in liability and health insurance premiums   As far as the national economy is concerned, the data that have come out since our last   meeting have not been very encouraging  While the reported third-quarter decline in real GDP of   04 percent could have been a lot worse and may be revised lower, Friday’s negative jobs report   makes it clear that the economy is headed toward what eventually will be defined as a recession    That’s really a side issue  The key question for policy, as others have already indicated, is how   severe it will be both in depth and duration  Comparing the current situation with historical   experience suggests to me that there are reasons to believe it will not be especially deep or   prolonged First, as almost everyone has already observed, monetary policy has eased steadily since   the first of the year and is presently accommodative  Second, significant government and private   sector spending stimulus have been put in place with the recent tax cut, and more government   spending programs are likely  Security investment, rebuilding, and insurance payment flows are all     11/6/01 43   likely to bolster spending  Admittedly, these types of expenditures will not lead to productivity   increases I’m not especially worried about that because of the need to keep personal income   moving up in the near term until business fixed investment recovers  While the added spending will   help, it is really a form of stop-gap income maintenance  Third, while the economy received a major   shock on September 11th, the banking and financial sectors are sound and have proved largely   resilient Our examiners tell us that banks continue to lend prudently and that, while some   deterioration in loan portfolios has occurred, the losses are not especially worrisome at this point    Unlike the financial situation in most previous economic contractions, it’s hard to argue that   financial system weakness and reduced credit availability have contributed or likely will contribute   significantly to the decline in economic activity   Monetary policy over the past year has done what it is supposed to do and arguably   virtually all of what it can do to shore up the current outlook  The more important policy question   for the short term is fiscal policy, the impact of which will depend on how the federal tax and   spending programs are actually structured  Since a further change in monetary policy will have little   observable impact on Q4 performance, our focus should be on the projected path of the economy   over the next year and whether we believe that path is achievable  While the range of professional   forecasts for the next two quarters is quite wide, those forecasts are remarkably consistent and quite   optimistic for the second half of 2002, as is the Greenbook  Our experiments with some of those   models as well as with our own VAR model suggest that additional easing at this point is not likely   to provide any meaningful spending  In some ways, it might even hinder the adjustment process that   still needs to work its way out in many sectors of the economy  Additionally, the Greenbook   simulations of alternative monetary policies suggest that with slack demand and higher   unemployment additional attempts to cushion the economy will ultimately be associated with a     11/6/01 44   further uptick in inflation Moreover, to achieve any of these paths requires policy to be more   nimble than in the past, in terms of raising the funds rate as the economy begins to recover     I must confess that it confuses me at least a bit when Al Broaddus and Bob McTeer swap   hats! [Laughter] Nevertheless, my views today are probably closest to those expressed by Gary   Stern While we continue to face considerable uncertainty and downside risks, I believe we have   come to a point where further policy responses should be more measured  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
6466,2001-11-06," Mr Chairman, this is the most fascinating meeting in my six years at the   table People have often asked me if I ever change my mind during the course of a meeting and I   always say “yes,” but I’m not sure that I often do  Today is probably the exception  I not only went   into the weekend but I came out of the weekend thinking that either no policy action today or a   modest move was the right decision  I certainly have come some way during the course of the   meeting and I think I understand the downside risks more fully  Having said that, I’m still of the   view that a modest move today feels more right to me  I think Don made a credible argument for   such a policy I share the concerns of Cathy Minehan and Bill Poole that we may in fact build in     11/6/01 91   expectations for even more easing than we would like  I think there’s even a chance of a scare   factor; people will think that we believe the economy is far worse than they thought  Having said all   that, I support your recommendation and understand the arguments for a 50 basis point move  "
6513,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  While overall business conditions in the   Southeast remain weak, we’re beginning to get hints of at least some marginal improvement in the   consumer and related sectors  Retailers in our area indicate that Thanksgiving holiday sales met or   exceeded their lowered expectations  This is largely consistent with the most recent data on same-   store sales nationally Merchant inventories are reported to be lean and retailers are guardedly   optimistic about the prospects for the holiday season  Home construction and sales, while off their   peaks, remain at high levels, driven by lower mortgage rates   In contrast, while record auto sales occurred in October as a result of manufacturers’   incentive programs, one of our directors who owns a diverse set of dealerships in the Atlanta area   reported the worst month ever in November  And our contact at Ford indicated that their sales in the   Southeast were the weakest in the country last month  Additionally, weakness continues in the   commercial real estate sector, with commercial vacancies increasing in every major market  At the   same time, manufacturing has continued its 15-month contraction and tourism shows little sign of   recovery   Speaking of tourism, while we know that September 11th had significantly adverse effects,   particularly on the desire to travel and stay in hotels, the important question is how persistent will that   shock be Recent developments shed light on both the persistence issue as well as on how the ripple   effects are playing out Specifically, they suggest that the shock to business travel has been   significantly shorter-lived than the shock to leisure travel  Our contact at Delta Airlines reports that   overall air traffic has returned even more slowly than the pessimistic outlook the industry gave the   federal government in the first weeks following the disaster  Delta tells us that while traffic slowly   continues to come back, it is currently 20 percent below the pre-attack business plan and revenue is   still 30 percent below that plan The recovery in business travel is also reflected in major business     12/11/01 37    centers like Miami, where CVB hotels have seen a pickup in business traffic  In contrast, occupancy   rates on Miami’s South Beach and other localities frequented mainly by tourists remain desperately   low, as the key European leisure traffic has essentially dried up  As a consequence, Disney has   postponed indefinitely opening the first 3,000 rooms of an almost 6,000 room resort in Orlando  AAA   indicates that requests for theme park tickets in the Southeast are 80 percent of last year’s sales, but   their data indicate that most of the travel to these facilities is by car, not by air  Attempts at price   discounting have not worked to induce leisure travelers to return to the skies  They remain “fear   sensitive” In contrast, the evidence is that business travel is clearly more fare sensitive; airlines have   recognized this and are discounting business fares in order to sustain momentum in that area    Reflecting the reduced air traffic, car rentals in Florida for the past week are down some 25 to 30   percent from a year ago ANC Rental Corp, which owns Alamo and National and relies primarily on   air traffic for patrons, has filed for Chapter 11 protection, and a senior industry contact suggested that   not be far behind In an effort to cut costs, car rental firms in Florida are reducing their   fleets and have dumped an estimated 50,000 vehicles onto the used car market in the past 90 days    Interestingly, Hertz is not among these companies  It’s a subsidiary of Ford and has been prevented   from responding to market pressures in the same way as the independent firms  Two Florida cruise   lines have also filed for Chapter 11 protection, and two others have merged     The fallout from these travel-related developments is also being felt in the services   employment statistics  The Sixth District was home to some of the strongest growth in services   employment in the nation during the 1990s  In particular, almost 40 percent of Florida’s 7 million   plus workforce are employed in the provision of nonfinancial, nonretail services; the state has about 50   percent more people employed in hotels and related activities than the national average  As a result,     12/11/01 38    the slowdown in tourism has hit service-related jobs hard and will continue to do so for some time in   the future   We have continued to press our regional contacts for insights into when we might expect to   see some recovery in investment spending  While excess capacity in most industries certainly will   discourage spending to add capacity, there are now some signs of renewed spending on technology    Our contact at the corporate headquarters of UPS in Atlanta tells us that while they have cut spending   on trucks and planes, they are planning a 6 to 7 percent increase in technology spending next year   because of its central and growing importance to their business  Likewise, a contact from Cingular   Wireless, a major telecommunications firm serving our region, tells us that they plan to go ahead with   substantial investment in a new generation of technology next year in hopes of getting a jump on the   competition   On the national front, I believe the extraordinary uncertainty affecting the national outlook,   which concerned us all at the last meeting, may be resolving itself at least somewhat  While I’m not in   any way suggesting that the economy has turned around, it would appear that the run of high   frequency data released in the last week or so has been more positive and could be suggestive of a   response to the stimulus already present in the economy  As noted in the Greenbook, personal   spending is up relative to expectations and the manufacturing sector has begun to show some signs of   life And several major tech firms, including Intel and AMD, have revised upward their sales   expectations, so perhaps that sector may be on the verge of bottoming out  The new technology   spending plans of a couple of the large regional companies I just cited a minute ago are consistent with   that view   As Dave Stockton noted, a major difference in the outlook from our last meeting is the   prospect for additional fiscal stimulus, which now looks more problematic than it did a month ago      12/11/01 39    That is reflected in one of the alternative Greenbook simulations  This would cause me more concern   except for the fact that we have a direct stimulus from the significant drop in energy costs, which has   added to income and has lowered costs   We estimate this has added as much as 1-1/4 percent to   disposable personal income in the second half of this year--and our estimates do not take into account   the extra bonus of a warm winter so far   As we move to our policy discussion, I would join President McTeer in urging patience, in   light of indications of an emerging recovery  The prospect of a recovery is also supported by the   improved situation in equity markets  I am not convinced that a further move at this time will alter the   near-term path of the economy by speeding up the recovery  Finally, I’m not enamored with the   argument that we need to move now as a precaution against further shocks, as yet unrealized     In short, I don’t think we need to do something just to do something or simply to ratify   market expectations  I think it’s probably time to give greater weight to longer-term considerations    Thank you, Mr Chairman    I won’t do it again, I promise!  "
6514,2001-12-11," Mr Chairman, I can accept your recommendation, but I have a preference   for no change at today’s meeting  I would like to associate myself with President Stern’s comments         12/11/01 94    It seems to me that after eleven months of very aggressive front-loaded easing and having been in an   accommodative stance for some time now--the degree of which we could argue about--we have the   latitude to pause today That’s not to say we can declare victory but I think we ought to pause and see   how things play out People around the table have made the point that we’re very likely to see some   more ugly data over the next couple of months or next couple of quarters  But I would argue that there   is some considerable value in signaling several things  One is that we are seeing some first signs--I   underscore first--of stabilization and that many of the further adjustments that still need to be made are   not particularly interest rate sensitive  And finally, having done what we can to cushion the slowdown   over the cycle, we can send the message that we have gotten back to--in fact have never gotten away   from--a focus on the optimum long-term policy  Perhaps the statement that you have crafted will   achieve much of that, but I think there is some significant value today in making some of those points   to the people who watch what we do Thank you, Mr Chairman        "
6568,2002-01-29," Most of the points I wanted to make have been made, so I won’t repeat   them  But building on what Tom just said, couldn’t we make the argument that if we were to   release the minutes a bit earlier, perhaps in ten days or two weeks, that that would be   satisfactory? I’d suggest that we give ourselves more time to think about this question and even   work more on the legal issues and then perhaps come back in another meeting or two and discuss   it further I think it could be argued that to proceed with the proposal that is on the table at the   moment might harm the decisionmaking process significantly  So, if in fact we have the option           January 29-30, 2002 Page 142 of 194  of coming back to this issue with the prospect of releasing the minutes on a more timely basis—   in a week or two—would that not reasonably pass muster?  Couldn’t we delay the release of the   vote tally for that short a period of time in order to get the decision in the right perspective and   be sure that we don’t harm the process?  "
6569,2002-01-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall business conditions in the Sixth   District are now more mixed than I reported at the last meeting  While clearly not as positive as   some read the evidence at the national level, things are marginally less negative and at least are   not inconsistent with the suggestion that activity may have bottomed out  For example, our   consumer sector continues to display resilience  Most merchants noted that sales had met or   exceeded their expectations  But I must add that this was not the case for smaller specialty   stores Discounting continues to be widespread, and the majority of the people we talked with   said that their profit margins were noticeably worse during the fourth quarter than a year ago    The most positive reports continued to come from discount retailers like the Wal-Marts of the   world, whose profit margins were steady and whose sales growth was higher  Automobile sales   remained solid but predictably were down from their high levels in November as the incentive   programs played out  Real estate agents and homebuilders in our area noted an improvement in   home sales in December from the November pace, and the volume of new permits issued   remained strong, especially at the low end of the market     Our important tourism industry and travel-related activity are still hurting, although we’re   seeing some gradual improvement  Markets such as Orlando are under considerable stress   because of the low number of visitors and the abundance of hotel space  The key factor in south   and central Florida has been the decline in the number of European visitors  Airport traffic   through Miami International Airport was down 11 percent from year-ago levels, and advanced   bookings at resorts for the first quarter of 2002 were 10 to 15 percent below last year’s level    Reports suggest that several Orlando hotels are in serious financial trouble, with a number of   borrowers having failed to make required debt-service payments  Additionally, the corporate   travel market remains soft  Conventions are not being cancelled, but attendance is low  Reports     January 29-30, 2002 Page 94 of 194  that car rental rates are beginning to increase and the fact that airline discounting is being scaled   back may signal some improvement in business demand conditions     Our manufacturing sector remains weak overall, and layoffs continue at a fast pace in the   apparel industry, which accounts for one-third of the District’s job losses during this contraction    At the same time, new orders have improved for some producers of industrial electronic   equipment, and some firms have even noted that they were rehiring some staff and extending   production hours Not surprisingly, producers of security equipment reported strong growth in   demand since September 11, and both Lockheed Martin and Gulf Stream continued to benefit   from federal government and foreign government programs and from the demand for private   secure plane travel     Large cost increases continue to be noted in health care in the form of higher wages for   health care workers and higher health insurance costs to employers  Bankers in our region, while   slightly more optimistic than in December, still report that they are flush with liquidity    Commercial loan demand is limited to nonexistent  A contact at Equifax, a leading provider of   credit rating services, indicated in recent conversations that the firm had several new and very   attractive credit-related products but was unable to generate any interest in them from their   customers  The senior executive I talked with likened the hunkering down of business   executives to a “deer in the headlights” phenomenon     Commercial real estate markets have remained weak in the District  State and local   government projects, which as someone else noted had taken up some of the slack as commercial   projects dried up, have now also slowed markedly as local governments face their own budget   pressures The CEO of one very large commercial builder told me on Monday that he fears a   significant gap in building activity before it gets restarted     January 29-30, 2002 Page 95 of 194  On the national front, the recent flow of more-positive information, which many of us   have noted in our public statements since the first of the year, suggests that we may now be at or   near the bottom of the cycle  The deterioration of the labor market seems to be easing, with   average hourly wages and the workweek rising and jobless claims continuing to fall  Even small   businesses are noting that some jobs are becoming harder to fill  Both of the consumer   confidence surveys, which I take as coincident indicators, are now less weak  Even   manufacturing, as measured by industrial production and demand for core capital goods, is less   weak Also, the signs of renewed demand for noncommunications equipment are encouraging    While caution dictates that we not become over confident and declare victory prematurely, I find   it interesting and reassuring that this is the first time in three or four months that the professional   outside forecasts, our own internal models, and the Greenbook do not contain further downward   revisions Furthermore, with the exception of Argentina, forecasts for the rest of the world have   been revised upward   While the evidence suggesting that a recovery is under way has become more convincing,   the strength of the recovery once we get past the initial boost from a significant inventory swing   is less clear to me  Like those who prepared the chart show for yesterday afternoon, my staff   devoted considerable time in our briefing earlier this week to looking at how various sectors   behaved in the quarters leading up to the recession  That work underscores how differently a   number of important factors varied from other recent cycles  Those differences and the   questions they raise about how the same sectors will behave coming out of this recession point   out the uncertainty and the risks we face in trying to ascertain the shape and strength of the   recovery I’m particularly struck by the remarkably strong consumer spending and housing   numbers  Like some others who have commented already this morning, I think one can make a          January 29-30, 2002 Page 96 of 194  good case—and the Greenbook has done that to some extent—that we are likely to get only   modest additional contributions from those sectors in coming quarters  I may be even more   cautious in my outlook for those areas because I think there’s a reasonably high probability that   job losses still to come will be greater than in the Greenbook baseline forecast  And therefore,   the return to job growth may look more like what we saw after the 1990-91 recession    Businesses are under more pressure than ever to show profits and very likely will continue to   squeeze their labor costs   I have argued in the past that the outside reading of the implicit policy rule being   followed by the Fed is to cut the funds rate until we see signs of a turnaround in economic   activity The economy seems to be at that point  While further fiscal stimulus now looks less   likely and probably less needed, significant monetary stimulus remains in the pipeline  Thinking   more now about the longer-term path of policy, further easing at this point would appear to   hamper our ability to return the funds rate to appropriate levels as we get into the recovery    Thank you, Mr Chairman    "
6570,2002-01-29," Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  "
6629,2002-03-19," Mr Chairman, just to complete the go-around, let me associate myself   with those who have a preference for the GNMAs as opposed to the foreign debt alternative  My   staff tells me that we’d be smart in the short run to concentrate on repos, even with Ginnies    Apparently there are some rather difficult accounting issues that need to be explored as far as   outright purchases are concerned So I would put myself in the same camp as others who have   taken that position    I assume that we could do more, as the first cut—do more repos before   we do outright purchases    I’m comfortable with where you came out  With time to think about it, it   doesn’t seem terribly threatening to have the vote released  It’s far better than any of the           March 19, 2002 Page 104 of 117  alternatives, which all seem to create another policy event of some kind  In my view, the last   thing we need is another interim statement or announcement regarding our policy decision  I   share President Broaddus’s thoughts that if we could release the minutes earlier, even if it’s a   week earlier, that might be desirable  So that’s something that I think we still ought to consider   and get back to But I’m comfortable with where you came out  "
6630,2002-03-19," Mr Chairman, business conditions have also improved in the Sixth   District since our last meeting  Indications are that the pace of economic activity is increasing   despite the fact that conditions in some industries and some regions are still quite weak  The   District’s single-family housing market remains strong, fueled by low mortgage rates  However,   the large, stale inventory of high-end homes has shown little sign of declining, and one builder is   now referring to these as “yet-to-be-used” homes [laughter] because he says he cannot in good   conscience continue to call them new after having been on the market for so long  A similar   problem remains in our District’s commercial real estate market  Vacancy rates are high, and        March 19, 2002 Page 62 of 117  reports of rent concessions are prevalent  One large and very successful commercial   architectural firm—in fact the one that did our building—initiated a first round of layoffs last   month And major commercial builders tell me that they routinely are seeing eight to ten bidders   on jobs that used to draw only two or three     Our tourism and hospitality sector continues a slow but steady recovery  Airport   passenger traffic has improved every month since September  Delta tells us that their domestic   traffic was down a little over 8 percent in February from the same period a year ago, with   international traffic still down about 13 percent  Delta has not sat idly by, though  They have   used this period of extraordinary stress to do some very aggressive cost cutting  By dropping and   only slowly restoring a number of flights, the company has actually achieved higher load factors   than it had pre-September  In addition to cutting food service, they have announced the   discontinuation of payments to travel agents And just last week they announced that there   would be no wage increases for non-union, non-management workers in the year 2002     Our manufacturing sector is still mixed but is beginning to show signs of returning to   some stability  Planned production cuts in March at the Ford auto assembly plant in Atlanta   were not executed because sales of the Taurus model that is being built there for the rental car   industry had improved significantly  In contrast, the former Lucent fiber optics division will lay   off 300 more workers because of continued weakness in the telecommunications industry  At   Lockheed’s Marietta plant this week 2,700 union machinists walked off the job in a dispute over   job guarantees Interestingly, the average age of the striking workers is 53, with twenty-one   years of experience at the Lockheed plant     Regional transportation businesses reported that rail and truckload volume improved for   some commercial and industrial cargo but remained weak for coal, forest products, and paper      March 19, 2002 Page 63 of 117  The paper and pulp and textile-related sectors continue to struggle  The trade dispute over steel   tariffs has come home to roost so to speak, as Russia banned American shipments of poultry   products to their country This development does not bode well for Southern poultry producers   where exports from Georgia and Mississippi currently account for about 15 percent or more of   the local poultry industry’s revenue     On the national front, the flow of more positive information that many of us noted in   January has continued, enhancing the chances that the recession has bottomed out and that the   economy is on a more upward trajectory  However, I’m not yet prepared to be quite as   optimistic as either the Greenbook or our own Bank’s VAR model forecast about the speed or   the trajectory of the recovery I continue to be somewhat cautious, thinking that, after the   inventory rebound has materialized, growth in final demand may be more modest than some are   anticipating, with less improvement in profits and investment spending  One of my directors last   week quoted someone as suggesting that it’s beginning to feel like a profitless prosperity  In   addition to other fundamentals that would seem likely to temper the vigor of the recovery, the   recent rise in oil prices, as others have mentioned, could have a damping effect on demand and   serves as a reminder of the risks that once again may be facing us     Balanced against these cautions I do recognize a number of factors that are consistent   with the more positive outlook presented in the Greenbook  First, substantial stimulus remains in   the pipeline The money supply continues to grow at a very strong pace Second, it’s now clear   that government deficit spending will likely expand, adding to aggregate demand  And the   recently passed investment tax credit, as almost everyone has suggested, should further bolster   demand for equipment and software, which already appears to be picking up  In that regard, I   would mention a confirming anecdote from the chief financial officer of UPS  He noted that     March 19, 2002 Page 64 of 117  semiconductor shipments from Asia were running about 8 percent higher in December on a year-  over-year basis and that this trend had carried over into the first quarter of this year    Additionally, while paring back their purchases of  vehicles and airplanes, UPS told us that they   are pushing ahead with their own computer and software investments  And our contact at   Cingular Wireless, headquartered in Atlanta, indicated that they were pushing ahead with the   roll-out of a new generation of wireless services on a pilot basis in California  Third, our recent   contacts in the auto industry indicate that early March auto sales are continuing at a 16 million   pace Given that automakers show few signs of pulling back rebate and favorable financing   programs, there may be little or no payback from last quarter’s extraordinary sales  Fourth, the   sustained rebound in productivity noted in the Greenbook may portend a more positive outlook   for growth That, coupled with the fact that many firms drastically cut their workforces, may   present a more positive profit picture, especially if firms remain cautious about hiring    Consistent with Tom Hoenig’s comment just before the break, some of our directors suggest that   this is the case in reporting that incremental additions to the workforces of many firms are   occurring through the hiring of temporaries rather than full-time employees  Putting this all   together leads me to the conclusion that the risks to the expansion have clearly become more   balanced Having said that, I would emphasize that I do not believe that the downside risks have   gone away or gotten substantially smaller And I think we have time to judge more carefully the   momentum of the expansion before we start reversing the path of interest rates     Now more than ever we need to think about the longer run, and I believe that the   Greenbook simulations help us in that regard  Frankly, if offered the opportunity to lock in any   one of the forecasts in the alternative simulations in the short run, I would take it in a minute  At   this point, my own hunch is that the slower growth scenario may be among the most likely                  March 19, 2002 Page 65 of 117  Looking forward, however, it’s clear that rates currently are unsustainably low  They will soon   need to begin to rise Hence, I believe we must get in a position to make that happen  Suppose   we ask ourselves, What should the nominal funds rate be with a real GDP forecast of 3 to   4 percent, as now reflected in the Greenbook, and PCE inflation between 14 and 16 percent?  It   seems clear that the answer would not be “near 1¾ percent” but something more like “4 to   4½ percent” This means that we have a lot of work to do  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6631,2002-03-19," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  "
6686,2002-05-07," Mr Chairman, economic conditions in the Southeast are improving   marginally but at the same time remain quite mixed  Several sectors began the second quarter   with modest growth or signs of improvement, whereas some other areas continued to display   significant weakness  For example, retail sales rose modestly in March, but regional auto sales   continued to disappoint relative to national sales, with the exception of foreign makers, who   reported healthy gains While the overall residential housing market remains strong in most   parts of our District, most of the builders and realtors report signs of softening in selected price   segments and selected geographic regions  Commercial real estate markets continue to suffer   from weak demand, and there are few signs that that will change anytime soon  In Atlanta the               May 7, 2002 39 of 81  office vacancy rate is now at 20 percent  As a consequence, rental rates are falling, and   substantial incentives are being offered in the form of free rent and higher build-out allowances    The tourism and hospitality industry continues to improve  The outlook for the summer is   positive and resorts and theme parks are having trouble filling both seasonal and nonseasonal   jobs such as wait staff, security workers, and housekeepers  Disney has openings for some   700 positions, and Royal Pacific Resort in Orlando is set to hire about 1,000 workers  Business   travel, however, has yet to come back  Reports to us from Delta Airlines indicate that load   factors on the high-margin traditional business routes remain well below those for tourist   destinations  As an aside, the effects of September 11 and the decline in travel to Florida help to   explain the lagging performance of District domestic auto sales that I noted earlier  The lagging   sales turn out to be concentrated in Florida and are driven by lower fleet sales of rental cars     Manufacturing and manufacturing employment remain weak  There are meager signs of   improvement on the manufacturing employment side, as some laid-off workers at some plants   are being recalled and the pace of job cuts has slowed  Our growing southern auto industry,   which consists mainly of foreign producers, has been a source of employment strength  But this   reflects more secular rather than cyclical factors  Our contact at Nissan reports that it hired for a   new plant a number of maintenance engineers recently laid off at nearby paper mills The   growing popularity of Nissan’s Altima model has required the addition of an extra hour to each   day shift at the assembly plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, during April  In May that assembly line is   scheduled to go from working one to two Saturdays a month to keep up with orders  Similarly,   reflecting increased demand by trucking companies, Peterbuilt Motor Company in Tennessee is   rehiring about 300 workers and more than doubling production at its heavy truck plant, thus   reversing a series of layoffs and production cuts during 2001  This demand, however, is         May 7, 2002 40 of 81  apparently related to an attempt to avoid the impact of tighter EPA regulations slated to go into   effect October 1 that would increase the cost of tractors by 5 to 10 percent  As a result of all this   auto and truck assembly activity, parts suppliers in the region are also expanding their output and   employment  Overall, however, District employment remains flat  And consistent with the most   recent national labor market report, which came out last Friday, our firms report that what new   hiring is taking place involves mostly adding more temporary workers and increasing hours, a   pattern others have already reported   We also received reports that firms are economizing on labor by spreading out IT   projects, which have previously been done simultaneously with a larger workforce  Not only are   firms managing their workforces carefully, there’s growing evidence that IT wages are becoming   more flexible downward Some contract IT firms have indicated that they are easing out higher-  paid technical people by encouraging them to take lower pay from customers rather than face   being laid off Having said that, District unemployment remains below that of the nation and in   March was about 53 percent   On the national front, the puzzle remains as to what the path of the recovery will look like   and the speed with which growth will return to potential  I find myself about where I was in   March on this point and my concerns are virtually identical to those I expressed at that time    Will the strength in housing and consumer demand continue to support the economy until the   inventory liquidation cycle ends?  When will business investment turn around?  And how much   stimulus from previous easings of monetary policy and increases in government spending last   year remain in the system?  Furthermore, I find few clues in the recent GDP number to answer   these questions It provides little hint of forward momentum in the economy and, in fact,   probably raises more questions than it answers  The boost from inventories, reflecting a slower                   May 7, 2002 41 of 81  pace of liquidation, tells us very little about when businesses will actually begin to rebuild   inventories  Consistent with this, our contacts suggest that at least some firms are cutting orders   from abroad and continue to move toward greater reliance on just-in-time inventory management   by placing smaller orders more frequently with domestic suppliers  Consumption spending was   off significantly from the 61 percent pace of the fourth quarter  The 8 percent decline in   durables was nearly offset by the increase in nondurables spending So the net on the   consumption side was accounted for by a 38 percent increase in services Does this portend less   support from consumption going forward?   It’s also still my view that we should expect only a modest contribution from residential   construction  The recent slowing that we’re seeing in some segments of that market raises   questions about how much growth can come from that sector  Finally, with state governments   feeling more and more fiscal pressure and having already drawn heavily on their rainy day funds   and revenue windfalls, can we count on additions to aggregate demand from that sector?   As for policy concerns, since we can’t do anything to change the near-term outlook, we   must by necessity be more forward-looking  I was among those who noted last time that rates   currently are unsustainably low and that they will soon need to begin to rise  The question is   whether now is the time I have two worries, but when I balance them out I would argue that it is   not First, I’m concerned about our extensive policy easing last year when combined with the   recent rise in energy prices  If policy is too easy and if energy prices were to continue to   increase, is there a risk that we won’t act to tighten policy because of perceived risks to the real   economy?  Is there a risk that by not tightening in such circumstances we would unintentionally   convert a relative energy price increase into an across-the-board increase in prices more   generally?  That is what happened in the 1970s  The only difference is that energy prices rose               May 7, 2002 42 of 81  and we then eased policy whereas this time policy was eased, admittedly for other reasons, and   then energy prices rose Given the lags in policy, I see little difference in the ultimate   consequences for inflation   My second concern, though, is that, if we tighten policy preemptively, there is the risk   that we could damage prospects in the key segments of the real economy we’re counting on to   move the economy forward, namely housing, investment, and consumer spending, all of which   are interest rate sensitive  The alternative simulations we’ve investigated, including those from   our own model and those in the Greenbook, are still fairly optimistic  However, they may look   less so if we get a combination of the flatter investment spending and lower productivity growth   scenarios that are in the Greenbook, which I think is certainly possible  That’s not a scenario we   would want to help materialize  So at this time I think preemptive tightening would be a risky   strategy As others have said, we seem to have time to let things play out a bit more and get the   situation in better focus before we begin the inevitable policy reversal  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
6687,2002-05-07," Mr Chairman, I agree as well  "
6791,2002-08-13," It’s nice to be back, thanks    I wouldn’t dare do that  "
6792,2002-08-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Southeast have   deteriorated somewhat further across almost all sectors since our June meeting  I keep looking   for positive signs of a pickup in growth, but evidence seems sparse at this point  One   consolation is that activity remains at a relatively high level     Turning to individual sectors, regional retailers report that sales weakened overall despite   an improvement in auto sales  Manufacturing activity in the Southeast continued lackluster, but   executives remain relatively optimistic, and inventories are reportedly balanced in most cases    Our contacts report that technology spending in the District has generally been restricted to   software upgrades, with substantial new investment remaining on hold  Our growing regional   auto industry is one area that continues to invest and expand  One announcement was unique    One of our Tennessee directors is a top North American executive for Nissan, and he told us that   Nissan plans to increase capacity at their yet-to-be-completed Canton, Mississippi, plant by   adding some 1,300 additional jobs even before producing the very first car  I believe that may be   the first time that kind of thing has happened in the United States  The rest of our regional auto   industry also continues to expand, reflecting the strong auto sales nationwide  Honda is   expanding its Lincoln, Alabama, plant and plans to add 2,000 jobs in 2004  And a number of   other such announcements have been made in recent months   Reflecting the slow pace of manufacturing, employment growth in that sector remained   modest at best However, overall District employment shrank about 07 percent, slightly less   than in the nation as a whole Florida and Georgia did register modest job gains in June, but the   other four states in our District posted job losses  Despite the lower payroll numbers, the District   unemployment rate actually declined 02 percent, to 52 percent, in June because the labor force   shrank for the second consecutive month            August 13, 2002 29 of 92  The other positive sector continues to be housing  Residential markets posted more-  moderate growth in recent months, but activity remained at very high levels  New home   construction was essentially flat, and inventories were balanced in most markets  Home sales   rose modestly in June compared with a year ago, and realtors generally anticipate that sales in   the third and fourth quarters will exceed year-ago levels  The chairman of our Bank’s board is a   large custom homebuilder, operating in several states, and he reports that the high-end market   clearly has softened in a number of cities  Multifamily housing and commercial real estate   remain weak, although some improvement in industrial leasing is showing up in a few markets    In contrast, as elsewhere, the office market shows no sign of improvement yet, and my inquiries   among leading architectural firms have picked up few signs of new activity in the pipeline    Meanwhile reports from the tourism and hospitality sector were not as upbeat as earlier   this year Disney says it is operating at 90 percent of normal capacity for this time of year, and   visitors appear to be staying for shorter periods and spending less this year compared with last   year Business travel is still quite weak   There have been some concerns expressed recently about a possible credit crunch, but   that isn’t consistent with the information provided by my examiners or what we are hearing   anecdotally Consumer lending continues to increase moderately, and the share of problem   assets remains relatively low  In most areas, banks continue to report little growth in commercial   loan demand  And mortgage lenders, not surprisingly, say that they expect continued strong   demand from borrowers in the second half of the year   Finally at the regional level, I would note that the only current price pressures showing up   are for health care, insurance, and steel  The impact of the 30 percent tariff on imported steel is   particularly pronounced and is being felt in steel prices across the District  Some car               August 13, 2002 30 of 92  manufacturers and others tell us that they are now facing double-digit increases in prices of   imported steel goods     On the national front, the high-frequency data combined with recent revisions to both the   GDP and the productivity statistics are not as encouraging as we might have hoped following our   last meeting  Virtually all forecasts have been revised downward, reflecting lower growth rates   for key components such as investment, weaker data on consumer expectations, construction,   manufacturing, core capital goods, and all the other things that people have already listed  My   own expectations going into the year were perhaps a bit more modest than some  But I’ve been   disappointed that we are not yet seeing some early signs of building momentum  As a great   believer in technology, I had expected to see more investment spending of that type by now, both   to reduce costs and to exploit new product opportunities  But even that has been slow to get   restarted   Putting all the data and the stories together, the picture that emerges for me is one of   businesses still very much hunkered down, putting off both investment spending and additions to   staff Despite that, unemployment, if it does not rise appreciably further, is still at a relatively   modest level compared with some other cycles  One of my economists half jokingly reminded   me that current unemployment is actually below some earlier estimates of NAIRU  The current   level of employment is still providing income at levels to support some growth in consumer   spending despite the adjustments taking place there  And it’s hard to see any big kick from   government spending over the period ahead, as growing pressures on revenues and spending at   the state and local level are offsetting some of the federal spending that we’re getting   All things considered, I share the Greenbook’s view that the most likely path over the   near term is slow, unexceptional, growth that only gradually moves back toward potential next            August 13, 2002 31 of 92  year While it is easy to get impatient, as many people are now doing, it’s important as we move   into the policy discussion later to remind ourselves and others once again just how   accommodative policy already is  And we need to avoid the unintended consequences of   possibly doing something at this point that would thwart the generally orderly adjustment   process that is still taking place in a number of areas  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6793,2002-08-13," Mr Chairman, I can be comfortable with what you suggest, but I would   want to associate myself with the position that President Broaddus first expressed and a number         August 13, 2002 85 of 92  of people agreed with I think we’re still learning how to use both the bias and the press   statement that we consider at the end of each meeting  I was looking forward more than usual to   the distribution of the draft press statement, hoping that the word wizards had found some    language short of a change in the bias that might convey the same message  I share the concern   expressed by some other people that many observers, probably most, will read a change in the   bias—at least until we get a string of good data—as suggesting that we’re going to ease    Ironically, I think that’s an added uncertainty that we really don’t intend to convey today  But I   accept the arguments on the other side, and were I voting, I certainly would not dissent today   over the change in the balance of risks statement  Thank you  "
6844,2002-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Southeast has   continued to advance at a lackluster pace since our last meeting  And it’s my sense from   conversations with business community leaders that we have lost some of the momentum and   cautious optimism that we were seeing earlier in the year  Consumer spending is showing the   same pattern that it has at the national level  Home sales and residential construction remain   strong in most of our markets, yet there are continuing reports, especially from the chairman of   my board, of growing softness in higher-priced homes  Also like the nation, auto sales remain   very strong, given the reinstatement of incentives  Retail sales of nondurable goods rose only   modestly across the region in August, and back-to-school sales were reported to have been soft   and disappointing   State budgets are feeling the pinch of tax receipts that are running below forecasts    Leisure travel to resort areas in the District has improved slowly, supported primarily by driving   travelers But business travel and related convention business, which is important to many of our        September 24, 2002 37 of 115  major cities, has been weak and continues to disappoint  Business spending remains subdued    With the exception of our growing and vigorous southern auto industry, manufacturing appears   to have lost some momentum as well  Almost any postponable expenditure is still being   deferred, and businesses are not adding significantly to payrolls  The large international   temporary employment company headquartered in Atlanta tells us that the growth in temporary   employment demand that was showing some  pickup in the spring and early summer has   plateaued And there has not yet been any significant sign of employers wanting to convert   temps to permanent hires, a clearly identifiable stage in an employment rebound which that   company says was evident in past recoveries   Probably the weakest sector in our Southeast region is commercial real estate  That   market is essentially dead in the water, and large contractors who do the bulk of this work report   that there are not even any early conversations with businesses about new projects  Inquiries   further back in the construction food chain—to architects in our area—brought the same reports    Even new public projects funded by state and local governments seem to be drying up as current   work is completed, reflecting the growing pressures on state and local budgets   Consumer lending continues to outpace commercial loan demand  While we’re hearing   mixed reports on consumer bankruptcies and defaults, data being shared with us by the large   credit reporting company, Equifax, suggest that debt service burdens have come down over the   past year, especially for those in the highest income class  Consistent with this observation, our   bank examiners report that consumer credit quality at District banks is either holding or   improving, with no significant surprises  Somewhat contradictory to that information, we’ve   received several recent reports, including some from participants at our Small Business Advisory   Council meeting last week, of slower payments on accounts  While some of that deterioration        September 24, 2002 38 of 115  appears to be at the consumer level, most reports seem related to trade credit where companies,   especially large companies, are stretching out their payments   At the national level, we interpret the new data since our last meeting as decidedly mixed,   not offering any new encouragement of growing momentum over the near term but perhaps   suggesting that the downside risks that we were concerned about six weeks ago have abated at   least somewhat  At the same time I judge uncertainty to have increased, and the consequences of   a possible war with Iraq have certainly contributed to that  As solid recovery gets pushed further   out in time, many are expressing growing frustration and impatience  With few signs of   significant increases in capital spending and employment over the near term, my own view is   that the path of the economy over the next several quarters may well be a bit below that traced   out in the Greenbook The more I learn about the extraordinary capacity yet to be worked out of   the telecom industry—and the now more apparent structural problems in the airline industry that   go well beyond the September 11 effect, the even longer delayed rebound in commercial   construction, and other various excesses and imbalances that are being worked through—the   harder it is for me to expect a big, near-term upside surprise     Having said that, I still urge us to be patient while those corrections get made  As I’ve   suggested before, further cuts in rates could only delay those changes and slow the ultimate   recovery In fact, it seems to me that the very low, below long-term equilibrium, interest rates   that have been in effect for a long while now may have contributed to the development of some   of the excesses  Moreover, the low rates may already be slowing the adjustment process and   could be helping to create still new imbalances  A number of observers of the massive   overcapacity in the telecom sector trace some of those excesses to the ready availability of low-  cost capital that encouraged even fringe and upstart telecom suppliers and service providers to              September 24, 2002 39 of 115  invest well beyond any sustainable level of capacity  My commercial real estate friends tell me    that the commercial real estate oversupply is adjusting less rapidly than would be the case if   carrying costs on marginal properties were not so low  And the now historically low borrowing   rates on homes and autos may be encouraging various players in those sectors to develop   unrealistic expectations about a sustainable level of activity     Although I would not yet characterize price developments in housing as a general   housing bubble, I’m hearing more and more reports of what might be characterized as purely   speculative housing and property deals, mostly in Florida  These deals are all driven by claims   that sound as if the property can be resold in a few months or a few years at a nice profit so at   current interest rates how can one pass up such an opportunity  Of course, there’s a bit of a   Catch-22 in that these slow adjustments induced by low interest rates have served to sustain   some measure of stability as the economy works through other adjustments  While I’m certainly   not suggesting that we consider any policy tightening at this meeting, I do think we may already   be in a bit of a policy trap  I recognize that some downside risks remain, including some   potentially large and negative shocks, but I do not think we should exacerbate our long-term   problem with still lower interest rates unless the downside risks loom larger or the negative   shocks are realized Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6845,2002-09-24," Mr Chairman, I don’t think our individual views of where we are or even   what is around the corner in the next few quarters are all that different this morning  In fact, I’m   probably on the less optimistic end of that range of outcomes  As my earlier comments suggest,   I’m probably still in the minority today in terms of my thinking about our policy options  I   understand and certainly respect the views of others, but I have a different view of the risks and   rewards of further easing at this point  Based on my understanding of where the economy is, I   don’t think we’re dealing with the need for an interest rate cut at this point I don’t think it’s   going to speed the adjustments that we’re still hoping to see made   We’d love to see some more investment spending, but not a single businessperson I’ve   talked to has suggested that a slightly lower interest rate is going to spur investment spending  In   fact, I’m struck by the telecommunications industry, which I think is a poster child for the   excesses we’re trying to get worked out The CEO of the large Baby Bell that runs the phone   company in the Southeast pointed out that they cannot possibly grow their way out of the mess   they have in that industry  The only thing that is going to bring any kind of equilibrium to the        September 24, 2002 96 of 115  industry is further contraction in the number of firms that are involved  I think the CEO would   worry that any additional easing at this point might prolong the time that it will take to get some    of the marginal players out of the business  It might even lead to additional irrational pricing in   the short term, which would only exacerbate the problem of getting back to profitability and   stability So, using that as an example, I just don’t think that a rate cut is likely to have the kind   of effects we intend I’m not even sure that, if we could induce additional car and house   purchases, it’s something we really want to do  And I’m not as convinced as others seem to be   that creating an environment where people extract still more equity from their houses is all good   In summary, I have to say that, while I certainly understand and support the notion of   retaining the balance of risks sentence as it is in the draft statement—and I think the way you   suggested is the best way to do it—I believe there is still a case for some patience  I think we   should trust in the resilience of the economy and its fundamental ability to work through this   situation, assuming that one of those terrible geopolitical risks that you talked about doesn’t   materialize  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6898,2002-11-06," Mr Chairman, I too would agree that the Ginnie Maes should be our first   priority It seems to me that foreign debt has a whole host of risks associated with it—political,   credit, and exchange risks I like the way that Don Kohn and Al Broaddus particularly talked   about the ACF and the CACF  I think we could come back to them after we have some                November 6, 2002 109 of 122  experience with the new Lombard facility and perhaps make that facility even more usable in an   emergency situation  So I agree that we should put both aside for the moment and come back to   then later if we decide we don’t have adequate coverage    "
6899,2002-11-06," Economic activity in our Southeast region slowed further in early fall    Despite the cutesy signs we’ve all seen in some merchants’ windows such as “we hear we’re in a   period of slow growth but we’ve decided not to participate”—or some version of that—our area   is not showing its typical, faster bounceback from recession than other areas of the country    That’s largely explained by the absence of the usual sharp housing rebound that has often jump-  started our extensive housing-related industries and the continued sluggishness in business   services, a sector on which we’ve developed a substantial dependence  Tourism and business   travel are still disappointing Following a slow summer, out-of-state tourists have yet to return to   our important Florida destinations  Yesterday morning the corporate head of our Atlanta tourist   and convention bureau told me that their hotel and convention services firms have now pretty   much written off any meaningful rebound in business in 2003 based on very disappointing   advanced bookings for next year  Of course, that pushes off still further the rebound in business   airline travel that our friends at Delta Airlines, other carriers, builders of airplanes, and others in   that food chain have been waiting for     Our retail sector is soft overall, and expectations for the upcoming holiday season are   modest, in part because of the short period between Thanksgiving and Christmas  But our            November 6, 2002 56 of 122  retailers are not expecting a total disaster either  Because of their lower sales expectations, they   tell us they’re being conservative in their approach to both inventories and staffing  Auto sales   in September fell below year-ago levels  Regional manufacturing remains sluggish except for   defense and auto-related companies  Year-to-date through September our defense contractors   have garnered $74 billion in new contracts, and that has been a nice shot in the arm for many   companies  Consistent with recent aggregate evidence on improved productivity, we continue to   get reports suggesting that manufacturers are developing still more lean manufacturing   processes And managers at our state-of-the-art auto-producing facilities continue to boast of   significant technological advances in their production lines, with more to come   Continued resilience in our housing sector remains one of the mainstays of District   activity, but we did not get a sharp dip in housing during the recession and, therefore, did not get   a sharp rebound Activity remains at very high levels The south Florida housing market would   have to be characterized as red hot One director reported that when a new moderately priced   development on the west coast of Florida opened, demand was so great that sales had to be   limited to three homes per customer  That’s a semi-true story  [Laughter] Outside of Florida,   the housing market is essentially flat in terms of growth but continues to operate at very high   levels The exception is the high-end markets in Atlanta, Nashville, and Tampa, which have   clearly softened Commercial real estate remains quite weak across our District  As one office   leasing agent told me yesterday, it’s not so much because of the overbuilding of new space that   he has seen in other cycles but the collapse of demand  His company has reduced staff, tightened   their belts, and given space back He suggested the work-off of current excess office space is   going to take quite a long time             November 6, 2002 57 of 122  A final comment on the region  The District’s credit markets are characterized by solid   consumer demand and virtually nonexistent corporate demand for funds  In fact, our banks tell   us they will have to work hard to maintain any growth at all in business lending, as payoffs   threaten to exceed renewals and new lending  We see few signs of credit supply problems    Deposits and wholesale funding to banks are readily available, and banks stand ready to lend to   creditworthy companies  Credit quality still appears to be good, and banks tell us that they think   they’re past the low point in the current credit quality cycle   On the national front, the hope that data releases between FOMC meetings might provide   some very clear hint about the future direction of the economy seems to have been, as Roger   Ferguson reminded us at the last meeting, wishful thinking  The measured rebound in output   growth in the third quarter and the slow second quarter were generally in line with expectations,   and subsequent data seem to be generally consistent with a slow fourth quarter as most have been   forecasting I do not think we should be surprised or should despair at the lack of an   employment rebound at this point in the cycle  As the Greenbook suggested, it is quite likely   that we will have some more months of modest employment gains, with limited growth in final   demand, continuation of good productivity gains, and the general sense of caution that hangs   over corporate America because of geopolitical issues  We should take some comfort in the fact   that labor markets seem to have stabilized at least to some extent in recent months   I would argue that the continued delay in the rebound in investment spending, while   disappointing, is understandable, given the substantial excess capacity that has built up in many   industries and the time it always takes for new investment such as we had in the late 1990s to   become fully operational in the payback mode  And there’s a general sense of caution and   uncertainty as well as the geopolitical issues that hang over decisionmakers  Consumer income         November 6, 2002 58 of 122  continues to grow, and consumers have begun to restructure their balance sheets to slow down   debt accumulation and to shift debt composition toward mortgages  Consumers have also   moderated their spending even in the context of very low interest rates and extraordinary   incentives on auto financing Going forward, consumer spending appears likely to be more   subdued But that, at least in my mind, is understandable and rational   In short, I believe that we are positioned to experience the modest but fundamentally   sound growth traced out in the Greenbook I for one would be reasonably happy with such an   outcome  Ironically, by almost any yardstick except that of the late 1990s we’d be pleased with   such a path As we move to the policy discussion, I think it will be tempting to want to do   something even when the balance between potential short-term gains and the potential longer-  term negatives of a still more accommodative policy are not completely clear, at least not to me    I have been among those who have urged that patience be part of our prescription and that we   weigh carefully the pressure to pump up short-term spending and growth in sectors that may   already be at or beyond sustainable levels The expected slower growth in the fourth quarter,   which is a short two months from being history, and the forecast for next year and beyond don’t   look all that bad to me  As perhaps another voice in the wilderness, I think a case can still be   made for some patience  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6900,2002-11-06," Mr Chairman, I can support the recommendation  I would be more than   a little uncomfortable with 50 basis points and the continuation of an asymmetric risk   assessment  I hope we can use the press statement to suggest that we know how to look beyond   the next couple of data releases and that we see a better economy down the road  I wish I were a         November 6, 2002 94 of 122  little surer and more comfortable with exactly how a policy change of this kind works its way   through to both long-term rates and to the shorter-term consumer spending that is interest   insensitive  It’s not quite as clear to me as it seems to be to others that that will work  I have   always hated to disappoint my kids at Christmas time  I suspect there is a Santa Claus, but he   may not be able to deliver quite as many presents or as big a package this year  So I have some    doubts that monetary policy really works its way through the various sectors quite as cleanly as   some people suggest  But I can support the recommendation, and I understand the arguments   that have been made  "
6953,2002-12-10," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Sixth District are   largely unchanged over the short period since our last meeting  And few new clues have   emerged that might shed light on the likely path of the national economy While housing is still   holding its own in most of our major markets, nonresidential real estate demand remains weak,   and new construction has virtually ground to a halt  Our bankers continue to tell us that   commercial loan demand remains sluggish, but the good news is that bank credit quality is   holding firm  Employment gains have been limited to the services sector, and overall   employment increases in November were reported in only one of our six states, Florida  Finally,   while holiday sales were off to a brisk start, we all know how difficult it is to use such early   reports to judge the full holiday season, especially with the early and aggressive discounting by            December 10, 2002 30 of 87  many merchants this year and the shortened number of shopping days  The expectation seems to   be that total holiday sales may be about flat or up only modestly compared with last year     Last week we finished our latest round of District director meetings in our five Branch   offices, and a couple of interesting tidbits from those discussions caught my attention  First, one   of our Florida directors who is very active in helping to put together mergers and acquisitions of   modest-sized regional companies reported that, for the second month in a row, he was seeing a   noticeable increase in activity in that market  He attributed the increased interest to business   owners being more comfortable with acquiring companies rather than investing in new internal   projects for growth That is, acquisition brings more certainty  Perhaps this is a harbinger for   things to come  Second, we’re getting some signals that our important Florida tourism sector is   showing new signs of recovery Advance bookings at resorts and for rental homes for the first   quarter of next year are strong, although the duration of the average stay is still less than typical    What is hurting that industry right now, though, is the absence of European visitors who   typically flood into South Florida in the fourth quarter of the year  Finally, while you may recall   my mentioning that bookings with Florida’s cruise industry have been strong for some months,   you also may have seen the reports of special problems experienced by guests on several recent   cruises Doesn’t that just make you sick?  [Laughter] Sorry!   Turning to the national economy, our view of the situation is not materially different this   time from that of the Greenbook  The fourth quarter seems to be playing out pretty much as   expected, with considerable caution throttling spending and with the motor vehicle give-back   readily apparent Of course, the more important question is how long and how mushy the soft   spot will turn out to be  I certainly agree that the added stimulus from our further policy ease   five weeks ago and the growing prospect of fiscal stimulus should help at the margin  The         December 10, 2002 31 of 87  narrowing of bond spreads over Treasuries, as Jerry Jordan has already suggested, and the   outlook for lower energy prices should also be helpful   At the same time, I’m struck by how often I continue to hear talk of excess capacity in   many industries, including telecommunications, airlines, paper, and others, and maybe even   autos Moreover, the special inquiries we all made at Dave Stockton’s request since the   November meeting as to business investment spending plans seemed to reinforce the view that   such spending continues to be pushed further out  Except for short-term costs, the increased   productivity can be reasonably assured  While the message that the path we’re on “ain’t all that   bad” may not be completely satisfactory for those in the political arena, it seems to me that we   can be helpful by continuing to emphasize the merits of a growing expansion built upon   improving fundamentals   Anticipating a less-than-contentious policy discussion later in the meeting, I would   suggest that we use the coming months of hopeful and thoughtful watching and waiting to   continue to research and refine our thinking on potential  Just as the Board staff’s briefing   earlier this week emphasized the large error bands around estimates of GDP growth and inflation   over coming quarters, I assume we would all agree—and the questions earlier today suggest we   do—that significant questions remain about longer-term trends in productivity and their   implications for potential  It would be nice to be able to calibrate our next round of policy   tightening, when it comes, with some confidence and with the best chance of not allowing   ourselves to get ahead of or behind the curve  The prospect of eventually finding ourselves in   that phase of policymaking with a very stimulative fiscal policy still in place—and one that is   hard to turn off—seems to make our best thinking for such a period all the more important    Thank you, Mr Chairman         December 10, 2002 32 of 87 "
6954,2002-12-10," I agree as well, Mr Chairman  "
7009,2003-01-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity remained sluggish in our   Southeastern region through December and early January this year  Many of our regular   contacts in those sectors that are still seeing little or no rebound are saying, “What recovery?”    Someone I talked with recently dusted off an old Southern country boy expression when he said   that he just hopes the economic situation doesn’t deteriorate into a hog wallow  I’ll translate that   into city boy language during the break, but I think you get the idea   Our regional bright spots and soft spots reflect the national picture in most respects  Our   contact at the corporate headquarters of UPS in Atlanta was helpful in piecing together the   picture of Christmas holiday sales  As we all know and have talked about at various times, there   have been significant changes in where people shop  The traditional mall retailers are losing   market share to discounters and the Internet  UPS’s chief financial officer told us that their   Internet-related deliveries were up some 24 percent from year-ago levels  Despite those big   gains, and I guess they were on a small base, everything we know suggests that holiday sales in   our region were about flat compared with a year ago, with late-in-the-season spending helping to   save the day  The pattern of later shopping surely has multiple explanations, but we would   suggest that it may be additional evidence of the broader pattern of uncertainty and postponed   commitments that we’re seeing elsewhere in the economy   Job growth in our region has been stubbornly absent  In our District, the manufacturing   sector, which is still a bit larger as a proportion of total employment than is the case nationally,   January 28-29, 2003 111 of 195    the extent of job losses and the significance of those losses are very different between durable   and nondurable manufacturing  Durable goods manufacturing employment declined by a   somewhat smaller percentage than for the nation, mainly because our District’s durable goods   firms are less concentrated in industrial and electronic equipment  In contrast, though,   nondurable goods manufacturing employment fared somewhat worse than in the nation; much of   the employment losses there were from plant closings rather than reduced hours and shifts  So   the job recovery in that sector does not look very promising     Not surprisingly, the other major problem we’re seeing—and others have already   highlighted it—is the condition of state and local finances  Deficits and budget problems abound   because ramped up spending during the late 1990s was not curtailed quickly enough as   conditions deteriorated  It’s our sense that the hurt at the state and local level, and consequently   implications for economic drag, may be even greater than portrayed in the Greenbook  Although   our states may be small and Bob Parry’s explanation may be what is most important, at least in   our six states the very real tax increases and spending reductions look to be quite significant     There are the continuing bright spots  Residential construction remains healthy and   strong, with no early signs of slowdown  Current mortgage rates should sustain the high level of   activity, although the potential for a further pickup in that activity is questionable in my view    Commercial construction is another story  With the current high vacancy rates, at the present   rental rates it’s hard to see a meaningful bounceback anytime this year  Our tourism industry   continues to see a slow, steady recovery, although tourism is still not back to the levels in 2000    Business travel and convention business have not recovered at a commensurate rate  So our   regional picture is very mixed  As I’ve said before, our region is not getting the special early   recovery bounce that has often led the nation at this point in past cycles   January 28-29, 2003 112 of 195    At the national level I keep looking for the expected signs that help is on the way—that   those sectors that have yet to get some traction are beginning to come back  I’ve been trying to   practice my own advice of being patient  All things considered, I do share the broad view that   the economy will continue to improve and that the recovery will become more broad-based as   we move through 2003 and beyond  At the same time, my staff and I are a bit less convinced   than the Greenbook authors that we’ll see such strong a recovery as early as later this year    While we do see some pickup beyond the early part of the year, there may be some good   reasons—already pointed out by others—to be somewhat cautious about expecting a quick and   large bounce  Fourth-quarter profit numbers are just coming in and so far seem to be showing   modest improvement compared with year-ago levels and are up significantly in some sectors    However, I’m less certain about the assumed strength of productivity growth and the further   growth in housing activity and business investment in the near term that is embedded in the   Greenbook forecast for the second half of the year     The initial leveling out in labor markets last year is beginning to seem extended  Lots of   business people I talked with still seem to be very, very focused on further cost reductions, with   more job cuts and delayed hiring a big part of that focus  While certainly there must now be   considerable pent-up demand for additional staff to relieve some of the “do more with less”   mode that businesses have been in, it may be awhile longer before the unemployment rate moves   down and the economy gets a positive kick from sustained employment growth     Despite the political pressures to do something on the fiscal side—and despite Dave   Stockton’s assertion that the fiscal assumptions embedded in the staff forecast are quite   modest—it’s not clear to me that the fiscal stimulus we’ll get will be targeted and timed to affect   the near-term slack in the economy  In fact, I’m actually a little encouraged that there seems to   January 28-29, 2003 113 of 195    be some debate about the longer-term negative consequences of certain specific fiscal actions    Finally, as has been noted repeatedly, how the war worries will play out is still not completely   clear  At least for awhile longer, that overhang and the related short-term run-up in oil prices are   not helpful and are masking what might otherwise be developing in the real economy     For all those reasons, we see growth in 2003 as more modest than in the staff forecast,   with less of a sharp pickup toward the end of the year  Still, with monetary stimulus already in   place and at least some additional fiscal stimulus probably coming, with more and more   imbalances and excesses having been worked off, and with the prospect that geopolitical drags   will eventually become less worrisome, we think we’re on a reasonable path at the moment    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7010,2003-01-28,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
7072,2003-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I suspect everybody will note before the   morning is over, it has proved particularly difficult to get our arms around what’s happening in   the economy generally  That’s certainly the case more specifically in our own District  The data   and the anecdotal evidence are contradictory in some respects, and the messages regarding the   impact of geopolitical uncertainty on corporate and consumer decisionmaking are not completely   clear  For example, last week we met with our Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor Advisory   Council and the rhetoric at best was somber, especially from the manufacturing sector  Even so,   we had a Florida architect in the group who said he was forced to turn away business and   recently had expanded his staff  The heads of a small accounting firm and a small engineering   firm reported difficulties hiring qualified accountants and engineers respectively  A computer   support and systems supplier indicated that business was good and that he has recently been   adding employees  And a pallet manufacturer indicated that demand had improved slightly  The   point is that how people were feeling and the realities of their business activities didn’t always   match  Of course, there’s always a danger in attempting to generalize from such anecdotes, but   our discussions in that group didn’t provide a clear indication of continued deterioration in the   economy   March 18, 2003 31 of 101    We specifically asked our six boards of directors, which met last week and the week   before, to question their contacts about three related issues  the impact of geopolitical   uncertainty on hiring and investment; the amount of excess capacity that existed and how much   demand would have to pick up before hiring and investment would resume; and what was   happening in commercial real estate  The commercial real estate situation is the easiest to   summarize  Activity remains dead in Atlanta and many of our other major cities  Furthermore,   it is slowing or softening in those parts of our District that had been doing rather well last year,   mainly south Florida and Louisiana  As for the capacity issue, the firms that reported to our   directors are saying that demand would have to pick up between 10 and 20 percent before hiring   and investment would resume and their businesses would return to what they consider normal    Finally, it’s clear that uncertainty is weighing more and more heavily on short-term investment   decisions  Businesses are also reporting a lack of profitability combined with soft demand, both   of which reflect a mix of fundamentals and fears that will have to be reversed before hiring and   investment accelerate   I have several quick final comments about our region  First, residential housing remains   strong, but increasingly concerns are being expressed that pockets of overbuilding are appearing,   especially in the multifamily sector  Moreover, additional softness is showing up in the high-end   single-family market and in south Florida even in the middle-market segment  Second, we   recently received reports of a further slowdown in tourism, especially for the cruise industry out   of South Florida—even though they’ve begun offering some significant fare discounts  Third,   despite higher oil and gas prices, the Gulf of Mexico is essentially a dead sea as far as drilling   and exploration are concerned, reflecting uncertainty about the longer-term prospects for energy   prices  Fourth, higher fuel prices are reportedly having significant short-term effects on costs in   March 18, 2003 32 of 101    many industries  One of our directors, a trucking executive, reported on an industry study that   suggested that recent elevated diesel fuel prices, if they persist, would add about $129 billion in   costs this year that will have to be absorbed by shippers or their customers  Finally, higher   natural gas prices have led to the shutdown of several chemical plants in the Sixth District  My   conclusion from all this is that uncertainty is certainly having some impact on the economy in   our region, with activity a bit softer in some sectors than I reported at the last meeting  But   clearly there are some sectors—housing and health care to name a couple—that continue to do   just fine   Sifting out the effects of uncertainty from fundamentals is no easier at the national level   than at the District level  Recent high-frequency data came in a bit weaker than I had hoped,   especially for labor markets and the auto sector  But how much of this is due to uncertainty is   not obvious to me  At the same time, the sources of strength in the economy remain reasonably   sound  Consumer spending is being maintained, and housing continues at a high level    However, increasing concerns are being expressed about both  Moreover, investment activity   and inventory accumulation continue to lag  I’m not as optimistic as the Greenbook baseline   forecast on the pickup in investment spending  The prolonged investment slump scenario better   captures my own view and would suggest a somewhat slower growth forecast  I really don’t see   where the impetus to substantial new investment will come from in the short run  Despite the   increased signs of weakness, I continue to believe that substantial monetary stimulus remains in   place  That stimulus remains significant the longer we hold rates below what market participants   had initially expected  Downward movement in long-term interest rates indicates that our policy   stimulus continues to filter through the term structure  Further, should even parts of the   March 18, 2003 33 of 101    Administration’s fiscal stimulus package be passed, it would give us still additional positive   impetus to growth   Having said all that, I believe we still face the same two questions we pondered last time    First, how much of the slowdown is due to fundamentals, and how much is due to uncertainty?    Second, would a further cut in rates have an impact on the fundamentals?  Sorting out these   issues is important because I start from the premise that an easing of monetary policy can’t   substantially affect uncertainty or its sources  Moreover, the fundamental problems I see in the   economy right now are more structural in nature, and those are not likely to be mitigated by   further rate cuts   Also, I’m not as comfortable as I’d like to be with the way our models are capturing the   evolution of the fundamentals and their impact on the economy  My sense from talking to   business contacts is that in reality the fundamentals may not be as strong as the model forecasts   suggest  Because of the way models are structured, they may not capture the full structural   dislocations that exist in the economy now and how they are being resolved  For example, our   model may not fully incorporate the levels of debt held by both businesses and consumers and   the implied fixed nominal payments associated with those commitments  Further shocks that   hinder cash flows could generate more dislocations and thereby slow the progress to profitability    In addition, I believe that uncertainty is feeding back into the economy, posing real costs that   will have lagging consequences even after the uncertainty is resolved  This is especially true in   several industries that were already experiencing structural adjustment processes  For example,   the current run-up in energy prices is certainly exacerbating an already difficult situation in the   airline, trucking, and chemical industries  I find it hard to believe that even a quick resolution of   March 18, 2003 34 of 101    the geopolitical uncertainties will enable many of these firms to bounce back as quickly as they   might have done had they not been stressed by the energy situation     To end where I began, it seems to me that the extraordinary uncertainty we face today   makes it very difficult to get a good reading on the underlying fundamentals of the economy and   the really important questions as to the mix of cyclical and structural issues we’re dealing with    While it is probably fair to say that short-term, downside risks have increased somewhat, it’s not   clear to me that this is the optimal time for another policy easing, though that may eventually be   appropriate  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7073,2003-03-18,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  My staff and I struggled   mightily with how we would handle the balance of risks statement  Hats off to the person who   first came up with the idea     Hats off to Don and Vincent  I would also echo Don’s comments about   the need to be careful that we don’t go too far in implying that a move is imminent  Thank you  "
7122,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in our Southeast region   also remained sluggish over the intermeeting period  Both retail and auto sales have been weak,   May 6, 2003 33 of 115    while manufacturing has been soft except for defense-related production  Excess capacity still   exists in the commercial real estate sector, and state governments continue to struggle with   strained budgets  Labor markets were largely unchanged in March, with the District   unemployment rate at 51 percent  Firms remain reluctant to hire new full-time employees    We’re not hearing reports of significant increases in the use of temporary workers either  On the   brighter side, Florida tourism and single-family construction and home sales in most of our   markets remain at healthy levels     To get a handle on the effects of uncertainty on business investment, we specifically   asked our thirty-five Branch directors who met with us last week whether the resolution of the   war was affecting investment plans  The answers we got suggest both that it was too soon to tell   and that people were now turning their heads to reassess domestic economic fundamentals,   which at least in some sectors still didn’t favor expansion  Reportedly, most investment   continued to be concentrated on replacement rather than expansion  That said, there was clearly   a more optimistic business tone concerning the near term  I was perhaps most fascinated by   comments I got at a lunch meeting of Atlanta CEOs last week  Four different CEOs came up to   me individually as we gathered for lunch to comment on encouraging signs or developments in   their business  Interestingly, during the lunch when the host asked the group for comments about   the economy, those same individuals sat quietly  [Laughter]  I’m not sure what that tells us    Putting it all together, I found little in either the available data or the anecdotal information from   our region that clarifies whether the current thinking and behavior are a result of uncertainty or   are simply a realization of the downside risks  It seems that it’s just too soon to tell     This is how I read the incoming data at the national level as well  While it’s easy to be at   least a little disappointed that we haven’t yet seen concrete evidence of growing momentum, the   May 6, 2003 34 of 115    data are just not sufficiently distant from the war period to allow us to parse the economic   consequences of resolving war-related uncertainty from the economic fundamentals  The   consensus among most private forecasters as well as the Greenbook and my own forecast all   make a reasonable case for growing momentum as we move through the year and into next year    But I agree with the Chairman’s observation in his recent testimony that the future path of the   economy is likely to come into focus only gradually   The outlook for inflation is always an important part of our policy deliberations, and   there continues to be a debate about the potential dangers of deflation  I take these concerns   seriously also, but I am not yet convinced that deflation is our foremost risk at this time  Briefly   I’m going to indicate why  The deflation issue is not simply about a declining price level but   rather reflects concern about the potential for a significant and widespread weakening in real   activity and the disruptions to financial intermediation that accompany it, like those we   experienced in the Great Depression  The Great Depression deflation was in my view the result   of widespread real economic weakness, policy errors, and extreme domestic financial distress,   along with international financial shocks that together formed the “perfect storm”  The question   is whether we see similar preconditions today for such an episode and if so, what is the   supporting empirical evidence     We clearly have experienced significant external shocks  But the real economy is   recovering, albeit slowly  It is not contracting  Some sectors do continue to suffer  Prices are   falling for output in certain industries—the airlines, telecom, high-tech and manufactured goods   generally and for some commodities  These are relative price declines, however, and do not   reflect across-the-board deflation  In most instances the causes are easily explainable by   idiosyncratic shocks or industry-specific circumstances  The price declines flow from   May 6, 2003 35 of 115    productivity increases, overcapacity, increased global and local competition, outmoded business   models, and secular industrial change     As a consequence, the relative price declines particular to these sectors are going to occur   no matter what we do in the monetary policy area  Even so, the concern for policy may be that   the weakening of relative prices will feed through into a general deflation  To date, however,   there is no sign that this is happening  Inflation is still positive  Furthermore, none of the   expectations measures either from surveys or the term structure signal that deflation is on the   horizon  Lastly, the fall in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies of countries   experiencing inflation is not consistent with a deflationary scenario for the United States     What about policy mistakes?  In the Great Depression, the money supply contracted over   30 percent, and financial intermediation came close to shutting down  Today, monetary policy is   quite accommodative in my view, the monetary aggregates continue to grow, and bank balance   sheets and capital positions are favorable  Financial conditions today appear far more positive   and simply aren’t comparable to the distress situation observed during the Great Depression    Intermediation is taking place, and creditworthy borrowers continue to fund themselves through   depository institutions and capital markets  What we are seeing now in the financial distress   indicators such as measures of default, chargeoffs, and delinquencies are within the range of   standard recessions and are not in my view symptomatic of a debt deflation, nor are they a   concern to banking supervision at this time     For some there is the specter that what happened in Japan may also happen here  My   reading of the conditions in Japan, however, suggests that they parallel the problems of our Great   Depression  The main difference is a matter of degree, timing, and the willingness of the   government to prop up economically insolvent institutions with implicit guarantees  Real   May 6, 2003 36 of 115    economic activity in Japan has declined for nearly a decade, and a gradual deflation appears to   be expected  Financial distress in Japanese depository institutions is the most significant and   well-known problem  Were it not for implicit government guarantees, these institutions would   likely have failed a long time ago, and the economy may have gone into a tailspin  In the   meantime, Japan continues to consume its accumulated wealth  Again, the features of this   experience are not in my view comparable to our own situation at this time     Looking ahead to our policy discussion, I would observe again that interest rates are   already low, monetary policy is already stimulative, fiscal policy is stimulative and likely to get   more so, and most forecasts are showing growing momentum as we move through the year and   into next year  It seems to me that we have time to let the war-related uncertainty unwind and to   wait for the path of the economy to become clear  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7123,2003-05-06,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation to make no policy change   today  I actually came in thinking—and I said this to somebody during the break—that the worst   of all worlds would be to take no action today and to go back to a balance of risk statement of the   kind we ended up with here  I think it was Al Broaddus and maybe Don Kohn who made a point   that was quite vivid in my mind—that we need to convey some positive sense about the outlook    To throw a bit of cold water on the way this statement is structured I, like several others—I’m   still thinking about this as I speak—believe it might be better to strike that last sentence where   we blend the two risks  I know we can’t abandon the statement without preparing the public for   it  I’m not smart enough and don’t have enough time to think about whether or not we can   simply drop that sentence  But I’m afraid it does undo some of what we’re trying to do today,   and that bothers me a good deal     Is a postscript allowable, Mr Chairman?  Not to rebut, but I just want to   make a point that there seems to be enough uneasiness about this hybrid statement that I’m   uncomfortable with Vincent’s notion that we might have to wait until next January to talk about   this  I wonder if we can’t find some way to get back to a fundamental discussion of the wording   of our press statements because I suspect the issue we’re struggling with will be with us for a   while  We’re going to have this problem meeting after meeting if we don’t tackle it in June or at   least fairly quickly  So I would lobby for quick attention to it  "
7175,2003-06-24,"  So move     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As others have commented, not much is left   to be said!  I’d start by observing, though, that having put the subject of deflation squarely on the   table as part of our statement after the last meeting, I think we created an enormous, compelling   need to do a lot of learning and to do it quickly  The papers and the discussions today certainly   have helped me understand the issues   Maybe even more important—to pick up on what Sandy just said—we’ve created   enormous interest externally among the press, our own directors, business people, and even my   brothers  [Laughter]  Everybody I talk to wants to learn more about the subject  In fact, the   range of emotional reaction to our statement last time among the people I talked with ran the   gamut from those who were reassured by the fact that we are talking about the subject and   understand it to those who found the mention of deflation frightening  The latter included one of   my brothers who said, “Jack, you’re scaring people”  So I think our statement last month has   created for us a tremendous responsibility to continue to educate the public about this issue and   about what we’re doing  It’s the number one subject for the speech requests that I’m getting   these days   The other thing I was going to touch on, and this probably has been talked about enough,   is our basic responsibility as a central bank in a developing depression situation—to be sure that   June 24-25, 2003 54 of 211    there’s plenty of liquidity and to steel the intermediaries to fund real economic activity  I don’t   think anybody has suggested that there is a lack of liquidity now or that intermediation is not   currently taking place   I don’t want to talk more about the Japanese situation or the experience of the 1930s; they   have been discussed  But I came to the meeting wondering if those who were most concerned   about deflation in the short run would argue that more liquidity at some point—and maybe very   soon—would help reduce the risks of deflation to a more acceptable level  There has been a lot   of talk about that  I had trouble, too, trying to be responsive to Vincent’s particular questions   and I felt better after hearing your comments on them, Mr Chairman  When I looked at the   options presented, I felt the same way that I did when we had the discussion not so long ago   about what we would do in terms of conducting monetary policy if we ran out of government   debt  I never was completely comfortable with any of the alternatives we had on the table; I   certainly feel that way about this situation   Finally, I would emphasize—and it’s been said several times already—that we have to be   very, very careful about what we say on this subject externally  I fear that we could get ahead of   ourselves and create a self-fulfilling concern about deflation  I think I’m repeating points that   have already been made, so I will close  Thank you  "
7176,2003-06-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We have observed only marginal changes   and subdued economic conditions in the Sixth District since the time of the last meeting  In fact   at our board meeting one director suggested that the economy reminded him of the movie   “Ground Hog Day”  The same scene seems to be repeated over and over again  But here’s an   abbreviated version of our regional story   Retail sales have been growing at a modest pace and are still being driven primarily by   promotional activity  Our tourism and hospitality industries have improved in some areas, and   room rates are actually up somewhat in some locations  Low mortgage rates have continued to   sustain single-family housing markets, but multifamily construction and nonresidential   construction are still hobbled by excess capacity and weak demand  Structural adjustments   June 24-25, 2003 93 of 211    continue in our manufacturing sector, which remains sluggish except for auto-related activity    Similarly, activity in petrochemicals is declining because of high natural gas prices and   burdensome environmental rules  As requested, we also made some special inquiries with regard   to investment prospects, but we were unable to find any significant sentiment on the part of   businesses to invest except to replace depreciated equipment or to cut costs  Such cost-cutting   investments continue to have considerable attraction  A couple of company contacts reported   that such investments were expected to cut labor costs as much as 30 or 35 percent  To me this   suggests that the outlook for continued productivity gains is indeed real    There’s little sign of improvement on the labor market front except in Florida, where the   bulk of our District’s economic growth is occurring  District employers generally remain   reluctant to hire full-time employees  State governments are adjusting to lower revenues by   seeking new revenue sources or by making deep cuts in spending  Certainly that restraint will   damp somewhat the stimulative effect of the recent federal tax cuts     Finally at the regional level, prices observed in our area have been essentially stable as   increases in prices for services have been offset by continued softness in goods prices  Another   positive development since our last meeting in this “Ground Hog Day” scenario I just painted is   that District measures of consumer confidence are rising and we’re seeing indications that   business expectations have improved  The whispered conversations suggesting that things just   feel better, which I reported at our last meeting, have continued     On the national front, I see a number of marginally positive developments  Housing   remains stable at a high level; industrial production edged up last month; manufacturing seems to   have stabilized; and durable goods orders are positive  Consumer spending is holding its own,   and retail sales, excluding autos, seem to be coming back  Financial market developments have   June 24-25, 2003 94 of 211    also been positive, with stock market indexes up significantly  Interest rates have actually come   down across the curve by more than 50 basis points  Business credit terms have eased; business   profitability is up; and credit quality is acceptable and not deteriorating  Finally, energy prices   are still down from the highs we saw earlier   While my forecast is a bit less exuberant than the Greenbook’s—and my own numbers   would be on the low side of those we submitted—it seems to me that the economy has turned the   corner and is poised to gain momentum  At the same time, I recognize that the outlook for   investment spending and significant job growth over the near term is not as encouraging as we   might like  And markets have built in expectations of further easing     Looking ahead just a bit to the policy discussion, I would suggest that what we say in our   press statement today may be more important than our action  The material presented by David   Wilcox emphasized the importance of aligning expectations to achieve the desired response to   our decisions  Our statement about disinflation after the May meeting clearly was responsible   for the significant decline in rates across the yield curve despite the fact that we did not change   the funds rate  Because of expectations, I believe it is important today to link directly any policy   move that we might decide to make to concerns about the fundamentals in the real economy    I argued for patience last time, and I believe we are seeing a turnaround  Not changing   rates today, coupled with a positive statement about the recovery prospects and not saying   anything to fuel greater concern about further disinflation, would seem to be a reasonable policy   alternative  I would be uncomfortable if we justified a further rate cut by citing concerns about   further disinflation or deflation rather than its causes  I would not cut rates because of a desire to   avoid operational problems of the zero bound in the future or as an effort to get ahead of the   curve in anticipation of further adverse shocks to the real economy  I’m convinced that a prompt   June 24-25, 2003 95 of 211    response to actual shocks is very appropriate, as was the case with the September 11 terrorist   attacks  Since shocks by definition cannot be anticipated, to act in anticipation of an unknown   shock would in my view simply waste whatever powder we have left  As for the disinflation   argument, I believe it remains a low probability event for the reasons I discussed earlier  The   kind of disinflation I think we should be concerned about in terms of specific policy action is the   kind associated with a depression, not problems of the zero bound or wage rigidity     I’d like to make one additional observation about expectations, though  I think we need   to leave a sense that any downward move in rates is viewed by us as temporary  If we lower   nominal rates to near zero and state publicly that we intend to keep them down until the economy   recovers, then there’s a nontrivial risk—especially if the economy weakens further—that the   public’s expectations for deflation will be heightened  That clearly happened in Japan  In other   words, trying to avoid the Japan-type of liquidity trap could only increase the likelihood that it   will occur because of the effect on expectations  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7177,2003-06-24,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I have to admit to being   still a bit uneasy, until we see the draft press statement in a few minutes, because how we talk   about the disinflation risks concerns me  When I look at the tabulation of our individual   forecasts for inflation next year, I don’t see any statistically significant further decline in our   inflation expectations  So I find it hard to read into the conversations I’ve listened to and these   forecasts a great concern among us about inflation falling rapidly over the period ahead    Therefore, I hope that we won’t create the mis-impression in the statement that we see a bigger   June 24-25, 2003 151 of 211    risk than our forecasts seem to suggest That’s not what I see when I look at our forecasts    Nevertheless, I’m supportive of your recommendation, and I will vote for it     Mr Chairman?   CHARIMAN GREENSPAN  Yes     I know you’re trying to strike a balance between a number of different   views, but when I read the words “unwelcome substantial fall in inflation” they sound more   menacing, more troubling, and indicative of greater concern than I think most of us have  I   wonder if there’s a way to take the edge off of that wording a bit     Are those the same words we used last time?  "
7240,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Readings on economic activity from our   Southeast region were still somewhat mixed in June and early July, but there were encouraging   signs  Anecdotal information suggests that retail sales in June and early July exceeded year-ago   levels, and sales very recently were boosted by what has become an annual tax-free back-to-  school shopping weekend in several of our states  Our important housing industry remains   healthy  While commercial construction was down nationally, activity in that sector across our   region seems to have bottomed out  Developers continue to tell me that there are now at least   early discussions of future projects, despite continued high vacancy rates and a substantial   amount of sublease space that is a drag on the market     Manufacturing in our area is a mixed bag  While we still are seeing some declines in   textiles and chemicals, we’re getting nice boosts from our defense and auto-related segments  A   contact in the packaging industry, which often leads an acceleration in activity, reports that there   has been a recent pickup in one-time orders and that overall commercial orders remain steady    Tourism is also a mixed picture  Facing disappointing attendance, Walt Disney World laid off   some of its craft and maintenance workers for the first time in nine years  On the brighter side,   the top official of Atlanta’s convention and tourism authority told me recently that the bookings   for next year look measurably better than this year’s, and he is encouraged that things are finally   beginning to turn around     We’re still not picking up any signs of significant hiring plans in our region  The trend   continues to be one of utilizing temporary staff until economic conditions have clearly stabilized    Our contact at one Atlanta temp service firm noted a major pickup in her business, which   provides workers for the light industrial and warehouse segments of our regional economy    August 12, 2003 30 of 110    Lastly, we’re now seeing some signs that venture capital activity is beginning to pick up in the   technology sector of the economy that has become increasingly important in Atlanta and in other   parts of our Southeast region   On the national front, I interpret recent data as providing tangible evidence that the   pickup in activity that we’ve been expecting is more and more likely to be realized  The second-  quarter GDP data, the positive trend in spending on business equipment and software, the   increase in nondefense capital shipments, the modest improvement in the ISM manufacturing   index, the latest measures of productivity, and other data that David cited are all encouraging  It   seems to me that the key question is what the trajectory of the expected pickup will be  Will it   be the more optimistic path of the Greenbook and some private forecasts or the somewhat more   modest trajectory reflected in the central tendency of the midyear forecasts submitted by   Committee members?  While one can see where greater upside momentum might come from, I   think for now the evidence is more consistent with a more measured pickup     While we may get the sharp turnaround in employment laid out in the Greenbook, it is   my sense that many companies will continue to work mightily to hold on to the labor cost gains   they have made  The rapidly rising health care and pension costs associated with each new hire   will get even closer scrutiny, and with more gains available from expenditures on technology,   many companies will be able to continue to substitute capital for labor   If a rebound in job growth is delayed and stretched out, the increases in income and   aggregate demand that would normally accompany employment gains will be pushed out some   as well  The path for a rebound in investment spending is also not clear to me  We’re still not   seeing in the numbers or picking up anecdotally clear evidence that investment spending is   accelerating sharply  Indeed, the yet-to-be-released NFIB survey suggests that neither low   August 12, 2003 31 of 110    interest rates nor the investment tax incentives in the President’s program are yet adding to what   have been modest investment plans    Our Bank’s GDP forecast remains on the low side of the range of Committee members’   forecasts  We’re also somewhat skeptical about the most optimistic views of potential  And we   do not see the output gap as being large enough for long enough to make the pressure for future   disinflation of the kind suggested in our statements compelling  While the recent backup in rates   will have some effect at the margin, financial market conditions remain very favorable, and fiscal   policy and monetary policy remain accommodative, as most of us have noted repeatedly in   recent meetings  From a short-term perspective, our differences regarding the projected path of   the economy over the next several quarters are not particularly important since I believe they   imply similar near-term paths for the funds rate  Rather, differences in the assumed paths for   output and inflation are more important in terms of what we communicate to the public and   financial markets about our outlook and our likely policy concerns going forward  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
7241,2003-08-12,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I’d like to associate   myself closely with Bob Parry’s suggestion that we think about the merits of having some   discussion of how we are going to explain our action before we vote  I’d also associate myself   with Bill Poole’s comment about being extremely careful in terms of what we say about future   policy actions  We may be as surprised on the other side in future months as we have been with   the disinflation in recent months  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Maybe all has been said that can be said, but I want to echo that last   comment  I’m uncomfortable with the last sentence, and not because it’s not helpful in the   current circumstance; I think Ben and Don made the point very well that it is  My concern is that   it will be the first time that, as part of the statement, we have made some very explicit comments   August 12, 2003 89 of 110    about future policy, and I’m afraid it’s going to set a precedent  I think we’ll be expected in   future statements after our meetings to make parallel kinds of comments at times when that   would not be helpful  I’m trying to weigh the helpfulness in the current circumstances against   moving ten feet more down the slippery slope of how much we say in these statements before we   have a chance to talk about this next month  I just wonder if that’s a good trade today     Those who prefer to drop it?  "
7286,2003-09-15,"  Mr Chairman, I’m struck by how far we’ve come since December 1999    I was a relative newcomer at the table when Roger’s working group gave its report  I didn’t go   back and pull the report, but I pulled a sentence from Dave Lindsey’s document  It read  “All   members of the working group share the objective of reducing the close connection between the   choice of the bias and the perceived probability of near-term policy action”  Maybe my memory   isn’t clear, but I recall that we were wringing our hands and hoping that markets would not   interpret the bias as a policy forecast  For four or five years now we have let that go   unchallenged and apparently have become more and more comfortable with that notion without   having a substantive discussion on the issue  I think what we did at the last meeting in terms of   “for the foreseeable future” was another major step down that road  To my mind that was more   than just a communication issue    September 15, 2003 44 of 78    I share the view expressed by several others who have spoken already about being   somewhat uncomfortable with references to the timing of possible changes in policy  My   sense—from the discussion that we had at the last meeting, a few remarks that have been made   since then, and some comments in the Greenbook—is that a number of people wish that we   could have made that wording more explicit  Some would have favored our saying that policy   would be on hold for the next six, nine, or twelve months  That makes me really uncomfortable    Some of us at the last meeting had—and probably still will have at tomorrow’s meeting—a   different view about fundamental issues such as productivity, potential growth, and the output   gap  So the issue involved more than communication and the choice of words  To me there was   an underlying discomfort with the kind of unconditional pre-commitment to future policy that I   think we may have conveyed  In my view we need to have more discussion about whether we’re   really comfortable with having gone that far with a policy forecast of that sort  I think that’s   fundamental  If we are comfortable doing that, it raises some process issues, which is   understandable  If we’re going to make that kind of commitment, it does become a part of the   Committee’s action  So that should make us want to talk about the words that we use  It’s going   to make us want to edit the minutes more carefully  I found myself already doing that on the   minutes from the last couple of meetings and wishing that I could see everybody else’s   comments and see what happened to the entire draft   We had a last-minute discussion before I left Atlanta this morning about Tom’s idea of an   earlier release of the minutes  My first thought was that it probably made sense  But the more I   thought about it, the more concern I had about nineteen of us trying to comment one-on-one on   minutes that all of a sudden become terribly, terribly important  I can’t imagine how that process   would unfold  As attractive as the idea was conceptually when I first thought about it, I just   September 15, 2003 45 of 78    can’t imagine that it would work well  Each of us could send in our comments, but we won’t   know how anyone else commented, and we won’t have a chance to help with the process  I bet   we’re not going to be satisfied at all when the minutes come out at the end of that process     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had a few more comments but in the interest   of time I’ll quit  "
7318,2003-09-16,  I think “may” would be better     Yes  Could you reread it with Roger’s final edits?     Yes  
7319,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the time of our last FOMC meeting, the   tone of our District’s meetings and much of the recent data have been providing more tangible   evidence that economic activity in our region is picking up  This does not reflect an abrupt   acceleration but rather the cumulative effects of positive readings since late July  In particular,   retail contacts were more positive about sales activity, and the manufacturing sector has   displayed some welcome signs of improvement     September 16, 2003 35 of 106    Despite the recent run-up in mortgage rates, single-family construction and sales in our   area remain flat to up slightly  We particularly attempted to determine from our directors and   their contacts whether the continuing strength in housing was solely a pipeline effect that pre-  dated the recent rise in mortgage rates or if it was reflective of continuing activity  The sense   was that, while there was a bit of a “get it while it lasts” attitude among borrowers, rates were   still low and should not depress residential construction unless they moved significantly higher     There are still few signs of business willingness to invest except to cut costs  The stories   we are hearing suggest that firms will continue to constrain investment spending until they are   more convinced that the pickup in activity is permanent  We also asked our contacts about job   creation  Consistent with a reluctance to invest, District firms remain extremely cautious about   adding jobs  In Florida, businesses have continued to squeeze more out of less, and some of this   was attributed to the ability to better utilize existing technology   The other point made by many of the people we talked with was that, while output was   increasing, they were skeptical that it was due to true increases in underlying productivity in the   sense that we usually think about productivity  Finally, as for inventory investment, our contacts   suggested that they can make do with less and will not rush to replenish inventories let alone   increase inventories to historical ratios even as activity rises  All of this supports the view that   the acceleration ahead could be somewhat more subdued than some anticipate   As for the national outlook, there is little need to repeat the positive and encouraging   developments that were well documented in the Greenbook  While a significant pickup in GDP   is looking more and more likely, I too remain frustrated by the lack of job creation  That said,   my discussions with business people in our District suggest that the loss of manufacturing jobs,   for example, is structural and not cyclical  Most of these jobs have been lost permanently; they   September 16, 2003 36 of 106    will not come back even as demand picks up  Restructuring is the major explanation offered by   other types of firms for employment declines  Again, I don’t see many of the jobs that have been   shed coming back quickly even as the economy improves  For this reason I remain somewhat   skeptical about the relatively near-term and strong pickup in employment that is forecast in the   Greenbook  Regardless, it’s also the case that further decreases in interest rates will not induce   firms to add jobs because expanding demand is not there  My sense is that monetary policy   remains appropriately accommodative  Fiscal policy is supportive  And it seems to me that   there is less reason to be concerned about deflation at the moment  I’m pretty comfortable with   where we are at the present time  Thank you, Mr Chairman        "
7320,2003-09-16,"  Mr Chairman I support no change in the funds rate target  I remain   concerned about striking a better balance of risks statement, but that’s not something we can deal   with today  I hope we will keep in mind a fundamental review of that     I also like the idea of trying to find an exit strategy  I’ve read the new final sentence   three or four times, and I wish I could be more comfortable that I know how people are going to   interpret it  I’m not sure it’s going to get us where we’re trying to go  Roger said he was   September 16, 2003 88 of 106    worried about the people in this room understanding it; I’m worried about the people outside   understanding that last sentence  I think a lot is going to depend on what we say in subsequent   days and weeks about disinflation as we speak on the economy  The fact is that in this paragraph   we refer to disinflation three times  My suspicion is that at least some of us will continue to talk   about disinflation, so I’m not sure this statement really gets us unstuck from what we did at the   last meeting  On balance, I think I’d be more comfortable leaving the language as we had it in   our statement last time and trying to find some better words for use at another meeting  But I’ll   accept this change in the language if that’s the consensus of the Committee  "
7374,2003-10-28,"  Mr Chairman, I don’t have a quote, but I am reminded of a life   experience, which was the first time I ate a raw oyster  Somebody forgot to tell me to let it slide   down  Instead, I began to chew on the darn thing, and the more you chew on an oyster the   tougher it gets to swallow  I might have been closer to being ready to make some judgments on   communication issues at our dinner meeting last month than I am now  If anything, it has   become clearer to me that this subject is very complicated  There are more options  Ned’s ideas   are fascinating but raise some new questions  The discussion today raises still more  So I’m not   close to being ready this afternoon to start choosing   I may be in the minority in this view, but despite the fact that we’ve already talked about   this issue and some ideas are on the table, I’m not sure each of us has really had a chance to put   our best ideas on the table  I don’t think we can do that in a one-hour dinner meeting, and I don’t   think we can do that in a one-hour session at an FOMC meeting  So if we can get by until the   October 28, 2003 94 of 126    January meeting, I have a rather strong preference for asking a small group of either principals or   senior staff to get everybody’s best ideas and sort through the options to a point where we can   effectively work with them  That would give us some time to think this out more carefully, and   we could devote a whole afternoon to discuss it thoroughly at our January meeting and try to get   it as right as we possibly can  I think we’d be best served if we took that kind of time and care to   try to sort some of this out  It has gotten very complicated  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7375,2003-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Last meeting I reported that economic   activity in our Southeast region was showing tangible signs of forward momentum  That has   October 28, 2003 47 of 126    continued into October  The retail sector remains reasonably strong, with some reports of   increased sales of high-end merchandise, and our contacts are optimistic about the holiday sales   prospects  Single-family housing markets across our region have retained their strength, and   vacancy rates in the multifamily sector have declined  Our commercial real estate markets have   not yet turned around, though there were several interesting reports from our bankers about   financing being sought for new projects  Our important hospitality and tourism sector has   continued to improve, as hotel occupancy increased, restaurant business was generally good, and   the number of European visitors in Florida rose because of an appreciating euro  Manufacturing   remains mixed, though with growing signs of more stability  We hear more reports of spending   to replace equipment  And somewhat different from Bill Poole’s report, our trucking contacts   indicate that there has been increased activity in recent weeks  The outlook for increases in   hiring continues to be the most difficult to judge  Businesses are telling us that they remain   reluctant to hire permanent workers, opting instead to use overtime or part-time and contract   help  That said, overall employment in our District now appears to be growing at a moderate   pace  Prices remain stable, although one of my directors in the utility business continues to   encourage us to think through the implications of potentially higher natural gas prices over the   winter and what that may mean for production costs   Turning to the national outlook, the expansion appears to be on track  I would use the   same words that others have in describing the most recent data as encouraging  The expansion   seems to be getting stronger legs and appears to have more breadth  Productivity is strong    Capital spending is beginning to show traction in the construction, manufacturing, wholesale,   and professional services sectors  The international outlook has been revised up in the last two   October 28, 2003 48 of 126    Greenbooks  Recent data even suggest that the heretofore disappointing jobs picture may be   stabilizing or improving, although it’s probably too soon to generalize there   At the same time, we still are hearing expressions of caution from both large and small   businesses, and a significant amount of restructuring and retrenchment is continuing in at least   some industries  Inventory accumulation remains another question mark  Business inventories   continue to run down, and I read the reports from a recent NFIB survey as suggesting that small   businesses at least won’t be adding to inventories quite yet  So the timing and the size of the   expected inventory pickup is still not clear  Taken together, these developments on the national   front, reinforced by the continuing improvements we’re seeing in our region, give me growing   confidence that a more broadly based expansion is now in process and is likely to continue     I want to look ahead just a bit, and with considerable restraint, to the discussion on policy   and communication since it’s especially hard for me to sense how that discussion might be   structured today  Although I think policy is calibrated about right as we try to nurture the   developing expansion, I believe we need to be especially cautious today about how much we   tinker with the wording of our announcement lest we interject new uncertainty and controversy   about the future path of policy  There probably is room to modify our words at the margin—to   convey growing confidence about the sustainability of the expansion and perhaps try to clarify or   condition our currently unconditional commitment to maintain an accommodative policy for a   considerable period  But the ideas left on the table from our discussion last month and the   additional ideas that have been put forward since then lead me to strongly favor taking some time   to think through the very complicated and important issues that have been raised  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
7376,2003-10-28,"  I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
7438,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the last FOMC meeting, economic   activity in the Sixth District has continued to expand at a reasonable pace, with strength fairly   broadly based  Compared with the rest of the nation, the region’s growth appears robust,   suggesting that our area may be leading again as we did in the recovery from the 1990-91   recession To illustrate the breadth of the strength we’re seeing regionally, retailers are upbeat   about sales in recent weeks, and prospects for the holiday season appear to be better than last   year  Auto sales, which had weakened in October, bounced back in November  Commercial   real estate markets are improving, especially retail and distribution expansions  Residential   housing markets remain generally stable at very high levels  While office vacancy rates remain   high, we’re now getting positive absorption with subleased space no longer coming back on the   market the way it did earlier  The tourism industry reported a rise in visitors and a positive   outlook for the winter season, especially for cruises  Visitors from Europe are returning, buoyed   by an appreciating euro, although traffic from Latin America has dropped  This is the third   FOMC briefing in a row in which we’ve had reports from our banking sector suggesting that   loan demand is picking up, primarily in the service sector but with some new borrowing now   showing up for commercial real estate projects and manufacturing  Trade and transportation   activity improved in the District  Indeed, truck manufacturers are noting a sharp increase in   orders  One local trailer manufacturer said that his company had an inventory of 1700 trailers   just six months ago and today they are struggling to keep up with demand  They have a backlog   of orders through the end of the first quarter     The District is also leading the nation in job growth, as it did coming out of the 1990-91   recession  Recent job momentum for Georgia in particular was exceeded by only two states, and   metro Atlanta had the fastest job growth in recent months of any metropolitan area in the   December 9, 2003 49 of 133    country  It’s difficult to pinpoint a distinct source for this growth, such as a few large employers   bringing back workers  All indications are that, outside of manufacturing, it’s quite broad based   The rise in employment is being reflected in improving state sales tax and income tax receipts    Every state in the District now has an unemployment rate below that for the nation, and   Georgia’s stands at 42 percent  That said, it’s also true that job growth in our District is   considerably more muted this time than in the post-recession period in the early ’90s  We have   yet to see the surge that would significantly push down unemployment rates         As for inflation, price increases still appear muted except for health care and the pass-   through of higher natural gas prices  We also hear some scattered anecdotal reports of higher   prices in trucking, where shortages of equipment are beginning to affect truck and trailer prices     On the national front, I count myself among those skeptics who were surprised by the   sheer strength of the third-quarter growth and productivity numbers  Perhaps even more   encouraging are the signs that investment has begun to pick up and the signs of life in labor   markets  In anecdotal reports, revisions to inventory numbers suggest that accumulation has now   begun, further complementing the other signals  All this bodes well for this year and next  I,   like others, expect some slowdown in the fourth quarter from the third, but I do anticipate that   2004 will be even stronger than 2003  Any quibbles I might have with the Greenbook over point   estimates for growth are minor because the baseline forecast path in the Greenbook is consistent   with our own Atlanta model forecast    I find it more difficult to work through the longer-term outlook for inflation and to   reconcile the Greenbook’s very benign outlook with the somewhat earlier upturn in the inflation   path suggested by private-sector forecasters, some of our own modeling work, and financial   market views  Certainly, the less than benign views regarding the inflation outlook seem to be   December 9, 2003 50 of 133    reflecting fundamentals in one way or another  Those fundamentals include money growth for   several years in excess of the nominal rate of economic growth, real interest rates near zero or   negative, a surge in government spending with very large short-term deficits, a drop in the value   of the dollar, a growing trade deficit, and increased leanings toward trade protectionism  I would   conclude that the inflation risks are currently close to balanced  The growth that we have seen   recently and that we expect to continue into next year certainly reduces the probability of   worrisome further disinflation That should remind us as well as others that inflation could move   sooner than expected in the other direction   Looking ahead just a bit to the policy discussion, I would guess that there will be a sense   that we continue to have the luxury of being able to be patient in terms of adjusting the stance of   policy  At the same time, we’re at a point where we can and should begin to turn more attention   to the longer term and the process of ultimately adjusting policy, hopefully gracefully, initially   back to a more neutral setting  In preparation for those later discussions, I would suggest that   our ultimate policy adjustment would need to take careful account of certain existing conditions   in the economy that may affect the underlying policy transmission channels   What I have in mind is the following  Approximately 40 percent of the increase in GDP   since the trough is due to housing and durable goods purchases, which usually need to be   financed and were clearly encouraged and supported by low interest rates  Measures of   consumer debt produced by the Board’s staff show that consumers clearly have increased their   debt burdens and their financial obligation ratios  Delinquency rates on subprime mortgages far   exceed those of other mortgages  Finally, while credit card lenders remain profitable, their   chargeoff ratios are now approaching 7 percent  As a result, current profit levels are being   maintained by low commercial paper funding costs and not by increased charges on loans   December 9, 2003 51 of 133    Should we raise rates too high too quickly this time, we risk choking off demand for   housing and durables, a situation that will be exacerbated by a profit squeeze on lenders,   particularly credit card lenders, who will be forced to curtail lending or tighten standards    There’s also a risk, with business investment still tentative, that precipitous rate hikes might   heighten businessmen’s risk aversion and lead them to postpone planned investment  But   smaller rate hikes might have a greater economic impact this time than in previous expansions    These structural issues suggest to me that we may need to be more concerned than usual about   exactly what evidence or signals we will need to see to trigger a preemptive policy reversal,   given the lags in the transmission of policy  These considerations also seem to argue for   preparing people at the right time for a smooth transition to a less accommodative policy  It’s   nice to come to a point where we can begin to sort through those longer-term issues  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
7439,2003-12-09,"  Mr Chairman, after the first go-around I made a note to myself during   the break that if I were a committee of one I would drop completely the reference to further   disinflation  I think we learned earlier that repeating phrases gets us into trouble  I noted also   December 9, 2003 98 of 133    that I would like to characterize the inflation risk as either balanced or close to balance  I think   we’re missing a chance to move a little further away from the “considerable period” language  I   actually like the “can be patient in adjusting the stance of policy” phrase that was suggested as an   alternative  However, I can and will support your recommendation  I’m not sure, given the   hour, that I can convince myself—or anyone else—that my approach is a better way to go  So I   am comfortable with your recommendation  "
7499,2004-01-27,"  Thank you  When Roger called me and I asked him if an option was   “none of the above,” I shuddered, thinking that I’d be the only one with that preference  But I   gather from the comments thus far that I’m not alone  So let me just say up front that I certainly   share the view that we ought to resist the temptation to tinker at the margin at this point   I, too, found the working group and staff papers helpful, but for a reason other than the   reasons that have already been articulated  I think those materials exposed some very   fundamental issues that we simply haven’t come to grips with  I would suggest that the more   we’ve tried to say and the more we’ve tried to sharpen up the language of our post-meeting   statements, the more we have bumped into some very frustrating fundamentals that I don’t think   we’ve begun to agree on around this table  Not only is that going to get in the way with regard to   what to say in our post-meeting statements, but I think it’s going to carry over into the discussion   of the minutes    In that regard, I don’t think we’ve really decided what information we ought to provide to   the public  I agree with Presidents Minehan and McTeer that we have not even necessarily   agreed that we ought to be in the business of providing short-term—and I underscore short-  term—guidance to financial markets  We differ in our views as to whether that has been helpful   and appropriate  In my opinion, it has created a very short-term focus on policy that has not been   terribly helpful    So to my mind there are some very fundamental questions along those lines  I don’t   think we’ve even begun to deal with some of the basic questions about how to communicate our   policy objectives and benchmarks  In fact, we haven’t even agreed on the definition of some of   the very fundamental terms that Vincent highlighted, such as “sustainable growth,” “long-term   potential,” and “price stability”  Until we’ve defined those kinds of terms among ourselves, it   January 27-28, 2004 32 of 238    seems to me that such concepts as “gaps” have no meaning  They certainly have no independent   meaning; they have meaning only in the context of the Phillips curve framework, a construct on   which at least some of us have very different views  So how do we anchor the forward-looking   portion of our post-meeting statements on some kind of agreed-upon targets and objectives?  The   notion of our targets and objectives creeps into those statements even by the way we construct   them now  What is the relationship between the post-FOMC statements and the semiannual   Monetary Policy Reports to the Congress?  Those are questions we need to talk about, and I   think we’ll have some interesting discussions    In sum, my view of the work that has been done is that we should use it to highlight some   of the very fundamental issues that I think are going to be with us whether we’re talking about   the post-meeting statements or the minutes  Until we can come to grips with those issues, I think   we’re going to continue to struggle  And the more we try to say, the more difficult it will be for   us to be comfortable with the post-meeting statements  I’d like to come back and add some   further thoughts when we talk about the minutes and our semiannual forecasts  Thank you     Thank you, Governor Ferguson  I agree with your characterization of the   way to think about this as being risk management  That’s a concept the Chairman has used in   other policy discussions  I don’t think the risks are so large in terms of the process of producing   the minutes, though I see some small risks there  And like most others who have spoken, I don’t   like the idea of a blackout of essentially half of the period between meetings  I think that would   be a terrible step backwards   To me the larger risk—and this is going to seem strange, but I take a different view from   the one you expressed—is that, rather than being less informative, the minutes could become   more informative in an unfortunate sense You were saying that perhaps the discussion would be   more careful and more circumspect and as a result the minutes would not be as informative—a   point that Bob Parry also mentioned  I think it’s possible that it could go the other way and that   some people would be trying to get into the minutes their own particular way of thinking about   the economy  That could inadvertently lead to a lot of time being spent in the meetings trying to   January 27-28, 2004 55 of 238    get our preferred points of view into the minutes and more time spent arguing during the editing   process about how much of that language survives  And it seems to me, as Cathy Minehan   suggested, that the minutes will be read more carefully if they come out before the next policy   meeting  So depending on whose views the readers pick out of the minutes, if we have that kind   of jousting for phraseology and language in the minutes, we could in fact end up with minutes   that are more informative than we really want them to be  I see that as a larger risk, as strange as   that may sound  I just don’t think we need to go in that direction right now  And once we do,   we’ll have a very hard time going back the other way  So I would strongly prefer to sit tight   I also originally thought of the early release of the minutes as a possible tradeoff to get   away from the risk assessment in the post-meeting statements  But I think there’s another way to   make that kind of trade and it’s in the Monetary Policy Reports  We’ll come back to that shortly;   that’s an issue I would like to keep open also, as President McTeer suggested  Thank you     Do I have to follow that?  Could I ask for a bye and have you come back   to me?  I’m going to risk a bloody nose  I think the Chairman has already popped my balloon   before I tried to blow it up!  I’ve actually been laboring under the apparently false impression   that we are in fact in the forecasting business  I’ve assumed that we make policy decisions based   on both our collective and individual forecasts  We spend a lot of time not only studying the   staff’s forecast but looking at outside forecasts and doing some of our own  My staff tells me   that there’s a not insignificant body of research that says there is in fact some value in putting   together a number of forecasts that are done on a different set of assumptions    I guess I was dreaming—it may be the equivalent of the nineteen-person communiqué   that the Chairman says just can’t be done—that twice a year we would take a look out twelve to   eighteen months and try to inform the public about what we see  I have the sense not so much in   the forecast but in the semiannual statements that we have an opportunity as a Committee to let   the public know our view of the outlook and how they might expect policy to respond to   developments that might unfold  I know we respond to low probability events, but I hate to think   that our policy from meeting to meeting is driven without the benefit of a longer-term forecast   obviously adjusted for short-term events as they unfold  That troubles me a lot   So I had this dream that we could provide a really thoughtful semiannual statement from   this Committee—whether it’s done before the Chairman’s testimony or after the testimony—and   offer that as our forward-looking view of the broader economy  If we did that and talked about   January 27-28, 2004 79 of 238    developments that we believed would be important in the period ahead, I thought we might be   able to get away from the shorter-term statements that react to the recent data  I’m troubled, for   example, by the current Bluebook—that we’re going to struggle tomorrow with how to re-  characterize the labor markets because last time we said they were modestly improving and now   it appears that they may or may not be  I just wish that we could get ourselves and others   thinking a little more about the longer term, obviously tempered as we go along by unfolding   developments  That was my balloon that got popped, and I guess my nose is bloodied  But I   wanted to take a crack at it  "
7500,2004-01-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic picture unfolding in our   region, like that for the nation, continues to be encouraging  Both the hard data and the   accompanying commentary from merchants confirm that holiday sales were quite positive  We   continue to see a changing mix of fortunes among traditional retailers, specialty retailers,   discounters, and Internet shopping sites  Combined holiday sales exceeded last year’s by almost   all accounts  The news from our important tourism industry continues to improve, with reports   of record-breaking attendance for some District attractions and stronger hotel occupancy and   bookings  Single-family residential housing markets in our region remain strong; and even in the   depressed multifamily residential and commercial property sectors, vacancy rates seem to have   peaked and are beginning to improve     Business sentiment has decidedly improved across a wide range of business executives   that I have talked with  That optimism and strong profits are being reflected in capital spending   and capital spending plans  Interestingly, that spending is no longer just for cost savings   opportunities or for equipment replacement; I am also hearing more reports of spending to   expand capacity in selected cases because sales are strong  Trucking firms, in particular, have   noted a significant turnaround in both hiring and truck orders  Our bank examiners report that   large regional banks are seeing a measurable pickup in commercial loan demand, although that   renewed activity is still more in the discussion stage than in actual loans booked  Negative   reports are now coming mostly from struggling manufacturing industries such as petrochemicals   and apparel     The area of greatest risk and uncertainty in our regional picture over the near term is   employment  While our region continues to lead the nation in employment growth, we have   seen some falloff in the pace of that growth since the last meeting  That said, the two states that   January 27-28, 2004 130 of 238    account for the lion’s share of the growth we are getting, Georgia and Florida, now have   unemployment rates of only 4 percent and 47 percent, respectively  The largest employment   gains remain in employment services, and not surprisingly the job category showing net job   losses continues to be nondurables manufacturing    At the national level, I think we have to be rather pleased with the trends we are seeing   and expect to see in the composition of growth  I interpret the vast majority of recent high-  frequency data to be very positive  To my mind, perhaps the most important reading since our   last meeting is the confirmation of strong business profits and improved business confidence,   which are now clearly translating into more investment spending and inventory rebuilding  That,   in turn, should eventually contribute to some better job growth  Like many others who have   already spoken, I see the extent and timing of job growth as probably the greatest short-term risk   to our forecast  In fact, our own forecast is on the low side of the Greenbook and other forecasts   We are less sure that hiring will be as robust as others are expecting    The greatest longer-term risk, in my view, is the large and growing fiscal imbalance  The   better federal fiscal picture was an important contributor to our economic successes in the 1990s,   supporting our ability to conduct monetary policy geared to controlling inflation  Fiscal   imbalance, should it continue or worsen, may significantly complicate our longer-term policy   choices  Overall, my near-term outlook does not differ greatly from that in the Greenbook, and   the differences hold little significance for short-term policy, which I believe is about right for   now  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7501,2004-01-27,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I do think the new   language is a nice recalibration of our signal  It is an exit strategy that is thoughtful and gentle,   and in that regard it makes sense  When Ned was talking about calling in the fire trucks, I was   thinking that we had already planned to do that, but we sent the gas trucks in their place    [Laughter]  We’ve had the nozzle on automatic, and I think it’s time that we put our hand back   on the nozzle  In my view, your proposed rewording is a great signal, and I support it  Thank   you  "
7561,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent economic developments in our   Southeast region continue to be positive  Retailers are reporting that sales are still running well   above year-ago levels  Our important tourism and hospitality industry has improved further, and   reports are now quite positive, especially from South Florida  Unusually cold weather in the   North has resulted in a larger-than-usual migration of snowbirds from Canada, and a weaker   dollar has stimulated an influx of foreign visitors from Europe  Low mortgage rates continue to   buoy our single-family housing markets  And we’re seeing small improvements in selected   segments of the nonresidential sector, mainly due to institutional construction  While vacancy   March 16, 2004 45 of 107    rates remain relatively high in most of our large office space markets, it appears that both office   and industrial markets have at least stabilized     The sentiment of our regional business leaders remains positive and upbeat, and we are   hearing some of the same reports on capital spending, particularly for software and equipment, as   are reflected in the national data  Our bankers, unlike those in Al Broaddus’s District, are   generally disappointed that the business borrowing they thought they saw in the pipeline earlier   in the year has often not materialized  Apparently, much of the capital spending in our region is   being financed out of profits   We cannot shed much new light on the disappointing employment picture from what we   are seeing and hearing  Most of the job growth we’re able to track in our region is coming from   Florida, and much of that is in low-skill jobs in the hospitality industry  A few manufacturing   firms report that they are adding to payrolls  Ironically, and paralleling the comments of Cathy   and Tony, several of our District directors and Small Business Advisory Council members   reported a shortage of highly skilled workers, such as engineers and computer specialists  We   even heard reports of difficulty finding good workers for minimum-wage jobs in the service   sector in some areas of the region   We keep looking to our directors and other contacts for indications of imbalances and   pricing pressures that they might see developing, and we’ve begun to get hints of both  A   number of folks are expressing growing concern about potential overbuilding and worrisome   speculation in the real estate markets, especially in Florida  Entire condo projects and upscale   residential lots are being pre-sold before any construction, with buyers freely admitting that they   have no intention of occupying the units or building on the land but rather are counting on   “flipping” the properties—selling them quickly at higher prices   March 16, 2004 46 of 107    The list of goods and services with outsized price increases is beginning to grow  In   addition to insurance and health care, which have been on that list for some time, we’re hearing   about a number of others  Builders have begun to complain about increases in prices for lumber   and other inputs  Trucking prices are up in the aftermath of some shakeout in that industry and   new limits on driving time  The large run-up in steel prices is trickling down to end users, with   some steel goods now being priced only upon shipment  The higher oil and gas prices are being   passed through  My son, who is a residential real estate developer, reports that the cost of steel   fence posts has doubled over the last year and that the price of asphalt is measurably higher  He   has now rewritten his lot sales contracts to be able to pass through such higher costs  One of my   corporate directors reports that not only has his use of auditing services nearly quadrupled but   that the auditing firm had the gall to raise its fees!  Cruise ship operators, even with all the   capacity they’ve added in recent years, have reportedly raised some prices and scaled back   discounts and deals  Although these selected price increases and the return of some pricing   power in a growing economy are not expected to translate into higher near-term inflation   measures, it has been quite a long time since I’ve heard so much chatter about price increases  I   think it’s a reminder that, as supply and demand move back into balance in sector after sector,   we need to be alert   On the national front, I remain very optimistic about the outlook  We do seem to be on a   path with broad-based footing, and good growth over coming quarters seems quite likely  Our   own VAR models are suggesting growth close to 4 percent or perhaps a bit less; even so, those   forecasts are still well within the new error bands provided for the Greenbook forecast  I would   like to join others in applauding the staff for that refinement in the forecasts that come out of the   Greenbook   March 16, 2004 47 of 107    As most of us have suggested this morning and at other times, the lack of more-solid job   growth is clearly disappointing  While I think we understand and can explain to some degree the   sluggishness we’re seeing, it’s my sense that the error bands around expected employment gains   over coming quarters are quite wide  My own staff is of the view that even the scaled-back   estimates and the later timing of job growth in the Greenbook could still be a bit optimistic    Understanding the implications of that for our forecast of GDP growth and for policy is   important   Among the longer-term risks that I’ve emphasized at other recent meetings is the   unsustainable fiscal situation, which others have talked about and which is still not resolved  In   preparation for this meeting, my staff and I talked about the growing accumulation of US   securities by both the Japanese and the Chinese, as noted in the Greenbook and discussed briefly   this morning  As I understand the numbers, their holdings now account for more than a quarter   of outstanding Treasuries, and the pace of acquisition actually has quickened  It would be   interesting to hear some more discussion about how those purchases have interacted with our   own Desk operations and the possible implications for our policy and policy process should   those governments slow down their purchases or let their holdings run off as they mature   Finally, in line with my earlier comments about the selected return of some pricing power   as supply and demand move back into better balance, you won’t be surprised that I would judge   the inflation risks to be balanced now  While we still have some uncertainties and some drags on   activity to work our way through, we may not be able to be as patient for as long as some people   think  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7562,2004-03-16,"  Mr Chairman, I could support your recommendation, but I share the   view of President Stern and others in that the discussion around the table today sounded, at least   to my ear, as if we do see the inflation risks as balanced  In fact, I think we may have stayed   with the phrase “unwelcome decline in inflation” too long  Those words in the statement don’t   seem to be reflective of the discussion we had this morning  So I would have a preference for a   balanced risks statement on inflation  Thank you     A quick question prompted by Vincent’s last comment that we won’t   have the luxury to have this type of discussion in the future  A couple of meetings back, when   we were talking about expediting the minutes, you suggested that one way to deal with resolving   comments to the Secretary was to have a subset of the Committee to help with the editing  Are   we going to talk some more about that?  As we go through this experiment, are we going to use   that kind of process, or are we simply going to leave it entirely to Vincent?     Will we see each other’s comments?  This is the first time I think we’ve   ever had the luxury of seeing who made what kinds of comments  Will we see each other’s   comments, and by attribution, in the future?     I thought that’s what you suggested in earlier conversations The idea   was to have some group look at the comments on the staff’s draft and make some shared   judgment about whether the suggested changes should be made     Thank you  "
7613,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Continuing a pattern that was already evident at   the time of our last meeting, economic developments in our Southeast region are upbeat  There’s   evidence from several fronts that I would point to that demonstrates the growing breadth of our   regional expansion  Florida is the strongest state in our area by most measures, and a substantial   share of that strength is coming from tourism  Occupancy rates are continuing to rise, and a   growing number of foreign tourists are coming to the United States  Convention bookings in   Atlanta are now up 20 percent over last year, and business travel reportedly has increased further    Our manufacturing sector is experiencing a pickup as well, and that is reflected in new   orders and production  More goods are being moved and that’s showing up in increased demand for   trucking, rail, and air shipments  Some of this improvement in manufacturing can be traced to   stronger export activity  And while nonresidential construction has yet to show any measurable   pickup in most of our markets, activity in the important residential construction sector continues to   be vigorous  Certainly there are sectors that still have more repair work to do  In our area, those   include a major airline and telecommunications firms  In some cases, the slow recovery is now not   so much a matter of economic climate but rather the need for new business models  Of course, we   have some firms and some communities highly dependent on industries like apparel and textiles that   are still hurting from the structural adjustments taking place in their businesses   Another positive development since our last meeting is that our bankers are now reporting   significant improvement in C&I lending, mirroring reports that Al Broaddus, Mark Olson, and   May 4, 2004 34 of 112       others made last time  Perhaps an e-mail I received from Ms Paula Lovell, the recent past chairman   of our board of directors, captures the kind of upbeat reports that have now become prevalent    Paula runs her own public relations firm in Nashville, and she wrote me a note last week, which she   described as “unsolicited” because, her having served ten years on our board, her views on the   business outlook had indeed been solicited  At any rate, she said, “Jack, hope you and the Fed   crowd are doing well  I know this is unsolicited, but the flood gates have opened here with our   business  I had at least twenty companies call during the first quarter of 2004 to hire us or to call an   urgent meeting to ‘get started’  Everywhere I look there’s money flowing  I think things are really   strong”   Like others, we’re continuing to get anecdotal reports of rising prices and comments that   more of the increases in commodity import prices are being passed through to intermediate and final   goods  Examples include steel, energy, food, chemicals, plastic, metal, wood building materials,   fertilizers, tires, ice cream, and agricultural products like soy, coffee, and meats  While not an   Atlanta regional tidbit, the cab driver who brought me from the airport to the hotel here in   Washington last night proudly announced that, effective yesterday, there was a 10 percent increase   in fares for cabs coming into the District  And he was complaining because his colleagues in a   couple of other cities had gotten 15 to 20 percent increases for similar trips  The reasons being   given for the now more widespread price increases vary but include low inventories, lack of   capacity, increased demand, higher OPEC prices, and regulation   On the national front, I think we have to be pleased with the way things are unfolding    While the initial GDP numbers for the first quarter were a bit below many estimates, they continued   a pattern of three quarters of strong growth that is arguably above long-term trends  And I’m   comfortable with consensus forecasts that have robust growth continuing through this year and next    May 4, 2004 35 of 112       Perhaps most encouraging is the better balance we’re seeing across sectors, with business spending   now making a nice contribution to growth and expected to continue to do so  While there is still   considerable uncertainty as to the future path of employment growth, the most recent data and   anecdotal reports are encouraging there as well     It’s my sense that we’re now at a point where we need to spend more time trying to   understand price pressures and price prospects and their implications for policy  While we certainly   do not yet have any alarming run-up in inflation, I do not think we should dismiss the signals we   may be getting from both the data and anecdotal reports  Relying heavily on an output gap model   makes me uncomfortable, mostly because the gap is not a directly observable measure and because,   as others have already discussed this morning, forecast estimates of the current gap are very   different depending on whether one accepts the Board staff’s judgmental estimate, the FRB/US   model estimate, CBO’s estimate, or some other estimate  I’m also less comfortable than some about   inflation expectations being well anchored  I think recent data and surveys can be interpreted as   saying that we have already had some deterioration   I believe we’re at a point where we can begin to take back some of the extraordinary policy   accommodation that’s in place without great risk of serious unintended consequences  We can talk   about this more in the policy go-around, but if we believe that a further unwanted fall in inflation is   no longer a significant risk—a view that several have publicly expressed recently—and that risk   was the reason we gave for our last 25 basis points of easing, then a credible case can be made at   this meeting or at least at the next one for removing that accommodation as a first step  I also hope   that we will talk carefully about any new language we introduce into the statement as we come   closer to the time when we can contemplate a policy shift  In our earlier discussions I think many of   us expressed uneasiness about making pre-commitments as to the timing or the path of policy   May 4, 2004 36 of 112       changes  Those kinds of commitments could eventually mislead markets or tie our own hands  It’s   nice to have come to a point where we can have these kinds of discussions  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    "
7614,2004-05-04,"  I have a question of process  Do you want to continue this discussion?  I   can hold my comments and wait, but I want to weigh in on this issue as well  It’s a question of   whether we’re going to come back to it or not     I’ll hold my comments until later then   May 4, 2004 80 of 112         Mr Chairman, I wish we were in a position to move today, but obviously   we’re not  I’m among those who have a strong preference not to introduce another word such as   “measured” into our statement  Again, we’re all trying to play English major, I think  But I agree   with your comment that we cannot know with any certainty how the data will come in  Indeed, they   may run away from us a bit, and we may want to be in a position, if not in June then sometime in   the summer, to make more than a 25 basis point move  Vincent, in his response to a question,   indicated that he thinks “measured” will, in fact, be interpreted to mean 25 basis point moves, and I   just don’t think we need to say that  In my view, we have enough credibility that we’re going to   operate in a reasonable and measured way  I believe we would be doing ourselves and the financial   markets a disservice by implying a pre-commitment to a particular path for policy—a commitment   that we may later wish we had not made  I think we can operate just fine by dropping the word   “patience” and leaving well enough alone  Thank you   May 4, 2004 87 of 112         It was fun!  "
7664,2004-06-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic expansion in our Southeast   region remains solid  Recent developments in retail sales, autos, housing, tourism, travel, banking,   and manufacturing have all been positive, and I will not go through a discussion of each individual   sector  The main weaknesses remain in nonresidential construction and chemicals     June 29-30, 2004 115 of 203          Most relevant to our policy discussion this time has been the emergence of imbalances in   certain sectors that are generating significant price increases  For example, shortages of steel and   cement, as well as rising prices in other building materials, are clearly affecting big projects in   Florida where bids are either being revised up or in some cases builders are walking away from   projects  The price of concrete is up 10 percent, with additional increases expected to come  At a   breakfast meeting last week, the developer of a large high-rise downtown Atlanta residential project   told me that the job he had priced last fall now looks to be coming in at a cost almost 10 percent   higher because of rising prices of various construction materials  We heard reports of wholesalers,   contractors, and machine tool companies stocking up on concrete, steel, plywood, and sheetrock, if   the materials are available, in order to avoid future price increases and potential shortages  One   Florida contractor reported holding a three-month inventory of steel to limit the effects of higher   future costs  A shortage of truck drivers because of both higher demand for transportation and new   driver regulations is not only increasing shipping costs but also reportedly causing some firms to   begin to carry larger inventories than previously   I’m getting more and more reports of the ability to pass through higher input prices to final   consumers  Let me cite just a few examples  I’ve heard numerous reports of companies imposing   fuel surcharges without customer complaints  Those reports have come from UPS, a waste-  management company, a concrete company in South Florida, a nursery, an agricultural food and   supply company, a trailer manufacturer in Tennessee, an auto seat manufacturer in Alabama, a   lumber company in Florida, and numerous small trucking and delivery companies  A box   manufacturer indicated that he had passed along a severe 10 percent increase in paper prices with   little resistance, and he’s set to raise prices again in September  In Florida, small grocery stores,   hotels, and restaurants report raising prices without resistance in light of strong demand and higher   June 29-30, 2004 116 of 203          food and energy input prices  Tennessee hotels and resorts are also raising prices for the first time   in years because of strong demand  Fast food companies are reporting chicken supply problems   because of the trucking shortage I mentioned previously  Supply problems coupled with increased   demand in retail poultry markets have reportedly led some grocery stores to tell their poultry   suppliers to “name their price”  Finally, many personal service firms—barbers, spas, et cetera—in   Florida are raising prices with little resistance  At the same time, it is important to note that we also   have many other reports of firms absorbing input price increases because of competition, weak   demand, or the hope that many of the increases will prove to be transitory  Nevertheless, over the   last several months, there have been far more stories of price increases and higher costs that are   being passed along than we have heard in many years   At the national level, I think we have to be pleased and reassured with the new real side   data, which have been quite positive overall  And as one of the earlier skeptics about the likelihood   of robust near-term job growth, I find the two strong employment reports since our last meeting to   be really good news  The Greenbook as well as other forecasters are suggesting that GDP growth   will be in excess of 4 percent in 2004, with inflation stabilizing in 2005 to a rate below that of 2004    The distinguishing factor between the Greenbook and many other forecasts is that few of the latter   have the Greenbook’s particular combination of reasonably strong real GDP growth, benign   inflation, and low unemployment together with a low path for the federal funds rate  If the   Greenbook forecasts are seen by the Committee as adequately representing our beliefs about the   future, then are we in fact forecasting that the economy will soon return to the path it was on in the   late 1990s?  Perhaps  But I see the underlying fundamentals as being different this time, and   different enough to suggest that the longer-term inflation risk may be higher than some believe   June 29-30, 2004 117 of 203          I suggested at our last meeting that our focus should be on the best path for future policy and   not just on the first rate increase  I’ve been anxious, and still am, to get started with an early process   of removing the extraordinary policy accommodation that is no longer needed  Recent inflation and   inflation expectations data—and the anecdotal reports we’ve shared this morning—seem to   underscore the need to get started with our policy adjustment, even allowing for the fact that some   portion of the price increases we’re seeing will turn out to be transitory  My concern about the   future path of policy has been reinforced by our discussions yesterday afternoon about the   underlying imbalances of the so-called twin deficits that we are now experiencing  This heightens   my belief that we may well find that we will need to be on a steeper rate path than we have been   seeing in many of our simulations  Specifically, what are some of the more troublesome underlying   fundamentals I’m talking about?  Consumer debt and household financial obligations, while a bit   off their peak levels, are still much greater than in the 1990s  And the government fiscal situation   now shows deficits that are larger and likely to continue to grow, especially since I don’t see either   tax or spending policies moving to correct them in the near future  Finally, as we discussed   yesterday, we have a growing and unsustainable current account deficit    These factors point to higher levels of consumption and aggregate demand and suggest that   a neutral funds rate may be somewhat higher than some project, especially at the present rates of   productivity  If I am correct, then we run the risk of pursuing a more accommodative monetary   policy than we intend, with the likely outcome being a higher rate of inflation than expected    There’s a temptation to downplay the risk I’m raising  After all, the US economy has functioned   quite well with low inflation rates and with a negative real short-term rate, and some see continued   resource slack as taking pressure off prices  But I suggest, given the recent combination of   expansive fiscal and monetary policies, that our low inflation rate is most likely the consequence of   June 29-30, 2004 118 of 203          heavy support for the dollar provided from abroad and a willingness on the part of foreigners to   invest in this country, compensating for the low US saving rate   History, as well as theory, suggests that large current account deficits should be self-  correcting through downward adjustments in our exchange rates, upward adjustments to real interest   rates, a reduction in domestic consumption relative to production, and an increase in private and   public savings  All of this was discussed yesterday  What I think makes the orderly transition of   this imbalance especially difficult and problematic is the posture of current US fiscal policy, which   is not oriented toward reeling in the deficit, combined with the trade and exchange rate policies of   other countries—China and Japan to name just two  These countries are pursuing policies they   perceive to be in their own short-term interest  That is, they are either running persistent current   account surpluses or maintaining an overvalued currency through currency intervention aimed at   fixing their exchange rates relative to the dollar  While this may help foster domestic growth in   those countries, it also has the effect of enabling risky fiscal behavior on the part of the United   States, while postponing the day of reckoning for all   Obviously, the Federal Reserve can’t deal with trade or foreign exchange policies, nor can   we engineer a return to a more sustainable world economy by ourselves  In this respect, the conduct   of monetary policy becomes more difficult  What I believe we can and should do is to move the   path of monetary policy back toward a more neutral position  And the sooner we begin and actually   get there, the lower the adjustment cost will be for the United States and for the rest of the world  If   we wait too long before acting, then the more aggressive path we would have to pursue to catch up   carries increased risk, given the leverage in the consumer sector  Moreover, by falling behind the   curve we risk the likelihood of additional pressure on the dollar, contributing even more to   international imbalances  Finally, like President Yellen, I am more comfortable with the funds rate   June 29-30, 2004 119 of 203          path embedded in financial markets than I am with the more modest adjustments reflected in the   Greenbook baseline And like several others, I hope we can find language for our statement that   unties our hands to do what is suggested by developments as they unfold  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
7715,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like many others coming into this meeting, I   have been trying to understand why some of the wind seems to have gone out of the sails of   consumer spending and employment  Consumer spending has been such an important anchor both   during the recession and during the recovery, as other sectors one by one healed and began to   contribute to the expansion  Of course, we’ve been counting on some solid employment growth,   August 10, 2004 32 of 103          and the new income and spending power that comes with it will offset the individual spending that   will wane at the margin as we remove our extraordinary policy accommodation  Like others, I think   I am comfortable concluding that some combination of the sapping effect of high energy prices,   heightened concerns about a terrorist act associated with our election season, the Olympics, or some   other target of opportunity served to chill consumers  However, more-recent data such as auto   sales, which have already been cited by several people, suggest that consumer spending has not   dried up   Employment developments are also interesting, to say the least  I take some comfort in   looking back at the monthly data of the boom period of the 1990s, which remind us of the volatility   of monthly employment data  It is not all that unusual to have two or even three not so strong   months within a period of strong employment growth  At the same time, I certainly think the mood   among the business leaders I talk with about new hiring is still one of squeezing out the last ounce   from existing staff and of achieving the maximum amount of staff cuts possible from technology,   mergers, and acquisitions  That mindset seems to argue for the kind of more-moderate, but still   good, job growth reflected in the staff’s latest estimates  Perhaps more importantly, I do not see any   obvious loss of momentum in other sectors  By most measures, manufacturing seems to be holding   its gains  Homebuilding and sales are holding up remarkably well  Investment spending continues   at a good pace  Exports are growing nicely  We’re even seeing some first signs of a stirring in   commercial construction, or at least some planning and financing for future construction   As always, I’ve tried to ascertain how our regional data and anecdotal reports either confirm   or contradict the broader national developments  Since our last meeting, my regional insight   suggests that there is still broad and sustained underlying strength in the expansion  Reports from   our region’s tourist destinations are quite upbeat  Air travel is strong  We’re seeing some new   August 10, 2004 33 of 103          commercial construction cranes on the horizon and are hearing of projects in the pipeline  So on the   output side, I remain reasonably confident and encouraged that a good expansion continues to be in   train  Even 3½ percent GDP growth estimates sound pretty good, unless one had come to believe   that we really had returned to the high spots of the 1990s   On the inflation front, I agree that we do not seem to face any near-term threat of   measurably higher and uncomfortable inflation rates  At the same time, I am less willing than some   to conclude that most of the price pressures we have seen and talked about here at our meetings are   going to turn out to be transitory  While many of the increases associated with higher oil and other   commodity prices should be reversed in time, I continue to be struck by the degree to which we still   are getting cost pass-throughs  We’re being reminded that, in those areas where demand is strong   and building, price increases are sticking  When one decomposes the contributions, positive and   negative, to core PCE prices over recent quarters, it is clear that, were it not for the downward drag   of core goods prices, the increase in core service prices would feel more threatening   Our regional data and insights continue to remind me that there are continuing price   pressures and more pricing power than we have seen in some time  Since the last meeting, several   trucking companies have told us that they are about to announce 5 to 6 percent price increases  A   senior UPS executive director reported that there is very little pushback in fuel surcharges  Truck   driver wages are on the rise, and several Southeast trucking companies say that they have raised   starting pay twice already in 2004 and are expecting another increase in the current quarter  A   national temporary employment service company reports that they have raised their rates for the   first time in a couple of years  So I am not as ready as some to move inflation concerns completely   to the back burner   August 10, 2004 34 of 103          Putting all this together and looking ahead just a bit to the policy discussion, I would   conclude that, while the error bands of confidence intervals around our forecasts are probably now   wider, given recent developments the risks now seem more honestly balanced than they were at the   time of our last meeting  I think we can and should stay on the path of removing our extraordinary   policy accommodation  Thinking in Olympic terms, we should continue to cut back on the dosage   of our performance-enhancing policy drug!  [Laughter]  And finally, not knowing how much   opportunity we will have to discuss our post-meeting statement, I would suggest—while I am still   among those who wish to have a fundamental discussion of our communication practices, perhaps   at our January meeting—that today is not a good time to be tinkering again with that statement    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7716,2004-08-10,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I have one question and   one observation  I think I got confused in the course of your exchange with Bill Poole  Is the last   phrase under the assessment of risk in or out?  I thought there was some question about putting a   period after “needed”  What is the proposition on the table?  Does the wording remain as written   here?     Yes    August 10, 2004 81 of 103            Okay  Now for my observation  I may have not followed your discussion   about the labor market and how we deal with it—and maybe this is what Ned was talking about  As   I read the statement, it seemed to me that we may have contributed to the emphasis that people are   putting on our judgment about labor market conditions by having pointed to the employment   situation in almost all of our recent statements, including this one  I don’t know how to translate   what you said into better words, but maybe I misunderstood what you were saying     That’s helpful  Thank you, sir  "
7765,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like Bill Poole, in searching for words that   describe developments since our last meeting I kept coming back to “ho-hum”  We’ve had some   mixed readings, as is almost always the case, but no really big positive or negative surprises    And maybe, just maybe, we should allow ourselves to be pleased with that  I’m generally   comfortable with the most likely path and composition of output and spending laid out in the   Greenbook  If we get 3½ to 4 percent growth over the next several quarters, we should continue   to make gradual progress on pushing the unemployment rate lower, and those sectors where the   recovery has lagged should show improvement   I also would not quibble with the conclusion that recent inflation data suggest no   immediate threat of a troublesome run-up in broad price indexes  While I don’t want to do   anything to reinforce the label that Al Broaddus gave me at his farewell lunch as the remaining   “hawk” in the group, I would point out that some mainstream outside inflation forecasts still   September 21, 2004 60 of 100          have a decidedly upward tilt  When it comes time to choose the words for our statement today, I   hope we will resist the option of using language that gives too much emphasis too quickly to the   last couple of months of better inflation data   Perhaps the most interesting dimension to our most recent economic data and our   projections for coming quarters is in the area of employment and the labor markets  We spent a   good bit of time in preparation for this meeting thinking through some of the same possibilities   that are addressed in the Greenbook’s “less room to grow” alternative scenario  My labor   economists concluded that, if the recent decline we’ve seen in the labor force participation rate is   permanent—and making certain other assumptions about population growth and immigration—it   seems entirely possible that employment growth in the range of only 100,000 per month, on   average, would be sufficient to maintain the unemployment rate at its current level  We’ve done   better than that recently and, hence, the continued decline in the unemployment rate  This job   growth is far below the heady claim of the Council of Economic Advisers now on everyone’s   mind that the tax cuts would create 300,000 new jobs per month  It is also far below the job   growth incorporated in the Greenbook’s baseline projection for 2005   I make these points only   to suggest that, as is the case with many of the other variables with which we work, there are   probably sizable error bands around our estimates of future job growth  And those estimates   could have important implications for the notions of slack, the room our economy has to grow,   and ultimately price pressures   Developments in our region don’t shed much light on policy issues today  My director   from the corporate executive office of UPS in Atlanta, their chief financial officer, characterized   the growth in their business as relatively solid though not quite as strong as earlier in the year    And members of the small business advisory group that I met with last week reported some of   September 21, 2004 61 of 100          the same spottiness and uneasiness that has shown through in other sources of information    Reports from our contacts note that, while the effects of the three hurricanes that hit our area   were severe in the affected areas and will likely show through in some of the state level data, the   economic disruptions are expected to be short-lived  Higher insurance deductibles and adequate   flood coverage may have a negative impact on consumer spending in the short run, but we know   from past experience that reconstruction outlays will probably make up for the temporary   slowdown  Damage to agricultural areas may take a while longer to mend, and fortunately, this   is a traditionally slow time of the year for tourism in Florida   Looking ahead to policy considerations, as we almost all have come to do, I think recent   developments have met the hurdle for staying on the policy path embraced at our last meeting    Assuming things continue to unfold in roughly the manner described in the Greenbook forecast, I   hope we will stay on the path of gradually removing more of the policy accommodation  I think   we should give considerable weight to the possibility of unintended consequences and distortions   in resource allocation from policy stimulation that remains in place for an extended period of   time  Should we at some point find that the economy has less room to grow than we thought and   inflationary pressures begin to build, in my view we will be in a better position if we have gotten   to a more neutral policy setting  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7766,2004-09-21,  I support it as well  
7819,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  All things considered, the national economy   continues on what I regard as a very acceptable pace  Real GDP for the past six months has   advanced at a rate of more than 4 percent  This is above the average rate of 36 percent we   experienced during the 1990s expansion and with less volatility than we experienced during that   period  Furthermore, our models suggest that this growth is above the projected trend growth rate   of about 3¼ percent, which implies that there are no significant output gaps  Consumer spending   remains solid, and investment spending continues to make a good contribution to growth, while the   usual suspects for shocks and worries remain—oil, war, terrorism, fiscal policy, the dollar, and   others  I share the sense that there’s a high probability that balanced growth at or above trend will   continue over the forecast period     Most of us, like David, have been puzzling for some while over the atypical pattern of job   growth in this postrecession period  I see last week’s unexpectedly strong number as a bonus  The   overall employment outlook now looks more promising, but like several others, I would suggest   that we not overemphasize one month’s data, nor do I think we should expect a return to the   November 10, 2004 41 of 107    experience of the 1990s  That experience—the 300,000 plus monthly job growth that some began   to think of as the norm—with hindsight may very well have been reflecting a transitory acceleration   rather than heralding a shift in the underlying pace of sustainable job creation  And that   extraordinary experience may have contributed to an overly optimistic estimate of the NAIRU    Similarly, I’m also reminded, as others have suggested, that a significant portion of the productivity   growth we thought was taking place was subsequently revised away as new data came out  The   point is that we should not let the job situation play too dominant a role in our policy discussions   but should concentrate instead on getting the funds rate back to a more neutral stance   Much of what I see happening in the national economy is also evident in our District    Consumer spending is good; state government tax collections have been increasing  Housing   construction continues at a high level, and much of the structural downsizing in the region’s   manufacturing sector appears to be behind us   The hurricanes clearly took their toll on our region, and that impact will show through in the   measure of economic activity for a while  Tourism has been especially hard hit  A number of   hotels in Florida are still out of commission, but these are mostly small and in secondary tourist   markets  Major destination areas like Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, et cetera, are largely   unaffected  Nevertheless, our contacts are reporting that tourists remain skeptical and that advance   bookings for next fall are down  In addition, high fuel prices, when layered on top of other   structural problems, have essentially brought Delta Airlines to its knees  Our other regionally based   airline, AirTran, has also posted a loss for the third quarter as a result of high fuel prices and   hurricane-related disruptions to air travel   Also, notwithstanding the comments I just made about the strength of housing construction,   we have seen in anecdotal information just a hint of slowing in the pace of home sales  I don’t   think we should be surprised to see a leveling-off in that sector as some of the one-time effects of   November 10, 2004 42 of 107    people shifting from apartments to houses or moving up to larger homes wind down at current   interest rates   Finally, building on a comment the Chairman made, I would note that Hurricane Ivan added   to our short-term oil problem by destroying a significant number of oil and gas pipelines in the Gulf   of Mexico  Since mid-September some 4½ percent of yearly oil production from the Gulf has been   lost, and that region represents, I believe, around a third of total US production  These losses   caught refineries by surprise, and the US refineries have struggled to make up for the loss  In the   first week of September, refineries were running at about 96 percent of operable capacity  In the   last week of September they were at 84 percent, and currently they are running at about 89 percent   of capacity   These issues aside, I believe that if one steps back for a broader look at where we are with   the economy, we seem to be on a very acceptable track  Policy remains extremely accommodative   Election uncertainty is behind us  With real growth on what looks to be a good and sustainable   path, with inflation still moderate, and with the employment picture at least a bit more promising, I   believe that the policy path we have been on is the correct one  I hope we will continue to remove   more of the accommodation, as financial markets expect  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7820,2004-11-10,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, including the language  "
7874,2004-12-14,"  Mr Chairman, like Roger, I was in the group originally that was very   uneasy about this  But I’ve come to the other side and believe that, on balance, it is probably the   thing to do    Let me mention just a couple of thoughts, without completely repeating what others have   said  I would also commend Vincent and the staff and Bill and Don for helping us understand some   of the issues involved  I was thinking that more and more over the last few years—starting with   December 14, 2004 86 of 118           Dave and his staff and our own staff—we have used the concept of error bands around our   forecasts  And it seems to me that there are, in fact, distinct opinion bands around our views in a   meeting  I’ve been among those who have been very uncomfortable trying to boil down our post-  meeting statement to a few phrases  I share some of Cathy’s feeling that, if we’re going to release   the minutes earlier, we might like to have a tradeoff at some point and that might be the way to   accomplish it  I agree completely with the point that Ben, Roger, and Tim all made about the fact   that we’re making speeches anyway and the market is analyzing what we say  I’ve found myself   over and over again a week or two after a meeting, when it’s time to go back out and hit the street   again, wishing that the minutes were in play so that they could provide a frame of reference for my   comments  I think it’s a distinct advantage to have the minutes in the public domain earlier   Finally, I’d note a couple of nuances that perhaps could go unsaid  One of them I say with   some trepidation  In the original discussion, I raised some concern about not knowing what   happens after all the comments come in or how they get resolved  Vincent has done a nice job of   telling me what he did in terms of the disposition of my comments  But I have no concept of what   other comments came in and what kind of process he went through behind the scenes to take them   into account  I don’t mean that as a lack of confidence in either Vincent or you, Mr Chairman, to   tailor the final minutes appropriately  They’ve turned out pretty well  But there may be other   Secretariats or other Chairmen that I’d be a little uncomfortable just turning loose and giving a   blank check  In the last discussion of this you suggested that it might be possible to have a small   editing committee so that somebody would know what kind of comments were coming in and how   they were handled  So that issue of how differences are resolved when various comments come in   still makes me a little uneasy   December 14, 2004 87 of 118           Let me make one final comment  If we’re not going to release the minutes early but   continue to produce them early, I wonder if we don’t leave ourselves a little vulnerable to criticism   if somebody outside finds out that we have, in fact, produced them but have put them on a shelf  If   the minutes are in final form and people find out about that, I think we’re really vulnerable to   somebody saying, “Why didn’t you release them?”  So I don’t know whether that halfway house   works or not  Thanks  "
7875,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The meetings with our Sixth District boards of   directors were particularly timely this cycle, just concluding at the end of last week  I would note   three issues and impressions that came from those discussions   First, the directors’ general outlook for the economy was decidedly positive and more solid   and broad-based than has been the case for some time  There even seem to be some new stirrings in   commercial real estate  And more of our bankers are reporting some increase in business lending,   especially in small and middle markets  I was particularly struck by the degree to which much of   December 14, 2004 26 of 118           the business caution that remains was attributed by many to all of the time and attention being   devoted to the Sarbanes–Oxley governance work  One gets the sense that, once some of the initial   adjustment to that legislation is behind us, perhaps—just perhaps—some of the caution we have   talked so much about will begin to dissipate   Second, I was struck by the degree of talk about price increases that had been put in place or   were being planned  While some of those were directly attributed to the cost of oil and other energy   costs, there was just more widespread conversation about the determination to get some price   adjustment   Third, I was intrigued by an oil price observation from one of our New Orleans directors,   who is a senior executive for one of the largest US chemical companies  I had been under the   impression that less-developed countries like China, because they are “energy efficiency   disadvantaged,” would be relatively more hurt by the past rise of oil prices than the United States    However, this director related that, during a recent visit to China to discuss a new joint venture plant   to produce an input to the manufacture of plastic goods, his staff couldn’t reconcile the financials   that were being presented  The reason was that the energy price assumption in those projections   seemed to be unreasonably low  To make a long story short, the Chinese were using oil prices that   were about $10 less a barrel than West Texas intermediate crude  When queried about this, it seems   that the refineries built in developing Asia over the last fifteen years were designed to process sour   crude, which is presently trading at a price that is $8 to $10 below that of sweet crude  This means   that the area has a temporary, as well as a potential absolute, energy price advantage  Sour crude is   not in short supply  Moreover, US plants can’t handle it  The story seems totally consistent with   the discussion in the Greenbook of substantial differences in the prices of sour and sweet crude   December 14, 2004 27 of 118           At the national level, I find myself characterizing the pace of growth as somewhat more   robust than the “moderate pace” language we used in our post-FOMC statement last time  With   GDP having expanded at an average of more than 4 percent for the past six quarters and a forecast   for more of the same, I think we could be even more positive in describing the path we seem to be   on  Although we continue to puzzle and even worry about job growth, as Tony just noted we have   averaged about 185,000 new jobs a month over the past eleven months  This has been enough to   allow the unemployment rate to drift lower over the course of the year  Although continued   productivity gains and a general reluctance by businesses to hire until absolutely necessary suggest   that a substantially greater base of new job creation is probably not likely, we should continue to   make further gains in working down the unemployment rate unless we have significant changes in   the participation rate or in immigration policy   I cannot point to any alarming developments with respect to inflation, but the anecdotal   reports I just shared from across our District suggest a possible shift in the prospects for widespread   price increases, and that gives me pause  I’d also note that five-to-ten-year inflation expectations,   while reasonably well anchored, have drifted up steadily in 2003 and 2004 to nearly 2¾ percent   Finally, the substantial run-up in house prices, which we have followed in Florida and also   see in the populous Northeast and West Coast of the United States, may be at least partially   attributable to unusually low mortgage rates influenced by our very accommodative policy, which   has been in place for some time  Those developments and the risks associated with the run-up in   house prices probably deserve further study and thought as we decide how to posture policy    I continue to be comfortable with the policy path we’re on  And barring some surprise, I   judge that we still have a considerable way to go to get back to a more neutral stance  My concern   is that, with a real fed funds rate that continues to be near zero, we could unintentionally be   December 14, 2004 28 of 118           encouraging further imbalances in both the inflation environment and in the international sector  I   hope we will not try to signal that we may soon pause in our removal of policy accommodation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7876,2004-12-14,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I would say, again, that I   don’t think “moderate pace” actually describes the conversation around the table this morning  But   I agree with others that this is not the time to play with a word like that  "
7939,2005-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also thank the staff for the helpful papers My   own views are closest to Cathy Minehan’s and Don Kohn’s  Like almost everyone who has spoken,   I would remind all of us that we have been very successful in helping to achieve a long period of   stable and low inflation I think we have also achieved significant transparency in terms of our   inflation preferences I believe that each of us around this table has a general sense of what we think   our target is I believe that outsiders, including financial markets, get it as well  So, I don’t think   there’s any great additional transparency to be achieved by announcing a specific numerical   objective   I think there’s also considerable risk at this point in going down the path of choosing a more   formal objective  We have a large group around this table, and I think it’s going to be very   difficult—though perhaps not—and maybe even counterproductive to agree on a single price   measure on a more formal basis and with a less flexible adjustment process  I think we could even   lose some of the richness of the discussion that we’ve had in the past  I’m reminded of the period of           February 1-2, 2005 42 of 177  time when we were so worried about deflation that we perhaps didn’t do as much as we could have   in dissecting and decomposing some of the measures of inflation to see some of the things that were   going on under the surface If we focus on a single price measure, we may in fact miss that kind of   opportunity to look at what really is going on Although I agree with President Stern that having a   specific objective would not tie our hands, literally, I think it would, in fact, cause us to give up at   least some of the flexibility that we currently enjoy  And I see no reason to do that   There hasn’t been a lot of discussion of one of the items that Vincent mentioned in his paper,   and that is the reaction of Congress to our attempts to set a price-related objective  I agree with   others that we probably, in our way of government, have an obligation at least to consult with the   Congress I think there’s a clear risk that the Congress, with all good intentions, could want to   substitute its judgment for ours regarding what would be an appropriate objective  And maybe, as   Vincent’s paper suggests, Congress would even attempt to give us multiple objectives that could be   internally inconsistent or, in fact, beyond the central bank’s ability to materially affect   I won’t repeat the arguments others have made about some of the new communications   problems that we could create with a formal objective  I actually think what we need to do is to   allow ourselves and others to celebrate an approach and operating process that has worked and   worked very well in not only achieving low inflation but anchoring inflation expectations  I   certainly agree with the suggestion in Vincent’s presentation that we should continue to work on   other opportunities to explain our inflation preferences and intentions But, to use the word that   others use, I don’t think our current process is “broken” I have much more confidence than some   others that the people around this table and others who will follow us are not likely to break it   Mr Chairman, I think we should stay where we are for the moment, although this issue   certainly merits continued discussion  Thank you  "
7940,2005-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As was the case at the time of our last meeting, I   think we should be pleased with the way things are unfolding  Output continues to expand at a good   and sustainable pace, we’re getting solid investment spending to complement sustained consumer                    February 1-2, 2005 94 of 177  spending, we’re getting sufficient job creation to at least gradually push unemployment lower, and   inflation remains at a low level   What we’re seeing in our Southeast region certainly confirms and helps to explain the   favorable picture we see at the national level  Most of the key sectors of our regional economy,   including consumer spending, housing, manufacturing, retail, tourism, and auto sales, remain   positive We found it encouraging that a large share of investment spending by businesses was   reported to be attributable to the anticipation of increased sales  Other planned investment spending   is being attributed to a desire to upgrade technology and to continue to improve competitiveness and   cost efficiency Consumer spending in our region continues to be strong  Tourism has been   especially positive Florida theme parks are once again full to capacity, hotel bookings are up, and   hotel room tax collections are 8 percent ahead of year-ago levels  Housing growth in our region has   eased a bit, though it still remains at a high level    The good pace of overall activity has contributed to new regional job creation While having   slowed somewhat in December, job creation has been sufficient to move ahead of the peak   experienced just before the onset of the recession  Our District added some 264,000 jobs last year,   an increase of 14 percent Florida led the District, creating 172,000 new jobs  Since the end of the   recession, Florida has accounted for 27 percent of the net new jobs created in the entire country   The District unemployment rate, at 49 percent as of the end of December, remains below that of the   nation   Finally, I continue to be watchful for imbalances and their implications for inflation  At our   last board meeting, our directors provided additional reports of continued sharp run-ups in housing   prices in selected areas, especially in some Florida real estate markets  One director who manages a   large trucking firm noted that equipment shortages in trucking are leading to frequent price   increases She reported that fuel surcharges are also being readily passed on and that rationing of   transportation services is becoming more widespread  Other directors who are large shippers                          February 1-2, 2005 95 of 177  commented that railroads are beginning to decline to renew some contracts to ship certain bulk   chemicals, which are less profitable than containers and piggyback loads   As for policy, nothing in the data from either our region or at the national level suggests to   me that we need to change the path that current policy is on in terms of either speeding up or   slowing down the pace with which we’re removing the substantial accommodation that remains    Markets are expecting further moves  And our models are suggesting that even with several more   increases in our fed funds target rate, the real economy should expand between 3½ to almost 4   percent next year That modeling work suggests that unemployment should continue to edge down   and that the CPI should average between 2½ and 3 percent Of course, the risks to these forecasts   that people have already talked about are not insignificant But I’m comfortable with the path we’re   on, at least for now Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7941,2005-02-01," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
8000,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like others, I’ve been both somewhat surprised   but certainly pleased at the steady and strong pace of real GDP and job growth we’ve been   experiencing   This positive experience has been mirrored within our Southeast region  For example,   regional retail sales growth in January was 7 percent on a year-over-year basis This momentum   also carried through into February, with inventory accumulation reported to be generally balanced    Factory orders are also continuing to increase   However, like the rest of the nation, one recent soft spot has been new vehicle sales, which   remained weak except for some imports and luxury cars  In contrast, used car sales have improved   and, as one might expect, prices of compact and more efficient cars have increased at a faster pace   than those of SUVs   Our tourism and hospitality industry continues to give very positive reports, with rising hotel   and motel occupancy rates  It’s clear that the weaker dollar has resulted in a surge in foreign   tourists, who are not only visiting but also buying houses in Florida  Better job creation in our   District continues, led by Florida, and the District unemployment rate edged down further in January   to 5 percent                             March 22, 2005 31 of 116  Our banking contacts and supervisory people report continued consumer loan growth, high   asset quality, and low past-dues At the same time, our bank examiners are reporting a pickup in   competition for commercial and real estate lending, especially from money center banks  We   received one report of a regional bank losing out on what was essentially a BBB credit The   borrower was offered what amounted to AAA credit financing, at 20 basis points over Libor  Our   bank directors have also expressed concern that the flat yield curve is driving lenders out the   maturity spectrum where they are taking more risk in search of returns   I mentioned housing a moment ago  That sector continues to show strength in our region,   with more and more anecdotal reports that can only reflect speculative activity along many parts of   the Florida coast Investors are making significant capital gains buying and reselling condo units   before the contractor has even broken ground But such speculation isn’t confined to multifamily   condo units We’re also seeing some of that same speculation in Florida single-family detached   homes, a much larger part of the total residential market, although the very high levels of permits   and sales per capita are partly explained by the underlying demand for such houses for relocation   and second homes   Turning to developments at the national level, I find that I can almost repeat the points I   made at last month’s meeting  The rates of real growth and job creation are very encouraging  My   growing concern, which has been heightened slightly over the intermeeting period because of the   continued reports of housing speculation and the potential underpricing of risk, is the inflation   situation It’s clear from the incoming information on prices—the surge in PCE and PPI data in   some recent months, the changes in the Greenbook inflation forecasts, and recent changes in the   trend patterns of key components comprising the measures of core CPI—that both goods and   services inflation are now showing signs of picking up                                   March 22, 2005 32 of 116  Are we at the point where it’s time to change the path of policy?  I don’t think we are there   yet I continue to believe that we are on the right policy path, at least for now, and that we should   resist the temptation at this meeting to deviate from it  While inflation pressures and potential   pressures have clearly increased, much of the recent surge we’ve been seeing in core goods inflation   is coming from the rise in used car prices, which we believe is driven by the pullback in new car   incentives and the slowdown of used cars coming on the market  In addition, as of January, a large   number of components of the core CPI—actually 20—still continue to show declines as compared   with 32 components that are showing increases   Finally, while there has been some deterioration in short-term inflation expectations, longer-  term expectations have not moved measurably  While I am comfortable with our current policy   path, I believe that what we say in the statement has, in fact, become even more important and more   sensitive While our current policy path seems to me to address the risks as I see them today, I   would like us to find the opportunity sometime soon to underscore the need for more flexibility to   respond to incoming data  The inflation risks are worrisome and could deteriorate, and we may, in   fact, need to use that additional flexibility before too long I’ll comment more later about suggested   changes to the statement language  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8001,2005-03-22," Mr Chairman, I’m not sure I followed all the alternatives, but let me weigh   in on the draft language in cell B5 as well If we’re going to make that kind of change in the   language, I think there’s a better way to do it that will be a better transition in terms of the guidance   we offer I would suggest another alternative—I guess it’s the fifth alternative on the table—using   words like “Conditional upon the current path of policy, the risks to the attainment of both   sustainable growth and price stability are roughly balanced”  That does a couple of things It seems   to me linked to the path of policy that I heard most of us around the table say we are comfortable   with; and it gets around the problem that Bill Poole talked about in terms of our inability to find   words to describe the distribution of risk I think something like that is a better transitional   paragraph    “Conditional upon the current path of policy, the risks to the attainment of   both sustainable growth and price stability are roughly balanced” To me it combines a number of   things I heard around the table Also, I want to say that I come out of the same cave as Cathy on the   B4 cell Although we didn’t have any quid pro quo when we voted for early release of the minutes,   one of the effects that a lot of us hoped for was that we could simplify our statement  It seems to me   that we have a chance to do that by dropping that whole last sentence in B4 about energy prices and   consumer prices  I think we could depend better on the minutes that come out in three weeks to                                     March 22, 2005 81 of 116  flesh out that risk as well as others that we’ve talked about To me it’s a great opportunity to   simplify the statement a little    May I try just one more thought?  I meant to say this earlier  I think Jerry   Jordan, wherever he is on his sailboat, would smile at B5, because I think we’re saying exactly what   Jerry tried to get us for years to say If policy is set appropriately at the meeting, the risks should   always be balanced I think it actually neuters the entire balance-of-risk statement    We have    I have just a quick suggestion If we’re really going to tackle this in May,   we ought to try to get drafts of what we’re going to work with out earlier than a couple of days   before the meeting so we have more time to share our views    That would be my plea    Sorry, Vincent    Mr Chairman, we’ve obviously begun an important conversation  If it   wasn’t evident before, it is now, how painful and difficult this is going to be I also appreciate the   reminder of the need to be sure that we don’t unnecessarily shock the markets as we try to get our                                         March 22, 2005 97 of 116  words right—or as right as we can make them  So I look forward to the discussion of this next   meeting, and I intend to vote for your recommendations today  "
8051,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I interpret what is characterized as softness in   some of the recent data releases as an indication that at least the risks to the path of real output   growth, which has averaged 3½ percent since the end of the recession and 43 percent over the last   eight quarters, may have increased  It’s my sense that both consumer and business confidence may   still be a bit more fragile than we thought, and it seems most likely that the skittishness is more due   to the uncertainty about high energy prices and their likely persistence rather than a reaction to   higher interest rates   Recent data and the anecdotal reports I hear from our Southeast business leaders, from both   large and small companies, seem to suggest some new caution when it comes to spending and hiring   decisions A director who is a senior level executive of Georgia Pacific Corporation says that recent   box sales, which track consumer nondurables fairly well, have tapered off slightly, whereas another   director, who is Chief Financial Officer of UPS, reports that business is steady but not spectacular    At a meeting of our Small Business Advisory Council two weeks ago, there was a near consensus   among those in the non-services sector that persistently high energy prices were taking a toll on   profits and were causing some capital spending plans to be put on hold  Obviously, the earnings   problems of the two airlines headquartered in our District were exacerbated by higher fuel costs                                     May 3, 2005 35 of 116  Furthermore, the large gains in temporary employment may be indicative of reluctance to add full-  time employees unless absolutely necessary   Despite the increased uncertainties, however, I view the most likely path for output, as does   the Greenbook, to be near or even above potential and, as such, unlikely to require attention from   monetary policy  I’m a bit more concerned about the recent price developments which, while not   alarming, have now given us several months of upward tilt to measures of inflation—regardless of   the index one prefers   The price pressures we see in our region, while mirroring the general upward drift reflected   in the national data, are still uneven, with some intended and actual price increases becoming more   widespread and sticking and others being greeted with resistance  For example, our Georgia Pacific   executive reported that for the last two months attempts to get price increases on many consumer   products were meeting with less success than was the case in late 2004  He indicated that his   customers now were more aggressively playing suppliers off against one another  At the same time,   he reported that the prices of building materials were now clearly reflecting the higher energy costs   involved in their production   Residential construction in Florida remains white hot, with continuing concern about   speculation in those markets as I’ve been reporting for a while now  And just two days ago, one of   our former directors from central Florida reported that one of the area’s largest contractors was told   that concrete was about to go on allocation and to discontinue Saturday deliveries That same source   also indicated that drywall was about to be in short supply again   At the same time, our staff’s work on disaggregating the CPI inflation data indicates that the   largest contributors to increased inflation have come mostly from factors other than the pass-through   of energy costs—namely, increases in new and used car prices, lodging costs away from home, and                                       May 3, 2005 36 of 116  the rental equivalence measure for housing  Over the past six months, the negative contribution to   inflation from goods has been reversed, more clearly exposing the underlying trend in services   inflation, which has been rising at nearly 3 percent for the past year   In short, the various price and real-side data, tempered with anecdotal reports, lead me to the   assessment that, while the risks to the real-side economy have clearly increased, the risks to inflation   are now clearly to the upside and policy remains accommodative  Markets are expecting another 25   basis points of tightening today, and this seems to me the right path for us to be on  Having said   that, I conclude that, with the increased uncertainty about the real economy, we need to think hard,   very hard, about just how much we really know and what to say about the path of policy going   forward Like President Minehan, I suggest that it might be time to let some of the policy   uncertainty show through Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8052,2005-05-03," Mr Chairman, I was going to raise this point later, or maybe at another   meeting, but I think it’s consistent with the discussion we’re having  I would hope that we don’t   foreclose the possibility, long term, of rethinking this entire process  It seems backwards to me to be   trying to work on the statement before we have the benefit of a Committee discussion in which we   hear each other’s views I don’t think we can replicate that in one-on-one discussions   Don, you know far better than I do the process at the Bank of England, but Bob Eisenbeis   and I had occasion to visit there, and I believe their process still involves a meeting that encompasses   two days They meet one day to talk about their views on the economic outlook and on policy    They spend the next day talking about what to do and how to describe it It seems to me that this   work is important enough that at some point—again, not today—we might want to reconsider the   whole process If we to want to craft these kinds of statements, they may be better done by the   Committee after we’ve had our discussion about the economy and policy  I just hope we wouldn’t   rule that out as a possibility somewhere down the road      Mr Chairman, I think we have a conundrum—another one—with a capital   C on this language issue We can’t seem to get unstuck from it  I’ve probably already said enough   I agree with what Bill Poole said, but I’m not sure I understood your response  I think it’s absolutely   critical that the minutes that are going to come out in three weeks are faithful to the tone of the   discussion and reflect the range of uncertainty I heard around the table  And I heard an awful lot of   uncertainty today, from people who were on the side of thinking that we need to pause to those who                                 May 3, 2005 88 of 116  felt that we need to go faster in raising the funds rate I also am growing uncomfortable with a   statement released after the meeting that doesn’t seem to describe that range of uncertainty and the   latitude that we need as a Committee  I wish I were smart enough to offer an alternative  I   appreciate your concern about our post-meeting statement causing serious, unintended   consequences, but I’m not sure the statement we have on the table really does that  Obviously, I’ll   support it and the 25 basis points, but I don’t think we’ve got this licked yet We have a lot more   work to do to try to get it sorted out Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8103,2005-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Anecdotal reports from our regional contacts   and the most recent data releases suggest that business conditions in the Southeast have remained   positive since our last meeting  Florida, as has been the case for some time, has been dominant in   terms of both employment growth and the pace of economic activity, given the strength in sectors   such as tourism and housing   Coincident indicators, like personal income and state tax revenues, suggest that our   District’s growth over the past several months has averaged about 3 percent, with major   contributions coming not only from Florida but also from Alabama and, to a lesser extent, Georgia   and Mississippi   District employment growth has been averaging roughly 35,000 per month until the   disappointing report of only 3,000 new jobs in May  Our regional unemployment rate has been   running about 02 percentage point below the national average  However, absent Florida, the rest of   the District underperformed the nation as a whole                                              June 29-30, 2005 116 of 234  The apparent slowing in employment growth was a concern in terms of the regional outlook,   although I would say that recent anecdotal reports on hiring are more encouraging than the official   data  It seems to me that the key question from a policy perspective is whether there are signs of   regional imbalances on either the price or the real side that might shed light on the national picture   and on the broader risk to either growth or inflation   With respect to growth, the capital spending survey suggests that planned investment   spending in our District remains solid  And the motivations for this are now more rooted in the   expectation of increased sales rather than the need to cut costs, improve productivity, or to replace   obsolete technology  Having said that, let me note that we received some interesting and sobering   anecdotal comments from our directors  One director from the paper pulp and forest industry   expressed concerns, perhaps selfish concerns, about the overexpansion for certain manufactured   building supplies  He indicated, for example, that production capacity for building products such as   gypsum wall board, concrete, and manufactured lumber was on a pace to expand 30 to 35 percent   worldwide over the next three years  In the specific case of one product that is dear to his heart,   oriented strand board, he said that the increase looks more like 40 percent He characterized the   industry’s very aggressive investment spending plans as preparing to, and I quote, “jump off the   cliff yet again” [Laughter]   Our reports indicate that investment spending has also increased in the air cargo freight area,   driven by international demand  Our bankers tell us that commercial and industrial lending remains   highly competitive, with a resulting narrowing of spreads, although credit quality continues to be   good Our director from the forest product sector noted a continued softening in paper box demand,   which he has found to track nondurables very closely                                  June 29-30, 2005 117 of 234  Finally, there is the housing situation, which we talked about for a long time yesterday   afternoon  As I’ve been reporting for several meetings, some of our markets, especially those in   coastal areas of South Florida and the Florida panhandle, are experiencing a level of building   activity and price increases that are clearly, in my view, unsustainable  Nearly every major Florida   city now has experienced increases in the double-digit range, and some, like Miami, Palm Beach,   Sarasota, and West Palm, have been reporting increases in housing prices on a year-over-year basis   of between 25 and 30 percent  While our discussion yesterday did not seem to indicate a consensus   on a national housing bubble, based on past experience I’m reasonably comfortable characterizing   the housing feeding frenzy in some of our markets as being a bubble or a near bubble   For example, the number of major projects planned or under construction in Miami now   totals 114, most of which are high-rise developments  That includes 61,000 condo units—eight   times the number that were built in the last decade—and a total of 100,000 new parking spaces  I   know we don’t have any process for introducing exhibits into the record, but I’d like to pass Dave   Stockton this pictorial of the new projects in Miami, so that he can continue to worry a little bit   along with me [Laughter]     My supervision and regulation staff thinks this is an accident waiting to happen in our area    And while the local market excesses probably do not represent systemic national risk, the shakeouts   could have serious regional consequences  My bank supervision staff points out that housing-  related credit risks to our bank lenders are not so much from defaults on permanent mortgage   financing that we talked about yesterday, but rather from lending for land acquisition, development,   and construction   The ugly picture we have seen before—and that they think we may very likely see again   before long—goes something like this the drying up of sales of new units; the painful decision of                              June 29-30, 2005 118 of 234  developers to go ahead and complete the construction of additional units to make them saleable,   further depressing the market; and speculators who had hoped to see big capital gains walking away   or defaulting on their contracts, giving their properties back to the lender  Perhaps it’s because of   where I sit, but I am less comforted than some of my colleagues about the housing situation   As for the national economy, my view is that real GDP growth is most likely to remain on   its recent path, averaging around 3½ percent, which we judge to be very close to trend  Consumer   spending seems to continue to be roughly in line with GDP growth, confidence has rebounded,   investment spending is still supportive, and manufacturing has seemed a bit brighter in recent data   reports  I would characterize employment growth as better than the “improving gradually”   language would suggest, and I think it should be sufficient to at least keep the unemployment rate   around current levels or perhaps nudge it even lower   I am less sure about the prospects for underlying inflation  But given the amount of policy   accommodation that remains in place, and that will remain in place even if we raise our target rate   another 25 basis points today, I believe the inflation risks are now on the upside  While the most   recent monthly inflation numbers dipped a bit, the overall path for the last year has clearly been up    And the Greenbook forecast and other forecasts of inflation have been raised for the remainder of   this year and into next year  Until further evidence is available, there is the risk of putting too much   weight on the high-frequency numbers, such as the May PPI and CPI releases, and losing sight of   the longer-run inflation path   Even more important than this, however, is the presence of the longer-term imbalances that   we’ve talked about, which increase the risk to the economy  Most of these are largely beyond our   control  I have in mind here not only the fiscal deficit and the trade situation, but also the continued                                June 29-30, 2005 119 of 234  troubles in our domestic auto industry and, of course, problems in the airline industry  Both of these   latter problem areas may have undesirable spillover effects to financial markets   It also looks as if higher energy prices are here for a while, and this is reflected in futures   prices Higher energy costs will clearly squeeze energy-dependent businesses first, but I think we’ll   also have uncertain trickle-down effects that can’t be good for other industries    I’ve already expressed my concerns about the unstable path of housing in at least some   important local markets  I believe that the least risky policy strategy through these unusual times is   to set monetary policy so that it does not contribute to unsustainable activities  Therefore, I believe   that continuing on our recent policy path for the next few meetings would be the best course of   action Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8104,2005-06-29," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
8162,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Consistent with incoming data on the   national economy, business conditions in our part of the Southeast have remained positive since   our last meeting  In fact, I found it more difficult than usual to answer the questions “What has   changed?” and “What are we seeing and hearing in the region that might help inform national   trends in our policy discussion?”   So, uncharacteristically, I will highlight just one regional issue—one I’ve talked about a   great deal and one which I still think is especially important—and that is the extraordinary pace   of home building and sales in some of our markets in the Southeast  It may be wishful thinking   on my part, but one gets the sense that things may—and I emphasize may—have begun to show   some signs of cooling  Although home building remained at high levels over the most recent   period, reports from builders in our area were a bit more mixed, and some modest deceleration   was noted in a few Florida markets  Most interesting, our bank examiners are now reporting that   some of the large regional banks are beginning to exercise a new caution in their real estate   lending, and some have gone so far as to actually stop development and construction lending in   certain areas of Florida I find this appropriate and encouraging  Of course, the fact that   permanent mortgage rates remain relatively low, even with the recent uptick, is probably still the   greatest stimulus to the extraordinary and prolonged housing boom  But I hope my sense of   some restraint now being exhibited is correct and will bring us to a better balance                August 9, 2005 48 of 110  Turning to the national economy, I’ll also focus on just a couple of areas and their policy   implications, and I think all of those have already been referenced in the question period or by   others The first is that the growth in output has, if anything, been somewhat stronger recently   than I expected, even though the NIPA revisions tell us that the economy was on a somewhat   lower growth path than we had thought Others may not share my view, but I think that I, and   probably we, have more often than not tended to underestimate and underforecast output growth    We may be acknowledging that again based on the fact that most forecasts, including the   Greenbook, have been revised up for the remainder of the year  I believe it was President Stern,   and I think he just confirmed this, who reminded us once—and maybe more than once earlier in   the expansion when we were getting uneasy—to have faith, and he seems to have been right   I’m also perhaps more sensitive than some to what we now know from the data revisions   that show us the higher levels of inflation in the recent quarters  I recognize that the upward   revisions on the core PCE series were in the imputed prices  Nonetheless, the level of measured   inflation has gotten closer to the upper bounds of my comfort level, as well that of others, and I   think we should be more sensitive to forces that could, despite the most recent monthly data that   have been encouraging, exert upward pressure on prices in the period ahead   Although I did not go back and check, I would guess that the adjustment in the estimated   output gap reflected in today’s Greenbook was one of the largest between-meeting adjustments   in quite some time  Although I don’t find the output gap framework especially helpful, the rapid   closure in that measure suggests to me that upward inflation pressures could be more imminent   Of course, the Greenbook’s “more room to grow” alternative scenario could give one   comfort, but I do not find that possibility compelling, because such an outcome hinges critically   on the existence of more slack in labor markets, presumably due in part to the current low                August 9, 2005 49 of 110  participation rate I’m not convinced that is a reasonable view  I’m concerned for two reasons    First, it is not clear that the failure of labor force participation rates to rebound following the   recession means that slack in the economy is greater than is reflected currently in the   unemployment rate  Our Atlanta staff’s recent research indicates—when one controls for   changes in worker characteristics, changes in individual behavior and preferences, and for   differences in the economic environment—that labor force participation rates are not likely to   return anytime soon to the peak level seen in 2000   Second, looking at the upcoming changes in labor market demographics that will hit the   economy as soon as next year, we will have to change substantially how we think about labor   markets and job creation in our economy  If I read the data correctly, projections by the BLS   [Bureau of Labor Statistics] and Social Security Administration show that nearly 400,000 more   workers will retire in 2006 than will enter the labor market  That trend will accelerate year by   year, as more and more baby boomers reach retirement age  It is unlikely to be completely offset   by increases we might see in older worker labor force participation   The cumulative deficit in workers could reach nearly two million in 2009 and four   million in 2011  I think we all know our economy will find ways to deal with these significant   changes But given this forward-looking perspective, I am not terribly worried about slack in the   labor market  Further, not far down the road I think we will find ourselves concerned about   where the workers will come from, especially if the economy continues to create jobs—even at   the current pace  Not only do we have to revamp some aspects of how we think about the   economy, but we also must be mindful of the pressures that will bring to do things differently    And those trends will surely call for adjustments in some of our models                         August 9, 2005 50 of 110  When it comes to the policy discussion, I think we should be sure that we’re comfortable,   after taking account of the very latest information on growth, productivity, and inflation that   we’ve gotten over the last couple of weeks, with the phrase in the alternative B draft statement   that characterizes labor market conditions as continuing to improve only “gradually” and the   phrase that says “core inflation has been relatively low”  It seems to me that we should not do or   say anything today that could counter market expectations that we now have a somewhat greater   upside risk to inflation and that we still have unnecessary policy accommodation to remove    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8163,2005-08-09," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  While accepting your   arguments against fiddling with the wording, I must say that I also would prefer to take the word   “gradually” out And I share Sandy’s concern that, read literally, the phrase “core inflation has   been relatively low” could be interpreted as a comfort level, and I don’t think that was the tone   of our discussion But I assume we can correct that interpretation with our comments, as we all   go out and speak publicly, so I support your recommendation  "
8207,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously, our Atlanta Bank’s attention these   past three weeks has been riveted on Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, because of both our   operational responsibilities in the areas affected by the storm and our concerns about the welfare   of our New Orleans staff  In addition, we have been trying to contribute to our collective   understanding of the policy implications of the storm and its aftermath     Let me first take this opportunity to thank our colleagues here in Washington and at all of   the Reserve Banks for the extraordinary support you have given us over the past three weeks and   for the contributions some of you and many of your staff members have sent for our New   Orleans staff relief fund to help some of our most desperate employees  Also, it’s my   understanding that we have borrowed employees from at least seven other Reserve Banks to help                               September 20, 2005 37 of 117  us with the processing of New Orleans checks in Atlanta  And our sister banks in Dallas and St   Louis and the Cash Product Office in San Francisco have gone to extraordinary lengths to help   us meet the cash needs of the hurricane-affected areas   Fortunately, we have accounted for all but one of our 176 New Orleans staff  Our staff   members now, amazingly, are spread across 12 states, living with friends and relatives and trying   to restart their lives It’s not clear at this point when we’ll be able to restart operations out of the   New Orleans office We have sorted through the various dimensions of the impact of the storm   and could cite much in the form of detailed statistics and anecdotal evidence  That descriptive   information has already been shared with the Board staff and others around the System, so let me   use my time to focus on our views of the most important policy implications of what has   happened   In the end, we believe—if past experience is any guide—that while there will be a hit to   output, the natural inclination of people to rebuild residences and businesses will begin to kick in   more quickly than one might expect  And this will be supported by the inflow of insurance   payments and the substantial federal aid that the President has promised, as we have already   talked about We do believe that this will begin sooner in Mississippi, which does not have to   contend with the flooding that will delay progress in New Orleans  In fact, our directors from   Mississippi indicate that as early as last week deals were being done and aggressive cleanup and   even some major repair work had already started  From this perspective then, we believe the lost   output, as is the case in the forecast in the Greenbook, will be made up reasonably quickly   My greater concern is on the implications for prices from the damage of the area’s   infrastructure, which includes oil and gas platforms, rail lines, intermodal transportation, bridges,                         September 20, 2005 38 of 117  refineries, pipelines, and natural gas processing facilities  These facilities are critical to the   production and distribution of energy and energy-related products for the nation as a whole  The   damage has already been seen, as oil and natural gas prices have spiked, and we believe there   will be important impacts on both headline and core inflation measures  These will result from   the ripple effects stemming mainly from the supply shock to the prices of oil and gas, refined   products, transportation, and building materials    In addition, the promised federal spending will help to fuel demand for labor in the area   and for construction materials as well as other goods and services that are already in short supply   and will be needed for the rebuilding  As someone else has already indicated, this increased   demand will clearly add to short-term price pressures that will extend beyond the South  How   significant and how long-lasting these price effects will be is still very uncertain   For example, we don’t know how long the supply problem, particularly for natural gas,   will last Despite what has been reported elsewhere, our on-the-ground sources state that a large   part of the pipeline system that moves oil and gas from the wells to processing facilities has yet   to be inspected for damage, so we just can’t yet know how long it will be until normal operations   resume  And as Karen noted, this uncertainty may be exacerbated by Hurricane Rita, which is   now on a projected path that would take it through some of the offshore gas and oil fields that   were not severely hit by Katrina Our own sense is that the implications of the natural gas   disruption and its associated price run-up have not been given sufficient attention  While natural   gas reserves are reported to have been in the normal seasonal range prior to Katrina, there is little   or no capacity to make up for the near-term shortfalls, as could be done with oil                September 20, 2005 39 of 117  The chairman of my board of directors, who heads the holding company of the major   electric power company serving the Southeast, told me just yesterday that if natural gas prices   remain as high as futures markets suggest, the consumer is in for a huge hit in coming months    He suggests that not only will homeowners be shocked at their bills for natural gas this winter,   particularly if we have a cold winter, but that electric utility rates are in for a big jump, as state   regulatory agencies eventually approve the pass-through increase in generation costs attributed to   high natural gas prices We know that virtually all of the new electric-generating facilities built   in the last couple of decades were designed with natural gas as the preferred fuel  Just as higher   gasoline prices seem to have finally hit home with consumers, these coming jolts from natural   gas and electric bills could well show through to inflation expectations, in our view    While some of these supply and price shocks will likely be transitory, and energy supply   problems should ease a bit as pumping capacity in refineries comes back on line, they will still   last for several months before reverting to levels that we think are likely to be a bit higher than   pre-Katrina levels These increased energy prices will show through markedly, most markedly   in the broad headline inflation measures  But we also think we will see some significant feed-  through effects to core prices Large industrial users of natural gas, like the building materials   company Georgia-Pacific, whose president is on our Atlanta board, are already feeling the huge   cost pressures from high natural gas prices and have become more determined than ever to pass   on some of those costs    Another of our directors with worldwide responsibility for Dow Chemical indicates that   prices for petrochemical feeder stock from oil and gas are already up 20 to 40 percent and will   soon be felt across a wide array of plastic products and industrial chemicals  Another director                 September 20, 2005 40 of 117  who runs a major trucking firm indicates that her costs are going through the roof, and fuel   surcharges are now the norm  The anecdotal information is that customers are more readily   accepting these increased costs, which are now being passed on more readily rather than being   limited by competitive pressures  For these reasons, we are not nearly as sanguine about either   the short-term or long-term implications for prices as the Greenbook   Putting all of this together, we believe, as the Greenbook clearly lays out, that the   economy went into Katrina with considerable momentum  And looking past the next six months   or so, we think the hit to near-term aggregate growth will be more than offset by the stimulus   associated with deployment of private and public funds to rebuild   The maturity of the expansion pre-Katrina was underscored by a report from one of our   regular temporary employment agency contacts who reported that they are now seeing shortages   in several markets in a number of skilled and unskilled jobs  In fact, they have raised wages by   $250 an hour in several categories While I think one might make the case today for a pause   from our policy path, it is the case that significant monetary accommodation is already in place    And we have more fiscal policy support to come in targeted federal spending for hurricane relief   I am most concerned about the pressure on prices  While some of this will be short-lived,   I don’t think those higher inflation numbers will go unnoticed by either businesses or   individuals And I think this could begin to cause some deterioration in inflation expectations,   which remained reasonably well contained until recently  At the same time, I don’t want us to   appear to be overreacting to the short-term supply shock to prices; that may make it seem that we   think we’ve gotten behind the curve I believe the best way to ensure that expectations don’t   become unraveled is to continue on our present policy path for a bit longer  I think this means—                September 20, 2005 41 of 117  as hard as it is for me, coming from our area, to say—that we should increase our fed funds   target rate by another 25 basis points today and be very careful about the communication that we   craft to go with that announcement  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8208,2005-09-20," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I have the same   uneasiness I had at the last meeting—perhaps elevated this time—about one part of the   statement  I’m not sure that the words about the inflation situation and the risks in the inflation   outlook truly capture the tone of the discussion I heard in the last four hours  I think the   concerns about pressures on both core and headline inflation are greater than this statement   suggests And I don’t think the statement language really captures your notion that the real risk   is on the inflation side I don’t expect to change the language today, but I would hope that by the   next meeting we will think some more about whether we‘re being true to the discussion that we   had in the meeting    And that will help    "
8251,2005-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me first share some thoughts on recent   economic developments in our Southeast region  As you would expect, we’ve continued to assess   the regional and national implications of Hurricane Katrina, and now Hurricanes Rita and Wilma,   which have added to our woes    The recent employment statistics serve as a real-time barometer of the hit our region has   taken  Across the states involved, through September our District has lost approximately 300,000   jobs from the storms  Ironically, businesses in the affected areas trying to restart their operations   are, in many cases, desperate to hire workers  On a trip from the New Orleans Airport into                                 November 1, 2005 46 of 114  downtown New Orleans, one sees help wanted signs on every corner  The inability to get evacuees   from the area back into local housing has clearly slowed the process of business recovery  In fact, if   one thing related to the storms now stands out, it’s the lingering uncertainty on several fronts and   what now looks to us to be a longer rebuilding and recovery period   Indications are that it could well be several more months before oil and gas production and   processing return to near normal  The latest reports from our contacts indicate that almost 7 percent   of US daily oil production and 9½ percent of US natural gas production remain shut in  The   assessment of damage and the repairs to pipeline and production facilities in the Gulf continue to be   hampered by equipment and labor shortages Louisiana refineries are slowly coming back on line,   but by current estimates up to 6 percent of total US refining capacity will remain off line until at   least early next year  And US refineries are reportedly now operating at only about 80 percent of   capacity The situation with respect to natural gas is even less clear than for refined products, and   there remains widespread concern that potential shortages over the winter could keep natural gas   prices elevated for a while   At the time of our last meeting, I expressed concern about the impact of the storms on   shipping and port facilities It now appears that activity is slowly returning to the Port of New   Orleans, constrained by labor availability and access to land transportation  By and large, ships that   were inbound to New Orleans were diverted to other ports, so there wasn’t as much disruption to the   nation’s imports as there was to those exports that depended upon the Mississippi River and   Louisiana ports   At the last meeting I also indicated that while we expected a significant regional hit to output,   that would quickly be replaced by spending on cleanup and rebuilding  This is generally happening,   but the large-scale reconstruction is now not expected to get under way until the first quarter of next                                     November 1, 2005 47 of 114  year when insurance assessments have been completed and comprehensive plans are put in place    Commercial contractors note that there was a strong backlog of work prior to the hurricanes; and   this, coupled with labor shortages, will constrain the pace of rebuilding at least for a while   At the national level, I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that despite our heartaches   along the Gulf Coast, the national economy seems to have remained relatively strong And this was   reinforced by last Friday’s initial reading of third-quarter real GDP   I view the economy as continuing on a path of about trend  However, I continue to wonder   how the consumer will respond to higher energy prices  So far, the impact hasn’t been great, but   there may be some important substitution effects when the consumer is faced with substantially   higher heating costs during the winter on top of still-elevated gasoline prices  Spending may not   decline, but more household funds may be allocated to energy and less to other goods and services,   and this could cause second-round effects in terms of cutbacks in production and investment  In   addition, we do know that auto sales dropped early in the fourth quarter, due in part to energy   concerns but also due to a retreat from employee pricing   I’ve gotten some recent and interesting anecdotal information that is consistent with my   concern about consumption and consumer substitution effects  Last week I chatted with a major   wholesale supplier of groceries who has seen a significant recent pickup in business  He noted that   core wholesale grocery sales are notoriously steady and boring, and he attributed the measurable   pickup in recent weeks to the fact that more people were likely eating in and, hence, were buying   more groceries  Similarly, an Atlanta director who is president of a major building materials and   consumer products firm noted that his away-from-home product sales—staples like paper towels   and toilet tissue sold to restaurants—were slowing and that retail home product sales were up  He   interpreted that as consistent with the stay-at-home sentiment expressed by the grocery wholesaler                                                 November 1, 2005 48 of 114  This same director, however, also commented on how serious the price pressures were due to   energy and freight costs  His company experienced a substantial earnings decline in the third   quarter, as he wasn’t able to pass on all of his cost increases to his customers  Taken together,   recent data and these kinds of anecdotes suggest to me that downside risks to consumer spending   still remain elevated   This brings me to the inflation risk, which is my major concern  As already noted by a   number of people, we experienced a significant increase in both headline CPI and PPI inflation last   month, which was expected  This was largely due to energy and, in my view, is likely to be   temporary  At the same time, the core measures remained relatively stable, but the anecdotes about   growing price pressures and actual or intended price increases seem to be at odds with this   continuing, going forward  I note, too, like others, that the Greenbook has built in more of a pass-  through of energy and other price increases into core inflation next year   There are some possible explanations that we’ve all given at one time or another for this   seeming disconnect, including the fact that the economy is relatively more energy-efficient and that   we are evolving into a more service-oriented economy so that energy is a much less direct   component of consumption  And perhaps most importantly, there’s the fact that intense competition   is limiting the ability to pass input price increases through to customers—for instance, the difficulty   I noted earlier that the consumer products firm was having in passing on energy costs  A large   athletic apparel manufacturer in our District, the Russell Corporation, attributed a large share of   their third-quarter earnings decline to higher costs for poly-cotton blends that could not be passed   on, very specifically because of intense foreign competition   But these questions about pricing power are not, in my view, reasons to be complacent about   the inflation outlook  The real funds rate is still low, there is substantial monetary accommodation                                           November 1, 2005 49 of 114  in the system, and significant fiscal spending associated with hurricane-related rebuilding has yet to   come on stream   My concern is that deviating from our path of gradually removing policy accommodation at   this time could signal that we are less concerned about inflation and, therefore, cause some   deterioration in inflation expectations  It is this threat that I think we need to guard against   I view   the cost of ratcheting down inflation expectations, should they get out of hand, as being great  So   I’d argue that we need to continue on our current path, at least for a while longer, including raising   our fed funds target rate by 25 basis points today   As several of us have said today and in previous recent meetings, deciding what to say   following today’s meeting may be more difficult than deciding what to do  Realizing that our   discussion of the statement often gets truncated, I also want to put down a brief marker  Given my   concern about keeping inflation expectations in check, I would prefer a statement that is somewhere   between Bluebook alternatives B and C  I’m concerned that “C” is too strong, but I am particularly   uncomfortable with the balance of risk characterization in option B  President Yellen has just   offered some attractive statement language for us to consider, and I think it’s terribly important that   we make time at this meeting or at some other meeting in the near future to begin to talk about that   seriously  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8252,2005-11-01," Mr Chairman, since Vincent has raised the question of process, and I get the   sense that we’re probably not prepared today to deal substantively with changing the statement, I’m   wondering out loud if we shouldn’t try to go even further than Vincent has suggested between now   and the next meeting  Perhaps we should try to get ourselves in a position at least a couple of weeks   before the next meeting where we have some viable optional language worked out that we could   make operative at the next meeting if we choose to   It has been pretty clear that we’re not going to have a very productive discussion today on the   statement—or next time either, unless we do some work on it in advance  Given the amount of   thinking that has been done on this and the suggestions Janet has made and Tim has made, I think   we ought to be able in a couple or three weeks to get something on the table that we could all look at   if we truly want to have an option that we could exercise, if we choose, at the December meeting   So I just want to push on the process side a little bit and ask if we could do that    I would push a little bit    But we need to have that more than a couple of days before the meeting if   we’re really going to have something that’s workable  I guess it sounds like what you have in mind   is what I’m hoping we can do  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, there are words and phrases that I’m not as comfortable with   as I’d like to be, particularly the part dealing with inflation risk  The word “potential” has crept into   the sentence in terms of inflation pressures; I see those pressures as clearly there and not just   potential  But I certainly can support your recommendation and I look forward to a discussion   between meetings of how to fundamentally restructure the statement we’re using  Thank you  "
8296,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me share a few thoughts on what we’re   seeing in our Southeast region  Overall, growth in our District continues at an acceptable pace, with   most of the data and most of the anecdotal reports from directors and other contacts being positive   across almost all sectors   Recovery from the hurricanes is proceeding about as we expected, although it’s hard to track   all related economic activity, as many residents are still living in—and many businesses still operating   from—the new cities to which they fled  Businesses in the affected areas that are open are now   reporting brisk sales of autos and clothing, as belongings destroyed by the storm are replaced   Economic activity for major rebuilding and replacement of housing-related durables has not really   started in any significant way  And if there is any new realization about the timing of that, it is that   the rebuilding process—and consequently the economic impact—will be considerably more   protracted than I first thought  It will probably be a process of five years or more  Almost half of   electricity and telephone customers in the area still have not had those services restored   Since we last met, there have also been more and more frequent reports of a definite chill in   the residential construction activity and speculation in the frenzied coastal real estate markets  While   that is yet to show through in any convincing way in regional and national statistics, those reports of a   measurable shift in attitude and activity are coming from lenders, developers, and real estate   salespeople                         December 13, 2005 31 of 100  Perhaps most relevant to the near-term policy considerations, we’re still getting numerous   reports of price pressures and determination to try to relieve those pressures by passing through the   added costs  At our meetings last week, two directors from large national companies described what   they characterized as new windows of opportunity to get price increases—windows they have already   jumped through and gotten significant price increases that are sticking  They reported that even their   tough customers, like the Wal-Marts of the world, had accepted those increases  It was also reported   that while regular gasoline prices have come down, prices of diesel fuel had declined relatively less    And while some rollback of fuel surcharges may be occurring, that is not yet evident   Finally, on a regional level, early holiday sales are reported to be satisfactory  And our   director who is chief financial officer of UPS reported that deliveries are running above plan at this   point Yet there is a realization that tracking total holiday sales may be more difficult than ever, as   consumers shift their buying patterns from traditional, more easily measurable stores to a larger use of   the Internet for purchases   I also find the new information since our last meeting on the national front encouraging  The   latest numbers on third-quarter GDP were a bit better than I expected and describe what I, too, would   characterize as a solid expansion  We seem to have good balance across sectors  While it’s   reasonable to expect some marginal change in the mix of activity as we move into next year, I expect   more of the same in 2006   While the significant fallback in oil prices from their recent highs, the continuing strong   competitive pressures, and the robust productivity gains have all worked to constrain inflationary   pressures, it’s my judgment that we could still see a rise in inflation as businesses continue to try to   recoup their higher input costs  And leaning against those potential pressures should be our priority,   at least for now                                     December 13, 2005 32 of 100  Against that backdrop, I would argue that by some measures our current policy setting, at least   going into this meeting, is still accommodative  And whether we choose to describe it as such in our   statement, I favor staying on our policy path at least a bit longer  I think I look forward to our later   discussion of what the statement should say  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8297,2005-12-13," Mr Chairman, I too support the recommendation for a 25 basis point increase    I’m sure that the process we went through on revising the language in the statement was frustrating to   the staff but I actually found it both interesting and constructive  When we’re making changes as   significant as we are today, I think there should be some way for all of us to contribute to the ideas   and to see each other’s ideas So again, as frustrating as I’m sure it was, I found it constructive   There’s a lot to like about alternative B, and I support it as well  I’ll limit my comments just   to the words in play Actually, my comments on the draft statement language last week indicated a   support for leaving “policy accommodation” in  My thinking was—and I still believe this—that we   really haven’t moved through whatever the neutral point is to pure tightening  I have a little bit of   concern that markets will interpret it that way and assume that we’ve gotten behind and, therefore, are   ratcheting things up  But I like Brian’s comment that there comes a time to honorably discharge                                   December 13, 2005 88 of 100  words and phrases from service  And since it’s so hard to measure, and even more difficult to talk   about, I think it is time to get that out of the statement   I actually think there’s no cost to leaving in “measured” in row 4  Although I think the   probability is very small of its removal being misinterpreted as an opportunity for us to move faster, to   me it’s much better to leave it in  I have a strong preference for leaving the next line as it is, with “is   likely” instead of “may”  I think that’s where we are, and I’d much prefer that the wording stay that   way  I assume we’re going to have other substantial changes to the statement in coming months  I   just hope we can find a way either before the meeting or during the meeting to have a chance to share   our views and see each other’s ideas, as messy as it is  I think we come out in a better place when we   do that  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8343,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also have not had the occasion in the public   farewell ceremonies to say thank you to you  So let me say what an honor it has been to serve under   your leadership and to be associated with the great confidence and respect you’ve given people in   what we do at the Fed  Thank you  Thank you very much   January 31, 2006 45 of 106    Given your request for brevity, let me confine my remarks to a few observations about our   District that may have implications for the national outlook  Generally I would say that the   anecdotal information and the available data suggest that economic growth in our southeast region   continues at a very solid pace  At the past two meetings, I reported evidence of the slowing in the   real estate markets, and those reports continue  It has become especially notable in a few selected   markets, including several that have been hot for some time, like Florida  Banks are now clearly   pulling back on their construction lending  We’re receiving increasing numbers of reports that   planned projects have either been put on hold or are not going to come out of the ground  And   we’re now beginning to see some signs of downward pressure on prices—in some cases in the high   single digits, but in a few markets substantially higher than that  As an example, we heard one   report that in the Panama City area of Florida, condos that had been going for $600 a square foot are   now being priced at $450 a square foot  That’s a 25 percent correction  I think we have to view   these corrections that are taking place as healthy  Worker shortages due to hurricane cleanup work   in Louisiana and coastal Mississippi are also contributing to the slowdown in Florida  I would   emphasize, again, that this evidence is not indicative of a broad trend throughout the District  Our   general real estate situation still feels pretty solid   I’d also like to make a couple of comments on the situation of the hurricane areas, where,   according to the staff , FEMA spending turned out to be less than expected in the fourth quarter  At   the last meeting I noted it had become clear that the stimulus from the flow of government funds   would be slower than expected  Work in both Mississippi and Louisiana is still mostly in the initial   cleanup phase  Despite what we see in public statements, there is no substantial rebuilding under   way yet, except for casino reconstruction in Mississippi  The grace period on mortgage payments   has already or is about to run out, and this could bring additional hardship for the affected property   January 31, 2006 46 of 106    owners, with obvious implications for lenders  Indeed, a handful of small community banks may   actually be at risk     Considerable uncertainty exists concerning federal flood insurance policies going forward,   and in certain areas no rebuilding can take place until flood maps are redrawn, building codes are   reassessed, soil contamination is assessed, and permits are issued—all of which could take many,   many months  Because so few people have been able to move back to their properties, even those   homes that were only modestly damaged by the storm are now beginning to show signs of   deterioration due to mold and a lack of maintenance and repairs  I think the take-away from this   discussion is that the economic kick we’ve been expecting from hurricane rebuilding is probably   going to be spread over 2006, 2007, and perhaps even a bit further     The damage to the energy sector in the Gulf now appears to have been worse than most had   thought  Although national production of crude is reported back at about 92 percent of pre-  hurricane levels and natural gas production is back to 95 percent of pre-hurricane levels, our sources   tell us that 25 percent of the Gulf region capacity for crude and about 16 percent of the Gulf   capacity for natural gas remain shut in  And that shortfall, in my view, remains significant  More   than half the crude oil that is shut in is attributable to the production lost from Shell’s Mars   platform, which isn’t expected to be operational until mid-2006  Our contacts are also now saying   that natural gas production will probably not fully return to pre-hurricane levels because the   production at several sites is already in decline—as much as 8 percent below the peak   Finally, as has been the case for some time, we’ve continued to receive information from   our directors of pricing pressures, of plans to push through price increases, and of a greater   willingness on the part of upstream purchasers to accept those increases  And I think we are likely   seeing some of that in the latest inflation data   January 31, 2006 47 of 106    On the national front, very briefly, like everyone else, I was surprised and somewhat   disappointed by the considerably weaker than expected initial report on fourth-quarter GDP, but like   the Greenbook, I think I’m satisfied that we can explain most of the shortfall  I do not see it as an   erosion of fundamentals, and in fact, I think we may well see some offsetting gains in the current   quarter  I expect a return to solid growth in the current quarter  My own forecast for output,   inflation, and unemployment for 2006 and 2007 remains positive   At the same time, there are some especially interesting unknowns and risks at the moment   that we’ll have to watch being played out  As others have already suggested, energy remains a   major wild card with the very delicate balance between worldwide supply and worldwide demand    With recovery of the energy industry in our Gulf Coast region not yet complete, with the fragile   political situation in many oil-producing regions around the world, and with the ever-present risk of   natural disaster and sabotage, it seems reasonable to expect continued elevated energy prices and   substantial energy-price volatility  It’s not clear to me whether households and businesses have   fully adjusted to these new realities  The residential real estate adjustment, which seems to be   beginning to take place both in the level of activity and in prices, could have important implications,   as Dave Stockton and others have already suggested  Whether consumers will be able and willing   to continue to smooth their expenditures relative to current income seems to be substantially   dependent upon home prices, mortgage interest rates, and the ability to tap home equity  And the   potential inflation pressures we’ve highlighted for some while, and which still do not seem to have   played out fully, should not be too easily and too quickly discounted   All things considered, I think we have to be reasonably comfortable with the outlook and the   policy path we have been on, but I look forward to discussions of policy and the way we   communicate what we see ahead  Thank you, Mr Chairman   January 31, 2006 48 of 106   "
8344,2006-01-31,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I’m comfortable with the   language  Some of the alternative language that has been suggested is attractive  I think we should   make as few changes today as we can, and this recommendation does that  I also support the Vice   January 31, 2006 75 of 106    Chairman’s recommendation to wait until another day to have a full discussion of the vote on the   statement  Thank you  "
