3459,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman It is a real honor for me to be here  representing our Bank and subbing for Al Broaddus You may know that Al's son was married    8/18/98  this weekend He had an extended trip out of town He wanted to be sure the Committee knew  that the economy of western North Carolina was receiving a big boost this past weekend!  The Fifth District economy continues to grow at a moderate rate this summer Overall  manufacturing activity picked up some in July as a result of strong domestic demand, especially in  the building materials and capital goods areas But, with much weaker orders, our textile and  apparel producers continue to have a tough time Growth in retail sales slowed somewhat,  especially in consumer durables, but the nonretail service sectors are experiencing very strong  revenue growth Real estate activity and bank lending remain strong, and there is excess money  chasing too few investment opportunities The Charlotte area continues its very rapid growth, and  we have reports of a record amount of new investment there in the first half of 1998 Finally,  District labor markets remain very tight We continue to hear frequent comments from District  contacts about difficulties in attracting and retaining workers and an increased dependence on the  in-migration of workers, especially in the construction industry  On the national picture, I have a few comments about the Greenbook forecast The  Greenbook sees the slowdown in inventory accumulation and the deterioration in net exports that  occurred in the second quarter as setting the stage for a sharp and lasting slowing in the growth of  domestic final demand As a consequence of that slowdown and a further significant deterioration  in net exports, real GDP is expected to expand at a rate just below its potential, relieving some of  the pressure on labor markets and lowering core inflation a bit in coming quarters It would be  very nice if this chain of events were actually realized and I hope it will be, but I have some  doubts  First, domestic demand is expected to slow promptly to about half its average pace in  the first part of 1998 Given that labor markets adjusted for the GM strike apparently tightened    8/18/98  further in July, pointing to further real wage growth, I am not convinced that domestic spending  will slow as much and as promptly as in the Greenbook forecast  Secondly, as Mike Prell noted earlier, the Greenbook is forecasting a much greater  deterioration in net exports than the Blue Chip forecasters In fact, I noticed that the Greenbook is  about as pessimistic as the average of the ten most pessimistic Blue Chip forecasters The  Greenbook's forecast of net exports represents a drag on real GDP growth of about 1 percent in  the second half of 1998 By contrast, the Blue Chip consensus looks for a much smaller drop in  net exports, with much less drag on GDP I know that foreign trade developments are very  difficult to forecast and I certainly am not a forecaster, but on the face of it, the Greenbook seems  to be at the low end on this point  I see considerable upside risk in the Greenbook forecast of the economic outlook  Inflation itself, continued strong domestic demand, and the second-quarter jump in the ECI are  particularly worrisome The latter may indicate some ebbing in the productivity growth that has  been holding down unit labor costs I also worry that we are at risk of a jump in health care costs  that would raise the benefit-cost component of the ECI And, as Mike Prell pointed out, the  special survey data on variable pay suggests that the ECI may understate compensation costs "
3460,1998-08-18," We would agree that the downside risks have increased, but we still  believe that the upside risks are greater, given the strength in domestic demand So, we would  continue to favor a smaller increase in the fed funds rate sooner rather than a larger increase that  could well be needed later There obviously is a lot of sentiment for alternative B around the  table Given Committee adoption of that alternative, we would favor a continuation of the  asymmetric tilt "
