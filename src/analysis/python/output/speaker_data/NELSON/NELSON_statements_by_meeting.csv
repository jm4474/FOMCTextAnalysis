8682,2009-02-07," And they’re triple-A ABS   It could be that they were looking at haircuts for the asset type that was   backing them   Just to say definitively, if I could, the haircuts on triple-A ABS charged   at the discount window are all smaller than the ones charged by the TALF   There is no distinction among the discount window haircuts  So you   might be thinking of auto loans as opposed to triple-A ABS that are backed by auto loans    The haircuts are set at 3 percentage points plus four times the estimated   losses in a one-out-of-100-years scenario  But those are credit losses, not market losses   To provide some numbers—and I think these numbers are included in   the memo that was circulated to the FOMC—our expected losses are $500 million   That’s the expected losses for the whole program   The stress losses in a one-in-100-years scenario are $24 billion  So   that’s to be compared with $6 billion from the interest spread—that’s just the spread over   LIBOR or over the swap rate So, even under the stress scenario, we anticipate that no one   would lose money Treasury would make money  And then, even if those were to be exceeded,   we’d still have the $20 billion Treasury cushion   It is probably important to add that it is very difficult to know what   losses will be under these circumstances  We have very little to go by to judge what the future is   going to be like The future is pretty uncertain territory right now, but those are our best   judgments  "
8706,2009-03-17," As Trish noted, the subscription for the first TALF operation  begins today  The loans requested between now and Thursday will settle on March  25, exactly four months after we first announced the program  Those months were  spent canvassing potential ABS issuers and investors to determine the program design  characteristics that would be most successful, evaluating the risks of the program and  developing the associated controls, and working out the back-office arrangements   Nevertheless, the size of the initial TALF subscription is going to be modest, in  part because potential borrowers are uneasy using the TALF to finance ABS  purchases Potential borrowers and primary dealers have largely been unable to work  out mutually acceptable customer arrangements  A particular sticking point seems to  be assigning responsibility for the risk that a potential borrower is determined to be  ineligible for the program at the eleventh hour, leaving the primary dealer, who is  typically the underwriter, responsible for funding the issue  Investors are also  reportedly concerned that participation in the program will expose them to  government interference in their business, a fear apparently confirmed on Friday  when it became more widely understood that recipients of 13(3) loans will be subject  to tighter restrictions when hiring noncitizens  We are trying to facilitate agreements  between potential borrowers and primary dealers, we are seeking to provide as much  clarity as possible on the issue of hiring noncitizens, and we are addressing other  issues as they arise We continue to hope that participants will grow more  comfortable with the program over time  I note that revisions to the FAQs to help  clarify some issues are going on right now     The subscription that starts today is for the TALF program as initially announced   The New York Fed will be extending three-year nonrecourse loans against newly                             March 17–18, 2009 9 of 266  issued triple-A-rated auto, credit card, and student loan ABS and ABS guaranteed by  the Small Business Administration  The monthly operations will continue through  this December unless extended by the Board  The program has a $200 billion ceiling  and is supported by $20 billion in credit protection from the Treasury   As you all know, the Board is prepared to consider increasing the size of the  program up to $1 trillion, supported by up to $100 billion in credit protection from the  Treasury The expansion would entail widening the list of eligible collateral to  encompass much of the universe of newly issued triple-A-rated collateralized  obligations, for the most part backed by newly and recently issued loans  Staff at the  Board, New York Fed, Chicago Fed, Atlanta Fed, and the Treasury have been  evaluating specific asset classes for possible inclusion in the program and have been  developing prospective terms and conditions  We are concentrating first on the  largest asset classes and will recommend specific categories of securities for inclusion  on a flow basis as we complete our reviews   As a first step in that expansion, we recommend that the Board approve adding  four categories of ABS to the list of eligible collateral, starting with the April  operation The four categories are the first to be recommended because they have  relatively straightforward structures similar to those already taken, allowing us to  evaluate them quickly Although they are smaller asset classes than the consumer  ABS already accepted, they are the largest among the securities that can be evaluated  quickly   The first three are the principal types of ABS that were excluded from the initial  program because they are not backed by consumer loans  ABS backed by loans or  leases relating to business equipment, ABS backed by leases of vehicle fleets, and  ABS backed by revolving lines of credit used to finance showroom inventories  The  fourth is ABS backed by the credit provided by residential mortgage servicers when  homeowners miss payments  Mortgage servicers have found credit increasingly  difficult and expensive to obtain  Accepting the ABS at the TALF should improve  the servicers’ ability to work with homeowners to prevent avoidable foreclosures   All the assets proposed to be accepted will have maturities of three years or less,  resulting in a good fit for the three-year term of the TALF loans  The proposed new  collateral classes are of roughly equivalent risk to the types already accepted  After  applying the recommended haircuts, which range from 8 to 13 percent, the risk to the  Federal Reserve should be similar to the de minimis risk associated with the types of  ABS already accepted as TALF collateral We estimate that accepting the new  categories of ABS would increase demand for TALF loans through December by  $30 billion to $130 billion  If the Board approves the additions, we would release  revised terms and conditions and FAQs for the program on Thursday   We are also evaluating the other remaining major collateralized asset classes for  inclusion under the TALF, for example, CMBS and non-agency RMBS  Subject to  Board approval, terms and conditions for these asset classes could be announced as                                                            2 Materials used by Messrs Gagnon and Reifschneider are appended to this document (appendix 2)                          March 17–18, 2009 10 of 266  early as mid-April  Staff members have held extensive discussions with issuers,  investors, and rating agencies about several asset categories and have narrowed down  the scope of securities that we might recommend accepting  For instance, CMBS  would likely include those backed by solidly underwritten existing mortgages and by  mortgages that are being refinanced, and RMBS would likely include those backed by  mortgages exceeding the conforming loan limit and possibly mortgages to near-prime  borrowers Because a number of the assets envisioned for the expansion are more  complicated than those currently taken or thus far proposed to be taken at the TALF,  staff members are planning to recommend that a collateral agent be hired to assist  with underwriting and that a portfolio manager be hired to monitor the assets  accepted   Staff members are also evaluating the use of the TALF to address the legacy asset  problem  The Treasury has proposed that the Federal Reserve accept at the TALF  older securities that were rated triple-A when issued but that may or may not still be  rated triple-A One reason to expand the TALF to legacy assets would be to increase  demand for, and hence the prices of, the eligible assets, thereby bolstering the balance  sheets of financial institutions Another reason would be to remove the eligible assets  from the balance sheets of their current holders, leaving those firms with cleaner,  more transparent balance sheets and an improved capacity to attract new equity from  private sources In the Treasury’s proposed structure, the legacy TALF loans have  five-year terms, but in other ways the facility resembles the existing TALF   Staff members have analyzed the feasibility of the legacy TALF proposal for a  few asset classes, specifically 2005- to 2008-vintage CMBS still rated triple-A and  subprime and Alt-A RMBS rated triple-A at origination  Our preliminary assessment  is that, for many of these securities, haircuts and other terms could be set that would  adequately protect the Federal Reserve and the Treasury but would nevertheless elicit  sufficient investor demand to be helpful  We have concluded, though, that it would  be necessary in some cases to set haircuts on a security-by-security basis   Nevertheless, we believe that we could operate the program at sufficient scale and  with sufficient speed by hiring an outside contractor     Joe Gagnon and Dave Reifschneider will now discuss large-scale asset purchases   I’ll do the best I can First of all, this is something that we’ve been   allowing the private sector to develop It’s not like some of these other instances where we’ve   worked with the private sector to develop special purpose vehicles like the MMIFF  These are   private sector efforts  These things first came up in discussions when we were trying to think of   ways to make the program useful for real money investors  Part of the challenge in the TALF is   that the objective is to encourage an investor class that normally hasn’t invested in asset-backed   securities to move into that space, namely, leveraged investors  Traditionally, asset-backed   securities have been held by real money investors, like pension funds and insurance companies    So we were trying to think of ways that the program could be made more attractive for those   investors One way to do that would be to have a special purpose vehicle purchase the asset-  backed securities and take the loan and raise the haircut part of that transaction by issuing equity    That equity could conceivably be a tradable security which could be invested in by real money   investors   When we looked at that a month or so ago, it didn’t necessarily seem as if it was going to   be successful, though my understanding is that it has gotten more momentum in recent weeks  In   particular, the one thing that I think would really make it take off would be if those equity   tranches could be rated by the credit rating agencies, and I am not sure where that effort stands   Another reason these special purpose vehicles came up was our requirement that we only   lend to US entities Many hedge funds are actually foreign entities, but we viewed it as   acceptable (and I may not get this exactly right) if there was a US arm of that entity with a US   operation—an actual person, a manager there—that would be a US entity that we could lend to    So to some extent there was an effort to set up vehicles along those lines Then, lastly, there has   been interest in potentially insulating the financial institution from some things like the H-1B           March 17–18, 2009 23 of 266  visa issue that I just mentioned or some other consequences of the program itself  I don’t think   any of these things are likely to be moving forward for this subscription, but rather they are   continuing to be reviewed by the private sector and being developed   Well, it’s not clear, and I think that’s the rub right now  The folks that   are concerned about compliance, I think, have written our regulations to say we will look   through such structures to the ownership entity to make sure that the compliance protocols have   been followed On the other hand, when we say whom we’re actually lending to, I think that   language has been more along the lines of—in particular, say, for whether or not it’s a US   entity—“it’s okay to set up one of these entities”  And because those two efforts are not yet   completely lined up, that’s why I believe these things are still under development and there are   still open questions that need to be answered before it’s clear that they will be able to go forward   I think it came up for several of these reasons  That’s certainly one of   them              March 17–18, 2009 24 of 266  Yes, and we have remained very focused on that   At this time, our estimate is that, over the life of the program, the   collateral that was approved initially—that’s beginning today, and that’s consumer ABS and                 March 17–18, 2009 25 of 266  Small Business Administration ABS—that should amount, we think, to $100 billion  So we   won’t make it to $200 billion unless the program is expanded  The additional asset classes that   we’ve proposed to the Board for inclusion, which would largely complete the asset-backed   securities space, as well as mortgage servicer advances, would add another $30 billion  So those   combined would still not bring us to $200 billion  The rest of the analysis is really very   tentative So our effort is to be as inclusive as possible, and we’re looking at the major   collateralized high-quality asset classes   No At this point I was thinking in terms of newly issued securities   The range that the teams have provided goes from $50 to $500 billion   depending on a number of issues, including whether or not warehouse financing is available,   whether or not investors can grow comfortable with the rather extreme mismatch between the   maturity of the TALF loans and the maturity of the underlying securities So that last step   conceivably would still not take us to the $1 trillion  But it is, I must say, very uncertain because   they’re still just scoping out those securities  Now, legacy assets would then add on to that   Our objective is to take as broad a set of assets as possible, consistent   with choosing ones that can be taken efficiently, that we can figure out ways to take with   acceptable risk to the Federal Reserve System and to the government   Well, all collateralized assets   But of relatively simple, straightforward structures, so that we can   manage and understand the risk—but, nevertheless, as wide a group as possible  We’re just on   the way to that at this stage   Let me distinguish in my answer between those assets which we   requested the Board to add this week and the completion of TALF 20  For the assets that are   being added this week, the objective is to fill out the ABS space, largely  That’s the market that,   in fact, shut down in the fourth quarter   These asset classes themselves are smaller than the ones that have   already been approved, but they are, nevertheless, relatively large in size  But it won’t get us               March 17–18, 2009 47 of 266  meaningfully closer to the ceiling  It’s addressing a market  We’re addressing it at this point   because the assets are quite similar to the ones that we’ve already added, so that we were able to   review their risks and bring them on board quickly   Yes, that’s right And, in fact, some of the sectors that we’re proposing   for inclusion were harmed by the initial announcement because they are near substitutes to those   things that we announced we were including So it was very desirable to finish that phase  I   think that the answer is relatively similar in the next stage—it’s just that there’s much more   review that needs to be done Perhaps it will be done within a month, but it then moves to the   larger space of markets that are also impaired but are similar in that they are the securitized,   high-quality space of newly originated securities  I’m sorry—your other question?   I don’t exactly know  In many cases, the lower-rated tranches are   retained by the issuers, so that they’re able to issue the triple-A securities by retaining the lower   rated I don’t have any specific information about other lower-rated tranches that have been   issued in conjunction with, admittedly, just a handful of ABS that are being issued at this   subscription, and who is purchasing those               March 17–18, 2009 48 of 266  In the risk analysis for TALF 21, we looked at a scenario which we   considered to have a 1 percent probability And even in those scenarios, all of the credit costs   were covered by the risk spread itself, so not only the Fed but also the Treasury did not take any   losses Our objective is basically to follow that principle with the legacy TALF, I think the   principle would be that under our stress scenario neither the Treasury nor the Fed would be   expected to take losses So losses, in order to come to the Fed, would first have to eat through   the Treasury protection, which we don’t expect to happen at all in the stress scenario   Is the legacy TALF a means to try to take the bad assets off bank   balance sheets?  Yes, that’s one of the objectives  "
8732,2009-04-28," Thank you, Chris Mr Chairman  As indicated in the memo  circulated to the FOMC on Friday, we are recommending that the Board expand the  list of TALF-eligible collateral to include commercial-mortgage-backed securities  and insurance premium finance ABS  We are also recommending that the New York  Fed offer five-year maturities on loans collateralized by CMBS and certain other  long-lived assets The TALF documentation has from the outset signaled a likely  expansion to CMBS  We are currently proposing that the TALF accept newly issued  CMBS We expect to have a proposal for legacy CMBS in a week or two  Today,  we propose accepting newly issued, fixed-rate, triple-A-rated CMBS that are not  subordinated to any other bonds in a given CMBS pool  The loans in the pool must  all be on income-generating properties   We anticipate that the TALF-eligible CMBS will be used to refinance maturing  loans that had been conservatively underwritten (and therefore retain significant                         April 28–29, 2009 12 of 201  positive equity) and to purchase distressed properties—those in or at risk of default   Providing liquidity for refinancing would help prevent an increase in defaults on  economically viable commercial properties, prevent further stress on current holders  of the maturing mortgages, and free up their balance sheets for additional lending   Providing liquidity to finance the purchase of distressed properties will help facilitate  the price discovery process and reduce the high levels of uncertainty about property  values   When evaluating the appropriate haircuts, we tried to take account of credit  losses, the likelihood that the TALF loans would not be repaid, and mark-to-market  losses We propose haircuts of 15 percent for CMBS with an expected life of 5 years  or less, rising to 20 percent for CMBS with an expected life of 10 years  The haircuts  would then be boosted by a projected 6 to 8 percentage points on average by the  diversion of interest carry to repay the loan, which I will discuss in a minute  In  addition, in contrast to our procedure for TALF 10 assets, we will have a collateral  gatekeeper that will review the deals and exclude those that appear unacceptable   In the current economic environment, loss predictions are especially uncertain,  but we did our best Using these haircuts, we anticipate that in a stress scenario,  defined as a 1-in-10 event, about 10 percent of the loans would default and that the  collateral at the time of default would be about 20 percent below the loan values   Thus, for the entire portfolio of CMBS loans, we project losses in a stress scenario of  2 percent At the same time, we would be charging the five-year swap rate plus  100 basis points on the loans  The excess spread on the loans accumulates as a first  loss position  Over the life of the five-year loans, that buffer will amount to about  5 percent of the loan portfolio  Because the accumulated excess spread is more than  double the expected losses, we expect that, even in a stress scenario, neither the  Treasury, which is in the second loss position, nor the Federal Reserve, which is in  the third loss position, would experience losses on the TALF loans backed by new- issue CMBS   We anticipate that the New York Fed will accept a different set of NRSROs for  CMBS Currently, we take Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch ratings on the collateral  accepted for all Federal Reserve lending  A Systemwide project is under way to  develop procedures for evaluating rating agencies for each collateral type, but the full  project will take many months to conduct  We accelerated the review of NRSROs for  CMBS The results are not quite complete, but we anticipate that the list of  recommended NRSROs for CMBS will differ from the list we have used in other  lending programs   The other asset class we propose adding to the program is insurance premium  finance ABS Insurance premium finance ABS are backed by loans to small  businesses to pay for property and casualty insurance  Unlike households, businesses  pay for such insurance upfront More than 1½ million of these loans are extended to  small businesses each year  When we asked market participants what remaining ABS  categories we should have accepted under TALF 10, we were unanimously told                              April 28–29, 2009 13 of 201  “insurance premium finance ABS”  The ABS bear very little credit risk because the   underlying loans are collateralized by the residual unused insurance premium    Nonetheless, spreads on these ABS have ballooned along with other ABS spreads    We spoke to the four largest premium finance companies  Three of them are   enthusiastic about the possibility that these ABS might be TALF-eligible  One of   those three is AIG Credit, a subsidiary of AIG  The unenthusiastic company is   BB&T, which is benefiting from its funding advantage as a bank    We are also proposing that the TALF begin to offer 5-year loans  All TALF loans  currently have 3-year maturities CMBS generally have 10-year terms  Market  participants were uniformly of the view that the TALF would not be very helpful for  CMBS unless the loan maturity is lengthened  The maturity mismatch is also a  significant negative for student loan ABS and SBA ABS, which have even longer  maturities than CMBS  We propose offering TALF loans with 5-year maturities for  CMBS, student loan ABS, and SBA ABS  We would also propose that 5-year loans  be offered for newly issued RMBS and legacy CMBS and RMBS if these assets are  eventually added as eligible collateral A 5-year loan term reduces the maturity  mismatch and extends the refinancing problem well beyond the expected end of the  recession   In order to reduce the risk that this program might impede your ability to raise the  funds rate above zero when the time comes, we would limit the total amount of TALF  loans with 5-year maturities to $100 billion  For now, we propose extending 5-year  loans to all who request them and otherwise qualify, but we would develop and put in  place an auction mechanism in the future if it appears to be necessary  As an  incentive to encourage investors to choose a 3-year loan or to repay a 5-year loan  early, we propose diverting some of the interest payments on the collateral backing   5-year loans toward accelerated repayment of the TALF loan, with a significantly  greater amount diverted in the fourth and fifth year  We expect that this early  repayment will equal about 8 percent of outstanding CMBS loans, resulting in the  extra haircut I mentioned earlier   If the proposed changes to the program are adopted, we anticipate that about   $30 billion in TALF loans collateralized by newly issued CMBS and about $2 billion   in loans backed by insurance premium finance ABS will be extended by   December 31 of this year, when the program is scheduled to end  If the changes are   adopted, we anticipate making a public announcement this Friday    We’re in the process of hiring at this time  We don’t have someone   now, but we are hiring two sorts of vendors right now  The process is under way, and we   anticipate hiring someone next week, I think  We’re looking at what’s called a “collateral   monitor,” which will be a number of firms that will help us value collateral that is pledged to us    We need those professionals in particular for valuing legacy RMBS pledges of collateral, but   they will also be able to help us evaluate other collateral, including CMBS, that’s brought to us    Then another function that we’re hiring for is an expanded collateral custodian   No, it is not   I would just highlight that this really illustrates the incredible uncertainty   about forecasting things like this  Several months ago we thought that this program would ramp   up relatively quickly We are now observing that it is not doing so, in large part because of   things that are themselves hard to predict  the ability of the primary dealers and the customers to   work out their legal disagreements and the political concerns of the investors  If those things   were to clear up, this program could move up really quickly, but they may not     April 28–29, 2009 19 of 201  I guess it’s a compromise between what we’ve heard from market   participants about the effectiveness of the program and the feedback from you and others and   from the Board on their preferences that the maturity of the loans be kept as short as possible  So   we have discussed in particular whether or not a five-year loan would be more effective than a   three-year loan, and we have heard back that it would be appreciably more effective   They would like for the maturity to be as long as possible   That’s right  "
8772,2009-06-23," I think partly it’s experience as we work with the program  It’s an   awareness that as ABS markets improve, we’re not going to need as much TALF activity to   support them It’s becoming consistent with what we’re seeing in CMBS markets  Right now   the numbers we’re putting down for TALF 20 peak at $50 billion, which is about what we think   is going to be needed for CMBS, and with TALF 10 it’s—I forget the numbers that we actually   put down—but it’s a more modest $125 billion, which is where we see activity at its current pace   ending in the first quarter  So it’s consistent with the policy objectives  It’s just accumulated   experience  "
8799,2009-08-11," Thank you, Jamie  I will briefly review the staff’s evaluation of  legacy RMBS as potential TALF collateral and then discuss a proposed extension of  the facility’s end date Staff members from the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks  of Atlanta and New York have worked to understand the potential economic and  financial benefits and costs of accepting legacy RMBS as collateral for TALF loans   The staff limited their investigation to about 16,000 bonds, with a face value of  $12 trillion, that are still performing, have relatively straightforward structures, and  were originally rated triple-A   RMBS are a complex and heterogeneous group of assets  As a result, it’s  impossible to identify a set of bonds with the lowest credit risk from the larger  universe without conducting a bond-level analysis  In short, there is no equivalent of  the legacy super-senior CMBS bonds that are currently TALF eligible  The prices of  the pool of bonds under review have risen from their mid-March nadir, with gains  accelerating in recent weeks The expected return to an investor buying a bond at  today’s prices is now typically half the return available a few months ago  Given the  recent increase in prices, adding legacy RMBS to the TALF, especially if confined to  the safest bonds and paired with large haircuts, might not increase bond prices  appreciably Instead, the facility would act more as a backstop financing vehicle  should risk premiums widen dramatically in coming months  Moreover, because  most bonds are expected to take at least some write-downs in coming years, to  implement even a limited facility we would have to hire multiple vendors to carefully  analyze candidate bonds, determine conservative haircuts, and effectively  communicate loan terms to potential investors     Turning to the TALF end date, currently the facility is scheduled to close on  December 31, 2009  The staff is proposing that the Board authorize TALF loans to  finance new-issue CMBS through June 30, 2010, and authorize all other TALF loans  through March 31 We are proposing an extension because at this point ABS and  CMBS markets appear to require the TALF to function and because issuers and  investors need assurance that the TALF will be available for several months into the  future The ABS and CMBS markets remain impaired and appear likely to remain  impaired through the proposed new deadlines  There is little near-term prospect for a  significant revival of non-TALF investor interest in ABS in volume, and the  economic recovery remains tentative and potentially contingent on the continued  availability of credit for consumers and businesses  The new-issue CMBS market has  been shuttered for over a year, and the only deals on the horizon are relatively small  TALF-financed deals Despite the impairment, the TALF is encouraging the flow of  credit to businesses and households  Staff analysis and a recent survey of issuers  indicate that the TALF has contributed to narrower spreads and has played a critical  role in facilitating new securitizations     There are benefits to announcing an extension sooner rather than waiting till the  end date is closer Potential issuers of new CMBS report needing six months, on  average, to arrange relatively large deals involving multiple borrowers                  August 11–12, 2009 36 of 165  Consequently, an issuer that begins the process of putting together a new-issue   CMBS deal today risks not completing the deal by the end of 2009, after the current   TALF deadline Similarly, potential investors in the TALF indicate that it takes time   to organize investment pools, and the looming deadline is damping interest    While extending the TALF may yield benefits, it may also have costs  In   particular, allowing the program to close might speed the development of alternative   methods for financing loans to businesses and households, albeit at the expense of   near-term disruptions in securitization markets  A potential cost of extending the   deadline for legacy CMBS is that it might reduce the urgency among investors to   arrange TALF-financed deals     If the Board decides to extend the facility in the manner proposed, it could   evaluate the need for a further extension later this year or early next year  At that   time, the staff can propose potential adjustments to the program to make TALF   financing less attractive, if appropriate  Conversely, if market conditions improve   more quickly and significantly than expected and conditions are no longer unusual   and exigent, the facility would be required to be closed at an earlier time    These issues were discussed by the Board at a meeting yesterday  No decisions   were made, but Board members generally expressed support for suspending staff   work on legacy RMBS and extending the TALF deadline to the proposed dates  If   these are the Board’s conclusions after the discussion today, a press release reporting   the new end dates and indicating that further expansion of the TALF appears unlikely   at this time could be released later this week  That concludes our prepared remarks    CLOs, new issue RMBS, and now legacy RMBS     August 11–12, 2009 37 of 165  With respect to the TALF, the criterion that we applied in thinking about   the problem was that it should be appropriate for emergency lending to take place throughout the   future period that the staff recommends that the facility stay open  So in particular for CMBS,   we thought that there was a reasonably high likelihood that the situation would remain unusual   and exigent through June 30, 2010 In addition, we required that it would be helpful to be open    Also, even if these criteria were met, if you could wait to announce, then it would be desirable to   delay because your perspective on whether it is going to be unusual and exigent in the future will   become more accurate as time passes  But as I explained, there is a benefit to announcing now   so that people can begin at this time to arrange these deals  That said, as I noted, if the situation   is not unusual and exigent at any point between now and then, it would still be necessary to close   the facility down at that time regardless of the deadline   That is right There is no expectation that there will be a change in the   types of CMBS that we would lend against  "
8854,2009-11-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will briefly update the Committee   on the TAF, primary credit, and the TALF  The staff is not seeking views at this   time, but we would be happy to answer the Committee’s questions    Credit extended under the term auction facility peaked near $500 billion in March   and has declined steadily since Over the intermeeting period, TAF credit declined   further to just under $140 billion  Of that amount, about three-quarters is extended to   branches and agencies of foreign banks  On September 24, the Board announced a                         November 3–4, 2009 13 of 201  phase-down schedule for TAF amounts through January, and it also indicated that  auctions of credit with maturities longer than 28 days would be phased out  In  yesterday’s auction of 70-day TAF funds, the amount auctioned was cut to  $25 billion, half the October amount  Only $132 billion was requested even though  $43 billion is maturing  By January 11, 2010, only $75 billion of 28-day credit will  be offered   We do not expect to ask the Board to make any decision about the TAF in the  near term  Later this year or perhaps early next year, the Board will be asked to  consider whether to further reduce the amount provided in TAF auctions, perhaps to  zero Reducing TAF auction amounts to zero in the intermediate term would be  consistent with the ongoing gradual normalization of Federal Reserve liquidity  operations, would ensure that no bank currently using the facility remained reliant on  TAF funding, and would help reduce reserve balances during a period in which the  FOMC might be tightening policy  If auction amounts were reduced to zero, the staff  would work to preserve operational readiness by periodically conducting simulated  auctions I’d emphasize that reducing TAF credit to zero for a period would not  imply that TAF credit would necessarily be zero in the future steady state  The  options that policymakers might consider for a permanent TAF currently seem likely  to include using TAF only as a tool for contingencies with no credit outstanding in  normal times or conducting monthly auctions of relatively small amounts of credit to  preserve readiness Whether to have a permanent TAF and, if so, in what form is an  issue we expect to raise once the financial crisis has fully subsided   Turning to primary credit, prior to the financial crisis, the primary credit rate had  been consistently set at a level 100 basis points over the target federal funds rate, and  the maximum available term of primary credit was overnight except for the smallest  institutions, which could borrow for up to one month  Over the past two years, the  Federal Reserve narrowed the primary credit rate spread to 25 basis points and  lengthened the maximum maturity to 90 days  The total amount of primary credit  outstanding peaked near $115 billion in October 2008  It has since fallen to  $23 billion, of which more than 90 percent is to branches and agencies of foreign  banks and two-thirds is extended to a single foreign bank that is prohibited from term  borrowing and is rolling overnight credit About $45 billion in primary credit had an  initial maturity greater than 28 days, and nearly all of that is to another foreign bank   Later this week, the Board will be asked to consider whether the maximum  maturity on primary credit loans should be reduced to 28 days in January 2010  In  this way, the terms on primary credit would not be tightened until after year-end, but  then the maximum maturity of primary credit would be aligned with the maturity of  TAF loans The Board and Reserve Banks could evaluate early next year the  appropriate time to adjust the spread of the primary credit rate over the target rate and  possibly to reduce further the maximum maturity on primary credit loans  If Reserve  Bank Presidents have comments on the proposal to reduce the maximum maturity of  primary credit loans to 28 days, please convey them directly to the Board staff or to a  member of the Board in the next few days                    November 3–4, 2009 14 of 201  Lastly, I will provide a brief update on the TALF  On October 5, the Board  announced two changes to the procedures for evaluating asset-backed securities  pledged to the TALF First, the Board requested public comment on a rule that would  establish criteria for determining the credit rating agencies whose ratings on ABS  would be accepted at the facility The proposed criteria will most likely result in  ratings from one additional agency being accepted starting with the January  subscription Second, starting with the November subscription, which takes place  today, the New York Fed is conducting a formal risk assessment of all ABS pledged  to the facility The new risk-assessment process has gone smoothly, and eight ABS  with a total value of about $6 billion will be issued in conjunction with the November  subscription   In recent months, spreads on most triple-A auto and credit card ABS have fallen  well below the 100 basis point TALF spread, and ABS are increasingly being funded  by non-TALF sources Whereas in May through August, TALF lending equaled  about two-thirds of ABS issuance, in September it fell to one-third and in October to  one-quarter The proportion appears likely to fall further in November, with less than  $1 billion in TALF loans for ABS expected today  Investors have now repaid over  20 percent of TALF loans backed by ABS, contributing to a 10 percent decline in  outstanding TALF credit over the intermeeting period   Conditions in the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities are more  mixed  Spreads on CMBS in secondary markets have narrowed significantly but are  still somewhat elevated, and TALF lending to finance purchases of legacy CMBS  continues each month at fairly low levels  The new-issue CMBS market remains  closed, but it now appears likely that a security, which will be eligible for TALF  financing, will be brought to market later this month  Nathan will now continue the  staff presentation   We do extend some TALF loans for seasoned ABS  I guess it’s   conceivable that those ABS had previously been borrowed against and then resold into the market   or they were issued as TALF-eligible and not taken up in the first round  However, off the top of   my head, I do not know the amount that is being extended against seasoned ABS    Certainly Yes, I’ll get that to you    They’re not refinancing their loans, but they’re paying them back  That   collateral is freeing up and conceivably could come back into the facility, which is what I thought   you were asking   But the overall amount of lending is just dropping very rapidly  This   month it’s going to be between $600 million and $1 billion, I think  So there just is not a lot of   scope for very much activity along those lines, given how quickly activity under the facility has   quieted down                                                November 3–4, 2009 30 of 201  Could I add another piece of information for President Fisher?  The   repayment of TALF loans has been concentrated in the plain-vanilla, short-maturity ABS where   secondary market spreads have come down the most  autos; credit cards; equipment ABS to a   lesser extent Because those spreads are now well below the TALF loan rate—and for example, in   the current subscription that is going on today, there was no request at all for TALF loans against   the auto ABS that were issued—it strikes me as pretty unlikely that a very large part of the TALF   lending that’s going on now is going to finance ABS that have already been paid back  Those   would have appreciated in price, and their spreads would now be too narrow to be attractive to   finance under the TALF   The only near-term decision that we’re asking of the Board in the next few   days is on the maximum maturity of the primary credit rate  But if the Presidents have views on   that issue, if they could convey that directly to a staff member or to a Governor over the coming   days outside this meeting, that would be best  The other issues are ones for coming months or early   next year, and I suppose that views expressed on those as well would be valuable now  Those have   to do with, in the intermediate term, the scaling-back of the TAF to possibly zero in the first half of   next year and also the eventual adjustment to the return to normalization of the terms of primary   credit  Again, both of those things are decisions that would be made next year  "
8881,2009-12-15," I’d add just a few things The two deals that were priced had been in the   TALF pipeline, so they were thinking of making them TALF-eligible, and they decided, having   observed the reaction to the first deal, it was possible to go ahead without that  The other thing is        December 15–16, 2009 16 of 247  that half of the loans that were taken out for DDR have actually been repaid already, that is, half   of the $72 million Finally, yesterday was the December CMBS subscription, and there were no   new-issue CMBS brought to that subscription   Thank you, Jim  I will briefly update the Committee on the  modifications to the terms on the Term Auction Facility and primary credit programs  that the staff anticipates it will propose over the next several months   The TAF auction that was conducted yesterday was again substantially  undersubscribed When it settles on Thursday, TAF credit will equal $76 billion,  45 percent lower than at the time of the November FOMC meeting  All currently  outstanding TAF loans will come due coincident with the January TAF auction  At  that point, only 28-day TAF credit will be provided  Although only $75 billion will  be auctioned in January, it seems likely that it will again be undersubscribed because  of the steep downward trend in TAF credit and because the year-end will have  passed   In light of the continued improvement in interbank funding markets, as discussed  at the November FOMC meeting, the staff expects that it will soon recommend the  Board announce a schedule of TAF auction amounts that decline to zero  The staff  will propose a specific schedule after observing the results of the January 11 auction   If the auction is again substantially undersubscribed, the staff could propose amounts  that decline to zero in just a few months, but evidence of stronger demand could lead  us to recommend an auction schedule that declines a bit more slowly, say, to zero by  midyear   Turning to primary credit, primary credit declined 14 percent over the  intermeeting period to $19 billion  Of that amount, $14 billion is outstanding to  Depfa, and $4 billion to Dexia, which are both branches of European banks   On November 17, the Board announced that the maximum maturity on primary  credit loans would be reduced to 28 days on January 14, a first step in normalizing the  terms on primary credit  That change will align the maximum term on primary credit  loans with the terms of TAF loans  A next step in normalization could be a 25 basis  point increase in the primary credit rate  The discount rate adjustment could be  discussed by Board members and Reserve Bank Presidents at the January FOMC  meeting, with any increase announced a few days later, presumably accompanied by  language that made it clear that the move was not a signal about the outlook for the  stance of monetary policy  The staff envisions that Presidents might initiate  discussions with their boards of directors about a potential increase a week or so  before the January FOMC meeting   A further step in normalization of primary credit terms could be a reduction in the  maximum maturity to overnight, except for the smallest institutions  The Board and  Reserve Banks could evaluate early next year the advisability and potential timing of  such a move          December 15–16, 2009 33 of 247  Consideration about further increases in the primary credit–federal funds rate   spread could be deferred until perhaps midyear to evaluate such further adjustments   in light of accumulated experience with a 50 basis point spread and shorter terms    That concludes our prepared remarks  We would be happy to answer your questions    Discussions about the increase in the discount rate   "
8909,2010-01-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will discuss the staff’s   recommendations for normalizing the terms on the primary credit facility and   reducing TAF auction amounts to zero  We are not requesting any decisions from the   Board at this time   January 26–27, 2010 22 of 260                Turning first to primary credit—primary credit was established in 2003 as a no-  questions-asked lending facility available only to sound financial institutions as a   backup source of funds  In order to encourage institutions to use the facility as a   backup funding source without a need for the Federal Reserve to administer credit   requests, the funds were provided at an above-market rate and generally on an   overnight basis  When the facility was established and during the years prior to the   financial crisis, the primary credit rate was set at 100 basis points over the target   federal funds rate  Analysis of the available information had suggested that a   100 basis point spread would make primary credit at least a bit more expensive than   similar funds for almost all depository institutions These terms on primary credit   appeared to have been largely successful in accomplishing the Federal Reserve’s   objectives for the program  Except in rare instances, depository institutions used the   facility as a backup source of funds and appeared to be willing to use primary credit   when the federal funds rate rose above the primary credit rate   Easing the terms of primary credit was one of the Federal Reserve’s first   responses to the financial crisis  On August 17, 2007, the Federal Reserve narrowed   the spread of the primary credit rate over the FOMC’s target rate to 50 basis points   and lengthened the maximum maturity to 30 days  On March 16, 2008, the Federal   Reserve lowered the spread to 25 basis points and extended the maximum maturity to   90 days   The substantial easing in the terms of primary credit was a necessary step to   provide liquidity to banks during the financial crisis  However, there is now a   significant misalignment between the terms of primary credit and the intended use of   the facility in routine circumstances  In particular, primary credit is too inexpensive   for the interest rate alone to motivate depository institutions to use the facility as a   backup funding source, and loan maturities longer than overnight encourage   depository institutions to use primary credit as an ongoing funding source  Currently,   about 20 depository institutions have been borrowing primary credit continuously for   over three months, and five have been borrowing for more than a year  A branch of   Depfa, a German bank, which alone accounts for more than 90 percent of primary   credit, has been borrowing continuously for 15 months  Several Reserve Bank   discount officers have expressed concerns that some depository institutions have   become overly reliant on discount window funding   With conditions in bank funding markets approaching pre-crisis levels, the staff   recommends that the terms on primary credit be adjusted back toward their pre-crisis   configuration  The Federal Reserve took a first step in that direction on January 14,   when the maximum maturity on primary credit loans was reduced to 28 days  A   second step in normalizing the terms on primary credit could be an increase in the   spread between the primary credit rate and the top of the fed funds target range to   50 basis points, which would set the primary credit rate at 75 basis points if the target   funds rate is unchanged  In one scenario for such a move, the Chairman could   foreshadow an increase in his monetary policy testimony in late February; if they so   January 26–27, 2010 23 of 260    desired, Reserve Bank boards of directors could then recommend an increase; and the   Board could approve the recommendations shortly thereafter  Any increase could be   announced using language that made it clear that the move was not a signal about the   outlook for the stance of monetary policy  A third step in normalizing the terms on   primary credit could then be to shorten the maximum maturity on primary credit   loans to pre-crisis levels—overnight for all but the smallest institutions—perhaps in   early spring  The announcement of such a change could indicate that the Board   expects depository institutions to use primary credit as a backup source of funds               The Board and Reserve Banks might elect to defer any further tightening of the   primary credit rate spread for several months in order to assess the experience with a   50 basis point spread  If a spread of 50 basis points is sufficient to limit use, it may   be preferable to a wider spread, in part because it might help reduce stigma  A   narrower spread would likely result in somewhat more frequent use of the window,   which, by making borrowing less unusual, might help overcome the negative views   about borrowing on the part of bank management, supervisors, and market   participants   Turning now to the term auction facility (TAF)—on January 11, the Federal   Reserve auctioned $75 billion in 28-day TAF credit  The auction was again   substantially undersubscribed, with depository institutions requesting only   $39 billion  As a result, the funds were provided at the minimum bid rate of 25 basis   points, the rate paid on excess reserves  The Board has indicated on its website that   there will be an auction on February 8, but no amount has been specified   In light of the continued improvement in bank funding markets and the resulting   diminished demand for TAF funds, the staff recommends that TAF auction amounts   be reduced to zero relatively quickly  In particular, the staff recommends that   $50 billion be offered in February and $25 billion in March and that the auctions be   discontinued subsequently  Reducing TAF auction amounts to zero would be   consistent with the ongoing normalization of Federal Reserve liquidity operations,   would ensure that no bank currently using the facility remained reliant on TAF   funding, and would help to reduce reserve balances modestly in advance of a period   in which the FOMC might be tightening policy  The staff also recommends that the   minimum bid rate on the TAF be increased to 50 basis points if the primary credit rate   were increased to 75 basis points so as to preserve the spread between the primary   credit rate and the TAF minimum bid rate     An alternative approach would be to auction small amounts of TAF credit on an   ongoing basis so that the TAF could be ramped up immediately in a contingency    However, responses to a survey of the Subcommittee on Credit Risk Management   and feedback from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff members who   conduct the auctions suggest that the TAF could be ramped up from zero with a delay   of at most a couple of weeks  Because regular discount window credit, potentially at   a reduced rate, would remain available as a first line of defense against heightened   credit strains in the early days of a severe crisis, the added benefit of auctioning a   January 26–27, 2010 24 of 260    small amount of TAF credit on an ongoing basis might be less than the benefits of   reducing TAF auction amounts to zero for the intermediate term         Even if the auction amounts are reduced to zero, the TAF would remain   authorized in Regulation A  Whether to have a permanent TAF and, if so, in what   form is an issue that could be addressed further in the future, when the Federal   Reserve’s post-financial-crisis monetary policy framework becomes clearer  That   concludes my prepared remarks    I think it was just to continue our process of gradually removing our   liquidity accommodations  It seemed more pressing to raise the discount rate spread a bit to get   some daylight between the market rates and the rate that we are charging and encourage   institutions to depart  That moving first just meant making the second adjustment later    That’s right  That would, in some sense, send the message that we are   looking for primary credit now to be used again as a backup source of funds    Yes, and primary credit was already renewable upon request  It was a   no-questions-asked facility  Our internal administrative guidelines, which we put together before   January 26–27, 2010 25 of 260    the financial crisis, recognized, however, that for a large institution that had a variety of sources   of funds with a primary credit rate of 100 basis points over the target, borrowing several times in   a row for a long period suggested that perhaps they didn’t, in fact, have access to alternative   funding sources  So there is just inherently some tension between operating it as a no-questions-  asked facility and the requirement that it be used as a backup funding source if we see repeated   uses of credit  That situation was somewhat ambiguous and would remain somewhat ambiguous   in the future    The reason we recommended observing the 50 basis point spread is that   there are costs to having too high a spread as well as costs to having too low a spread  If the   spread is too high, the primary credit is a less effective facility for limiting spikes in the federal   funds rate  It is also a less helpful facility for institutions to use as a backup liquidity source    When we chose a spread of 100 basis points at the outset and used that, it worked fairly well    Nevertheless there was a fair amount of uncertainty, and there remains uncertainty, as to what   the minimum spread is that could enable the spread alone to encourage institutions to use it as a   backup funding source  So it might be a good idea, as we move back up, to observe what   happens at 50 basis points to see if that spread alone is sufficient to encourage institutions to use   it as a backup funding source    At this point there is probably little cost one way or the other  But   because the staff is recommending that the TAF amounts be reduced to zero quickly so that they   would be at zero in two months, there did not seem to be a lot of benefit to making that change at   this time    That’s right    I think that is probably a question more of where to set the IOER rate   than the primary credit rate, if I understand your question correctly    As we move back to a more normal configuration, it will be important   that the primary credit rate be up and above market sources of funds if our objective is to have   institutions lending to one another and have the market operate initially rather than their coming   to us and borrowing  "
9203,2011-04-26,"2  Thank you Mr Chairman  At its meeting a year ago, the  Committee discussed strategies for removing policy accommodation and normalizing  the balance sheet over time  Shortly thereafter, in response to a weakening in the  economic outlook and the threat of deflation, you instead provided additional policy  accommodation by expanding the balance sheet further  At the risk of tempting fate  [laughter], last week the staff again sent you a memo on strategies for removing  accommodation and normalizing the balance sheet   In your previous discussion, you appeared to agree on two broad principles for  your exit strategy  First, the SOMA portfolio should be returned to a normal size and  an all-Treasuries composition over the intermediate term, which will require sales of  agency securities at some point  And second, sales of SOMA securities should be  implemented using a framework that would be communicated in advance and at a  pace that potentially could be adjusted in response to changes in economic and  financial conditions  Issues that remained open included the appropriate sensitivity of  sales to changes in the economic outlook, how quickly sales should proceed, whether  to redeem Treasury securities in order to shrink the balance sheet more rapidly, and  whether to use reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits to drain reserves  before raising your target for the federal funds rate  In addition, you will now also  need to decide when to stop the reinvestment of principal payments on agency  securities into longer-term Treasury securities  And, of course, you will also have to  decide on the appropriate sequence for these policy actions   To some extent, these decisions can be reduced to choices about a few key policy  issues  The first issue is the timing and pace of balance sheet reduction  Both raising  short-term interest rates and reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term  securities would restrain economic activity by tightening financial conditions, so  there is a degree of substitutability between these two policy levers  To accomplish  essentially the same outcome, the Committee could sell assets sooner and faster but  raise the target for the federal funds rate later and more slowly, or you could sell  assets later and more slowly but increase the federal funds rate target sooner and  faster  You likely see the key advantages to selling assets sooner and faster to be the  more rapid return to a normal policy environment, the reduction in any upside risks to                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Nelson are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   April 26–27, 2011 20 of 244              inflation stemming from outsized asset holdings and reserve balances, and the more  limited scope for your holdings of agency securities to unduly allocate credit to a  particular sector of the economy  You may see the principal advantages of selling  assets later and more slowly to be a reduced risk that the market could react sharply,  boosting longer-term rates significantly and weakening or even derailing the recovery  at a time when the federal funds rate was still constrained by the lower bound, and  possibly that the associated earlier liftoff of the funds rate and flatter yield curve  would be less likely to lead to financial imbalances   The second key policy issue is the responsiveness of the balance sheet to  economic conditions  The pace of sales could be quite responsive to economic  conditions, or sales could instead occur in a nearly deterministic manner  Under a  state-contingent approach for adjusting the balance sheet, the FOMC would be  actively employing two policy instruments to achieve its economic objectives   State-contingent sales could increase the scope and flexibility for adjusting financial  conditions; for example, more-rapid sales could withdraw accommodation quickly  even if the Committee were reluctant to raise the federal funds rate aggressively,  while ceasing or even reversing sales could ease policy even if the funds rate was still  constrained by the zero bound  On the other hand, you may see advantages to using  the funds rate target as your active policy instrument while setting asset sales on a  largely deterministic path  Because the effects of the federal funds rate on financial  markets and the economy are better understood than the effects of changes in the  balance sheet, such an approach may result in policy that is easier for you to calibrate  and easier for market participants to understand  Indeed, you only turned to the  balance sheet as a tool for easing policy once the funds rate was constrained by the  zero bound, and there is no corresponding constraint that prevents you from using the  funds rate as a means for tightening policy  Of course, there are policy options that  fall in between  For example, an approach that increases the pace of assets sales to a  limited degree as the economy strengthens and as you determine the pace of sales that  markets can bear could permit a more rapid normalization of the balance sheet than  sticking with the pace of sales that was appropriate earlier on   In the staff memo, we also indicated a couple of areas where we thought you  would find a particular approach to be preferable  First we see several advantages to  redeeming your holdings of Treasury and agency securities once you decide the time  has arrived to reduce the size of the balance sheet  Redemptions are operationally  simple, transparent, easily communicated, and potentially less disruptive to markets  than asset sales  Although redeeming Treasury securities would not result in a  speedier normalization of the composition of the SOMA, it would hasten the  normalization of its size  Second, in the event that the balance sheet is elevated when  you expect to soon begin raising your target for the federal funds rate, we see a strong  case for first using reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits to drain some  portion of reserves in advance of liftoff  Such an approach will put the Federal  Reserve in a better position to assess the effectiveness of the draining tools and judge  the size of draining operations that might be required to support changes in the IOER  rate in implementing a desired increase in short-term rates  Moreover, it will better   April 26–27, 2011 21 of 244              prepare both the Federal Reserve and market participants if it turns out that those  tools have to be used in significant size   In order to cast these strategic issues in more concrete terms, the memo also  discusses in some detail two possible exit scenarios  The timing for the two options  was chosen so that they yield very similar macroeconomic outcomes in simulations  with the FRB/US model, but the advantages of one option or the other do not depend  intrinsically on the specific timing assumed in the memo  Of course, in practice the  Committee might move more rapidly or more slowly, depending on your assessment  of appropriate policy and on economic developments   Option 1 is intended to maintain the federal funds rate as the primary policy  instrument while putting the balance sheet on a path to normalization that takes place  at a gradual and predictable pace  Under this option, if the economy were to follow  the baseline Tealbook outlook, the staff assumes that the Committee would begin  redeeming securities in December of this year, drop the “extended period” language  and commence reserve draining operations in March of next year, raise its target for  the federal funds rate in September of next year, and begin sales of agency securities  in March 2013  Sales of agency securities under this option would be calibrated to  return the portfolio to an all-Treasuries composition over five years, and the pace of  sales would be adjusted only if economic conditions deviated substantially from what  was expected when sales were initiated  The portfolio reaches its steady-state growth  path by late 2015, and sales of agency securities offset by purchases of Treasuries  continue through early 2018   Option 2 is constructed to normalize the balance sheet sooner and to use asset  sales as an active policy instrument  Under the baseline economic assumptions,  redemptions begin in December of this year and sales begin in June of next year   With sales happening sooner and proceeding more briskly, the federal funds rate  would not be increased until December of next year, three months later than in  option 1  With that timing, the “extended period” language would be modified or  dropped soon after the June 2012 decision to begin selling assets, for example, in  September 2012, at which point the Committee would also commence reserve  draining using term deposits and reverse repurchase agreements  Sales of agency  securities under this option would be calibrated to return the portfolio to an  all-Treasuries composition over three years given the projected economic outlook   Under the baseline economic assumptions, the balance sheet would return to its  steady-state growth path in early 2015, about one year earlier than in option 1, and the  last agency security would be sold by August 2015, nearly two and a half years  sooner than under option 1   Of course, a number of variants on these two approaches are also possible  For  one, President Plosser has proposed an approach similar to option 2, only in which  redemptions, sales, and the tightening of the federal funds rate target begin at the  same time  Under his proposed approach, a portion of sales would be deterministic,  but sales would also step up during intermeeting periods following an increase in the  federal funds rate target  For another, President Kocherlakota has proposed an   April 26–27, 2011 22 of 244              approach similar to option 1, except redemptions would begin later, at the same time  sales commenced, and principal payments on agency MBS would continue to be  reinvested in Treasury securities   The two options produce different paths for Federal Reserve income, remittances  to the Treasury, and realized and unrealized capital losses—that is, the options  discussed in the memo, not the options that the presidents introduced  The  cumulative amounts of remittances to Treasury under the two approaches are similar,  in part because the projected paths for longer-term interest rates in the two options are  little different  However, remittances are somewhat lower in the middle of the decade  under option 2 because the relatively rapid pace of securities sales at that time boosts  realized capital losses  Remittances under option 2 subsequently move above those in  option 1 because the earlier completion of sales means that realized losses end sooner   The Federal Reserve would report larger and more long-lived unrealized capital  losses under option 1 because of the later start and slower pace of asset sales  The  risks to Federal Reserve income and remittances to the Treasury would also differ  across the options, as discussed in the memo   Last week the staff also provided you with an additional background memo on  longer-run policy implementation frameworks  In the staff’s view, the Committee  can choose an exit strategy independently of its choice of a longer-run policy  framework  Any exit strategy will likely involve an elevated balance sheet with the  federal funds rate target near the IOER rate—as in floor-type systems—for some  time  If the FOMC desired to eventually move to a corridor-type system for the  federal funds rate, it could do so by continuing to drain reserves until they reached a  level that would be associated with the federal funds rate trading above the IOER  rate  Alternatively, the FOMC could maintain a floor-type system for the federal  funds rate by halting the decline of the balance sheet at a higher level of reserves   We’ve distributed a handout titled “Strategies for Removing Accommodation”  that reproduces the list of questions for your discussion that was circulated late last  week  That concludes my prepared remarks  We would be happy to answer your  questions    I don’t think so  Just because we calibrated the two options so that they   delivered the same amount of monetary tightening, they remove accommodation to the same   degree and deliver the same macroeconomic outcome    I suppose one advantage of option 2, of sales earlier, is that if the   Committee felt that it needed to tighten quickly, it would drain reserves more rapidly and thus set   up the commencement of tightening of the federal funds rate sooner  On the other hand, if the   Committee felt that it needed to tighten more gradually, it might be reluctant to engage in asset   sales earlier because there is a lot of uncertainty about their effect on the economy  It would   seem that at a point when the economy might be on less firm footing, the asset sales might pose   greater risk    I can’t think of any way to
