6420,2001-10-02," The other issue we were facing early in the week after the 17th   was that, as a symptom that the financing markets were operating much more efficiently,   the liquidity we had provided previously was beginning to have a very telling effect on   financing rates and the funds rate So when we were coming into the market in the   morning, on some of those operations we were receiving propositions of below 1 percent    We continued to accept them for a while, but there was no sense of balance in the   financing markets by the 18th or 19th--no sense that there was any upside risk to rates   And given the liquidity we had put in previously, market participants were really testing   how low rates could go There is no natural floor above zero  We did consciously reduce   the amount we were supplying at the margin so that at least at the end of the day market   participants would see that there was some risk of rates going up  We saw a little     10/2/01 12   evidence of that risk later in the week when in late trading rates reached as high as 6 or 7   percent Since we restored that balance to market expectations, though, we have been   supplying somewhat higher levels of central bank balances  "
