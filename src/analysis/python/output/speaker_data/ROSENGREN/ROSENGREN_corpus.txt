  Thank you    Thank you    The credit derivative swaps for Countrywide and some of the other   mortgage providers spiked up very appreciably at the end of last week, and they were accompanied   by announcements that the companies were having no trouble rolling over their financing  Some of   the Boston hedge fund managers have observed that one dependable correlation has been that the   announcement of no problem seems to be highly correlated with the actual problem’s occurring   with a lag of one to two weeks  [Laughter]  I am curious whether you are worried about the   possibility that Countrywide and some of the largest mortgage lenders might have difficulty in the   next two weeks rolling over financing, which would obviously have a broader impact    The Boston staff forecast is broadly consistent with the Greenbook   forecast, with export-led growth being significantly offset by weakness in residential investment,   resulting in a gradual increase in the unemployment rate and core PCE inflation settling around 2   percent  The Boston staff forecast is somewhat more optimistic on residential investment but also   has somewhat higher potential than the Greenbook forecast  My own view is that residential   investment is likely to be as weak as in the Greenbook forecast but that potential may be closer to   Boston’s estimate  Taken together, weak residential investment and somewhat stronger   productivity, along with the possibility that construction employment will be more depressed going   forward, may result in more of an upward drift in unemployment, helping to reduce some of the   concerns with labor market pressures on inflation  However, given the similarities in the forecasts,   well within standard errors, at this time it is probably more important to highlight the risks to the   August 7, 2007 52 of 136    forecast  It is notable that the rather benign outlook of the forecasters is in marked contrast to the   angst I hear when talking to asset and hedge fund managers in Boston  The angst is new and   reflects heightened concerns with the financial ramifications stemming from subprime mortgages   Recent developments in residential markets are of potential concern  They have been raised   by many around the table  Over the past several years, large homebuilders have been able to   increase their market share  Given the use of subcontractors and with little obvious economies of   scale, the primary advantage of large homebuilders would seem to be access to external finance,   which allows them to purchase large tracts of land  When housing and land prices were rising,   particularly in fast growing areas of the country, this access provided a significant advantage over   the small builders that could not tie up significant resources in land  However, what provided a   competitive advantage in the first half of this decade now places a significant strain on large   homebuilders  A large investment in land whose price is falling is aggravating the problem these   builders have with unsold inventory and depressed prices for new homes  Not surprisingly, the   largest homebuilders, which account for nearly a quarter of homes sold, have equity prices trading   lower than at any time in the past year, and recent earnings announcements have highlighted   significant write-downs in land values  The low equity prices of homebuilders seem broadly   consistent with residential investment remaining quite weak well into 2008   Financial market disruptions are likely to be a further impediment to the housing market and   potentially provide a channel for problems to extend beyond residential investment  A number of   financial instruments, such as the 2/28 and 3/27 mortgages that were widely used last year, are no   longer readily available  Furthermore, the originate-to-distribute model has been disrupted by the   heightened uncertainty surrounding CDOs and CLOs that we heard about earlier this morning    There seem to be two significant developments  First, the liquidity of these instruments has   August 7, 2007 53 of 136    declined, making valuation assessment difficult  As lenders have made margin calls, forced   liquidation of collateral in illiquid markets has further depressed the market  While of concern, I   would hope that this is only a short-run effect  The second development of concern is that many   investors have been relying on rating agencies to evaluate credit risk but the underlying credit risk is   relatively opaque and the correlations between tranches may not have been fully appreciated  If   investors have lost confidence in the rating agencies to accurately assess credit risk for structured   products, the market could be impeded until confidence is restored  Since similar structures are   used for financial instruments besides mortgages, getting secondary market financing for a broader   range of financing needs could be difficult, and external financing for some borrowers could be   affected  This has been reflected in the widening spreads for riskier corporate bonds, where the   spreads have widened from unusually low levels and are still relatively narrow compared with   earlier periods of significant financial disruption   While recent problems are not compelling enough for me to have a significant disagreement   with the forecast presented in the Greenbook, the risks surrounding that forecast on the downside   have increased  I remain concerned that higher oil prices, a falling dollar, and tight labor markets   pose upward risks to the forecast of inflation, but recent events have significantly raised my estimate   of the risk of a slower economy than I would have predicted a few weeks ago    I support leaving the target for the fed funds rate at 5¼ percent    However, the news since the last meeting would seem to be more elevated downside risk to   economic growth  This elevated risk reflects the baseline growth for real GDP as 2 percent (a   considerable reduction from the previous Greenbook), greater uncertainty about the evolution of   the housing market, and concern about the fallout from financial market disruptions  Given the   greater downside risk, I would prefer language in the assessment of risk paragraph from   alternative A, though I do like the modification to alternative B that was made, and I am worried   about an interpretation of a Fed put for financial markets  So although I’d prefer the risk   assessment in alternative A, which more accurately reflects my assessment of risks, I could   August 7, 2007 98 of 136    certainly accept removing the word “predominant”  That would be my second choice  My third   choice would be to bow to those who have a better understanding of nuanced language, since   that is certainly not my expertise, though I hope I will develop it over the years, and I could live   with the alternative B language as my third choice     I have a question for Bill Dudley  It’s my understanding that many of   the foreign names are now trading in the fed funds market at anywhere between 25 and 50 basis   points above some of the domestic names  So one rationale for having a reduction of only 50 points   rather than 75 points might be that it would be the only way that it would remain a penalty rate, at   least for some of those foreign names  Is that consistent with your information in terms of the   premiums in the fed funds market that some of the foreign banks are paying?  I know that the   collateral that has been posted at some of the Reserve Banks has come from foreign banks operating   in the United States  Is one of the goals to try to provide, in effect, liquidity to some of those that   are having difficulty getting dollar commitments?    This is a liquidity problem for mortgage-backed securities  Some   banks do have counterparty limits in the fed funds market  I think a 50 basis point move is   appropriate and necessary  My only concern is with the stigma issue surrounding the discount   window  This will have an effect only if it’s actually used  So my question is for Don Kohn    Should the discount officers be encouraged to encourage banks to use the discount window in   conjunction with this statement?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most of the economic data we have for   this meeting reflect the economy before the liquidity issues in August  The employment report,   September 18, 2007 54 of 188    while probably not wholly reflective of the problems and affected by some anomalous seasonals,   nonetheless provides evidence that labor markets were slowing at the outset of the financial   problems  Given the layoffs that are being announced by financial services firms and the   potential for continued difficulties in construction, some further easing of labor markets seems   quite likely  Although we do not have housing starts and permits for August, the outlook for the   second half of 2007 is likely to deteriorate further than forecasters had predicted before the   liquidity issues  There is good reason to believe the staff forecast that residential investment will   remain weak well into 2008  Stock prices of all the major homebuilders have continued to   decline since our last meeting, and the credit derivative swaps for several of the largest   homebuilders are at levels that reflect a very high probability of default   The news from the financial markets has improved marginally from the last meeting, but   I still have some significant concerns  Certainly, some of the financial anomalies have abated,   such as the extremely low rates for short-term Treasury securities, and there are some tentative   signs of improving liquidity  However, these improvements are tenuous, and the ability to raise   funds in a number of short-term financial markets remains quite difficult  I would just highlight   a few of the financial anomalies that are reflective of the situation  Usually, the overnight   Eurodollar trades very close to the overnight fed funds rate  Both are overnight dollar loans   between financial institutions on an unsecured basis  Over the past month, the funds for   overnight Eurodollars have frequently been trading much higher than overnight fed funds  This   highlights the difficulty that some European financial institutions are having borrowing in dollars   and the unwillingness of many financial institutions to arbitrage these spreads if they involve   credit exposures to European financial institutions, even for overnight  These difficulties worsen   when the maturities extend out to one to three months  Both the one-month and three-month   September 18, 2007 55 of 188    LIBOR rates have remained very elevated, particularly given that the fed funds futures during   this period have indicated a market expectation of falling federal funds rates over the next three   months  The elevated LIBOR rate tightens credit for a variety of domestic borrowers and could   affect areas that are already troubled  For example, many subprime mortgages are tied to the   LIBOR rate as are many loans that have been used to finance leveraged buyouts     A second example is the significant swelling of bank assets in August  The monthly   growth rate for bank C&I loans was 26 percent and for other loans and leases was 63 percent    These are among the largest monthly increases in thirty years  As in other periods of liquidity   strain, bank balance sheets become particularly important  As banks honor loan commitments   and agreements to provide liquidity support, their balance sheets grow  My concern is that bank   obligations will continue to expand bank balance sheets in September and crowd out other   investment opportunities     Many financial market participants are very concerned about the next two weeks, despite   some recent easing of conditions  Some investors are not willing to lend except overnight  The   asset-backed commercial paper market has remained under stress, and the rollovers have been   for shorter maturities  There is significant concern that holders of commercial paper may be   reluctant to hold asset-backed commercial paper on their balance sheets at the end of this month,   and rumors abound about whether money market funds and other short-term investors will   continue to hold commercial paper for structured products, particularly of the SIVs   So we have a situation of a very weak housing sector, some evidence of slowing   employment growth, and a period of extended illiquidity that may get worse before it gets better    The tail risk of liquidity problems and economic problems has grown, and we clearly want to   avoid outcomes by which declines in prices for houses and for financial assets tied to the housing   September 18, 2007 56 of 188    sector could create more-severe economic outcomes  The fact is that we do not have much   experience with periods of extended illiquidity, especially when the housing sector is so weak    So taking out insurance against these risks seems entirely appropriate  The decision is made   easier, in my view, because I see the risk of unacceptably high inflation resulting from such an   action as being quite low  My hope is that with appropriate easing of policy the liquidity issues   will abate as we start the fourth quarter    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think there’s a general consensus that we   should ease  To me the question is not whether to ease but how much is appropriate  To ease by   25 basis points, I think, could be justified by slow housing and weakening labor markets in the   absence of any financial turmoil  However, I’m concerned that a 25 basis point ease today might   very well need to be followed by another ease, quite possibly before the next meeting  Given the   economic slowing we have seen and the additional slowing that is already likely as a result of the   increase in many short-term interest rates, I prefer a more aggressive approach  A 50 basis point   reduction will offset some of the tightening that has already occurred in short-term interest rates and   will reduce the likelihood that the most pessimistic outcomes for housing prices and residential   investment will occur  Furthermore, it seems appropriate insurance against tail events given that   inflation pressures are unlikely to be a problem given the current economic outlook  Alternative B   in conjunction with other actions designed to improve liquidity seems the most appropriate given   the current economic outlook    A lot of us this morning discussed tail risk, and it does seem that   the tables we have right now might not capture the nature of tail risk that actually was critical to   a lot of that discussion  Some things that are related to your ability to forecast variables are tied   to uncertainty  But looking forward, there are also the kinds of risks, which I don’t think we’re   capturing, that were central to some of our discussion  Is there a way to capture tail risk or the   distribution—kind of like the scenarios that are done in the Greenbook, but, in effect, what   people were talking about with tail risk?  I don’t think we’re quite there yet, and I don’t know   September 18, 2007 126 of 188    that we need to do it for the first round  But we need to give some more thought to what tail risk   means and what we actually mean when we talk about insurance    Yes, it gets to the texture that Tim was getting at  I was thinking   about maybe having a question that tries to capture it so that we could at least respond to it if it’s   an important point for us to cover    I think that this is a very creative solution to thinking about the   stigma issue and providing liquidity to the market, so I applaud the effort to try to broaden the   tools that we have to think about these kinds of issues  When I was thinking about how this   might actually work, I did come up with a couple of operational questions  My thought was that   if we had this auction, who would be the most likely to want to take the money out?  I could   imagine a situation in which you would have five borrowers taking out the full $20 billion  If   September 18, 2007 135 of 188    those five were Countrywide, Washington Mutual, and three European banks, it would certainly   give the perception that we were focused on financial institutions that had significant risks  In   terms of worrying about markets as opposed to institutions, I think there is a potential perception   issue  So my first question related to that is the following  You picked 20 percent of the auction;   but if you picked a smaller percentage of the auction that any one institution could take, by   broadening out the number of institutions, I think there would be more of a perception that it was   designed for markets rather than for institutions  Now, I am aware that the offset to that is that   you might not take down the whole auction  So the less that any one institution can take, the   greater is the risk that you’re not fully subscribed, or you presumably could change the amount    But I’d like to hear at least some thought as to how you came up with 20 percent   The second issue is that when we think about the discount window, which is primarily for   overnight loans, there seems to be a bit of ambiguity in terms of whether you are primary or   secondary credit, and in this situation I think it starts becoming important  When I think of an   institution like Countrywide having a $4 billion loan, the OTS views them as a 2-rated   institution, and I don’t know how we would view them if we were regulating them  I do know   that the markets seem to be assessing them as being a good bit different from a 2-rated   institution  So when we’re thinking about an institution that we might have concerns about   giving 23A exemptions and an institution that might have difficulty raising funds because the   market perception is that they are very, very risky, how comfortable are we with the way the   discount window thinks about primary and secondary credit for institutions that the financial   markets at least think have a high probability of a fall?   My third question ties to the European banks  It seems for the European banks that the   ECB is better positioned to make the credit evaluation of whether they are risky or not risky and   September 18, 2007 136 of 188    the equivalent of our primary-secondary distinctions  Given that the European banks have the   option to borrow, assuming that the swap did go through, it would seem preferable that they   borrow in Europe rather than borrow here because I think about the incentives going forward  If   a European bank that has financial problems that, say, the German authorities and the German   Bank are aware of but we may not be fully aware of borrowed $4 billion from our liquidity   window, I wonder what the incentives are for either the institution or the regulator to fully   disclose the nature of the problems  I’d like to get your sense of why you think it necessary for   US banks to have access in both locations and for European banks to have access in both   locations  Those were the three questions that I had    But we would know whether they have access to an ACF facility in   Europe or an ACF facility here, and it would seem as though saying that you have access to an   ACF facility somewhere would not exclude, say, the Canadians or the Japanese but would   exclude the Europeans if they were participating in the same program    We make that distinction already in the discount window with   primary and secondary  So if you are at a CAMEL rating of 4 or 5, we normally would not allow   you to borrow as a primary credit  If we are taking the discount window as an analogy, yes, we   want to give it to the people who need it, but we don’t want to give it to the people who need it   so much that they are about to fail     I like the idea  I think it does reduce stigma, and it would likely   reduce the spread during a time of crisis  I would want it spread out among a larger number of   institutions than just five because I do worry about that potential  While I know that in your   documentation you highlighted that there wouldn’t be a way to identify the institution, my guess is   that, given that this is a new facility, there may be congressional hearings, and I wouldn’t be   surprised, particularly if only five institutions borrowed from it, if we’d have to at least be prepared   for the possibility that it would become more public than under normal circumstances   So in these terms, I think the haircuts that we think about for a twenty-eight-day period are a   little different from the haircuts you might take overnight, in which case we’re going to have to   make sure that we really are collateralized sufficiently so that we’re not taking risks, since that is a   principle of the discount window  I worry a bit about whether our primary-secondary distinction   was designed for this, and we might want to at least rethink exactly how we classify primary versus   secondary credits  During times of distress, this would be a way to try to provide liquidity, but it   might also be worth at least thinking about some of the potential issues during those times of stress   September 18, 2007 148 of 188      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Boston forecast is very close to   that of the Greenbook  With the constant federal funds rate assumption, the economy is very   close to full employment, and core inflation is close to 2 percent at the end of 2008  Such an   outcome is consistent with what I would hope to achieve with appropriate monetary policy    However, while this is an expected path that seems quite reasonable, the distribution of risks   around that outcome for growth remains skewed to the downside  Our forecast, like that of the   October 30-31, 2007 28 of 162    Greenbook, expects particularly weak residential investment  Problems in financing mortgages,   expectations of falling housing prices, and more-severe financial stress for homebuilders are   likely to weigh heavily over the next two quarters  In fact, our forecast for residential investment   has become sufficiently bleak that there may actually be some upside risk to it  [Laughter]   Somewhat surprising to me has been the lack of spillover to the rest of the economy from   the problems in residential investment  I remain concerned that falling housing prices will   further sap consumer confidence and cause a pullback in consumption, though to date there is   little evidence of a significant effect of the housing problems on consumer spending  Similarly, I   would have expected the financing problems that have aggravated the housing situation to have   caused a sharper reduction in investment in general and in nonresidential structures in particular    However, so far these remain risks rather than outcomes  Thus, while I am worried about the   downside risks, I am reminded that forecasters have frequently overestimated the consequences   of liquidity problems in the past   On the financial side, there have definitely been improvements in market conditions,   though markets remain fragile  Particularly worrisome has been the announcement of significant   downgrades of tranches of CDOs and mortgage-backed securities with large exposure to the   subprime mortgage market  Not only have the lower tranches experienced significant   downgrades, but a number of the AAA and AA tranches have been downgraded to below   investment grade  Some investors cannot retain below-investment-grade securities and are   forced to sell these securities in an already depressed market  The number of the downgrades,   the magnitude of the downgrades, and the piecemeal ratings announcements all are likely to call   into further question the reliability of the ratings process  If many high-grade securities tied to   mortgages are downgraded to below investment grade, some investors may conclude that   October 30-31, 2007 29 of 162    repricing of even high-graded tranches does not reflect a liquidity problem but rather a   substantial reevaluation of credit risk  Thus, I am concerned that continued widespread   downgrades may make recovery in the securitization market more difficult, particularly for   nonconforming mortgages, with a consequent increase in the financing cost of these assets  I   also remain concerned that the asset-backed commercial paper market remains fragile  While   investors seem to be distinguishing between conduits whose structure or underlying assets are   quite risky, my sense is that money managers are watching the market quite closely  I continue   to hear concerns over the possibility that some money market funds will experience losses that   will not be supported by their parents, resulting in increased investor concern with the safety of   money market funds more generally     On balance, the data both on the real economy and on financial markets have improved   since our September meeting  That improvement makes it more likely that the economy will   continue to recover gradually from the financial turmoil  However, both the real and the   financial risks remain skewed to the downside     I had a follow-up question on nonresidential structures  You talked   about drilling and mining, and I was wondering about the other parts of commercial real estate    Was anything in there?  I don’t know if you had a chance to look at it, but the reason I ask is that,   if you thought financing was starting to become a problem and you do have very weak   nonresidential investment going forward, you would expect to start seeing it there  So I’m   wondering if anything was in that breakout     I have a second question, which is that you didn’t mention durable goods  But if I   thought that credit problems, particularly subprime and other things, were starting to create   issues, I would expect to start seeing more imprints in the data for some of the durable goods  So   was seeing durable goods a little stronger in the consumption figures a surprise at all?   October 30-31, 2007 80 of 162     Just a follow-up on your comment about thinking about the release   and of uncertainty and risks around inflation and unemployment—it looks as though the   October 30-31, 2007 87 of 162    nomenclature that we’ve used in the assessment of risks was in part intended to get at the   direction of policy in the future  It does seem a little awkward if the language that we’re using in   the assessment of risks looks different from these fairly stark histograms  Since we haven’t gone   through this experiment before, seeing histograms that aren’t consistent with our statement   seems like an awkward start    Just to follow up on that—we submitted this last Friday, right?  I   don’t know if people will know when we submitted it, but it’s not a huge amount of time   between when it was submitted and when we are making an announcement  So if there were a   larger span of time, I would think that awkwardness wouldn’t be as great    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, find myself torn between   alternative A and alternative B and have been anguishing over them much of the last week figuring   out where I come out  The economic outcome detailed in both Boston’s and the Board’s forecasts   with no change in interest rates seems reasonable  The evidence since the last meeting indicates that   October 30-31, 2007 105 of 162    there may have been more strength in the real economy than we expected in the third quarter; and   financial markets have been recovering, but they are certainly not back to normal  The risks are   clearly on the downside, and our forecast expects a weak fourth quarter  So certainly an argument   for alternative B is to cut when it is clearer that the fourth quarter will be weak or we have data of   more-significant collateral damage from the housing sector  The argument for alternative A would   seem to be that we should take out more insurance against the downside risks  The costs for such   action are not great; and given the downside risk, some additional insurance is not unreasonable    However, we have discussed the modal forecast at some length, but our rigor around the tail is quite   limited, making it difficult to determine how often and how much insurance should be taken out   against downside risk  Thus, I prefer to wait until there are more data that the economy is   weakening, which I think is likely to happen   Just to comment on the assessment of risks—when I look at the uncertainty in terms of GDP   growth, I think of the histograms  That’s quite stark  If the major concern we have is downside   pressure on prices of housing, which is my concern—that housing prices continue to decline and   housing gets much worse—I think 25 basis points is probably a small premium to pay  But I doubt   that I would change where I would put the weighting even with a 25 basis point cut  I think the   housing scenario that is detailed in the Greenbook will still be there whether or not we cut the 25   basis points, and my guess is that between now and December we’ll have more confirmation that it   is a concern   Whatever we do in terms of the language, we need it to be consistent and accurate, and I am   a little worried about the language in alternative A being consistent and accurate with what we are   going to portray in our uncertainty of risks if we show those histograms  So if we’re showing the   histograms, regardless of whether or not we have a 25 basis point cut, I think the alternative B   October 30-31, 2007 106 of 162    language is more consistent with at least what we put down  Unless people think that, with the 25   basis point cut, there is a big shift in the uncertainty and the risks to GDP growth, I do worry about   how that will play out in the market and what kind of a tension there will be    No  If the goal is to try to convey that we aren’t necessarily going to   cut rates again, that is different from an assessment that there’s a downside risk that housing will get   much worse  So whatever we put in that should reflect what we actually want to convey and   certainly shouldn’t be inconsistent with histograms that we’re going to be publishing at the same   time     I agree that liquidity is a serious problem and getting worse  I think   in the charts that were sent around the jump in the one-month LIBOR, when it moved across the   end-of-the-year settlement, was an example of how serious the liquidity problems are viewed at   the end of the year  A multipronged approach to addressing this issue probably does make a lot   of sense  I would personally be in favor of reducing the primary rate relative to the fed funds   rate  I, too, am skeptical that, as long as there is a penalty rate, it will avoid the stigma issue, but   it might actually help cap how large the spread gets at the end of the year  I strongly support the   December 6, 2007 22 of 51    TAF  I strongly support the swap lines  The only question I do have for the staff is whether they   have any observations on how the Europeans avoid the stigma issue  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think I took the same pessimism pill   as President Yellen this morning  The Greenbook makes very somber reading, and I would   make several observations about the forecast it provides  First, Greenbook forecasts of two   successive quarters of growth below 1 percent are quite rare, and often in the past have occurred   shortly before or during recessions  Second, the 70 percent confidence interval for the   Greenbook projection of GDP, using historical forecast errors, has a negative lower bound    Third, I would note that when the unemployment rate rises at least ½ percent, it tends to rise   December 11, 2007 35 of 138    much further than just ½ percent  That is, historically, when we have unemployment rates rise   ½ percent, we have subsequently found ourselves in a recession  These observations indicate   that, while a recession is not forecast in the Greenbook—as David has been careful to state—the   probability of a recession is clearly elevated   At our last meeting, the housing market was very soft, but weakness in other components   was not yet reflected in the data  But now we have some evidence that consumption and   investment may also be slowing, and residential investment may be even weaker than we   thought  While incoming data have generally been weak, some higher-frequency data, like the   recent labor report, might be consistent with a stronger outlook than the Greenbook forecast    However, I am concerned that housing prices may actually fall more than assumed in the   Greenbook, potentially resulting in consequences that are difficult to forecast with models using   only postwar data  I am also sympathetic to the view that disruptions in financial flows have the   potential to result in significantly more weakness than would result from an econometric model   that does not capture significant liquidity disruptions, in part because the occurrence of such   events is quite rare  Added to these concerns is the current state of financial markets both here   and abroad  The elevated rates for term lending, even over relatively short maturities, indicates   significant risk aversion by market participants  Financial institutions with very low   probabilities of default, as measured by credit default swap rates, are nonetheless having   difficulty securing term lending over year-end   Bank supervisors of large financial institutions are beginning to report correlations in   nonperforming experiences of auto, credit card, and mortgage loans  Geographic regions hard   hit by mortgage defaults are also experiencing rising default rates in other types of loans    Portfolios that are not highly correlated during good times can become highly correlated during   December 11, 2007 36 of 138    bad times, and the initial trends being reported in bank supervision are not encouraging  I would   also highlight this as one of the instances in which bank supervision is providing some very   relevant input into thinking about the macroeconomy   Finally, I would highlight several institutional concerns that could have broader   implications  First, financial guarantors, as was highlighted earlier, have credit default swap   rates inconsistent with their AAA rating  Significant downgrades would further depress CDOs   but also disrupt the municipal bond market and force some banks to fulfill agreements to   purchase securities that do not maintain at least an AA rating  Second, there is the potential for   significant further announcements of downgrades of assets related to SIVs and CDOs  Money   market funds are currently experiencing inflows  However, those flows could quickly reverse if   investors lose confidence in their ability to redeem money market funds at par  Third, I would   note that for securities like lower-grade bonds that have not previously shown elevated risk   premiums, those premiums are now becoming quite elevated, providing evidence that what was   initially a liquidity concern is now becoming a more widespread and generalized concern about   the state of the economy   With core inflation a little below 2 percent, and future reductions in labor market   pressures likely, we have the flexibility to respond aggressively to slowing economic growth and   the ongoing financial turmoil  This seems to be the appropriate time to take significant further   action, knowing that, should the economy perform much better than we currently anticipate, we   could be equally nimble in raising rates as appropriate    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Weakness in economic data reported   since the last meeting, continued financial turmoil, and a forecast that places us uncomfortably close   to a recession calls for action, and my strong preference is for the decisive action reflected in   alternative A  With well-anchored inflation expectations and the possibility of unemployment rising   above our estimate of the NAIRU, the risks to inflation from this action seem quite low  However,   the possibility that the economy will soon be in a recession is too high, and our action should be   significant enough to substantially reduce that risk     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My views are actually very consistent   with your own  I would support lowering the fed funds rate 50 basis points, and, if it were up to   me, I would support doing it right now  The employment report last Friday was weaker than I   expected  In conjunction with the likelihood of several quarters of economic growth below   potential, the risk that the economy is in, or could be going into, a recession is too high    Continued declines in housing prices and stock prices raise my concern that deteriorating   household wealth will constrain consumption more than we anticipate  I am also worried that   weaker labor markets are likely to exacerbate problems in the housing market  Should housing   prices fall further and foreclosures rise more rapidly as a result of weak labor markets, financial   markets may experience even more turmoil than we have experienced to date  Commodity and   oil prices have risen, but I expect that the weakening in labor markets will be sufficient to   January 9, 2008 21 of 60    restrain inflation  The downside risks to the economy are significant, and I think we should take   aggressive action to mitigate that risk  Thank you     I, too, strongly support reducing the federal funds rate 75 basis   points  I am very concerned about financial market conditions detailed earlier by Bill  It is   widely viewed in the business community that we are slipping into a recession  Problems with   consumer debt are growing  I am concerned not only that we might be in, or about to be in, a   recession  I am concerned also how severe a recession could be  It is time to take decisive and   aggressive action, and I agree that, even with this cut, downside risks remain  Thank you     Yes  I would just note with the TAF experience, going back just for a   minute, that the Boston financial community has been overwhelmingly supportive  I don’t know   whether you have gotten the same sense when you talk to the financial community in New York,   but whether people were bidding or not, they actually thought that it was quite a fruitful exercise  In   terms of the credit default swaps, just looking at some of the institutions that were involved, it   seemed as if the US institutions, if you look at individual organizations, may have had much   higher credit default swap rates than many of the foreign institutions  As you noted, many of the   foreign institutions were substantially lower than at least a couple of the US ones that were   involved, and we obviously thought the US ones were sound, or we wouldn’t have been willing to   have them participate  We should look at the LIBOR rate, but I think we should also look at the   Treasury securities market because you don’t have to do as much in open market operations if   you’re doing some of it in the TAF, and we’ve had the interest rate on Treasury securities quite low    January 29–30, 2008 18 of 249    So I’m wondering whether, when we think about the analysis, we look not only at things like   LIBOR but also at the functioning of the Treasury market, and whether that was actually helped out   by this process  I don’t know if you’ve done any work on that, but it would be of interest to know if   that had helped with the better functioning of the Treasury market    Just a quick followup, this doesn’t include losses from securities  It   is only the loans, right?    Just in corporate bonds, for example    Okay  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The contours of our forecast are broadly   in line with the Greenbook  Growth well below potential for the first half of this year results in   additional slack in labor markets with a consequent reduction in the core rate of inflation over time    Our forecast returns to full employment by 2010 only if we reduce interest rates more than they are   in the Greenbook  Thus, our baseline forecast assumes that we reduce rates 50 basis points at this   meeting followed by additional easing in 2008, which eventually results in core inflation below   2 percent and the unemployment rate settling at our estimate of the NAIRU, somewhat below   5 percent  But even with this easing, there are significant downside risks to this forecast    Historically, increases in unemployment in excess of 06 percent and forecasts of two or more   quarters of real GDP growth below 2 percent have almost always been followed by a recession  In   fact, a variety of probit models looking at the probability of recession in 2008 indicate an   uncomfortably high probability of recession, in most cases above 50 percent   Several factors make me concerned that the outlook could be worse than our baseline   forecast  First, we have consistently underestimated weakness in residential investment  While our   forecast assumes a gradual decline in real estate prices, it does not have a substantial feedback   between rising unemployment rates causing further downward pressure on real estate prices and the   health of financial institutions  Were we to reach a tipping point of higher unemployment, higher   home foreclosures, increased financial duress, and falling housing prices, we would likely have to   January 29–30, 2008 78 of 249    ease far more than if we were to act preemptively to insure against this risk  Second, our weak   consumption is driven by negative wealth effects induced by weakness in equity markets and   modest declines in real estate prices  However, the heightened discussion of a potential recession   could easily result in a larger pullback by consumers  This would be consistent with the behavior of   rates on credit default swaps of major retailers, which have risen significantly since the middle of   December  Third, banks are seeing increasing problems with credit card debt  Capital One, one of   the few concentrated credit card lenders, has had their credit default swap rate rise from less than   100 basis points to more than 400 basis points as investors have become increasingly concerned   about the retail sector  While liquidity concerns have abated, credit risk for financial institutions has   grown  Rates on credit default swaps for our largest banks have been rising since December,   despite the announcement of additional equity investments  In addition, the greatest concern I hear   raised by the financial community in Boston is a risk posed by the monoline guarantors  The   movement in equity prices last week as a result of highly speculative statements on resolving the   monoline problem indicates a sensitivity of the markets to significant further deterioration in the   financial position of the monolines  Fourth, our model does not capture potential credit crunch   problems, although supplementary empirical analysis conducted by the Boston staff suggests that   such problems pose additional downside risks to our outlook  Bank balance sheets continue to   expand as banks act in their traditional role of providing liquidity during economic slowdowns    While the balance sheet constraints are likely to be most acute at our largest institutions, further   deterioration in real estate markets is likely to crimp smaller and midsize banks that have significant   real estate exposures   Given my concerns that we could soon be or may already be in a recession, I believe the   risks around our forecast of core inflation settling below 2 percent are well balanced  Inflation rates   January 29–30, 2008 79 of 249    have fallen in previous recessions, and I expect that historical regularity to be maintained if growth   is as slow as I expect  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, though I think a   case can be made for alternative A  The Boston model indicates that even after a 50 basis point   reduction, we still need more easing to return to an economy with both full employment and   inflation below 2 percent  Taking out insurance against more-severe downside risks would   imply even more easing than our baseline forecast  Given our recent move and the additional   January 29–30, 2008 121 of 249    easing in alternative B, I am comfortable waiting to take more aggressive action only if incoming   data warrant it  However, I will not be surprised if we find further action is indeed needed   What would be the arguments against taking an aggressive tack?  Certainly, one   argument might be that elevated oil and commodity prices and core inflation currently above   2 percent warrant a more restrained approach  However, I would note that in previous recessions   the inflation rate has declined significantly, even in the 1970s, in the midst of historic surges in   energy and food prices  Whether we skirt a recession or experience a recession, I expect core   inflation to trend down  A potential second argument is that we have responded too slowly to the   need for tighter policy in the past, so we should be more reluctant to ease in the present  While it   may be true that we raised rates too slowly at the onset of previous expansions, I see no reason   for this Committee to behave in a manner that it believes is suboptimal  As a Committee, we   seem to have consensus on the importance of maintaining low inflation rates, and I am confident   we have the will to raise rates with the same alacrity that we reduced them, should economic   conditions warrant such action    Just a question on exhibit 4, the bottom two panels  You have the four   banks there, and when you look at the capital ratios, it doesn’t look that discouraging  But when I   look at the credit default swaps, it looks a little less encouraging  So if I put Wachovia on this, I   believe Wachovia’s credit default swaps now are up to 166, which would be much higher than your   scale is right now  So it would be interesting actually to add Wachovia to that list  The second   thing is what you take from the fact that the capital ratios don’t look so bad but the credit default   swaps and what the markets are looking at indicate that, in the past month and a half, people—  despite the capital infusions—are actually exhibiting more concern about the default experiences   that might occur   January 29–30, 2008 164 of 249     It is great to see some bank supervision people at this table, and I   would just highlight one of the comments that you made about silos  It is interesting that this   morning we have been discussing issues of bank balance sheet constraints and how that would   occur, and it might be useful to think structurally within our own organization whether there are   ways to do a better job of getting people in bank supervision to understand some of the financial   stability issues we think about, and then vice versa  Maybe having some bank supervision people   come to FOMC meetings might be one way to actually promote some of this   In terms of the things that you were talking about, another issue that I think has been   important is that we’ve been talking about the effect of dropping housing prices  I know a   horizontal stress review was done about a year ago, and I’m sure Brian or Jon remembers that the   large financial institutions did the stress testing  When they did that stress testing, what was striking   was that there were four institutions—I think it was Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wachovia, and   Bank of America—in that stress test, and all four concluded that a housing-price reduction of   between 10 percent and 20 percent would affect earnings but wouldn’t affect capital  Obviously, in   retrospect that doesn’t seem to have been a good forecast  One, since we do think that stress testing   is useful, maybe understanding that and going back to those same four institutions and   understanding their stress testing might be a useful exercise to do  Two, if you did that exercise,   we’d learn something about how they’re thinking about housing prices and the indirect effects that   might occur because one of our concerns around the FOMC table is that there may be unintended   consequences if housing prices drop more than they have historically  Just as the banks have to   think about those kinds of stress tests and what they have already learned from the fact that they   didn’t pick up some of the indirect effects, our own knowledge would be supplemented if we   thought about some of those indirect effects as well   January 29–30, 2008 189 of 249    So the horizontal stress testing was interesting in that I think some of those institutions are   on the good side and the bad side of your things  The horizontal stress testing isn’t what generated   the decisions—and I do agree with your conclusion that most of the decisions were made by senior   management  Some organizations didn’t do subprime mortgages at all  I’m not so sure it was   generated from the stress testing as much as a gut feeling by senior bank management that they   weren’t going to engage in subprime mortgages  I think that’s true for a lot of these activities  It’s   interesting who’s at the top of the list and who’s at the bottom of the list for a lot of these activities    Ideally, over time, both bank supervision and bank risk management would get to the point that it’s   not just a gut decision by a person at the top but is a little more systematic and that the risk-  management process does that  Are you thinking of ways that we could actually encourage that   kind of interaction so that it becomes less gut from senior management and more integrated into the   risk management?  I know that was kind of a long entry     I just want to follow up on one of Bill Dudley’s comments  I   noticed in the terms and conditions that it included that the New York Fed reserves the right to   reject or declare ineligible any bid entirely at its own discretion  Under the TAF, we require that   people be qualified under the primary credit program  Are we planning on using a credit   March 10, 2008 14 of 39    standard equivalent to what is done for the TAF for the broker–dealer community?  Do we   currently have the capacity to make that determination?    Market conditions have deteriorated and are likely getting worse  I   strongly support both the swap and the TSLF to help mitigate those problems  In the longer run, I   think we do need to consider how to better assess counterparty risk to primary dealers  Thank you,   Mr Chairman   March 10, 2008 26 of 39      I’d like to commend the New York Fed staff for what I know has been   a very difficult time over the past week  My question is almost the opposite of President Lacker’s    He raises some interesting points, but I wonder  Given the stigma issues involved and what’s just   happened with Bear Stearns, you would think that borrowing at any kind of penalty rate for an   investment bank, which arguably is more susceptible to runs than the typical commercial bank, is   something that no one would take advantage of because of concerns about stigma  Is there any   evidence that there’s more stigma?  How are the primary dealers viewing this, and have they raised   concerns about confidentiality and what would be disclosed?   March 18, 2008 12 of 127     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the economic   data have continued to indicate a very weak economy and that, in all likelihood, we have entered   a recession  Like the Greenbook, my outlook is particularly influenced by indications of   significantly weaker labor markets and a housing market that is as yet showing no signs of   March 18, 2008 27 of 127    reaching bottom  Private payroll employment fell 101,000 in February, and the sum of the   downward revisions in December and January was about the same magnitude  Not only have we   had three months of declining private payroll employment, but also the decline has been   widespread across most industries  The Blue Chip economic forecast, the Greenbook forecast,   and our own forecast have the unemployment rate peaking somewhere between 5½ and   6 percent  While most analysts are in the process of downgrading their forecasts from skirting to   actually having a mild recession, the risk of a more severe downturn is uncomfortably high   A major determinant of the severity of a downturn will be the housing market  Because   recent developments in the housing market are so different from most postwar history, I remain   very concerned that the effects of substantial declines in housing prices will be difficult to   capture in statistical models based on historical data  The Case-Shiller index indicates that   housing prices fell approximately 10 percent in 2007, and a decline of similar magnitude this   year would mean that many homes purchased in the past several years are in a negative equity   position  Elevated foreclosures and large inventories of unsold properties are providing   abundant opportunities to purchase homes at heavily discounted prices financed at low interest   rates by historical standards  But widespread concerns that prices will continue to fall have   resulted in many prospective buyers deferring purchase decisions  To date, the housing market   has been quite weak, despite relatively low unemployment rates  But if our forecasts are right,   job losses this year are likely to exert a significant further drag on housing prices as rising   unemployment rates force additional home sales or foreclosures  Falling housing prices are   likely to have a collateral impact on consumption  Perhaps reflecting this risk, the credit default   swap rates on retailers have been rising, and we are increasingly hearing of retailers that are   closing stores or postponing expansions  Retailers, like consumers, are aware that high oil   March 18, 2008 28 of 127    prices, increasing job losses, and losses of wealth in the stock and housing markets are not likely   to be conducive to robust consumption   Exacerbating the negative economic news is the continued deterioration in financial   markets  Credit spreads have widened significantly over the past six weeks, with many spreads   more than 50 basis points higher than at the last meeting  Hedge fund and money managers that   I talk to are acutely aware of the counterparty risk and are very carefully managing their   collateral  Most firms with excess collateral are in the process of managing that position down    The deleveraging that is going on has reduced the willingness of banks and other financial   intermediaries to finance their positions  In addition, as concerns with liquidity rise, we are once   again seeing renewed pressure on the asset-backed commercial paper market  The rise in credit   default swaps for companies like Washington Mutual and Lehman Brothers indicates increased   concerns for the solvency of other large financial institutions with large exposures to mortgages    The potential for a further episode of financial market dysfunction and for runs on additional   financial firms is significant  My primary concern at this time is that we could suffer a severe   recession  Falling collateral values and impaired financial institutions can significantly   exacerbate economic downturns   Some indicators of inflation are higher than we want, but during previous recessions,   commodity prices and inflation rates fell  Given my forecast for the economic outlook, I expect   substantial excess capacity to significantly reduce inflationary pressures going forward, and I see   little evidence that higher commodity prices are causing upward pressures on wages and salaries    News of the problems at Bear Stearns and the very fragile situation in   financial markets complicate our decision today  Federal funds futures indicate that the market is   anticipating a reduction of at least 75 basis points and probably more than that  Normally the   expectations of financial market participants would not factor heavily in my decisionmaking    However, given the fragility in the market and my own expectation that, even with this move,   further easing will be necessary, I strongly prefer alternative A  While I view alternative B as a   significant action, I would have concerns about likely market reaction given the gravity of the   situation in financial markets and the possibility that a recession may not be mild, given falling   collateral values and financial difficulties at many of our major financial institutions  A 50 basis   point move would merely offset the increase in credit spreads that we have seen since the past   meeting  In addition, the Boston forecast and the Greenbook forecast with a 50 basis point ease   March 18, 2008 89 of 127    leave the unemployment rate well above the NAIRU but with inflation rates below 2 percent by the   end of 2009  Easing less than 50 basis points at this meeting would seem entirely inconsistent with   the economic and financial deterioration we have seen since the last meeting     Well, I certainly agree with the last statement that we should do   what makes sense, and in this case, differentiating between kinds of collateral that are all AAA   doesn’t make sense to me  We should broaden it out  I would say that in your presentation you   didn’t have the asset-backed commercial paper market, but those rates actually have been quite   elevated  Some rollovers for some of the large banks have not been working all that well, and   the assets that tend to be in those conduits are the very assets we are talking about expanding    They are the student loans, the auto loans, and the various other things that go into these   conduits  So I don’t know how big an effect it would be, but if you look at the asset-backed   commercial paper rates, they would look a lot like the LIBOR rates  I think that there might be   some net benefit, and it certainly does make sense to me that we would expand  There is no   reason to differentiate among AAA collateral that has many similar attributes    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Without judgmental adjustments, the   Boston Fed forecast is somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook  As in the Greenbook, our   GDP is weak in the first half of this year, though neither of the first two quarters actually turns   negative  Our slightly more optimistic forecast assumes that consumption and business fixed   investment are weak, but not as weak as in the Greenbook, and then the fiscal and monetary stimuli   are sufficient for the economy to pick up in the second half of this year  In a sense, the Greenbook   represents another mode in the forecast distribution with probability roughly equal to our forecast    The big risk to our forecast is that the financial turmoil and housing price declines, which are not   fully reflected in the Boston model, result in a greater drag on the economy  Such an outcome   would largely close the gap between the Greenbook and our forecast  In short, the downside risks to   our forecast are appreciable  With a monetary policy assumption similar to the Greenbook’s, we   have core PCE below 2 percent in 2009, but the unemployment rate remains well above the NAIRU   even at the end of 2010  If we sought to keep inflation below 2 percent but did not want an   extended period in which the unemployment rate was above the NAIRU, our model would require   more easing than currently assumed in the Greenbook   Since the last meeting, the economic data have remained weak  Private payroll employment   declined by approximately 100,000 jobs on average over the past three months, and the   unemployment rate increased 03 percentage point  In addition, the labor market weakness was   widespread across industries  Such labor market weakness is likely to aggravate an already   troubling housing story  To date, falling housing prices have disproportionately affected subprime   borrowers and those who purchased securitized products  However, if housing prices continue to   decline rapidly, that will begin to affect more prime borrowers and a wide array of financial   April 29–30, 2008 55 of 266    institutions  Smaller financial institutions that were largely unaffected by the financial turmoil last   August are beginning to see increases in delinquencies, and those with outsized exposures in   construction loans are now experiencing significant duress  Commercial real estate loans are also   now experiencing increased delinquencies  Like the Greenbook, I am concerned that commercial   real estate may be the next sector to experience problems  However, the biggest concern remains   that rising delinquencies and falling housing prices cause a much higher rate of mortgage defaults   than we have experienced historically  Should these mounting problems become more pronounced,   we are likely to see credit availability for small- and medium-sized businesses affected  That sector   has not to date been significantly affected by the financial turmoil   Many financial indicators have improved since the last meeting, as was highlighted in Bill’s   report  The stock market has moved up  Many credit spreads have narrowed  Treasury securities   and repurchase agreements are trading in more-normal ranges, and credit default swaps for many   financial firms have improved  Nonetheless, several ominous trends remain in financial markets    The LIBOR–OIS spread has widened, so borrowers tied to LIBOR rates have seen those rates rise   more than 25 basis points since the last meeting  Similarly, the TAF stop-out rate in the last three   auctions was higher than the primary credit rate, providing another indicator that banks remain in   need of dollar term funds  Finally, the asset-backed commercial paper market is once again   experiencing difficulties  Rates on asset-backed commercial paper have been rising, and there is a   risk that more of the paper will end up on bank balance sheets  Higher food and energy prices are   both a drag on the economy and a cause for concern with inflation  But despite the extended   sequence of supply shocks, I do not see evidence that inflation expectations are no longer anchored    Labor markets do not indicate that the commodity price increases are causing wage pressures, and   such pressures are even less likely if the unemployment rate continues to increase  Many of the   April 29–30, 2008 56 of 266    financial indicators of inflation, such as the five-year-forward rate, have fallen significantly from   their peaks earlier this year  Finally, core PCE over the past year has been 2 percent, and most   econometric-based forecasts expect that the weakness we are experiencing should result in core and   total PCE inflation at or below 2 percent next year  Overall, the downside risks to demand that I   listed in the outset seem the more compelling cause for concern  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There seems to be a groundswell of   opinion in financial markets, and perhaps around this table, that given the easing to date we are   at or close to a point where we should pause and assess the impact of both fiscal and monetary   stimulus already provided  Should we pause at a fed funds rate below 2 percent, at 2 percent, or   over 2 percent?  The Greenbook forecast assumes that we pause at 1¾ percent  With this degree   April 29–30, 2008 115 of 266    of stimulus, core and total PCE inflation is at or below 2 percent in 2009, but the unemployment   rate remains well above the NAIRU, even at the end of 2010  The Boston forecast generates   similar outcomes  The Greenbook and the Boston forecasts suggest that 25 basis points at this   meeting may not be enough  Both forecasts imply that a significant degree of slack remains in   the economy, even with a 25 basis point reduction at both this and the following meeting  In   addition, there are significant downside risks to the outlook  Falling asset prices in other   countries have frequently been accompanied by prolonged periods of weakness  Finally, given   the rise we have seen in the LIBOR rate, for many borrowers a 25 basis point decrease leaves   policy no more accommodative than at our last meeting     The consensus seems to be that we should be moving in smaller increments  But if we   choose option B, it is not at all clear to me that we should pause after this meeting  In that   regard, I was happy to see the revised language in the Bluebook table 1, which does not imply   that our easing cycle has definitely ended  While I hope that the economy recovers sufficiently   that further easing is not necessary, we need to remain flexible, particularly given that our   models indicate that even with further easing we are likely to experience several years of   elevated unemployment rates  Thank you    Okay  Just a quick question, which doesn’t have to be answered   now—given all of the financial turmoil, it would be interesting to see whether in other countries   that have these different arrangements there was a decrease in either overnight or term lending   with counterparties  Given the extent to which you can just work with a central bank rather than   counterparties, is there any evidence in these other regimes that interbank lending transaction   volume disappeared in some of these countries?  I would be interested in seeing that  Regarding   Governor Kroszner’s comment on the H41 release, it does seem that we could probably have a   materiality requirement in our balance sheet  Under most circumstances, what we are doing at   the discount window would seem not to hit that materiality criterion  I think we could be a little   April 29–30, 2008 175 of 266    more innovative—I agree with President Lacker’s point—but I think that the H41 does seem to   have an effect; and if we will be doing all these other things, taking another look at the H41 and   making sure that we don’t have more untapped flexibilities probably makes a lot of sense   I would like a little more discussion of “promote efficient and resilient money markets   and government securities markets” as a criterion  I’m not sure I would weight those criteria   equally  It seems that all these criteria, for the most part, take care of most of the dead weight   loss; and given that the banks still have to administrate for daylight credit, I am not sure that the   burden is all that different across these various regimes  But I can imagine that that one might be   different, and given we just had financial turmoil—I know this is a bit different from what   President Lacker said—I would put a little more attention to that   Overall, I like option 2 and option 5  I’m comfortable with those two  I’m attracted to   the voluntary balance program  On net, I would probably prefer a longer maintenance period to   a one-day maintenance period, but I don’t have a strong preference and could easily be   convinced otherwise     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Despite some encouraging data   recently, the Boston Fed economic outlook continues to see the economy growing below   potential over the next several quarters, further weakening in labor markets, and core PCE   trending down in response to excess capacity  Overall, our forecast has not changed significantly   since our April meeting  I view recent strength in consumer spending indicators as largely   borrowing from the second half of this year  This view is supported by the assessment that, apart   June 24–25, 2008 48 of 253    from the fiscal stimulus, consumption fundamentals—income, wealth, and employment—remain   on the weak side     Taking on board some of the increase in the May unemployment rate, our forecast has the   unemployment rate peaking at a slightly higher rate than at the last meeting  In this respect, we   are similar to many other forecasters  The May Blue Chip forecast had unemployment peaking   at 56 percent  The June Blue Chip forecast for unemployment peaks at 57 percent  While the   Greenbook has the unemployment rate peaking at 57 percent, as it did in April, it has the   unemployment rate at 56 percent at the end of 2009—01 percent higher than the April   Greenbook  So at least as measured by the unemployment rate, there seems little improvement   in the outlook since the April meeting  As in the Greenbook, residential investment in our   forecast continues to be a drag on the economy in 2009, and consumption holds up primarily as a   result of the fiscal stimulus package, which is in part offsetting the negative impact of   significantly higher oil prices on consumption  A major uncertainty remains whether further   home-price declines will have a more negative effect on residential investment and consumption   than we currently have in our forecast     Similarly, I would view financial market conditions as not having changed significantly   since our April meeting  The three-month LIBOR–OIS spread remains quite high by historical   standards at roughly 70 basis points, where it has been trading since the April FOMC  The Dow   Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq indexes have all declined since our April meeting  Investment   banks, such as Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, are now trading substantially below where   they were trading at our April meeting and below where they traded during the middle of March   when Bear Stearns experienced difficulties  Stock prices for large regional banks have declined   as they have needed to increase loan-loss reserves, raise new capital, and reduce dividend   June 24–25, 2008 49 of 253    payments  I continue to be concerned that we have more, significant difficulties ahead for many   financial institutions  First and second mortgages and home equity lines of credit are   deteriorating at many banks as falling home prices and job losses create problems that have now   spread to some prime residential products  I would characterize financial markets as remaining   fragile  The past two TAF auctions still produced stop-out rates above the primary credit rate,   and financial markets remain susceptible to event risk  The recent flurry of articles on Lehman   before their announcement of their capital infusion highlights continued concerns about   investment banks, despite our new liquidity facilities  As a result, I continue to view the   downside risk of further financial shocks as being significant   Core PCE inflation has trended lower during this quarter, bringing the four-quarter   change for the past year to 21 percent  Given that the Boston Fed forecast expects significant   excess capacity over this year, we forecast that core PCE inflation will be slightly below   2 percent in 2009  If food and energy prices stabilize, we expect total PCE to converge to core   PCE  We have experienced significant food and energy shocks, and oil prices continue to be   higher than our expectations  I would be quite concerned should the serially correlated surprises   in food and energy become embedded in inflation expectations and wages and salaries  But a   critical element to my forecast is that total PCE inflation converges to core PCE as wage and   salary increases remain largely unaffected by the supply shocks  In the data to date, wage and   salary increases have not trended up in response to the supply shocks, and my expectation is that   excess capacity in labor markets and continued competition from abroad make it unlikely that the   relative change in food and energy prices will become embedded in labor contracts   For the intermediate term, I remain focused on core PCE rather than total PCE for several   reasons  First, monetary policy is unlikely to have much effect on food and energy prices, which   June 24–25, 2008 50 of 253    are responding, among other developments, to the impact of natural disasters such as flooding in   the Midwest and manmade disasters such as ongoing political difficulties in Nigeria and the   Middle East  Second, statistical evidence provided by our research department seems to indicate   that over the past 20 years, when total and core inflation diverge, total has tended to converge to   core and not the opposite  Third, while inflation expectations are difficult to model, the lack of   an upward trend in wages and salaries seems consistent with worker expectations being driven   by core rather than total inflation  While the supply shocks may have increased the upside   inflation risks, the downside risks to the economy and financial markets remain quite elevated    In my view, we need more time and data to determine with greater confidence which of these   risks poses the greatest danger to the economy   In terms of the options, I am comfortable with either 1 or 3  I have a slight preference for   option 1  It is not that difficult for us to extend our forecast out five years  I actually think it   would be easier to explain to the public than option 3, and I think explaining to the public is one   of the main goals of expanding the forecast  But I could be happy with either option     I support alternative B  At this time, there are significant downside   risks to the economy and financial markets, as the collateral damage from the housing problems   works through the economy and financial institutions  At the same time, continued increases in   oil and food prices raise the risk that some part of these supply shocks will be incorporated into   inflation expectations  In the absence of more-compelling evidence about which of these two   risks will dominate, I would favor remaining on hold at this meeting  I hope that the economy   picks up in the second half of this year and that the financial markets stabilize so policy can   become less accommodative, but it is not clear that this will be the outcome  While the inflation   outlook has been affected by continued energy shocks, the future path of oil prices remains   uncertain, and recent history has many instances in which oil shocks are short-lived and have   little effect on longer-run inflation expectations  Until we have more clarity on the path of the   June 24–25, 2008 122 of 253    economy and inflation, policy should remain on hold, and our language should be consistent with   that    I just have a couple of questions of fact  How big was Bear Stearns’s   tri-party repo on the Thursday that they started getting into trouble—just to give a rough sense of   scale?  I know it’s not exact    About $150 billion?    Okay  So roughly $100 billion  The numbers seemed to be in that   range  Now, one of the reasons that we’re worried about the tri-party repo was that the securities in   that tri-party repo were very illiquid  Was Bear Stearns unusual in the amount of illiquid securities   that were being financed?  As we look down this list, is the nature of the tri-party repo across these   different parties similar or different?  You could have a tri-party repo with collateral that would be   easy to liquidate, or you could have a tri-party repo with something very difficult so that the   counterparty would have a difficult time actually selling it into a distressed market  From the work   you all have been doing, are there big differences or not?    For Bear Stearns, we have one side of the transaction looking at the   investment banks  On the other side of that transaction, you have companies like Fidelity, Schwab,   and Federated  So as we think about who poses systemic risk, we probably want to think about both   sides  In terms of a distress scenario, you have tri-party repos that are very illiquid  The clearing   bank does not want to provide the cash  As a result they have to liquidate, and you have companies   like Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated having to break the buck, and they don’t have much capital to   infuse  So just as we think about systemic risk, as you’re looking at these other organizations, are   there other people that you would add to that?  I know for Bear Stearns that Fidelity, Schwab, and   Federated played a very large role  Were there other organizations that we ought to be thinking   about that would have the same kind of nature?   June 24–25, 2008 158 of 253     One last question  Sorry for so many questions  The situation of   Lehman was kind of interesting because you saw their stock price go down  Talking to financial   institutions, both regulated and unregulated, in Boston, a lot of people were evaluating counterparty   risk and deciding whether or not they were going to start running before the capital issue  Did your   measures of liquidity pick up the amount of stress that was going on in the counterparty analysis   being done, I assume, all over the country?  One of the conditions for an institution’s access to the   June 24–25, 2008 159 of 253    discount window at a primary credit rate is that it not be rated a 4 or a 5  I know we’re not doing   bank exams, and I know we’re not looking at all the elements of the bank exam  How confident are   we, if we were to do something like that for Lehman or for Merrill Lynch, that we wouldn’t rate   them a 4 or a 5?    I have three comments for the long term and three comments for the   short term  For the long term, in the tradeoff between focusing on markets versus institutions, to the   extent that we can have standardized products traded on exchanges, we don’t need to spend as much   time with institutions, and that takes care of a lot of the counterparty risk  To the extent that the   products have to be customized and done in dealer markets, then we have counterparty risk and that   becomes an issue  So I applaud what the New York Fed is doing with the credit default swap   market in thinking about a way to more systematically reduce counterparty risk  I wonder if we   should more forcefully be trying to push it not only to a clearinghouse but also maybe to exchange   traded  I know there is a tradeoff between standardized products and nonstandardized products    But if we can get things to be more standard so that they can trade on an exchange, we won’t have   to spend as much time talking about some of the issues that we’ve been talking about  Not just a   credit default swap market has that characteristic  So if we can push a number of areas in which   there’s counterparty risk into an exchange, then we can get out of the business of focusing on all the   institutions   The second point is that there’s a broader role for us as a holding company supervisor    When I look at this list and look at Countrywide, it’s not because they’re a primary dealer that I   would be focused on them  It’s because they were 20 to 25 percent of the residential mortgage   market; they were a very large player  The OTS has holding company supervision over them  We   ought to ask ourselves whether now is the time to think about what organizations we ought to have   holding company responsibility for  The OTS has WaMu and had Countrywide  We ought to give   some thought to that  Now is the time to think about whether or not that’s appropriate and push for   it if there are going to be legislative recommendations  In terms of broker-dealers, I think the same   thing applies  I don’t think that we should be the primary regulator for these organizations  But if   June 24–25, 2008 168 of 253    we’re going to be lending to them in exigent circumstances, having holding company regulatory   authority does become important   The third point is that, when you look at this list, there are a lot of foreign institutions  One   insight that we’ve gotten is that an organization as big as UBS could potentially fail  That may not   be something that we thought was very likely nine months ago, but it is obviously more likely now   than we would have anticipated  Foreign organizations can either establish themselves as a branch   or have a domestic holding company  To the extent that foreign supervisors decide to wall off their   organizations around their geographic borders and say that, if there is a problem, we’re not going to   support institutions that are in the United States and you’re on your own, I think we need to revisit   some of our rules on how much capital we expect foreign holding companies that are intermediary   holding companies to hold  We might also want to think about, if there’s a lot of activity being   done through a branch that has no capital supporting it, how concerned we should be about that    Should we be taking actions to make sure that, if the foreign parent decides that they are going to   abandon the branch, we feel very comfortable with that outcome?  Given the list of the primary   dealers, I think the numbers are fairly large, larger than they were for Bear Stearns, and that’s   something that we probably should give a bit more thought to   On the short-term issues, I certainly think that we should extend the facilities past the end of   the year  That makes perfect sense  A number of us have made the point that the markets are still   fragile  Just the announcements about Lehman Brothers over the last month highlight that we’re not   yet safe, and I think that it makes perfect sense to extend through the end of the year because there   could be an end-of-the-year financing problem this year  Second, narrowing tri-party repo collateral   also makes sense  But it has implications for what securities people hold, and some of those   markets may become much more distressed if we announce that they no longer can be part of a tri-  June 24–25, 2008 169 of 253    party repo  So we need to give some thought to whether there will be collateral damage and to the   unintended consequences from that  Third, I agree with President Lacker that primary dealers   wouldn’t be where I’d focus  I’d focus on systemically important  That would be key players and   key markets whose failure might cause a cascading of counterparty failures  I think we ought to   start with that premise and which organizations fit into that category  Some of them will be on the   primary dealer list, but they are on the primary dealer list for a reason very different from the reason   they are systemically important  So maybe distinguishing between those two would be useful     I am supportive of the overall recommendations  I would say, along   with President Evans, that I am a little worried about how the markets may react to these new   additions and whether they may view it as the Federal Reserve viewing things as deteriorating rather   than improving  We have to think a bit about what the market expectations may be with the   announcement of these additions  I would just like to comment on President Yellen’s comments  I   think they highlight that we probably need to spend a little more time thinking about the link   between supervisory ratings and our running of the discount window as we do some of the other   work streams we are doing  Both our own supervisory ratings and the ratings of the primary   regulators in some cases seem to have lagged  That is particularly true for the OTS  There are a   number of other OTS institutions that the market seems quite concerned about and where the ratings   seem inconsistent with the market’s concerns  So it is not just looking backward but also looking   forward  As we extend the term for things like the TAF, I think the concerns do get raised if the   primary supervisor is not being very quick to make an evaluation of deteriorating circumstances  So   as we do our work streams, I would just encourage us to spend a little time thinking about how the   supervisory ratings and our operations of the discount window could be melded a bit better    I support this recommendation    I support the 84-day extension     My question is for Steve  There have been judgmental adjustments to   the domestic forecast reflecting financial headwinds in the United States  I’m wondering if we   made the same adjustments for financial headwinds in Europe  You highlighted that residential   investment looks a bit different in Europe, but they do have a lot of capital losses in their banking   system  Their LIBOR–OIS spread is quite elevated, and at least in some European countries—  Ireland and Spain as well as the United Kingdom, which you mentioned—housing has been quite   soft  Are you doing judgmental forecasts to reflect those headwinds, or do we do it on the domestic   side but not for the European outlook?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Boston forecast used for the June   meeting expected that the unemployment rate would peak at approximately 57 percent    Unfortunately, with the July employment report, the unemployment rate has already reached   57 percent, and we expect the economy is likely to grow less than potential for the next several   quarters  With the unemployment rate rising in the past three months by 07 percentage point and   payroll employment declining for the past six months, I am concerned that there remains a   significant risk that the second half of this year would look a lot like the “severe financial stress” or   “typical recession” scenarios  My concern reflects the potential impact of further deterioration   among financial institutions and financial markets that may create a significant headwind for the   economy and the likelihood that economic problems are growing in other countries, which would   slow one of the few bright spots in the economy—exports   Since our last meeting, much has been written about the problems at the GSEs  Concern   with the viability of the GSEs and potential future losses has contributed to mortgage rates rising   despite our past easing, the weak economy, and diminished demand for mortgages  With financial   institutions showing little interest in lending to subprime or jumbo borrowers, the increased cost for   individuals that qualify for conforming loans is likely to weaken the one part of the housing market   that had been relatively resilient to financial problems to date  For potential buyers, higher interest   rates and the likelihood that housing prices will continue to fall provide little current incentive to   purchase a home, while the job losses are providing an immediate need for some owners to sell their   homes  We need the housing market and housing prices to stabilize, which I had hoped would   occur in the second half of this year, but now it looks as though it will be deferred until next year     August 5, 2008 64 of 145    Falling housing prices have created significant collateral damage  Liquidity problems that   began one year ago remain in play  The capital-constrained financial institutions that are forced to   shrink their balance sheets may pose a significant additional problem in the second half of this year    While many of the largest banks that suffered significant losses last year were able to raise   additional capital fairly readily, the capital losses on newly issued bank equity may have reduced   many investors’ appetite for providing new capital for banks until it is clear that the economy is   recovering  The falling national housing prices and problems in commercial real estate in some   sectors of the economy are now affecting regional and community banking institutions, many of   which are unlikely to get equity infusions and thus will be forced to shrink  A reduction in the   willingness to lend, as represented by the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, has often portended   a reduction in credit to bank-dependent borrowers  As we get a more traditional credit crunch   compounding the liquidity problems, I am concerned that credit will be less available to consumers   and businesses and further slow consumption and business investment   Since the June meeting, the stock market has fallen 7 percent; and with the number of large   financial institutions experiencing very elevated CDS spreads and stock prices in the single digits,   the failure of one or more relatively large domestic or foreign financial institutions is a real   possibility  In such an environment, the assumption of annual equity prices rising 7 percent in the   rest of this year and 12 percent in 2009 as assumed in the Greenbook would seem to have some   significant downside risk  Elevated unemployment rates and a flat or slightly falling trend in wage   and salary inflation suggest an absence of the inflationary pressures in labor markets that would lead   to rising inflation once energy and food prices stabilize   These factors give me some confidence that we will see core and total inflation in 2009   close to 2 percent  Since our last meeting, labor markets have been weaker than expected, and oil   August 5, 2008 65 of 145    prices and many other commodity prices have fallen, in part as a result of the concern with a   slowing global economy  Although total inflation measures are clearly higher than any of us would   want, these readings appear to be transitory responses to supply shocks that are not flowing through   to labor markets  In fact, evidence from the labor market would seem to indicate that the downside   risks to the economy are affecting labor markets through job losses but are not creating an   environment in which labor tries to offset supply shocks with higher wage demands  Thank you    I support alternative B  I would actually prefer President Yellen’s   language but definitely believe that we should have the word “also” in there  Tightening at this time   would sap more strength from an already weak economy, and should the forecast look like the   “severe financial stress” scenario or the “typical recession” scenario, it would be extremely poorly   timed  If the data indicate that inflation is not ebbing as I expect and the economy is on a surer   footing than I fear, then it would be appropriate to begin what is likely to be a series of increases in   the federal funds target  But the data to date don’t indicate that, so I support alternative B     Just an amplification on the State Street situation  My   understanding is that no money actually went out  There was $20 billion in withdrawals that   came in late in the day  They had a $7½ billion credit line  State Street had enough collateral to   September 16, 2008 6 of 108    do $7½ billion  They were unwilling to do $20 billion  They asked us what our position was,   and we told them that they needed to make their own business decision in this case  I haven’t   heard what has happened this morning  I assume that they are scrambling for funds  But I would   emphasize that a real concern is that there will be a run this week on money market funds   because they may have to freeze the funds  It is possible that they will break the buck, and this   will be at organizations that don’t have sufficient capital to make people whole  So I think that is   a real concern     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be brief  This is already a   historic week, and the week has just begun  The labor market is weak and getting weaker  The   unemployment rate has risen 11 percentage points since April and is likely to rise further  I am   not convinced that the unemployment rate will level off where the Greenbook is assuming   currently  The failure of a major investment bank, the forced merger of another, the largest thrift   and insurer teetering, and the failure of Freddie and Fannie are likely to have a significant impact   September 16, 2008 30 of 108    on the real economy  Individuals and firms will become risk averse, with reluctance to consume   or to invest  Even if firms were inclined to invest, credit spreads are rising, and the cost and   availability of financing is becoming more difficult  Many securitization vehicles are frozen    The degree of financial distress has risen markedly  Deleveraging is likely to occur with a   vengeance as firms seek to survive this period of significant upheaval  Given that many   borrowers will face higher interest rates as a result of financial problems, we can help offset this   additional drag by reducing the federal funds rate  I support alternative A to reduce the fed funds   rate 25 basis points  Thank you    I think it’s too soon to know whether what we did with Lehman is   right  Given that the Treasury didn’t want to put money in, what happened was that we had no   choice  But we took a calculated bet  If we have a run on the money market funds or if the   nongovernment tri-party repo market shuts down, that bet may not look nearly so good  I think we   did the right thing given the constraints that we had  I hope we get through this week  But I think   it’s far from clear, and we were taking a bet, and I hope in the future we don’t have to be in   situations where we’re taking bets  It does highlight the need to look at the tri-party repo market,   look at the money market fund industry, and look at how they’re financing  There are a lot of   lessons learned, but we shouldn’t be in a position where we’re betting the economy on one or two   institutions  That is the situation we were in last weekend  We had no choice  We did what we had   to do, but I hope we will find a way to not get into this position again     That’s right     Economic and financial conditions have deteriorated significantly  I   strongly support a 50 basis point reduction, and I would not change the language  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     But there is nothing that prevents them from withdrawing those   assets before that, right?  Presumably, if they’re in a situation of default, they would withdraw   any Treasury securities held here first    I have two unrelated questions  One follows up on this, but the   other one is on the term auction facility  First, given how much we have expanded the term   auction facility, is there any consideration to having a minimum stop-out rate, given that the last   two have had fairly low stop-out rates?  I wonder if that was being considered at all, given how   October 28–29, 2008 24 of 206    much we expanded the size  Then the second question gets to the stigma issue related to the   swap lines  There was quite a lot of discussion about how to differentiate the countries  I had   the same thought that President Lacker had—if we could have set-off rights that enable them to   collateralize the swaps  I do think going to the IMF will attach a fair amount of stigma to the   organization  So I am worried that the spillover benefits to other countries will be negative, not   positive, because of that stigma  One option would be to say that either you could go to the IMF   or we would provide collateralized loans for other than these four, since it sounds as though   these four are a done deal  But rather than trying to draw the line and figure out whether Chile or   some other country is appropriate, we could collateralize it  If they held enough Treasury   securities at the New York Fed, then it would seem that we would have no reason not to do it  If   they didn’t have Treasury securities, which would probably partly reflect some of their own   mismanagement in their countries, then they wouldn’t be able to use the facility and would have   to use the IMF  But it would seem to be a way to get around some of the stigma issues, if   someone chose to come to us and fully collateralize it  That might be an alternative way to draw   the line rather than trying to come up with criteria that seemed a little difficult to understand, as I   went through the memo    But I’m just wondering, as the OIS rate has come down, when you   think of the band that we have for excess reserves, it does seem that the OIS provides a much   bigger band, for example, than what we have even for excess reserves  I wonder whether, during   October 28–29, 2008 25 of 206    periods in which people are considering a reduction of as much as 50 or more basis points, the   OIS ends up being a very low lower bound    But as we narrow the target for excess reserves and have a narrow   band there, you wonder whether the stop-out rate, having a lower band that is a little higher than   the OIS, might be an alternative way to think about it, now that we have the excess reserves   option as to the lower bound    Thank you, Mr Chairman  While the LIBOR–OIS spread has   narrowed somewhat, the mutual fund industry is no longer experiencing waves of redemptions, and   commercial paper market conditions have improved, we’re still not back to the short-term credit   conditions that prevailed before the failure of Lehman Brothers  This outcome is striking   considering the historic interventions that have occurred in the past month  With all of the new   October 28–29, 2008 78 of 206    government guarantees and equity infusions here and abroad, the limited improvement in short-term   credit markets attests to the degree of concern and risk aversion prevailing in financial markets   These concerns are likely to become even more elevated if the economy slows to the degree   expected in most forecasts  Like the Greenbook, our forecast anticipates a significant recession    The Boston forecast includes three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and results in an   unemployment rate peaking above 7½ percent  The weakening labor market and the large losses in   housing and stock wealth make it quite likely that consumption will shrink in the second half of this   year  While we need housing to reach bottom, mortgage rates relative to federal funds rates remain   quite high, and further job losses are likely to aggravate the upward trend in foreclosures and add to   the downward pressure on housing prices  With limited new home purchases and demand for   vehicles weak, consumption of consumer durables is unlikely to recover until next year    Commercial real estate, which has held up reasonably well, all things considered, is likely to be   much weaker next year as new and rollover financing is difficult to obtain and staff cuts and hiring   freezes affect the space needed by businesses  More generally, firms are likely to have little   incentive to make new investments until the severity of the downturn becomes much clearer    Unfortunately, many of our trading partners are likely to face an even more severe downturn,   aggravated by their slow fiscal and monetary response to deteriorating economic and financial   conditions  While the Greenbook assumes the stock market will rise by 8 percent for the remainder   of this year—it looks as though that happened today—     —I would say that I’d be surprised by that outcome    October 28–29, 2008 79 of 206    There are several looming financial problems that are likely to affect financial markets  Bill   Dudley highlighted the one that I think is the biggest for me, which is that the NAV (net asset value)   triggers for hedge funds will be a significant problem in the fourth quarter  Without comprehensive   information on hedge funds, it’s difficult to know the extent of the problems they are facing    However, since the stock market remains one of the few markets available for the disposing of   assets in bulk without a significant liquidity haircut, I’d expect significant selling in the fourth   quarter  My second big concern is that rollover financing will become more problematic as   financial problems persist  Particularly exposed are real estate developers and highly leveraged   private equity firms  My third worry is that neither insurance companies nor commercial banks   have reserved for the economic outcome in our baseline forecast  Under-reserving and high payout   ratios are likely to limit the amount of additional lending that banks are willing to take on  These   financial problems place additional downside risk to our forecast   Our forecast, like the Greenbook forecast, expects the rate of inflation to slow as a result of   falling food and energy prices and significant excess capacity emerging in the economy  In fact, our   equations indicate there is a non-negligible risk that deflation will be a problem in the outyears of   our forecast  Unlike President Lacker, I was surprised that it stayed as high as 1 rather than as low   as 1  The outlook for a weak real economy and falling inflation highlights the need for both   monetary and fiscal policy to offset some of the financial and economic problems that we are likely   to experience  Thank you    Like the Greenbook forecast, our forecast predicts a significant   recession  Further easing will likely help mitigate the severity of the recession  Coupled with   improvements in short-term credit spreads, a reduction in the federal funds rate should lower   rates on home equity lines of credit as well as business and consumer rates tied to LIBOR, easing   cash flow for consumers and businesses  We are facing problems of historic proportions, both   here and abroad  A 50 basis point easing, as in alternative A, is both necessary and appropriate    Even with the easing assumed in the Greenbook, the unemployment rate remains too high for too   long  The inflation rate falls enough to be well below my target  To avoid a severe and   October 28–29, 2008 125 of 206    prolonged recession, we will very likely need further monetary easing and a significant fiscal   package, even after this 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate   I would just note in terms of the language that, although I am comfortable with the   alternative A language, my actual views would be closer to saying “the predominant concern of   the Committee is the downside risk to growth” rather than “nevertheless, downside risks to   growth remain”     I would also like to join the chorus of people thanking the staff, in   particular the staff members who were working on the memos on Japan  Having done some work   on Japan myself, I know that getting the institutional details right is far from easy, particularly when   you are not a native speaker  So I much appreciated the work in that area   The probability of a severe economic downturn accompanied by deflation is too high, and   the effective fed funds rate is already very close to zero  This combination calls for aggressive,   nontraditional policies  My reading of the parallel Japanese experience highlights two general   principles  The first is one that President Stern highlighted  There is a macroeconomic impact from   what we do in bank supervision  Banking problems should be addressed expeditiously, with   realistic write-downs of problem assets and recapitalization of problem banks  In particular, we   should prevent perverse incentives where problem borrowers are supported while healthier   borrowers are starved for credit as banks try to satisfy balance sheet constraints and avoid further   loss recognition  Second, monetary and macroeconomic policies to address financial dislocations   should be proactive and forceful rather than released gradually over an extended period of time  In   the context of the questions that we have been asked to address, I’d like to encourage us to take   three actions   First, I would explicitly state that the Committee seeks to achieve a core PCE inflation rate   of 2 percent in the medium term  For the second time this decade we are approaching the zero   nominal interest rate bound  Setting too low an inflation target threatens to place us in our current   December 15–16, 2008 74 of 284    predicament too often  In contrast, by setting an explicit target at 2 percent, we will indicate our   resolve to take nontraditional policies necessary to achieve that goal  Because the inflation target   adopted under the current circumstances would be designed to raise inflation expectations and   stimulate the economy, this may be a particularly propitious time to adopt such an explicit target  A   2 percent target would also be consistent with our own revealed preference as the core PCE inflation   rate has averaged 194 percent, very close to 2 percent, over the past ten years   Second, during the past recession, 30-year conventional mortgage rates reached 5¼ percent    The current rate has been hovering at 5½ percent and has reached that level only since we   announced our program to purchase $600 billion in GSE debt and mortgage-backed securities  The   housing sector remains the epicenter of our problems  Given the current outlook, I would suggest   using facilities to move toward an interest rate target, for example, by reducing by 100 basis points   from current levels the conventional 30-year mortgage rate  Lowering the 30-year conventional   mortgage rate would reduce the cost of purchasing new homes, encourage refinancing by those with   sufficiently high credit scores and equity in their homes, and support fiscal policies that are targeted   at more-troubled homebuyers  It would help troubled and healthy homeowners, stimulate the most   distressed area of our economy, and help financial institutions exposed to problems in housing    Such a target would be understandable to the general public, and actions already taken have made   some progress in this area and serve as an example  I would focus on the mortgage rates rather than   the Treasury yield curve because lower Treasury rates seem to be having little effect on rates paid   by households and businesses, and the desire to avoid credit risk has already brought 10-year   Treasury rates to lows not seen in most recent recessions   Third, our facilities for short-term credit have been successful  Short-term commercial   paper rates have fallen as a result of our programs, as was highlighted by Bill Dudley, and the   December 15–16, 2008 75 of 284    rollover risk at the end of the year has been mitigated by the commercial paper program    Increasingly, however, I have been hearing complaints about banks pulling lines of credit when they   are up for renewal primarily because the banks are facing balance sheet issues  One possible   remedy might be to extend our commercial paper facility to highly rated firms for longer maturities   than are covered by the commercial paper market  All three suggestions would be easily   communicated and understood by the public, would address directly the areas of the economy in   which financing has become particularly difficult, and would highlight our resolve to avoid a   deflationary economy, such as Japan experienced for over a decade   I would just end with the note that I agree with the Governor Kohn on the monetary base for   two reasons  The first is that I do not think our facilities have been particularly well designed to set   a quantitative target  Many of the facilities are open ended  Go through the following thought   experiment  Suppose a money market fund once again breaks the buck  The AMLF will probably   go up $150 billion or $200 billion  I would expect the commercial paper facility to go up  I would   expect that most of the bank facilities would also go up  If we were limited by a quantitative target   at the very time that we actually want those facilities to be expanding, we would be constrained  I   do not think that is a good idea in the current situation  The second reason comes from my reading   of what happened in Japan, and this goes to some of the remarks that the Chairman made  The   monetary base in Japan did expand very rapidly  When banks are capital constrained, expanding   reserves very rapidly does not translate into an expansion of the broader balance sheet  So we could   very easily see a situation in the United States in which banks continue to be capital constrained for   some time  Despite increasing the monetary base, we might not see an expansion in terms of other   assets  That is exactly why I agree with the Chairman that we should be focused on the asset, not   the liability, side of the balance sheet   December 15–16, 2008 76 of 284     To the prime money funds     There is a second factor  There has been discussion of extending the   A1/P1 program to A2/P2, which the industry is certainly aware of, but I would highlight with the   A2/P2 that a lot of the mutual funds do not want to hold it over the end of the year  Most of the   A2/P2 borrowers are having trouble rolling over year-end  There is a real risk that that market will   have to rely on backup lines of credit, and it’s not clear whether the A2/P2 market comes back after   the New Year, if that happens, or in what capacity it does  So I think the real test will be to look at   this chart in January or February    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As requested, I will be brief  Like the   Greenbook, we see an economy in which the unemployment rate remains very elevated, and   inflation is below my target for several years  Our own equations would indicate that these elevated   unemployment rates are likely to put even more downward pressure on the inflation rate than   forecast in the Greenbook  The labor market is extremely weak, and there is a significant risk of   deflation  I believe that greater use of nontraditional policies will be needed to mitigate more-severe   outcomes than encompassed in the baseline forecast   On the financial side I would just highlight two points  First, many banks are placing   interest rate floors on home equity loans and on commercial loans  Pervasive use of floors may   make the choice of which low federal funds target to pick of little relevance to actual borrowing   costs  We may want to consider surveying banks to get a better understanding of where these floors   are currently being set  Second, many firms are reporting that their lines are not being renewed and   are asserting that it reflects problems with the bank not the borrower  Discussions with community   banks indicate that, for smaller borrowers, community banks are benefiting from this trend    However, it may be useful to understand better how the reductions in lines, particularly at troubled   banks, are affecting the overall economy   Just a general point  I think bank micro behavior is going to be very important for   macroeconomic outcomes, and we might want to increase the amount of effort that we are putting   December 15–16, 2008 129 of 284    into understanding both their financial condition and how their behaviors may be changing over the   next six to nine months  Whether that’s done through the bank supervision process or the loan   officer survey or which mechanism we use, I think we need to probably get a little more intelligence   on exactly what those trends are  Thank you, Mr Chairman    The bleak outlook calls for aggressive action  With the effective   federal funds rate already well below our target, there is a logic to moving to the floor at this   December 15–16, 2008 170 of 284    meeting and redirecting attention to nontraditional policies  Thus, I am comfortable with   alternative B and would reduce the interest rates on required and excess reserves to 25 basis   points   In terms of the questions that the Chairman just posed, I am comfortable specifying the   range of 0 to ¼ percent  I would actually keep the bracketed information  I am okay with the   conditionality  I would remove the reference to the Treasury securities, and for the future I   would certainly want to think about expanding the purchase of GSE and agency mortgage-  backed securities beyond $600 billion  Also I would support, at a future date, setting a target of   2 percent for the core PCE inflation rate    A lot of these could go down quite substantially if conditions   improve, and we wouldn’t control that    The loss of the securitization market is really important, so I think this   facility is a very important innovation  My question is, How important were the conduits to this   market, and how confident are we that there will be structures to bring back the securitization   market?  Or are we basically bridging to these things going on bank balance sheets or other types of   financial intermediaries?  How do you see this?  I guess the question is, From your perspective,   what is this a bridge to?    My question was whether the Treasury had a criterion for when   they thought ring-fencing was the most appropriate way to deal with a problem versus alternative   ways of dealing with these problems  We have had two cases now in which we have done ring-  fencing The circumstances have been very different  So is there a criterion that is being worked   with the Treasury and the FDIC for when those are appropriate actions to take and when other   options should be considered instead?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like President Evans, I met with my   academic advisory council this last week  It is composed of a variety of academic economists from   around Boston As you might expect, there were widely divergent views on the advisability of   inflation targeting and the nature of what it should look like, but I nonetheless think that some of the   observations they made were of interest  First, those who thought that a target was a good idea   thought the lower bound of that target should be 2 percent  That’s higher than they would have   advocated previously and certainly higher than many members of the FOMC have advocated    Second, those who thought a target was a good idea argued for a large range, at least 100 basis   points, reflecting the difficulty of actually remaining in our target range and, again, larger than I   think many have discussed in the past  Third, many felt that we would have a difficult time   explaining to the public our target because we might have great difficulty hitting that target and it   might make the Federal Reserve look ineffectual  So there was a surprising concern about actually   moving toward a target at this time   My own view is that a target may make sense to highlight that we will take actions   necessary to avoid deflation and that we will remove the accommodation quickly enough that   inflation will not be a significant problem when the economy does eventually recover  I do have   some caveats  First, as I have mentioned before, this is the second time this decade we have been   concerned about a zero lower bound, and it is significantly limiting our actions at this time  We   should take into account the cost of being in this position too often, and I think that argues for a   higher target rate than I would have argued for two years ago  At a minimum, the middle of the                  January 16, 2009 43 of 69  range should start with a 2, not a 1  Second, as we experiment with a target and given the variability   we have seen in all inflation measures, we should start with a larger range than I would have argued   for a few years ago, probably 100 basis points is reasonable  Third, just by observing where   inflation has actually been over the last decade, it seems as though a revealed preference for   inflation ranges has been roughly 1½ to 2½ percent  I think an open question is whether our   preferences should change based on hitting the lower bound this time   In terms of the other questions, I will just be very brief  Like others, I think it will be very   difficult to have a price-level objective  I just think it is too difficult to communicate  It will be a   big enough challenge to explain inflation targeting  So I would not be in favor of moving to a price-  level objective  Second, the Congress may ask that we also provide a target for the unemployment   rate if we adopt an explicit inflation target, and we should ask ourselves whether that is a tradeoff   we are going to be willing to make  Finally, regarding communication, most of our communication   recently has been on the PCE measure  I think changing as few things as possible probably makes   sense So I would be an advocate for using the total PCE  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman    So the TALF is scheduled to end in January, but all the other   programs with this vote will be scheduled to end in October, is that right?   Year-end?   It seems a little peculiar to have different dates  It seems   particularly peculiar to have it end at the end of the year when that is likely to be a problematic   time, regardless of whether things settle down  So, actually, I would have a preference to go to        January 27–28, 2009 27 of 267  January But if we are not going to go to January, I do think that we should discuss it at the June   meeting, not the August meeting, because I know that there has been some uncertainty in the   markets about which programs would be extended  I don’t think the speculation has been   particularly healthy, so it is better to have a little more clarity  It might be worthwhile, if we are   going to have it end in October, actually to include that it would be discussed in June so that   people know that it will come up again   Yes The August meeting seems a little late, given that there is   likely to be speculation about year-end by August   First of all, Mr Chairman, I agree with your prioritization that, to   the extent possible, it makes sense for the programs that have substantial credit risk to be borne   by the Treasury Obviously certain circumstances forced other decisions along the way, but I   think that is a good prioritization  Then the second prioritization is that ideally we would be   focused on markets and not individual names, and that’s consistent with moving the Maiden   Lane facilities over to the Treasury to the extent possible  I think both of those prioritizations   make sense   On the AMLF, I actually was roughly at the same point in November, and its size has   come down since then  It has been interesting  I have had a number of discussions with a   variety of mutual funds about winding down the AMLF  They don’t view the AMLF as being   the same animal as the other money market facility, and I have been told that it will take severe   duress before they use the other facility because they are worried about stigmatizing themselves    As for the AMLF, because it is the sale of asset-backed securities, there is not the same stigma   attached So actually we had $800 million come in today  It was a money market fund that has   experienced very substantial runoffs that are not occurring with other organizations  I have been   told that, even if it goes down to a small number, money market funds’ willingness not to hold   extensive cash balances or very short term maturities is, in part, due to the fact that they can   liquidate their positions in asset-backed securities relatively quickly  The AMLF is not ideally         January 27–28, 2009 63 of 267  structured—I definitely agree with that—but I am not sure that the other facilities are perfect   substitutes If we were not to extend it, I would want to do that only after some discussion with a   number of money market fund families because I think we might find that it would have an   effect on their willingness (a) to hold asset-backed commercial paper and (b) to hold a variety of   other assets I think that they would look for other ways to get much more liquid because, as has   been highlighted, the financial markets are very fragile   It is all asset-backed commercial paper  It’s all A1/P1 asset-backed   commercial paper   They are not issuers  This is a money market fund  The   commercial paper facility is for issuers of commercial paper  The AMLF is for money market   funds So they are not the same   There has been an unwillingness to do that actually  It has been the   experience of the money market funds   In a more general sense, I think that, since the end of the third quarter, we have been in a   situation in which both the securitization market has broken down and bank balance sheets are     January 27–28, 2009 64 of 267  quite constrained, which is why we have seen spreads that are very, very large  I do think that   the various short-term credit facilities that we have established have both brought the spread   down and brought more liquidity to the market more generally  So in a general context, those   facilities have been quite beneficial   I have just a couple of short comments  First, in the earlier presentation, I noted that   tangible common equity was highlighted in the slides, and I would say that a lot of our programs   have been tied to preferred equity, and the markets, Moody’s, and the rating agencies are focused   on tangible equity So whatever we do going forward, I think we need to spend a lot more time   thinking about tangible common equity because we are seeing in supervision presentations that   institutions that have substantial excess capital by regulatory ratios are also sometimes   institutions that the market is running away from because, when they do the tangible equity   calculation, it’s a problem  So we ought to give a little more thought to common shares going   forward   Second, I come out in a different place related to our purchase of mortgage-backed   securities and GSEs Mortgage rates have been around 6 percent for a year and a half  After the   announcement of the program, they went down to 5 percent  The housing market has been the   epicenter of this problem  It is a problem both for the housing market and for financial   institutions Rather than cutting back on that program, if we are trying to have an effect on   borrowing costs that affect the economy, that program would be the one I would expand  I   would expand that program and not do Treasury securities because Treasury securities are the   one asset that everybody wants to buy now So I am not sure that we have to get in line with   everybody else to buy the same thing that everybody else wants and push down a rate that is   already low The problem is not that Treasury securities are too high  The problem is that     January 27–28, 2009 65 of 267  everything else is high relative to Treasury securities  So if we want to lower borrowing costs,   that is exactly what some of these facilities are designed to do, and that is what I think we need   to do So I am supportive of doing more actually for the mortgage market, and that is for   discussion tomorrow   The TALF is of the same nature, and I think it actually is quite beneficial  I would hope   that we could get it operational as quickly as possible  I know that dealing with accountants,   lawyers, and others becomes very complicated, but I think that the sooner we get that up and   running, the better I do question whether the size is going to be appropriate if we really want to   have a significant effect We are going to have to look at both the size of that facility and the   assets that we are thinking about—particularly the CMBS market that was alluded to  It is   designed to deal primarily with original issuers of these securities  Another question that is   similar to the problem asset—for holders of those securities, you could have a TALF-like   program that deals with people who are holding those assets rather than issuing those assets    That gets more at the financial institutions’ issues rather than at the issuers’ issues, but I think   that is another program that we should at least think about as an alternative  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   Just very quickly, in terms of the allocation, housing is an interest-  sensitive component of GDP Every time we change interest rates, we are in effect going to have   an impact on housing, and it is going to be disproportionately borne by housing than other   sectors of the economy because of its interest-sensitivity  I view what we are doing with the   MBS and GSEs as dealing with the one area that we can actually change  I think it is going to   have a much bigger effect  In the Greenbook charts that we will be looking at tomorrow, if we           January 27–28, 2009 68 of 267  had a fed funds rate that we could lower, I do not doubt that we would be lowering the fed funds   rate if we had that possibility We don’t have that possibility  So we have to look to an   alternative asset Where is the biggest bang for the buck?  It’s probably in housing right now   Yes As I said yesterday, I talked to the money market funds    They do think that the backup facility, while they hope they don’t have to use it, has been serving   a different purpose from some of the other facilities  There is some concern that, if we were to   announce the closure, we would get inundated with asset-backed commercial paper right before   we closed down the facility And the money market funds would have to do other things to try to        January 27–28, 2009 116 of 267  remain more liquid, so we might create issues that we are not trying to create at this time  So I   would be in favor of extending it   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed   forecast has the unemployment rate well above the NAIRU and the inflation rate uncomfortably   low throughout the forecast period  Because our view is that inflation is more sensitive to   significant excess capacity, our forecast implies an even greater risk of deflation than the   Greenbook’s forecast Even with the substantial fiscal stimulus and recent monetary policy   actions done to date, our outlook implies that it will take more than five years to return to full   employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent or more   Housing continues to be a key component of the problems  Falling housing prices reduce   the wealth of consumers, contribute to problems at financial institutions, and provide little   incentive for residential investment to improve and so are a significant contributing factor to our   dire outlook  Until housing starts stabilize, I am skeptical that equity prices will show the   improvement embedded in the Greenbook forecast  The rising unemployment rate will be   placing further pressure on housing but will also be a contributing factor in weakening   commercial real estate, which a number of people around the table have highlighted    Commercial real estate has held up better in some locations, such as Boston, but even those   locations are beginning to soften With little credit available and vacancy rates climbing, my   contacts with real estate developers have become increasingly depressing  In Boston,   commercial real estate has also been buoyed by building by hospitals, colleges, and universities         January 27–28, 2009 142 of 267  However, losses experienced in endowments have caused the construction to be halted unless it   was fully funded and already started   Banking continues to be stressed Large banks are experiencing large losses in their   investment portfolios as highly-rated securities continue to sell at very steep discounts, if they   sell at all They are also likely to experience substantial increases in loan-loss reserves, which   appear to be lagging the problems  The economy and financial markets remain susceptible to   further bad news emanating from the banks  Despite monetary and fiscal actions taken or likely   to be taken soon, our forecast indicates that, without more-significant actions, unemployment   rates will remain too high and inflation will remain too low for an uncomfortably long period of   time   Regarding the long-term projections, I do support publishing those  I would note, as   President Pianalto did, that there does seem to be an increase as to where people are targeting   inflation It might be good to update some of the staff work that was done on what the   probability of hitting the zero lower bound is and what the probability of deflation is  It does   seem that our targets have been somewhat based on taste rather than focusing on the tails of the   distribution I think we have learned something about the tails of the distribution, and it might   lead to a more informed discussion if we discussed in more depth what the probability is now   that we have had some recent evidence of those two outcomes  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I prefer alternative A The current   outlook envisions an inflation rate below 2 percent throughout the forecast period  We have   judgmentally adjusted our inflation forecast upward relative to the straight model outlook  Thus,   our forecast entails a significant risk of deflation occurring in 2010 unless additional actions are   taken I see little harm in expanding our program of purchases of mortgage-backed securities   and GSE securities to lower mortgage rates further  While this alone is unlikely to be sufficient,   it will help stabilize housing and the financial sector  I would prefer this policy to purchasing   long-term Treasury securities  Rates on long-term Treasury securities remain quite low as many   investors prefer to hold government securities of all maturities  Trying to reduce the spreads           January 27–28, 2009 172 of 267  relative to Treasuries is likely to be more effective as it more directly attacks the elevated   borrowing costs   I would note that, in our own projections over the three-year period, not a single one of us   had an unemployment rate back below 5½ percent, and I would note that only one of us thought   that we would get to 2 percent if that was our inflation goal over the three-year period  The   difference between alternative A and alternative B is whether we say we might do something   versus doing something  It does seem that, if all of us think that we are not going to get to where   we want to go within three years, this would be the time to actually do something  Thank you,   Mr Chairman   I just want to make an observation that, if we are going to have the   economic projections come out at the same time, the public doesn’t read the Greenbook, but it   does look at our projections Between now and October the inflation forecast will dramatically   change If we are doing the long-run projections at the same time, the biggest bar is going to be   at 2 percent, and our forecast is going to say that virtually none of us thinks we will get there in   three years So in terms of being factually accurate, we should at least think about the   implications of our economic projections coming out at the same time   I wonder if we should have two-day meetings until we get into a   more status quo situation Rather than shortening the meetings, I think it was actually quite   productive to have the discussion  We might want to think about whether two-day meetings,   until we get more clarity as to what policy should be going forward, would be helpful    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the swap lines, I do think that we   could put in the minutes that it’s basically procedural—it’s symmetric with what other foreign   central banks have done with us I would argue for being transparent  We need to be prepared   for foreign funding problems, and I think it just makes sense to be clear on it   In terms of the resolution of holding companies, which ties into the foreign swap lines, I   think that’s as important an issue as the Fed bills, and I think trying to find a way to push   resolution makes sense  If you could argue that, if we had the resolution powers now we could   be doing much more effective things with AIG, there may be a hook to actually move things   along more quickly  I don’t know where our thinking is, but I see this as a chance to try to push   that, particularly if it would give us an opportunity to abrogate contracts in the event that we or   somebody else had resolution power  But I think we should try to move that just as quickly as   the Fed bills   In terms of the removal of problem assets, I agree that’s a critical component  I strongly   agree that we shouldn’t be doing ring-fencing institution by institution, so I’m glad we’re   moving away from that strategy  I think the first-best solution would be more aggressive   write-downs of assets, creating a bad bank for the most troubled banks  I think it’s a much more   straightforward solution, and I realize that it does mean much more capital for some banks   because we will be taking aggressive action  But I think that, just as we shouldn’t have banks   deferring losses, we, as the central bank and the Treasury, shouldn’t defer losses if they’re really   on the balance sheet The first-best solution, I think, is to try to work with the bad bank solution   The TALF for problem legacy assets—I think we shouldn’t make these programs   particularly voluntary If we’re going in and forcing write-downs, and the write-downs are fairly   significant, the banks are going to want to participate in the program, because they will have           March 17–18, 2009 77 of 266  already taken the losses So, instead of trying to make it voluntary, I think we should have the   write-downs be severe enough that they’re going to want to get the assets off their balance sheets   because they’ve already taken the losses and they’re not trying to defer additional losses    Thinking about how we can have a supervisory strategy that guarantees that outcome might   make it much easier than hoping that people volunteer their portfolios  To the extent that we can   do that, that would be my preferred option   In terms of the policy, I think this is the time to be very aggressive  I strongly prefer   option A in the Bluebook, or possibly even a little bit larger, as Vice Chairman Dudley has   suggested—I’d be open to that as well  We’re far from reaching either element of the dual   mandate over the forecast horizon  This is the time to push rates down  We have a new program   from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that’s going to include refinancing  The refinancing involves   paying closing costs Now is the time to push the rates down, so that the people who are   refinancing and participate in that program only have to pay the closing costs one time  It will   also square us with some of the other issues in terms of encouraging servicers to come up with   solutions It’s also spring—the right time for the housing sector, and we do need the housing   sector to start bottoming out, getting people back into the market  If we push rates down   significantly right now, I think many people will start coming off the sidelines, because even if   they don’t think prices have hit bottom, they will probably think interest rates are at an all-time   low and they may want to take advantage of that  So I think it’s a very good time to be doing   that   I do have concerns that the TALF is off to a slow start  When I talk to hedge funds,   they’re quite skeptical about how successful that program is going to be  We’ve been kind of   relying on that as possibly being a successful policy tool  Because I’m a little more skeptical        March 17–18, 2009 78 of 266  about either the TALF or the public–private fund working, it calls all the more for more   aggressive policy, which is embedded in option A  So I think option A, which has both the   Treasuries and the mortgage-backed securities, is the way to go   Thank you, Mr Chairman  We are more than a year into this   recession, and yet the decline in GDP and deterioration in labor markets continue unabated and,   indeed, continue to surprise on the downside While I’m hopeful that our actions and the fiscal   stimulus package will help to stabilize the economy in the second half of the year, the downside   risks to our forecast remain my primary concern  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed forecast   expects that the unemployment rate will remain well above full employment, and inflation will   remain well below my target throughout the forecast horizon  Indeed, the Boston Fed forecast   implies a high probability of a deflationary period if aggressive action is not taken   Concerns with credit availability continue to be a dominant theme when I talk to   businesses of all sizes Lenders are looking for opportunities to tighten terms of lending   agreements, and rollover of financing agreements remains problematic  In anticipation of   continuing financing difficulties, firms report that they are restricting operations  Even   organizations that normally would build through a downturn, such as hospitals and major   universities, have halted projects, leaving holes and half-finished buildings at many construction   sites in Boston   I see several worrisome near-term concerns that are likely to impede more-normal   financial market functioning  First, once we have reworked the initial submissions of the stress                 March 17–18, 2009 129 of 266  tests, the results for several major banks are unlikely to be consistent with public   pronouncements by some major banks that additional capital is not necessary  As our baseline   forecast is quickly converging to the stress scenario used in the exercise, there is a real risk of   loss of public credibility as it becomes apparent that some large banks will need substantially   more capital, which in the current environment can only be supplied by the government  I am   concerned that stock prices and credit markets may suffer additional setbacks and make some of   our forecasts for the stock market going forward a little more problematic   Second, the delays in removing problem assets will continue to cast a shadow on many   asset prices We may need to move to simpler, more straightforward solutions for removal of   problem assets, possibly in conjunction with the additional equity infusions at the end of the   stress tests   Third, like President Lockhart, I’m very worried about the commercial real estate sector,   which is rapidly deteriorating Neither the CMBS market nor banks are likely to provide much   support for the rollover of commercial real estate financing  And I’m increasingly concerned   about life insurance companies, which have traditionally been significant investors in   commercial real estate, as share prices of the major publicly held life insurers are now for the   most part selling at less than one-fifth of what they were six months ago, likely resulting in a   limited financial capacity to provide commercial real estate financing  In addition, the decline in   commercial real estate prices is putting many commercial properties under water, adding to   financing constraints While we normally do not consider life insurers to be a source of systemic   concerns that would have significant impacts on markets, that assumption may be tested over the   course of this year        March 17–18, 2009 130 of 266  Finally, stabilizing the housing sector is critically important  While a small component of   GDP, the impact of housing problems has been disproportionate to its weight in GDP  Declines   in housing prices continue to limit borrowing capacity for households, cause large losses in   household wealth that slow future consumption, and contribute to the significant losses   embedded in mortgage instruments and related derivative products for a variety of financial   intermediaries  While recently announced federal programs should help, those programs may   not fully reflect the new reality that job losses are likely to be the primary reason that borrowers   cannot make payments  We held a mortgage foreclosure event in Hartford, Connecticut last   month, attended by roughly 900 borrowers Discussions with the borrowers at the event, and   subsequent survey results, indicate that job losses among one or more family members were   already a key driver in pushing borrowers to foreclosure  Taking aggressive action to stabilize   housing and employment may be particularly important at this juncture  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   Yes, just a clarification  It would seem that, if the goal is to push   rates down and cause a wave of refinancing, then we’d want to be doing the bulk of the   purchasing during the period where the refinancing would occur, which presumably would be   over the next quarter If everybody refinances over the next quarter or two, the ability to   purchase new mortgages in the second half of the year would probably be pretty limited, if we’re   actually successful in doing it It does seem that the goal is not to have an even flow over the            March 17–18, 2009 175 of 266  course of the year, but to enable rates to get low enough that we facilitate a wave of refinancings   and new home purchases  So I think it would be good if we can provide some clarification that   the goal is not to spread it out, but to push the rates down and get the refinancings going, which   would imply front-loading, assuming the program is successful   I wouldn’t want to be constrained to do only a limited amount and   have the refinancings cause rates not to go down very much   Right If it’s appropriate, I’d rather do it sooner than later  I want   to get as much bang for the buck in the next two quarters as we can   This was the most depressing go-round in a year and a half, and   this was a really bad year and a half, so it highlights that we’re far away from where we want to   be, both in inflation and in unemployment  And in terms of communicating with the public, I   think that’s what we’re communicating to the public  We’re not where we want to be, and we   want to get there as quickly as we can   I don’t think simple rules on the balance sheet or the monetary base are appropriate    These are different programs for different problems  If the interbank market is disrupted, I   would expect swaps and TAF to go up If we have a real problem in other areas, I’d want to do   significant asset purchases  These are not substitutes, and just having either a balance sheet or a   monetary base rule is assuming that these programs are substitutes for each other  They’re   dealing with different problems   I think this is an opportune time to push down rates as significantly as we can  I think we   should be very aggressive I think everybody’s discussion around the table indicated we should   be aggressive I like the idea of heavily weighting on MBS purchases; I think that will be the   most effective I also like the idea that, if we’re going to try to get the most bang for the buck,   given that these are experimental programs, we ought to try at least to see what happens with the   Treasuries as well So my preference would be to do the combination of A and B, which is the   $115 trillion total, to try to have as big an effect as possible  And I would try to front-load it so   we get as much impact in the spring as we can  Thank you    I have a question on the mortgage-backed-security purchase   program, in particular looking at figure 13 and figure 14  Figure 13 shows that the mortgage   rates have come down as you discussed, and what’s striking to me is that it looks as though we   accounted for roughly 80 percent of the issuance of mortgage-backed securities over the first   four months of the year  If we had been willing to buy 100 percent of the issuance, I assume that   we would have been a price setter in that market and we would have had the ability to push rates   even further down So my question is, (A) Is that accurate, and (B) if our guidance to the Desk   was to try to get the retail rate between 4 and 4¼ percent, do you think we would be able to do   that for the new issuance?  As you’ve highlighted, we account for most of the coupon purchases   between 4 and 5 percent So if, instead, we had instructions that we’re really intending to try to   get that rate down, would you be able to hit it?   What does “wipe out” mean?  Does “wipe out” mean that they   leave the market temporarily and come back in once rates go back up, (if they go back up)?  It’s   not a wipe-out financially; it is just that they are not active in the market              April 28–29, 2009 15 of 201  Just to follow up one more time  If we had given instructions that   our goal was to try to get the retail rate between 4 and 4¼ percent, which is what some of the   projections had indicated we might get to, how much more do you think you would have had to   purchase to achieve that goal?  And would it have had the undesirable effects that you were   talking about?   There have been some initial signs that the recession may be   approaching a trough  It is too soon to tell whether the trough of the recession has truly been   reached Whenever we do reach the trough, the economic recovery is likely to be anemic    Consumers have experienced significant wealth loss despite the rebound in the stock market   since March, and consumption is likely to be restrained by further job losses  The rising fraction   of homeowners who find themselves underwater makes it difficult for them to move around, and   unless job prospects improve, they are going to have a difficult time moving  These continued   constraints in the recovery have influenced my forecast for the economy  I expect   unemployment to peak somewhat higher than in the Greenbook and improvements in the labor   market to be more gradual than in the Greenbook  The significant slack in the labor markets will   continue to place a lot of downward pressure on inflation, and there remains a significant risk   that deflation will not be avoided   I continue to believe that the risks around this outlook remain on the downside  My   primary concerns are that the reaction to the stress test is unpredictable  Contacts through the   AMLF have noted that they are concerned that the stress test could lead to downgrades in asset-  backed commercial paper to below the A1/P1, rendering them ineligible for the AMLF program    In addition, they note that money market funds have been more transparent with their public   holdings so that there could be another surge in redemptions for money market funds that hold           April 28–29, 2009 48 of 201  paper and for banks that perform poorly on the stress test  Second, I have my own concerns   about the results of the stress test President Evans’s question highlighted that institutions   undergoing the stress test may behave more as if they are capital constrained than they would in   the absence of the stress test I share that concern  I think there is a very strong desire right now   to avoid government capital infusions, and that desire seems to only be growing   Even banks that do not have the mandatory convertible preferred (MCP) are likely to be   affected Banks outside the 19 banks undergoing the stress test will pursue the same   conservative asset-producing strategies, concerned that the same criteria might be applied to   them  Among the 19 that will not need the MCP, it may be rational to slow their own organic   growth so that they can take advantage of asset sales or acquisition opportunities  If I am right   and the structure of the stress-test program discourages the expansion of lending, all business   lending, particularly commercial real estate lending, could be adversely affected  Contacts with   insurance firms note that insurance regulators have not made clear how they will react to FASB   rules on valuing illiquid assets This uncertainty may cause insurance companies to further   shrink their balance sheets at the same time that banks are doing the same thing  Thus, although   there have been some positive signs on the economy since the last FOMC meeting, I remain   concerned that the financial headwinds may not have abated yet  Thank you, Mr Chairman   The same logic could apply to mortgage-backed securities, though,   because you could do 3-, 5-, and 7-year mortgage-backed securities, and that has the opposite   story Those would not be as deep, and so you might have a bigger impact if you did the shorter   maturities  Unlike changing the maturity on the Treasuries, arguably you’d have a bigger impact   if you changed the maturities and bought ARMs rather than the 15- and 30-year fixed  That’s   also something that might be worth thinking about because the ARM rates haven’t come down              April 28–29, 2009 124 of 201  very much  So if you’re looking at a 30-year fixed, a 15-year fixed, and a 7-year ARM, the   7-year ARM hasn’t moved all that much, for example   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had hoped that the actions taken at the   last meeting would have had a larger impact on long-term rates, particularly the 30-year fixed   mortgage rate Our rates may fall further as the backlogs at mortgage brokers subside  I’d like   to encourage the Desk to consider what additional institutional feature might facilitate pushing   mortgage rates down further faster using markets in which we don’t have much experience  As   Trish highlighted in yesterday’s discussion, there are a number of things that we don’t directly   affect, but we may be able to affect them indirectly  In fact, that may be more efficient than   increasing purchases—to think about some of those institutional features and whether we can   help adjust them   In terms of the policy options, I prefer alternative B  I’d like to understand better the   effect of existing programs before deciding what additional actions are necessary  If our   mortgage-backed-security purchase program is successful in significantly lowering mortgage   rates, that may have the stimulative effect we desire  However, even if that program is   successful, the Bluebook simulations as well as those done by my staff make it clear that the   optimal policy simulation would indicate that further actions are necessary  Like President         April 28–29, 2009 137 of 201  Yellen’s, my forecast remains far from the goal for either inflation or unemployment  So the   question for me is, What is the most effective way to try to get closer to achieving those goals?   It’s not clear to me right now what the most effective use of our balance sheet is if the goal is to   reduce borrowing costs to consumers and businesses  I’m a little uncertain whether that’s   through more large Treasury purchases, whether that’s more actions in the TALF, or whether   that’s doing something different in the mortgage market  Thinking that through might be more   useful than expanding our balance sheet further at this time  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Trish, can you talk a bit about the mortgage-backed security   ARMs?  In particular, you mentioned that the Desk was going to look at the three-, five-, and   seven-year ARMs So given that the long end has moved up so much, is there anything you are   thinking of doing with the mortgage ARMs?    I have a question for Brian and Trish about your figure 5 on the   large-scale asset purchases  It’s interesting what a straight line that is  Over the last six months,   obviously, the economic forecast has changed—interest rates have moved, financial conditions   have changed—and yet our program has been invariant to all of those changes  So my first   question is whether you think that you’re restricted from being able to do anything other than a   straight line program  I thought you had more flexibility, but I want to get your sense of whether   you have the flexibility currently to be able to vary the amount that you’re purchasing or not  I   would say that, in talking to people in the financial community in Boston, one of the surprises   was that the purchase program was invariant to the rise in interest rates that we’ve recently   experienced, which certainly sent quite a message  Did you debate whether you had the        June 23–24, 2009 33 of 261  flexibility to do anything to, in effect, resist some of that increase, both in the Treasuries and the   mortgage-backed securities?   Well, we could always reload  So there is an option   We do have a long tradition of leaning against the wind, and this   program seems not to be very interested in leaning against the wind  I thought you had enough   flexibility to do that Personally I would hope that you would have the flexibility to do that and   that we might do a little bit more of it   In terms of your hybrid, I think it’s a very good proposal  You did note it’s a very small   part of the market, and, looking at data from McDash confirms that it’s an extremely small part   of the market  That is a part of the market where, if we wanted to push rates down more   aggressively, we could do so with relatively low costs  It seems that $1¼ trillion in mortgages is   a lot to support market functioning  So I actually have a broader goal than market functioning,   which is to get the cost of housing down for people who might want to purchase houses   If we’re worried about market functioning in the 15- and 30-year area, it does seem that   the 5- and 7-year area is one where there’s virtually no activity now; earlier this decade you   could get a 7-year ARM for 4½ percent, no points, no closing costs  We haven’t hit anything   close to that in this period  Given where the economy is, I don’t quite understand why those   ARMs haven’t come down and why they’re not priced more favorably  It may be reputational   effects from the subprime market  There might be a reason to stay away from 3-year ARMs,   because the “3-27” has some connotations  The 5-year and 7-year ARMs have the advantage of           June 23–24, 2009 36 of 261  being longer term while still meeting some of our balance sheet issues  So you might want to   give some thought to the politics of the choice between 3-year and 5- or 7-year  But it would   seem with the 5- or 7-year, we could lean against the wind and actually do more—we could   actually try to push the rate low enough so that, if the 30-year mortgage were very high because   of what was happening in the Treasuries, it would actually encourage housing purchases in that   market without changing the magnitude of what you’re doing  So I would like you to have a lot   more flexibility to do that and possibly to push those rates down more aggressively than we’ve   been willing to do with the 15- and 30-year rates   I agree with Brian’s recommendations  In terms of the TAF option   of raising the minimum bid rate, I come out where Governor Kohn does  There are several large   institutions that are borrowing heavily from the TAF that are just holding them as excess   reserves I think having a 10 basis point charge and making it a little bit costly actually does   make sense; it will probably bring down the TAF borrowing somewhat, which, given the size of   our balance sheet, probably also makes sense   In terms of the tools for exit, I agree with virtually everything that President Yellen said,   so I’m not going to repeat it    In terms of the asset purchase strategy, we don’t need to buy $1¼ trillion just for market   function and liquidity in mortgage-backed securities  We weren’t trying to set interest rates, but   we were certainly trying to influence interest rates  There’s no reason to do something of that   magnitude unless we’re going to influence interest rates  So I do think that there’s still a little bit   of difference around the table about exactly what we think these programs are intended to do    But we made a distinction between quantitative easing and the asset side of the balance sheet    To me, that meant that we’re trying to get the financing costs lower  It’s hard to break this out   from the discussion for tomorrow  But if we’re not happy with where we are on our dual   mandate, this is the only tool we have  And the way it operates has to be through the cost of   financing So, it’s a topic for discussion for tomorrow, but I think we have to make that link    We can’t talk about it separately   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed   forecast now expects that we will reach an unemployment rate of 10 percent  Unfortunately, this   statistic probably understates the degree of weakness in labor markets  In discussion with small   and medium-sized businesses in New England, it is striking how many firms have placed   workers on part-time schedules and how many firms have reported reducing nominal wages to   avoid further job cuts If New England’s firms are representative of the wider economy, these   practices may have implications for the recovery  First, firms are likely to defer hiring not only   until they are confident that the recovery has firmly taken root, but also until they have restored   hours to those workers whose hours they have already reduced  Second, wage pressures on   inflation are likely to continue to be subdued, as firms in weak sectors of the economy defer   wage increases until demand for their products increases   In my forecast, the recovery is quite restrained, making it unlikely that we reach full   employment during the forecast horizon  The recovery will be slower if mortgage rates do not   encourage buyers back into the market  While the 30-year mortgage rates have come down   somewhat from the recent spike, they remain well above the rates earlier this spring  Not           June 23–24, 2009 129 of 261  surprisingly, loan applications have slowed, and Realtors report diminished foot traffic after the   rates increased  But higher rates may slow the recovery even further  Higher rates will likely   put downward pressure on housing prices  This, in turn, will further diminish household wealth,   reducing consumption as households seek to recover from already large wealth losses  In   addition, lower house prices will likely add to the many households who struggle with the   potential of home foreclosure  As I discussed briefly yesterday, an interesting aspect of the   mortgage market during this recession is that five- and seven-year ARMs are not priced as   attractively as they were earlier in this decade  If longer-term mortgage rates remain high,   improved pricing of longer-term ARMs does have the potential to bring some borrowers back   into the market   While financial markets have improved, they remain fragile  The municipal bond market   could still be roiled by the lack of political will by some states and municipalities to address their   financial problems  Bank lending could be affected if commercial real estate and consumer   loans continue to deteriorate, forcing higher loan loss reserves, which, for many banks, are still   moving slowly relative to the growth of nonperforming loans  While the securitization market   appears to have improved somewhat as a result of the TALF, it is unclear how the eventual   removal of TALF financing and the possible legislation on securitization are likely to affect the   recovery in this market   Overall, my forecast is not much different from the last FOMC meeting, and, frankly, that   forecast implies uncomfortable outcomes for both unemployment and inflation  Higher   mortgage rates have caused me to push out the housing recovery, and the recent labor report has   raised my path of unemployment  Many banks remain capital constrained, and I expect many   more to be constrained as they need to increase loan loss reserves  Thus, I place a low           June 23–24, 2009 130 of 261  probability on rapid expansion of bank lending over the next two years  Even by the end of   2011, I expect that the unemployment rate will be well above full employment and inflation will   be well below my target  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The forecast has high unemployment   rates and low inflation rates through 2011, and the Greenbook forecast expects an undesirably   low inflation rate even at the end of 2013 Missing both elements of the dual mandate through   2011 and possibly beyond strongly suggests to me that we should attempt to provide more           June 23–24, 2009 180 of 261  stimulus both to avoid a multiyear elevated unemployment rate and to avoid a prolonged period   of lower than desired inflation   Mortgage and Treasury rates have risen despite our large-scale asset purchase program    The increase in Treasury rates likely reflects the reduced precautionary demand for that asset as   financial markets have improved  However, the increase in mortgage rates is likely to slow both   residential investment and consumption relative to what they would be if we were pushing rates   lower There has been a reluctance to intervene more aggressively in the thirty-year mortgage   market because it is felt that this would disrupt market functioning  But if our LSAPs cannot   produce mortgage rates that are low enough to spur refinancing and new construction, then we   have dramatically expanded our balance sheet with little to show for it   I believe we can and should do more  While I support alternative B, I would encourage   the Desk to further reduce mortgage rates relative to Treasury rates  Furthermore, since the   market for five- and seven-year ARMs is already quite limited, aggressive activity in ARMs   would restore the market and provide a low-cost alternative for some homebuyers willing to float   after five or seven years  Because of the lack of activity, setting a low rate in this market and   increasing volume would not disrupt market functioning  In fact, it would resuscitate the market    These ARMs also have some appeal for our balance sheet since they mature relatively quickly,   making the exit strategy easier for these assets  Acting more aggressively to restore the ARM   market and to further reduce the spread relative to Treasuries for longer-maturity mortgages   seem like appropriate steps to gain greater confidence that we will achieve both elements of our   dual mandate within a reasonable time horizon   I would emphasize that the experience of the past seven years has taught us that   conducting monetary policy in a very low-inflation environment is not as straightforward as we        June 23–24, 2009 181 of 261  might have wished  At some point, we should have a fuller discussion of our inflation goal in   light of the probability of reaching the zero lower bound in the future and the difficulty in   conducting monetary policy when we are at the zero bound   In terms of what’s in the statement, I actually would not be for having the final sentence    We have not been communicating the path of the LSAP program  I think we can taper as   appropriate without necessarily having to discuss how we’re going to taper it  I do prefer   President Yellen’s language—I do think it’s appropriate to mention the rise in rates, because it   has been quite appreciable, and it has been probably the biggest news that we’ve had in the last   month in terms of what has been going on in the financial markets  Thank you    Just in terms of the credit quality, if you look at the 5-, the 7-, and   the 10-year, the credit scores for those are appreciably better than they are for the 30-year and the   15-year products actually So following up on the Chairman’s comment, I think that, if you   focused on the 5, 7, and 10 rather than the 1 and 3, you have a very different risk profile, and it   actually does tend to match up with the duration that many people plan on staying in their   house—5, 7, or 10 years—rather than 30 years, which also has that advantage  So it would   recommend potentially thinking about starting with the 5, 7, and 10 rather than focusing on the   3and the 1, which have a different historical experience with default rates   My observation on credit scores was based on the historical data   that includes the last recession As you can see from the charts, in the last recession, the rates   were substantially lower than they are now   Well, it was a different recession  I’m just saying that the   observation on credit scores was based on a period in which actually we weren’t intervening and   that was a recession I think it is an open question as to who would take advantage of the   program, but right now it looks as if the spreads are outsized relative to what they have been   historically So you might argue that some people who would prefer a five-year or a seven-year   product now don’t have a product that’s functioning in the way that it has historically   Thank you, Mr Chairman  My question is for Chris, and my   question is this Potentially we are going to be doing reverse repos both in large magnitudes and   for extended periods of time  Do you have any concern with having only two clearing banks that   are central to that role?  And are there ways that we can either increase the competition or spread   out the number of entities that can help with that infrastructure?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data since the last meeting have   been broadly consistent with what we expected in our June forecast  We have received   confirmation that the economy has improved significantly from the sharp declines in the first   quarter Economic growth in the second half of 2009 is likely to be positive, albeit too slow to   prevent further job losses Our forecast still expects a weak recovery as the balance sheets of   consumers, businesses, and banks slowly improve  The improvement is, of course, contingent on   no significant adverse shocks appearing over the next year  It also assumes that households and   businesses will increase spending, as the stimulus provided by the variety of fiscal and monetary   programs subsides—a component of the forecast that remains quite tentative at this point        August 11–12, 2009 70 of 165  That the rate of decline in payroll employment in July was much slower than earlier in   the year is welcome news  However, the unemployment rate is quite high and is likely to remain   quite elevated for several more years  With many workers on reduced hours and much of the   labor force still concerned about their job prospects, workers are accepting much lower growth in   wages and benefits Models run by economists in my research department that estimate inflation   as a markup over labor costs, as well as many specifications of traditional Phillips curves used to   forecast inflation, imply outcomes closer to the disinflation scenario in the Greenbook  Thus,   there is a significant downside risk to the baseline forecast to inflation   Significant impediments to the recovery, of which I will highlight just two, also remain    Until recently, most complaints by businesses in New England regarding credit availability were   from customers of large, out-of-region banks that needed TARP capital  However, there are   increasing complaints that small and medium-sized banks are now behaving as if they are capital   constrained, despite New England’s smaller exposure to the real estate and auto-related problems   that plague many other parts of the country  The problem appears particularly acute for   commercial real estate Part 2 of the Greenbook characterizes commercial real estate as dismal    Most of my contacts are using much more colorful language  Problems with commercial real   estate look likely to get worse, and many banks’ loan loss reserves already lag with the growth in   nonperforming loans   Tight credit conditions are likely to make it difficult for businesses and households to   finance spending critical for the recovery  A second potential concern is the unintended   consequences of some of the remedies to recent problems  One example is money market   mutual funds, which have experienced declines in assets as investors have increased their risk   appetite, as Brian highlighted At the same time, the SEC is considering measures that would           August 11–12, 2009 71 of 165  reduce the risk of mutual funds, including potentially prohibiting purchases of asset-backed   commercial paper and A2/P2 commercial paper and reducing the weighted average maturity of   holdings While reducing the risk of mutual funds is desirable, if poorly implemented it could   disrupt asset markets where mutual funds have been key players  Although I am cautiously   optimistic that the recovery is beginning, the situation remains quite fragile  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The baseline forecast has inflation too   low and unemployment too high for the next several years  Such a forecast would almost surely   imply further easing, if we had not hit the zero bound  The asset-purchase program has probably   helped stabilize markets and lowered key interest rates compared with what they would have   been without the purchases However, the amount of macroeconomic stimulus produced to date   by our large asset purchases has been smaller than I expected  In part, our implementation   continues to favor market functioning over the broader macroeconomic goals of pushing rates   down more aggressively to more rapidly achieve desired macroeconomic outcomes  Given   current implementation strategies, I prefer alternative B (revised), though I remain concerned   about the pace of a likely recovery and would favor more-aggressive measures if the economy   were to falter or the risk of significant disinflation were to increase  Thank you, Mr Chairman    My question follows along the same lines; again, it’s to Jim  In thinking   about the term deposit facility, could we use the term auction facility apparatus to do the term deposit   facility, because one way of thinking about the term deposit is as a reverse discount window loan, right?    We already have an apparatus that has an auction for loans, so if we were going to use an auction format   for deposits instead, it would seem like we already have an apparatus to do it, and it would deal with some   of the questions about the permanence of the TAF, if it could go either way during times when we wanted                                                         September 22–23, 2009 31 of 212  either to push out a lot of reserves or pull in a lot of reserves So, when you’re thinking about the term   deposit facility, are you thinking about it as being something like the term auction facility, or is it a very   different structure?    Conceptually, that seems much easier than depending on the primary dealer   system, if what we wanted to do was pull out a lot of reserves   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data since the last   meeting give us more confidence that the economy is now recovering from the recession and the   second half of this year will have positive economic growth  But I expect near-term growth to be   insufficient to make much progress on the very weak labor markets  Most heartening have been   clear signals we’re receiving indicating a bottoming out in housing markets  Like many markets,           September 22–23, 2009 84 of 212  Boston has seen some increases in housing pricing, particularly for homes that are attractive to   buyers looking to use the government’s first-time homebuyer tax credit   The disinflation that the Greenbook has been forecasting is being borne out by the data    Core PCE inflation for the past year is 14 percent, significantly below the previous year and well   below where most of us expect the inflation rate to settle in the longer run  According to the   Survey of Professional Forecasters, the mean probability that the core PCE inflation is below   1½ percent in 2010 is 50 percent, with only a 12 percent mean probability attached to a core PCE   inflation exceeding 24 percent While some market analysts cite the expansion of the Federal   Reserve balance sheet as being inflationary, I do not believe that this poses much of a short-run   risk While we do not have recent historical experience in the United States with the effect of   rapid growth in the central bank balance sheet, the experience in Japan is instructive  Even with   their substantial quantitative easing program, the Bank of Japan has been fighting deflation rather   than inflation for the past decade  Despite the rapid growth in bank reserves in Japan, the   banking system was shrinking as banks reduced lending to satisfy capital constraints  It seems   unlikely that the expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet will have near-term inflationary   implications for reasons similar to those in Japan  Despite the buildup in US bank reserves,   bank lending remains constrained and is likely to be capital constrained for some time  Thus,   like the Greenbook, I expect that lower labor costs and the substantial slack in the economy will   continue to generate disinflation, and, thus, over the next two years, we will likely be moving   further below my inflation target of 2 percent    Discussions with bankers in New England are consistent with the data showing   continuing significant declines in lending  Their biggest concern is with commercial real estate   loans, where falling prices are making banks increasingly reluctant to lend  One very large           September 22–23, 2009 85 of 212  builder highlighted the fact that, although construction costs and the costs of labor have declined,   those cost reductions have not kept pace with the fall in prices of existing buildings  Bankers are   concerned with how commercial real estate loans will be treated at their next exam  The   mounting commercial real estate problems, along with nonperforming loans that are growing   faster than reserves at many banks, make it increasingly unlikely that we will see much   improvement in credit availability from banks in the coming year   While the real economy is improving, the robustness of private-sector growth once the   government programs wind down is still uncertain and poses additional downside risk  More   importantly, the unemployment rate is likely to remain uncomfortably high and inflation well   below my target for the next several years  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B The Greenbook   forecasts disinflation and high unemployment rates over the next two years  I agree with this   forecast These outcomes occur with an assumption that the federal funds rate will remain at   exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time, so I am very comfortable continuing to   say that in the statement     September 22–23, 2009 144 of 212  In terms of the LSAP program, we should purchase the entire $1¼ trillion in mortgage-  backed securities We should also taper the program, though I would prefer to leave the   completion date flexible depending on market conditions  I have a strong preference not to end   the program prematurely   I agree with Presidents Evans and Yeltsin—Yellen—[Laughter]   Continuing with my statement, that persistently high   unemployment is likely to result in low and falling inflation  This suggests that we will need to   maintain an accommodative stance for some time to come  We have only tentative signs of a   recovery at this point, and we should not take actions that risk reversing these initial positive   signs   I, too, have a couple of comments on the language  I would remove “up to” for two   reasons Not completing the $1¼ trillion purchase will signal that we are content with the path   where inflation is below my target and the unemployment rate is above my target through the   forecast horizon  I do not want to send such a signal  Second, housing is improving  However,   the first-time homebuyer tax incentive is ending at the end of November, and I would not want   our support for housing to end at the same time  I would also change the sentence on tapering to   remove the last clause and instead say, “The Committee will gradually slow the pace of its   purchases in order to promote a smooth transition in markets”  This would provide flexibility in   tapering and highlight our goal of ensuring a smooth transition  Thank you, Mr Chairman   I was talking about putting a period after “markets” and taking out   the last clause    Just a quick comment on the unintended consequences of lists    When we came up with the primary dealer list, I don’t think anybody could have guessed that we   would have a primary dealer credit facility  So when I think of coming up with lists of   counterparties, I just worry about the unintended consequences  If we select firms based on size   of institution, it might quickly be inferred that there is a broader reason to have the list   constituted the way we have it So when I think about that, it does seem that Governor Warsh’s   suggestion that, to the extent that we can broaden it but make it manageable for the Desk to do,   we avoid the unintended consequence of making it look like a list that was based on size that   may be misinterpreted for other purposes  I know it is much easier to deal operationally with   fewer counterparties; but just given the perceptions that can be created by that, we might want to   give some thought as to whether there are ways to broaden it so that we don’t give that   misperception   Then the second list is the list of countries  We spend a lot of time thinking about stigma,   and President Yellen and I were talking about this on the elevator coming up  But to the extent   that we could come up with a size criterion that made it very clear that, if a market got to this   size then we would entertain—it’s kind of the opposite  It seems like having a much clearer   criterion One reason all of these other central banks want to be our counterparty is that we are   signaling something  If we have a swap line with Mexico, people are inferring a signal that we   are comfortable having them as a counterparty  I worry about stigmatizing the countries like   Mexico and Korea and other countries that want potentially to be a counterparty in part for the   signaling benefit The way we get around that is if we have a very clear criterion that says, “If   you get to this size, then maybe we will think about having a swap line”  Maybe size isn’t the           November 3–4, 2009 51 of 201  right metric, but coming up with some metric other than country-specific choices would make   me more comfortable with that list as well   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data seem consistent with third-  quarter and fourth-quarter GDP growth averaging roughly 3 percent—a welcome change after   several consecutive quarters of decline  However, although I expect the economy to continue to   recover, it will likely grow much more slowly than previous recoveries I remain particularly   concerned that, as the monetary and fiscal supports subside, there will be insufficient private   spending to make much progress in labor markets  Growth in consumption and housing tend to be   drivers in recoveries, and although both grew in the third quarter, they were supported by a variety   of government programs, which are now in the process of winding down  As a result, I expect that,   by the end of next year, unemployment will not be much lower than its current level, an outcome   quite similar to the Greenbook forecast  I expect that, even by the end of 2012, the unemployment   rate will be well above our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment      The Greenbook assumes that credit conditions will ease, making credit more available for   businesses and households  I am concerned that banking conditions over the next year may well   deteriorate  For many banks, nonperforming loans are rising and rising faster than they are   reserving for problem loans  Thus I expect that capital constraints will not ease over the next year    In fact, they might tighten   Research at the Boston Fed has found that forecasters tend to underpredict unemployment   when the percent of bank assets in banks with a poor CAMELS rating is elevated  Currently, the   percent of bank assets in banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 or worse is high and climbing    Supporting this concern is the decline in lending in the Call Report data, which are continuing to                       November 3–4, 2009 75 of 201  worsen In fact, if one splits the lending between banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 with those   of 3 or worse, the declines in lending are much larger at institutions experiencing problems, in part   because they are likely shrinking to improve their capital ratios   In light of the substantial excess capacity in the economy and given that credit is likely to   remain constrained, I expect a gradual disinflation over the forecast period  The Greenbook forecast   for core CPI and core PCE looks like an annual step function bounded below by 1 percent  My   concern is that the inflation rate may not be bounded by 1 percent, and we may experience more   disinflation than in the Greenbook forecast  In part, this is the result of forecast equations in Boston,   but in part, it reflects the incoming data on wages, salaries, and benefits  The continued decline in   the rate of growth of wages and salaries, especially in the context of rapid productivity growth,   makes it quite unlikely that core inflation will reach my 2 percent target over the forecast period  As   others noted at the last meeting, this outlook represents continued poor outcomes for both aspects of   our dual mandate  I hope, but do not expect, that growth will be faster than most of us forecast    This would at least diminish the length of the other extended period, the period for which   unemployment remains severely elevated   In turn, while we can hope that anchored inflation expectations will keep inflation from   falling more than the Greenbook envisions, even in a protracted period of significant excess   capacity, I am concerned about the risks that expectations will move down or that they will not   sufficiently offset the downward pressure from resource slack  While potential output may have   fallen and the natural rate may have risen as a consequence of the crisis from which we are   emerging, it is difficult to imagine a shift so dramatic as to materially change the size of these   resource gaps  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B and the   language We are seeing some initial signs of recovery, but that recovery is likely to be weak   and subject to reversal  Given that we make little progress on reaching full employment or   2 percent core PCE inflation over the forecast period, even with the funds rate pinned at zero, I   am strongly in favor of retaining the “extended period” language  Given the significantly greater   losses that would be associated with the realization of downside versus upside risks to my   growth outlook, I hope we retain some policy flexibility over the coming months  I can easily   conceive of conditions under which we would need to provide additional stimulus to the   economy   Two additional comments  First, while I am comfortable with the language that has been   added surrounding the agency purchase program, I would say I still am concerned that some will   view that as a policy change So to the extent that we can possibly use informal mechanisms to   reiterate that it is not a policy change, I think that would be advisable  Second, in terms of   communicating policy as we do start shifting to changes, I think we should focus on things that   we know we can influence  So interest on reserves would be where I would be focusing the   statements, at least initially, until we get a better sense of how that works  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Just a question on panel 28 Is the policy rate that they’re talking   about there the fed funds rate or the interest rate on reserves?   So no dealer raised the question of whether you would just move   the interest rate on reserves but not do anything else, for example?   Just to follow up on that point, it seems like you have a huge   inventory, and the market doesn’t know how you are going to dispose of it  Asking the street   about what the interest rate reaction would be—if at every meeting we might potentially dump a   whole lot of it, I would want a huge risk premium before I bought that asset  So, as we think   about asset sales, and different rules for handling them, it seems that if there’s a clear rule, it may   have a different effect on the risk premium than the possibility that every six weeks you may or   may not have a huge inventory dumped onto the market  We haven’t had an experience like this,   so I don’t know how you can measure it empirically But to the extent that the dealer community   has any feel for this, it may be worth getting some sense about interest rates as well as quantities   when you do your survey   Just a question on the primary credit rate  We all have directors   meetings at different times  So if it’s purely a technical adjustment, it might be better to have a   day that we all called our boards of directors at the same time  I’m just a little worried that   somebody might have a directors meeting in the first week of January, and though I know this is   supposed to stay confidential, it might start leaking out  So it just strikes me that it would be   better if we could just say on a certain day you will call your board and everybody talks about it   as being a technical adjustment, if that’s truly what we think it is   Thank you, Mr Chairman  We have had some heartening news   since the last meeting  In particular, the employment report was stronger than most analysts   expected, with the economy losing only 11,000 jobs  However, it is obvious, but still important,   to emphasize that this is still moving in the wrong direction  As the recovery progresses, a good   employment report will be one that adds jobs substantially faster than growth in the labor force,   so we can make significant progress in reducing the unemployment rate and reattaining full   employment   The Greenbook has the unemployment rate at 96 percent at the end of 2010, with an   assumption of no change in the federal funds rate  Unfortunately, my own forecast is quite   similar  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain quite elevated  We need to see a   significant reduction in job loss and a marked increase in hiring if we are going to achieve net   increases in employment that significantly exceed growth in the labor force  Other labor market   trends highlight why the progress is likely to be slow in bringing the unemployment rate down    First, the fraction of employed persons working part-time for economic reasons is nearly at an   all-time high for the series  Second, the workweek of production and non-supervisory workers   remains low relative to non-recessionary periods  With many workers on a reduced workweek,   or involuntarily on part-time work, many businesses will defer hiring new employees until their   existing workforce is more fully utilized  Thus, even if GDP growth exceeds potential, as I   expect it will over the coming quarters, this will likely reduce the unemployment rate only   gradually   Headwinds from the banking sector are also likely to continue to blow strongly  The   percent of bank assets in institutions with low supervisory ratings continues to grow, and bank   failures are artificially being held down by resource constraints at the FDIC  Given the volume              December 15–16, 2009 48 of 247  of problem loans and problem banks, it is probably time to have a Resolution Trust Corporation   to deal with failed bank assets Recovery in commercial real estate will be delayed if the public   and private sectors hold large inventories of problem commercial real estate loans in the hope   that losses will be avoided through forbearance   On the inflation front, there is little evidence of inflationary pressures  A variety of   models used by the Boston Fed expect continued disinflation  For models that depend on   resource slack, the very high unemployment rate relative to any reasonable estimate of full   employment suggests further disinflation  However, recognizing the difficulties in measuring   unemployment and output gaps, we have also examined models that emphasize the role of real   marginal cost  Here, too, one would expect significant disinflation, because real unit labor costs   have been falling dramatically and are currently at a postwar low  With double-digit   unemployment, I don’t expect a quick reversal in real unit labor costs  Furthermore, our model   suggests that, even in the presence of extremely well-anchored inflation expectations, the   downward pull from resource underutilization may well outweigh the stabilizing effect of   anchored expectations   Thus, while the high-frequency data have clearly improved from earlier this year, they   have not changed enough to significantly alter the outlook of an economy with very weak labor   markets and a significant risk of further disinflation  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support alternative B The   Greenbook assumes no change in interest rates through 2010  That is consistent with my own   view of appropriate monetary policy and is consistent with communicating that we expect to   maintain very low rates for an extended period of time  If outcomes are similar to the Greenbook   forecast, removing the “extended period” language is a topic best left for the second half of 2010     Removal of that language is likely to set off a significant change in market interest rates  It will   not be appropriate until private sector growth is on a sustainable path and labor markets have   improved significantly   In terms of exit strategy, selling a portion of our holdings of mortgage-backed securities   should not be done in 2010 if the economy unfolds as envisioned in the Greenbook forecast    Uncertainty about the amount and speed of sales of our very large holdings of mortgage-backed   securities would almost surely drive up the risk premium required by private purchasers of   mortgage-backed securities Conversations with a variety of market participants in Boston   indicate that such sales are not anticipated and would be viewed as a signal that we wanted   mortgage rates much higher, with the potential to dramatically slow a housing sector just   beginning to recover   Should the economy unfold as in the Greenbook forecast, with only gradual improvement   in unemployment and the inflation rate well below 2 percent, I do not believe that we will need           December 15–16, 2009 107 of 247  to raise rates either through increasing the interest rate on reserves or removing reserves from the   system until at least the end of next year  The risks to real side recovery remain significant, and   the costs of the downside risks outweigh the costs associated with any upside risks   I’d like to follow up on the discussion yesterday on the primary credit rate  If we were to   keep the “extended period” language and raise the primary credit rate in January, it may send a   confusing signal to the market  While we would likely want to raise the primary credit rate as   we implement the term deposit facility, I would prefer to raise the primary credit rate closer to   the time we are implementing the facility and possibly in conjunction with removing the   extended period language, which I would hope would not be at the January meeting   I also concur with President Yellen’s comment on the TALF  Thank you, Mr Chairman   I also want to thank each of the presenters for giving very good   presentations Over breakfast, as Jeff alluded to, President Plosser and I had, I thought, a very   useful discussion about models and what was generating our results  I asked him, given where   the output gap was, and given where at least some measures of marginal cost might be, how he     December 15–16, 2009 179 of 247  was getting inflation actually rising  And his answer was, “Well, the driver is really inflation   expectations”   I have one question for each of you It will be quick  Let me posit my questions to each   of you first, and then I will let you all speak  My first question is for Mike  You’ve highlighted   the difficulty with coming up with the output gap, and I think it’s well understood that there are a   lot of ways to calculate the output gap, and there are estimation issues with the output gap  But   when I look at forecasts of inflation—if I look at the Blue Chip, if I look at professional   forecasters, if I look at the dispersion in surveys—I find that the modeling of inflation   expectations by economists isn’t much better than the modeling of output gaps  Gary Stern gave   us the advice that you need a model to beat a model as he was leaving  So we’re not very good   at modeling expectations; it seems like we have much the same problem when modeling the   output gap I’d like you to speak to the alternative, which is, how do we do a good job of   modeling expectations, or what more work needs to be done?   For Mark, my question is that, based on my understanding of at least some of the   international literature, importers tend to price to the US market  If you could just put your   work in the context of that observation, I think that would be useful for me   And for Jeff, in light of Mike’s comments, and his paper, I would be interested in your   views of the implications of the way you model inflation, given the alternative that Mike has laid   out in his paper     Brian, I was wondering if in your survey there was an open   response section in which the dealer community could talk about whether the fed funds rate was   an appropriate policy target when volume is small and GSEs are a significant part of the market    Did anybody venture as part of an open response that they thought that the policy target at least   during this transition period would not be the fed funds target?  And just a second part to that,   when I look at the implied fed funds rate in your chart 7, presumably that is both what they   expect us to do and our ability to do it  Given the very steep slope to the fed funds rate, it seems   that they are not that concerned about our ability to actually get the fed funds rate up in a   reasonable time frame  So given the discussion we are going to have in the next part of this   meeting, would you draw that inference from this and your discussions or not?    This is just a follow-up to Governor Kohn’s question  What is the   cost of having the minimum bid on the TAF be the primary credit rate?    It is just that, given the similarity of the programs, getting a lower   rate seems a curious characteristic for longer-term financing    And so if you time it simultaneously, it’s immaterial    Okay    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Thanks to the staff  I thought they   framed the questions very well, and I thought the memos did a very nice job of framing the   issues  I know this is a difficult set of questions and issues to be dealing with because we don’t   have a lot of empirical evidence  So I thought it really was quite exceptional what they put   together   In terms of my own strategy, I would redeem all Treasury and mortgage-backed   securities, but I would keep an open mind as to whether additional purchases will be necessary,   depending on how the economy evolves  I would look to interest on excess reserves for the   initial increase in interest rates when that becomes appropriate  I expect that market rates will   respond to the increase in interest on excess reserves, as the international evidence highlights, but   if not, future tightening can be accompanied by removal of excess reserves   I would engage in asset sales only if the economy is growing too quickly, an event I view   as quite remote over the course of this year  In particular, for asset sales, if market participants   fear that we intend to unload our mortgage-backed securities, possibly quite quickly, then the   resulting downward pressure on mortgage-backed-security prices could cause a significant rise in   mortgage yields at a time when the still-fragile housing market will be losing important   government support  So I don’t want to underestimate the potential impact of deciding to do   asset sales  And just thinking in my own instance, if I were to be on the other side of the trade,   with a trillion dollars looming that could possibly be dumped, I would be concerned that there   would be a significant market reaction   January 26–27, 2010 55 of 260    I would also note that the primary reason for reducing reserve balances is to regain   control over the federal funds rate  However, the market for federal funds has become small and   specialized, and the federal funds rate has become dominated by GSEs  As a consequence, I   believe the focus of our attention should be on the interest rate paid on excess reserves, as well as   our communication strategy, rather than on the federal funds rate  In short, we may well be able   to sufficiently decrease monetary stimulus, when that becomes appropriate, just by increasing the   interest rate on reserves  If the Committee does decide to substantially reduce reserves, I would   wait to take that action until after the removal of the “extended period” language because I have   the same concerns that President Yellen highlighted   In terms of the primary credit rate, I, too, want to emphasize that it’s a technical change    I think there are three elements to that  One, I think it is important that it is unanimous among   the Reserve Banks  Second, I think it is important that we halt the term auction facility at the   same time that we are changing the primary credit rate, and those things as technical changes   going together makes sense to me  And, third, I think it is most appropriate to announce it at the   March meeting as well  That is a time when we can talk about technical changes, but it is also a   bit easier to have a little more extended language to highlight the fact that it is a technical   change  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like the staff forecast, my outlook has   not changed much from the December FOMC meeting, despite a fairly disappointing   employment report  That report highlighted that we are still losing jobs, that many were taking   part-time work for economic reasons, and many have had little success in finding work despite   being unemployed for some time  As the recent Massachusetts election has highlighted, people   remain quite focused on the very weak labor market and are concerned that economic growth   will be insufficient to make much progress in labor markets  I still anticipate that unemployment   will decline only gradually from these very elevated levels, with a trajectory for the   unemployment rate that is quite similar to that of the Greenbook   In discussions with business leaders from around the District, there is a clear sentiment   that major investment and hiring decisions can wait until there is more clarity on the economic   outlook, and many are refocusing their investment programs  A president of a major university   in Boston highlighted that, despite some recovery in its endowment, it remains well below peak   and the university remains concerned about future prospects  Major projects have been shelved   altogether, whereas others have been examined for a possible joint development  A major   builder highlighted that lack of credit remains a significant issue but that, given significant   vacancies and weak demand for new space, major construction does not make sense as long as   the cost of building remains much higher than the cost of buying  With the CMBS market   severely disrupted and foreclosures looming, he sees little prospect for a turnaround in   commercial construction in the near term  Such sentiments highlight that it may be some time   January 26–27, 2010 115 of 260    before business fixed investment is a significant driver in this recovery  Despite the New   England economy being somewhat better off than the rest of the country, many of the states have   significant revenue shortfalls  Even with stimulus money from the federal government, state and   local spending is likely to be restrained for some time   The economy is clearly susceptible to external shocks  While many of our problems   earlier in the recession affected the rest of the world, Chinese restrictions on their lending and   mounting fiscal challenges in many of the peripheral European countries could reverberate here    Until the economy is more self-sustained, negative shocks can have an outsized effect, given that   with the zero bound on interest rates and the prospect of large future deficits makes it difficult to   offset negative shocks with monetary or fiscal stimulus  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support alternative B  With   unemployment likely to remain stubbornly high in the United States and with many of our   trading partners also experiencing weak labor markets, the risk of political or economic   misjudgments that could sap the strength from the current recovery remains high  This makes it   particularly important that our exit strategy does not inadvertently cause markets to tighten too   soon in anticipation of our actions, particularly as we are likely to miss both elements of our dual   mandate by a sizable margin throughout this year   In terms of language, I strongly prefer the language in paragraph 3 that the Committee   will continue to evaluate its purchases rather than its holdings of securities, for two reasons    First, we have not completed our purchases, and I think talking about holdings while we are still   January 26–27, 2010 176 of 260    continuing purchases through the end of March would be confusing  So I think we should   complete the purchase program before we start talking about holdings  Second, I think sales   should be the last thing that we do, as I said yesterday, so I would be doing many things before I   would be thinking about sales  That would include removing the “extended period” language,   draining reserves, increasing the interest rate on excess reserves before we start asset sales  I   think we are a long way away from signaling to the market that we might be doing asset sales    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At my directors’ meeting last week, the   most commonly used adjective to describe the economy was “flat”  The Greenbook is   estimating first-quarter final sales at 16 percent, which is roughly the same pace of final sales   growth we experienced in the second half of 2009, and it certainly seems consistent with the   qualitative assessment of a flat economy   While the Greenbook and my own forecast assume a gradual increase in momentum,   there is a high degree of uncertainty around the forecast  In particular, it is hard to be confident   that private demand will offset the reduction in overall fiscal stimulus as well as the end of   March 16, 2010 39 of 146    targeted fiscal programs, such as the first-time homebuyers’ program, and our own program of   purchasing mortgage-backed securities  It is worrisome that housing seems to have stalled in the   first quarter, even before the monetary and fiscal programs that were supporting the sector have   ended  Coupled with continuing problems in commercial real estate, the outlook remains dim for   those in construction trades who are hoping to be hired   These problems are quite apparent in the employment statistics  Men in the age category   of 20 to 24 years currently have an unemployment rate of 187 percent, 5 percentage points   higher than women  Of course, transitory movements in and out of the labor force can add   measurement error to the unemployment rate  To avoid these difficulties, one can examine the   employment–population ratio  But the employment–population ratio for these prime-age males   portrays the same qualitative picture as the unemployment rate  Its decline is striking—far larger   than in the previous three recessions, even when one includes adjustments for the significant   demographic shifts over the past decades  This group has been particularly hard hit by the   dramatic decline in construction and manufacturing jobs, but is a group that would certainly be   rehired if the economic recovery were more rapid  I would also note that the adjusted   employment–population ratio has shown a fairly reliable link to inflation, and its implications for   the inflation outlook are not reassuring  While layoffs have been subsiding, business confidence   has not improved to where businesses are doing significant hiring  Anecdotal stories   complement the employment report that indicates improvements in hiring of temporary workers,   but continued hesitance in hiring permanent workers until the recovery is more firmly   established   As for inflation, the trend of lower core prices continues, and the Greenbook has lowered   its forecast for core PCE inflation to only 1 percent at the end of 2011  The recent behavior of   March 16, 2010 40 of 146    compensation suggests that this trend is not yet at an end  The Boston staff model finds that the   recent wage deceleration is well explained by low inflation expectations and significant labor   market slack, partly offset by rapid productivity growth  Interestingly, the one-year inflation   expectations implied by the model are currently below 1 percent  That model suggests subdued   wage growth throughout the forecast horizon and a continued decline in core inflation, even as   short-run inflation expectations return toward their 2 percent anchor over several years  I would   also note that deflation rather than inflation has become a problem in Japan, and many European   countries are reporting very subdued core prices, particularly countries such as Spain and   Ireland, which have been severely impacted by the financial crisis   The problems in Europe highlight a continued downside risk  Problems with sovereign   risks have the potential to be amplified through the banking system  According to data from   DTC, the three largest net sellers of credit default swaps to Greece are financial institutions that   have exposures ranging from $690 million to $990 million, and one of the three is a large US   financial institution  Greece is a relatively small country, but a crisis of confidence in firms and   governments and peripheral countries in Europe could raise the possibility of once again creating   problems at highly leveraged institutions  We should be particularly alert to problems in   countries such as Spain, with its high unemployment rate, falling housing prices, and banks   reliant on wholesale financing   While the brunt of the problems would be centered in Europe, we would certainly not be   immune  While I expect that Europe will be able to resolve these problems without a large   negative shock, the risk of such shocks at a time when our recovery is still anemic and our policy   tools limited bears careful monitoring  While the economy is recovering, it is both a slow and   March 16, 2010 41 of 146    fragile recovery  I expect that it will be some time before we can have much confidence that the   recovery has firmly taken hold Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support alternative B  With   no change in the federal funds rate through 2011, the Greenbook still expects an unemployment   rate above 8 percent, and most measures of core inflation are around 1 percent  My own forecast   is not significantly different, implying at the end of 2011 we will still be well below my inflation   target and well above my estimate of full employment with no change in interest rates  If this   forecast is right, the “extended period” language will need to remain for an extended period   In the popular press, many have raised the concern that keeping interest rates at very low   levels could spur a leverage-supported bubble in asset prices  While I find the historical   evidence for this connection ambiguous at best, I see no evidence currently of excessive   extensions of credit in this country  In fact, my concern is the exact opposite, that even at these   low interest rates, lending is shrinking, not growing, and leveraged financial institutions are still   deleveraging   March 16, 2010 93 of 146    In assessing the risk to a policy of keeping rates unusually low, I see an important   asymmetry  Large positive shocks would get us somewhat closer to our desired targets, but still   leave us plenty of time before a tightening would be required  Large negative shocks, on the   other hand, would be difficult to offset and would push out further the date we reach either   element of our dual mandate  In short, there is little risk of growing too fast, but a significant   risk if the economy grows too slowly   In terms of the questions posed on reinvestment strategy, I would use the following two   principles  First, the reinvestment strategy should be consistent with the interest path  If we   need to remain accommodative, any reduction in reserves should be done in ways to minimize   the impact on borrowing costs of households and businesses  Second, in the long run, we should   return to an all-Treasury portfolio, but, in the short run, we should be focused on getting the right   macroeconomic outcome   Given my expectation for the need for accommodative policy for some time and my   concerns that selling of MBS will have a more significant impact on borrowing costs for   households than Treasuries, I would not expect to sell any mortgage-backed securities until after   we have begun tightening  It is quite possible that the recovery is slow enough that sales of MBS   will not be required at all  I would be comfortable not rolling over some Treasury securities if it   was viewed as desirable to reduce reserves more quickly and the impact on yield was minimal  I   would suggest a gradual reduction in rollover so that we can determine the potential impact    Assuming yield movement is minimal, we could continue to let Treasuries roll off  Once we had   reduced our balance sheet to low levels of excess reserves, we could replace mortgage-backed   securities as they rolled off with Treasuries eventually returning to an all-Treasuries portfolio   March 16, 2010 94 of 146    Finally, I would not retain the bracketed sentence in paragraph 2  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Okay     I just want to follow up on the Greek question  Do we have a sense   of which organizations have written the credit default swaps and whether that is a source of   contagion?  Are we connected with the Europeans? Somebody has to have a net exposure—not   everybody can be hedged  I’m just curious, given the magnitude, about whether that could end   up being in some respects as important as the total loans—I know in the international section we   had a description of the total loans  But I don’t know how many of those loans are hedged or   unhedged, so the other part of that market that we need is the credit default swaps  Are we   monitoring it?  Are the Europeans monitoring it?  When you think of financial stability, some   kind of a coordinated effort to monitor would seem like the approach we’d want to take    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The memos on options were extremely   useful  I think the memos highlight several important facts we need to consider  First, the size   and composition of our balance sheet, like short-term interest rates, are not the goals of policy    They are the instruments used to achieve our goals of full employment and price stability    Second, asset sales are a tightening of monetary policy; while the magnitude is uncertain, the   direction is not  And, third, under all the options, we will not achieve either element of our   mandate over the period we usually forecast, that is, by the end of 2011  In fact, we will be far   away if the Greenbook is right  So if I were to have a centennial option, it would probably be to   reach our mandate by the centennial rather than to get our balance sheet of mortgage-backed   securities to zero by the centennial  That highlights the point that, in my own estimation, we are   April 27–28, 2010 27 of 206                   very far from attaining either element of our mandate  That implies that both the onset of   conventional policy tightening and the need to sell assets are quite a ways off  In addition, there   is considerable uncertainty about how the economy will evolve in terms of both employment and   inflation  So I would strongly prefer to maintain a high degree of flexibility and conditionality in   whatever program we adopt  With that in mind, I feel that the more extreme options, such as   option 5, take an unacceptably long time to achieve either element of our mandate and fail to   embody the conditionality that I think is critical at this time   Consistent with these overarching principles, I would prefer an option that facilitates   reaching our dual mandate within a reasonable horizon but that shrinks our balance sheet when   and as needed so that we can be confident that we can raise rates when that becomes necessary    The closest option to achieving that goal would be a variant of option 2  Other things equal, I   would prefer not to sell assets until after, possibly well after, we begin tightening  I would also   prefer to make asset sales or purchases conditional on economic and financial conditions  I hope   that such a conditional plan would soften much of the announcement effect that could result in a   tightening of financial conditions when a tightening is not at all what the economy requires at   present   Given my economic outlook, I would prefer currently to replace maturing Treasury   securities with short-term Treasury bills that could run off as we approach our first tightening    When tightening is appropriate, these Treasury securities would roll off so that we can reduce   our excess reserves  This takes out some insurance against the risk that the large stock of   reserves could complicate further tightening or be seen as inflationary, though I view both of   these risks as remote   April 27–28, 2010 28 of 206                   In terms of communication, I would prefer to use the minutes rather than the statement to   convey the sense of the Committee and only say at this time that there are no plans to sell assets   until after we begin raising short-term interest rates  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Just a question    It would be interesting to know what was coming due and when, so   that we could get a sense, if we were to go with the last alternative, what it might look like    Getting the information as soon as tomorrow may not be possible, I realize    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is heartening that the incoming data   are coming in somewhat stronger than I expected at the last meeting  That said, my forecast is   very similar to that of the Greenbook, with moderate growth this year that picks up as the various   headwinds subside  The discussions I’ve had with businesses are consistent with this forecast    Most contacts are seeing modest improvement but are still very tentative  Before they’re willing   April 27–28, 2010 87 of 206                   to hire or undertake very large investments, they want to see more evidence that we are in a   sustained recovery  There are still important sectors of the economy that remain weak, as was   highlighted yesterday, such as commercial real estate and state and local spending, and I expect   that it will be some time before we see much improvement in these areas   My forecast also has continued disinflation, and many of the models used in my research   department imply more disinflation than in the Greenbook  Wages and salaries continue to   decline, and employers I have talked to report little pricing power  However, they have noted   plans to restore some of the benefits that were reduced over the past two years   I would note that bank lending continues to shrink significantly  This seems inconsistent   with concerns raised that excess reserves will be inflationary  Such an outcome would   presumably occur through substantial bank lending, and, in fact, the problem continues to be too   little lending, not too much lending  According to many of the bankers I’ve talked to, this is not   likely to turn around any time soon  As many bankers remain capital constrained, many banks   are waiting to understand the impact of regulatory reform, and most banks are still working   through significant nonperforming loans  With bankers remaining hesitant to lend, an asset   bubble funded by leveraged institutions seems unlikely  While the economy is improving, we   are likely to remain far from my goal of full employment and inflation at 2 percent over the   forecast horizon   I want to thank the Vice Chair for talking about Greece  I do think it highlights the point   that over time we may need a more structured discussion of tails of the distribution; the   Greenbook is focused on the modal forecast  I know the scenario analysis is partly intended to   get at that, but, given what’s happening with financial regulatory reform, and given that we have   a case study with Greece and possibly these downgrades, it seems to me that thinking about how   April 27–28, 2010 88 of 206                   to structure a discussion that gets at tails of the distribution, and thinking through how we could   get a more systematic way of doing that, would be useful  Thank you, Mr Chairman    They do that  But I was thinking more along the following lines    Take the example of Greece It would be helpful to have data on country risk exposure from the   BIS, to have some idea of what our large 10 or 15 institutions were holding, not only the   sovereign debt but the credit default swaps to the Greek banks themselves  We don’t really talk   about paths of contagion  And when we think about what happened with the real estate crisis, I   think we kind of knew there was an issue, but we didn’t have a structured way to have a full   discussion of that  And I think it’s useful to get an update   But this might be an opportunity to   think about how we could think through all of the channels and how that might influence what   we do, particularly on supervisory policy, so we do a better job of meshing supervisory policy   and monetary policy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, though I am   sympathetic to some of the language expressed in alternative A  While there has been some   April 27–28, 2010 143 of 206                   improvement in the economy, the recovery remains fragile, despite the significant support from   monetary and fiscal stimulus  Should the economy weaken as accommodation is removed, or as   a result of an external shock, such as what we’ve been discussing this morning, our tools to   offset such adverse circumstances are quite limited  In addition, disinflation in prices and wages   continues, which should provide us the flexibility to maintain accommodative policy until we   make much more progress on bringing the unemployment rate down  To avoid an erosion of   central bank credibility, we should seek to minimize the time that we’re missing on both   elements of our mandate  This will require maintaining our accommodative policy for an   extended period of time  I support postponing the Treasury decision until we can more fully   discuss the options at the next meeting, and I would signal in the minutes that mortgage-backed   securities sales will only occur after tightening in short-term interest rates has begun  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     I’m supportive of having the swap line  I think we should do things   for economic reasons, not political reasons  And I think the economics, given that we’re in the   middle of a crisis, indicate that it’s appropriate to have a swap line with the other central banks   that are in the G-7  So I support the move to open up the swap lines  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes, a technical question  It seemed that some of the options were   based just on when things would be redeemed versus when an auction would occur so that you   could put the funds back to work  Once something matures, is there any problem with just doing   repos until a Treasury bill auction occurs?  Is there something I don’t understand about the   mechanics that would make it difficult to have a bridge between the maturity of a longer-term   security and rolling into a Treasury bill auction?    Thank you   June 22–23, 2010 25 of 213              Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the last meeting, a majority of us   thought that sales should occur after tightening  I don’t think we should be revisiting this at each   meeting  I think we should come to a conclusion and stand by it  I think the reason that a   majority of us thought that sales should go after a tightening is because sales are a tightening    They may be of a small magnitude, but the direction is clear—it’s a tightening   The reason mortgage rates have fallen is not because the economy is so strong, it’s   because the economy is weaker than it was before  What was striking in Brian’s first memo was   a 20 percent chance that somebody falls off the euro  Well, I think the reason mortgage rates are   so low is that the possibility of a tail event has gone up substantially, and that wasn’t the case at   the previous meeting  So I think it would be particularly puzzling right now—in this   environment, with the inflation rate forecast lower, the unemployment rate forecast higher, the   market as a whole thinking that interest rates are lower because a bad outcome is more likely,   and the stock market down—if we said we’ve decided to do a tightening  I find it quite   inconsistent that we would do a tightening at this meeting, even if it is of a small magnitude  So   I don’t think that we should take back what we had agreed to and what we represented in the   minutes at the last meeting   On the Treasuries, my preference spills over a little into our forecast discussion in the   next two parts of the meeting, but I don’t think this is the time to make any changes at all  My   preference would be to make no change in what we’re doing for the Treasury portfolio  Over   time, I can see some logic in shortening the maturity, but I don’t think this is the time to do it  If   anything, the probability of having to do more purchases has gone up rather than down  We’re   closer to a deflationary scenario, and we’re closer to an environment in which we could have a   really bad outcome, and we don’t have many tools to deal with a really bad outcome  Interest   June 22–23, 2010 31 of 213             rates are already bound by zero, so our only option is sales or purchases of other assets  In that   environment, this is a particularly good time not to do anything and see if we might actually have   to do more purchases rather than more sales as time goes on  Thank you, Mr Chairman    That’s because interest rates are so low that it means that the   prepayment will be very rapid, and as a result, our balance sheet will shrink quite rapidly if   interest rates stay this low    But it would also presumably change the mortgage rate relative to   the Treasury rate  So if the housing sector is one of the sectors that you think is particularly   weak, it would be relatively unusual  Even though it’s a change in duration, it’s also a change in   composition that does have potential compositional effects, particularly on a sector that may be   weak otherwise    I found the financial stability memos and briefing very, very   helpful, and I just wanted to follow up on your comment on Greece and Portugal and the notion   that, while a default isn’t imminent, it may occur over time  My reading of the Reinhart and   Rogoff book was that they highlighted sovereign defaults that were often accompanied by very   large exchange rate movements as well, and I take it that that’s not embedded in your longer-run   forecast  I was wondering if you could talk about how you would see the Greeks making a   choice in the situation that default is likely to occur  Would they choose to restructure or would   they pull out of the euro and revalue their exchange rate, which would give them a terms of trade   advantage to offset some of their unemployment problems?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  At my directors meeting last week,   several directors made an analogy to a turtle that had bravely stuck its head out in the first   quarter, but quickly retreated to its shell in May  [Laughter]  Most of the data we’ve seen   reflects the period when the turtle was out of its shell, but, in the coming weeks, I’m afraid we’ll   get confirmation detailing why the turtle’s courage was short-lived  Many of my contacts   highlighted that the headlines from Europe have caused them to reevaluate hiring and investment   decisions, presumably linked in large part to the expectation of declining export demand as the   dollar strengthens and many countries undertake fiscal tightening   My forecasts have been predicated on a fragile job market, partly offset by moderate   growth in business fixed investment  If my business contacts’ pullback in these key areas in the   face of European problems is representative, then the risk of slower growth than I had previously   forecast has increased  And my concern over the outlook extends beyond the effects of   European troubles, with state and local spending clearly in retreat, and with the housing sector   likely faltering  In sum, I am worried that the Tealbook may be too optimistic   In terms of financial markets, I am concerned about the effects of a gradual but   cumulatively significant withdrawal from European exposures  US money market funds have   been an important source of funding for European banks My contacts with money market funds   indicate that they are becoming increasingly concerned about exposure in Europe  In particular,   the money market funds are concerned that investors in their funds will flee if they see large   exposures to Europe and cannot differentiate between sound and weak European names  In   June 22–23, 2010 80 of 213             general, there’s a lack of confidence in the political will to make adequate adjustments in   Europe  If my contacts are right, the problems emanating from Europe will gradually worsen  I   share many of their concerns, and I am more concerned about Europe being able to muddle   through than is reflected in many of our briefing documents   Even if Europe is able to avoid a severe contraction and more significant financial   problems, my outlook in the near term for the US economy entails a heightened risk of   deflation  Spain and Ireland are experiencing deflation even before the full effect of fiscal   austerity has been felt  Japan remains in deflation and has shown little ability to pull out  I am   worried that we may be underestimating the risk of deflation and that we are placing too much   weight on well-anchored expectations at a time when we are seeing disinflation in wages and   declines in a surprising number of components of the CPI  While I’m confident that we have the   tools to offset inflation, the Japanese experience makes me less confident about the tools   available to offset deflation  Should the European problems cause an economic stall, the   deflation risks would become even greater   Given the move towards fiscal austerity in the United States that is likely to be even more   pronounced after the election, and given that alternative monetary policies have shown to be of   only limited help, both here and abroad, it is not clear how forceful our response would or could   be if the economy slows and we experience deflation  This is a risk we should be seeking to   minimize and is something we should take seriously as we think about adverse economic   scenarios    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  The Tealbook   has a higher unemployment rate at the end of 2010 and 2011 than at our previous meeting  It   also has a lower core inflation rate at the end of 2010 and 2011 than at our previous meeting    This forecast is very limited improvement in the very large miss on our unemployment mandate,   June 22–23, 2010 134 of 213             and we move further away from reaching a goal of 2 percent inflation  My own forecast has   moved in the same direction  As a result, I view any tightening through language or asset sales   as moving in the wrong direction  Like the staff, I do not see much likelihood that we should   tighten policy in 2010 or 2011   I would note that key phrases in alternative A provide a description of the outlook and its   relation to our goals that seems better aligned with the staff forecast and with my own outlook    In particular, alternative A highlights the fact that the outlook has weakened somewhat, and   emphasizes that inflation is likely to remain below, and maybe well below, rates consistent with   our dual mandate  Should we experience further weakness and disinflation, we may want to   move to language closer to that expressed in alternative A at future meetings  In fact, I am   concerned that we should be doing more contingency planning with a possibility that deflation or   financial contagion from Europe could move from the risk to the outcome column  While we   were quite innovative during the financial crisis, should these risks become a reality, our   creativity may once again be tested  In terms of the coupon swaps, I view it as a technical   matter  As a result, I think making an announcement of a technical matter is fine     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data have been   disappointing  As inventory rebuilding subsided, most forecasts anticipated improvements in   final sales  However, final sales have yet to show any evidence of more rapid growth, averaging   less than 2 percent over the past four quarters  With state and local governments continuing to   retrench, consumers saving more, and home sales weak after the curtailment of the tax credit, the   second half of the year is likely to be subdued  Like the Tealbook, I expect no improvement in   the unemployment rate for the balance of the year, and I worry that economic growth that barely   attains potential, coupled with extremely high unemployment, may begin to affect the longer-run   health of the economy  In particular, such a slow and protracted recovery runs the risk of   inflicting collateral damage to labor markets as the long-term unemployed become increasingly   discouraged  The departure of 12 million workers from the labor force over the past three   months is consistent with this concern   The inflation rate is quite low and further disinflation remains likely, given the   underutilized resources in the economy  Another large negative shock could push disinflation to   outright deflation  It’s easy to imagine the fiscal problems in much of the developed world   triggering a crisis that pushes us in this direction This outcome may have a higher probability   than we’d like to believe, judging from the extremely elevated sovereign spreads that remain    Apparently, many investors are pricing in a high probability of sovereign default in several   European countries over a reasonable time period  Because a negative shock could occur, we   should be devoting time to devising and evaluating plausible alternative monetary policy   strategies  While fiscal policies would likely be the most effective tool, there is serious question   whether a fiscal policy response would occur   August 10, 2010 30 of 160             In terms of potential unconventional monetary policy measures, should they become   necessary, I would prefer large purchases of mortgages to large purchases of government bonds    Government bonds are already in high demand, and other assets will not enjoy the same flight to   quality as government bonds if the economy deteriorates  In considering additional purchases of   mortgage securities, I would argue that we need to understand better the effects of our first   purchase program  Recent research by Andreas Fuster and Paul Willen in a Boston Fed working   paper examined the effects of the LSAP on the mortgage market  They highlight that borrowers   choose among a combination of points and interest rates, and many borrowers with low FICO   scores choose mortgages with a higher rate and lower points  Because we focused our LSAP   program on low coupon mortgages, the largest effect was on borrowers with high FICO scores   and high incomes who chose low interest rates and more points  This unintended consequence of   the program highlights that we may need to better understand how our actions affect the entire   distribution of the mortgage products and potentially focus on those segments of the market that   would best support new homebuyers should we decide that a larger LSAP program is necessary   in the future Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support option B  We currently are   unlikely to make any progress on either element of our dual mandate over the course of this year    In fact, it’s quite possible that the unemployment rate could be higher and the inflation rate lower   at the end of this year  Moving in the wrong direction on both elements of our mandate, given   how far we are from where we want to be, is highly undesirable  Making such an outcome less   likely is appropriate, and the reinvestment of maturing mortgage-backed securities will highlight   that we are now further from the exit and are willing to take more aggressive action if necessary   In considering the likely trajectory for inflation, I would emphasize that I take less   comfort than some in anchored inflation expectations  My staff has been looking at the same   charts as the Chairman, and recent work by Jeff Fuhrer examining the deflation experience in   Japan has found that longer-run inflation expectations there have been well-anchored above   1 percent for more than a decade  However, the realized core rate of inflation has remained   August 10, 2010 99 of 160             negative for almost that entire period, despite the stable longer-run inflation expectations  While   there are many differences between the US and Japanese economies, this comparison suggests   to me that the risk of deflation, even in the presence of anchored expectations, is greater than   what I would like at this stage of the recovery  While deflation is only a risk at this time, it is   appropriate to take out insurance against that risk  Should that risk become greater, we will need   to take out more insurance  Thank you, Mr Chairman    It’s keeping constant the holdings  I don’t know what it’s doing to   the accommodation     Before we did the large-scale asset purchase program, we had a   group of memos looking at the cross-correlation among mortgage rates, Treasury rates, and   corporate rates, and I was just wondering if any work had been done to see if those cross-  correlations had changed since those memos were originally done  I’m not suggesting this   necessarily for this meeting, but maybe at a future meeting it would be of interest to see whether   any of those relationships had changed, given the various changes that have occurred over the   last several years  And maybe you have an impression of whether they have changed   September 21, 2010 14 of 151              It is never good news when the staff feels that it is necessary to   create a box looking at the probability of a recession  Whether or not this is truly a harbinger of   a recession, I agree with most forecasters who expect very slow economic growth for the second   half of this year, and this is coupled with the not-insignificant risk of a negative tail event  Much   slower economic growth could be generated by a combination of fiscal austerity, further   deceleration in final sales, or realization of the risk highlighted in the other striking box in the   staff documents, namely, the risk implied in the very elevated rate for credit default swaps for   sovereigns and banking institutions in Europe   Slow economic growth for the second half this year implies that we can expect little   improvement in labor markets in the short run  In fact, it is quite possible that we end the year   with unemployment at or above the very elevated rate we had at the beginning of this year    While some structural dislocation occurs in every recession, this recession has been   characterized by a widespread decline in the demand for labor  In the 1990 recession, the only   industry to experience a peak-to-trough loss of employment of 5 percent or greater was   construction  In the 2001 recession, the only two industries to experience peak-to-trough loss of   employment of 5 percent or greater were manufacturing and information technology  However,   in this recession there has been a peak-to-trough loss of employment of 5 percent or greater in   construction, manufacturing, retail trade, wholesale trade, transportation, information   technology, financial activities, and professional and business services  Consistent with job   losses reflecting a widespread decline in demand, a survey by the National Federation of   September 21, 2010 34 of 151             Independent Business asked small businesses whether they had one or more hard-to-fill jobs   vacant  Only 10 percent said yes, which remains near the 25-year low for this survey question   While New England is doing better than many areas of the country, community banks in   my District are reporting more home foreclosures and nonperforming residential loans  They   report that most of these foreclosures are being triggered less by job loss and more by households   finally depleting their resources and giving up on an economic rebound  A very slow recovery   can have significant negative long-run implications for both employment and households’   financial condition  We continue to see evidence of disinflation  The core CPI is currently just   below 1 percent and is expected to remain far below 2 percent through the forecast period of   2012  As President Evans highlighted at the last meeting, large misses for years on the upside of   our inflation goal would not be acceptable and would warrant a significant policy response  If   so, then large misses for years on the downside of our inflation goal should also not be   acceptable and warrant a significant policy response  Fiscal policy may be the most effective   policy tool when we hit the zero lower bound for interest rates  However, if fiscal stimulus is not   forthcoming, and if we are not making significant progress towards both elements of our policy   mandate, then monetary policy should not remain on the sidelines Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, though I expect   that something like alternative A will be necessary unless we get substantially more positive   economic news over the next two months  It is quite likely that we will make little or no   progress on the extremely high unemployment rate or the very low inflation rate this year  If so,   an option like that in the A alternatives does seem appropriate   Because I expect that more monetary stimulus may be necessary in the future, it may be   worth considering options beyond the quantitative targets in the current A alternatives  One   possibility would be to explore what kind of asset purchases would have the largest economic   effects  For example, if MBS purchases would have greater economic effects than Treasury   purchases of the same magnitude, in the short run that concern would dominate my desire for   achieving a Treasury-only portfolio in the long run  It might also be worth considering whether   targeting a longer-term interest rate might be more effective than targeting a quantity  Had we   September 21, 2010 92 of 151             announced we were targeting mortgage rates when we began the LSAP, it is not clear that we   would have needed to purchase the same quantity that we eventually purchased  That we could   credibly enforce a target is unlikely to be doubted, because we have already been willing to   purchase a very sizable proportion of all newly issued mortgages  Obviously, we could,   alternatively, choose to target a longer- or a medium-term Treasury rate  Exploring a full set of   options at the next meeting would help us to choose the policy option that generates the largest   economic impact from further expansion of our balance sheet   I would just say that, given the wide range of comments we have already heard and are   likely to hear over the rest of the go-round, it does seem that we might want to explore using the   full two days that we have and not just have the first day be quite so abbreviated I agree with   you—I think it would be useful to have somewhat of a regime change, but we need to get a   consensus on actions, we need to get a consensus on intermediate goals, and we need to get a   consensus on communication strategies  And that does seem difficult to do unless we have   enough time to actually do it  So we might just think about having a more extended two-day   meeting     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll try to be brief in answering the   questions you asked1  In terms of specifying the objectives, I find myself between option 1 and   option 2  In some respects, I view option 2 as a concrete version of option 1  I think many   observers already view our longer-run goals for inflation as a target, so we currently operate with                                                     1 A list of the questions addressed by meeting participants is attached to this transcript (appendix 1)    October 15, 2010 10 of 62             what amounts to a fuzzy target  There are certain advantages to speaking with one voice on where   we expect to go with both inflation and unemployment, so I’d lean a bit more towards option 2 than   option 1, but I could be comfortable with either of those two   I think price level targeting is an interesting proposal and has some advantages, but, at least   for now, I think it has some challenges as well  I’ll just highlight three issues that I’d want to think   hard about if we were going to move in that direction  First is the challenge of communicating; I   think we need to make sure that we really believe we can communicate the concepts in a clear way,   not only to economists but also to other people who matter  Second, I do have some questions   about our ability to bind future FOMC members to whatever path we get started on  Third, I’m a   little concerned about how easily we can bring inflation down once we get to that point   In terms of the LSAPs, I am in favor of doing more  Actually, I’d be open to doing   mortgage-backed securities or possibly even investigating whether SBA loans could also be used   for purchases  I know that market is relatively small, but it would signal that we are interested in   credit availability more generally  If we decide that we are focusing on Treasuries, I don’t think it   makes too much of a difference which of the long-term maturities we choose to do, since we will be   taking duration out of the long end of the market  But I do have a preference for focusing on rates   rather than quantities  If we don’t go the route of fixing rates, I would prefer to do the purchases in   medium-sized amounts; that is, I would not want to be fine-tuning the amounts  I wouldn’t want to   go much smaller than purchases of $500 billion  That seems like an amount that could have a   material effect, and, hopefully, we wouldn’t have to change it in a very high-frequency way  It   would highlight that this is an unconventional policy, and we’d want to see what the effects are  But   I think that, if we try to fine-tune things with very small amounts, we might see relatively little   October 15, 2010 11 of 62             effect, and it might actually undermine some of the goals that we’re trying to achieve in terms of   getting interest rates to move   Regarding the suggestion of a postmeeting press conference, I think that might be a good   idea—that’s easy for me to say, because you’d be the one doing the press conference, not me  If   you were willing to do it, I do think there are some advantages to providing a little more clarity to   what was discussed at the meeting; furthermore, it dovetails with some of the concerns about   interpretations of what came out of the meetings     Can you still hear me?    Am I back on?    I’m about to conclude anyway  In terms of interest rates, if we were   to go the route of targeting, I would prefer to work in the area where we thought we would have the   biggest impact, so I’d prefer to be at the long end of the market, not the short end of the market    Finally, I think we need to get more clarity on some of the options before we worry too much about   communication strategy  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My forecast for the economy in the   near term is much like the Tealbook’s  I, too, have the unemployment rate ending the year where   it began, at 97 percent, and falling only to roughly 9 percent by the end of 2011   Over the past two years, we have been experiencing gradual disinflation, and, with the   likelihood of continued weakness in labor markets, my forecast expects this disinflationary trend   to continue  I would highlight that the disinflation we have experienced, and are likely to   continue to experience, is most unwelcome, in part because it increases the short-term real   interest rate  In December of 2009, the year-over-year core CPI was 18 percent  In the most   recent release, the year-over-year CPI was 08 percent  The decline in core PCE has been   smaller, but still the most recent PCE release shows a continued deceleration  With the short-  term interest rate pinned at zero, falling inflation has increased the real fed funds rate, creating an   unintentional tightening of monetary policy  Thus, even if one assumes that the risk of deflation   is low, preventing any further disinflation is important  In fact, I believe that we should be   working harder to return inflation to 2 percent over a reasonable horizon   In terms of labor markets, I recently had a meeting with my Academic Advisory Council,   which includes a variety of economists from Harvard, Yale, and MIT  They are generally a   rather unruly bunch—[laughter]—but they were unanimous in their view that most of our current   unemployment is the result of inadequate demand  In fact, their biggest concern was that   remaining at this elevated rate of unemployment would create a structural unemployment   problem, which only further emphasized the need, in their view, for more aggressive fiscal or   monetary policy actions  Two members of my Research Department, Chris Foote and Richard   Ryan, have further investigated one possible source of structural unemployment  Some have   posited that the fall in housing prices has made homeowners much less willing or able to move    November 2–3, 2010 45 of 238             If this were true, one would expect the duration of unemployment would diverge between   homeowners and renters, with renters more willing to relocate to obtain employment  Using the   Current Population Survey, they examined whether unemployment duration varies between   homeowners and renters after controlling for worker demographics, workplace skills, and the   strength of the home-state housing markets  They find no statistical difference between   homeowners and renters  Instead, they find that long-duration unemployment spells are   ubiquitous and are not confined to construction, to lower-educated, to lower-skilled, or to   housebound workers  These findings seem consistent with inadequate aggregate demand being   the main source of unemployment duration   I’ve also met with a variety of asset managers over the past month  Those discussions   indicate that even the possibility of quantitative easing is having a significant impact on their   expectations of interest rate and exchange rate movements  They do not seem to have any doubt   that our actions could alter financial market conditions materially  However, there is a wide   range of views on the likely impact on the economy of easier financial market conditions   My own view of the ability of quantitative easing to affect financial market conditions is   not unlike that of the Tealbook  However, I would say that the effect of quantitative easing,   through the exchange rate channel, may be of a larger magnitude than I had previously thought    I would also highlight that movements in interest and exchange rates over the past month   associated with the perceived changes in the probability and magnitude of quantitative easing   seem to confirm what I am hearing from market participants, namely, that adjustments to a   quantitative easing program can have a meaningful impact on financial market conditions    Thank you, Mr Chairman    I just want to follow up on the schedule  If the Treasury were to   change its debt management dramatically, or if foreign purchases were to change dramatically,   you wouldn’t be bound to keep the same distribution  You feel that you have the flexibility to   make the adjustment without waiting until an FOMC meeting  Is that correct?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I suggested yesterday, my forecast   is that unemployment will remain at 9 percent or higher throughout 2011, resulting in continued   disinflationary pressure  Further disinflation is not only inconsistent with my target, but it also   would imply a tightening of short-term real rates at a time when I believe we should be easing    The continuation of large misses on both elements of our mandate through the forecast horizon   provides ample reason for further monetary policy accommodation   I am in favor of alternative B  However, under alternative B, my expectation is that we   would complete the entire purchase of $600 billion in securities, unless incoming data indicated   that we would achieve both elements of our mandate within the forecast horizon—an event I   view as, unfortunately, quite remote  I also view alternative B as providing an easing bias    Unless we make significant progress on both elements of the mandate, that is, if the outlook   continues to imply slow and meager progress towards both elements of the mandate, I would   favor serious consideration of additional asset purchases following the round that I hope we will   approve today   A serious mistake made by the Japanese was that they moved slowly and methodically to   address, first, the disinflation, and then the deflation once they hit the zero bound  I do not want   our monetary policy to make the same mistake  We should make clear in both our language and   our actions that we are resolute in achieving both elements of our mandate   In terms of alternative A, paragraph 4, I would just say that I wouldn’t want it to be a   substitution for the policy; if anything, I would want it in addition   November 2–3, 2010 136 of 238               I have a question just about the length of the extension  Given that   the sovereign debt crisis is unlikely to be completely resolved in six months, is there a reason not   to have it go out for a longer period of time?    I have a question on the house-price adjustment  As I was reading   the financial stability memos, particularly the one on the banking sector, I noticed that it   highlighted that the percent of bank assets in 3-, 4-, and 5-rated institutions had become quite   elevated, approximately where we were the last time we had “headwinds” in the banking sector    So, when we think of a house-price decline that’s as large as what you’re talking about,   combined with the elevated percent of bank assets in 3-, 4-, and 5-rated institutions, do we still   assume that the headwinds in the banking markets are going to subside over the course of the   year?  And what are you assuming about securities that are tied to real estate, given your new   information on the pricing of housing?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The tenor of the incoming data has   been positive, though not much different from what was expected in most forecasts, and it is   broadly consistent with only a very gradual recovery  Even with the announcement of both fiscal   and financial stimulus, the Tealbook is little changed from our November meeting  For the final   quarter of 2012, the Tealbook forecasts unemployment to be 01 percentage point higher and   core PCE inflation to be 01 percentage point lower than at the November meeting  Similarly,   the Blue Chip forecast is not much different from last month  Thus, despite the move to more   accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, we are still expecting only very slow progress on an   inflation rate that is too low and an unemployment rate that is too high   While the inflation forecasts are little changed, the decline in core inflation has   continued  In fact, the core CPI inflation rate for the last 12 months, at 06 percent, is the lowest   since 1957 when the index began  As the Tealbook inflation box shows, the diffusion index and   a wide variety of inflation measures provide ample evidence of continued disinflation  While   commodity prices have certainly increased, there seems little ability to pass these increases on to   final goods prices, given the significant slack in the economy  Discussions with businesses   around New England highlight that they have used productivity gains to offset rising commodity   prices, because they see little ability to pass price increases on to their customers     Our announcement of further large-scale asset purchases has spurred considerable   discussion about the potential for them to create undesirable inflationary pressures  For our   excess reserves to translate into future inflation or debt-financed asset bubbles, banks would have   to increase lending significantly  This is not what we see  In the United States, Japan, and the   United Kingdom, lending has remained very weak, despite the infusion of liquidity by central   banks in all three countries   December 14, 2010 36 of 127             In addition, discussions with bankers do not indicate that a significant upsurge in demand   in this country is imminent—rather, quite the opposite  Bankers continue to experience weak   demand for loans, particularly among smaller businesses  While I do not expect these trends to   reverse any time soon, if they do, they should be quite observable, allowing us to take   appropriate actions when that becomes necessary   With the outlook little changed, it is probably worthwhile thinking about the risks to the   forecast  The Tealbook highlights a much weaker path for house prices  While I am not   particularly confident of our ability to forecast house prices, significant further declines in house   prices have the potential to weaken bank balance sheets significantly, further complicate the   ability to remove the foreclosure overhang, and cause consumers to retrench as their confidence   ebbs along with their housing wealth   A second concern is the increasing difficulties with state and local finances, which some   have compared with the problems with peripheral nations in Europe  While I do not think the   analogy to Europe is particularly apt, these problems share one common attribute, and that is that   the lack of political will to address problems may make the problems significantly worse   My biggest concern remains Europe  With announcements in late spring regarding   Greece, many hoped that the problem would be postponed for several years, and that Europe   would find a way to muddle through  As events over the last month have made clear, the   situation remains fragile, and confidence in banks remains tenuous  Clearly, the Irish stress test   of their banks did not uncover the significant weakness in Irish banks, and concern with other   stress tests has contributed to some creeping up of interbank rates  Should European problems   become more severe, I do worry about the transmission through US banks and money market   December 14, 2010 37 of 127             funds  US prime money market funds with $16 trillion in assets have European exposures that   now account for over 60 percent of their assets  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  With our   announcement of the large-scale asset purchase last month, and with some additional fiscal   stimulus likely to be approved before the end of the year, this is probably an appropriate time to   assess the impact of these actions and to gauge whether the slow recovery embedded in most of   our forecasts unfolds as expected  With little change to our forecast, which envisions substantial   misses on both elements of our mandate through 2012 and beyond, it is difficult to imagine why   we would not purchase all $600 billion of government securities  Moreover, I remain concerned   that disinflationary pressures may not abate quickly given the significant excess capacity in the   economy and given that the recovery, such as we have experienced it to date, remains quite   fragile  With core inflation estimates currently getting close to estimates of the inflation bias, I   can easily envision circumstances in which we would want to expand our large-scale asset   purchases next year  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the intermeeting period, the tenor   of the incoming data has improved  Most private forecasters have been raising their estimates of   the last quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011  Like the Tealbook, I am expecting growth   over 2011 to be between 3½ and 4 percent, somewhat above the most recent Blue Chip forecast    While the consumption and investment data have generally improved, continued problems in   housing and state and local government spending should prevent the economy from growing   much faster than 4 percent this year   The problems with residential investment cause me particular concern  Boston staff has   done some research that suggests that spillover effects from a weaker housing market are a   significant risk and found that the magnitude of the risk was qualitatively very similar to the   scenario in the Tealbook that involved an intensified real estate slump with spillover   Even with somewhat more robust growth, it is likely to be at least four years before we   reach full employment  While we have discussed issues with structural employment at length, I   would highlight that both directors and members of my various councils have highlighted how   easy it is to hire qualified workers  And I would note that the New England labor market is   much tighter than most other parts of the country, because only in Rhode Island is the   unemployment rate above the national average  I will give just one example  A retail grocer in   January 25–26, 2011 94 of 282              New England is planning on expanding by opening four additional grocery stores and needed to   hire 500 workers  He had more than 4,000 applications for the jobs, with lines extending well   around multiple city blocks  And he was struck by how many had previous experience running   bakeries, butcher shops, other grocery stores, or had other skills particularly relevant to the   grocery business  Contacts expanding in high-tech, restaurants, and financial services have   similar stories and have remarked on how many highly qualified candidates are available  The   problem remains too few jobs, not too few skilled workers   Given the excess capacity in labor markets and the downward trend in both core inflation   and compensation, returning to a 2 percent core inflation rate in the medium term will certainly   require years of much stronger data than we have seen to date  We still see evidence of this in   the inflation data  Despite the increase in energy prices, many key areas have experienced price   declines over the past year, including motor vehicles, household appliances, and apparel  The   low inflation rate and the likelihood that it will remain below our target over the medium term   gives us ample room to encourage faster improvement in labor markets and to put the economy   on a stronger footing   I would like to compliment the staff on the material they are providing in the financial   stability report  I also remain concerned that the European problems pose downside risks to the   United States  At the last meeting, I highlighted the risk that money market fund exposures to   Europe could be a channel of transmission from Europe to the US financial markets  Some of   the smaller money market funds over the past year have had exposure to peripheral sovereign   debt, and, when worrying about the financial stability of money market funds, it is the smallest,   rather than the largest, that tend to pose the greatest risk of breaking the buck and initiating   another broad run   January 25–26, 2011 95 of 282              A second transmission channel I have not focused on in my earlier comments consists of   European banks in peripheral countries  The pictures in the financial stability packet show how   much the CDS spreads have widened for Spanish banks, as more attention has been given to   sovereign debt problems in Spain  Banco Santander, one of the largest banks in the world, has   had its CDS rise from 83 basis points at the beginning of 2010 to 292 basis points more recently    The CDS on the other large Spanish bank, BBVA, has risen from 85 in the beginning of last year   to 314 more recently  Investor concerns about some of these large European banks highlight the   urgency of getting our own economy on a solid footing, so that we can withstand any additional   significant financial shocks in the coming year  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B as written  We   should stay the course  Inflation remains well below my inflation target and output well below   potential through 2012  With the very low inflation rate forecasted to continue for several years,   we have ample room to be accommodative and encourage more rapid growth  I expect to   complete the entire purchase program  Our purchase program is certainly consistent with our   dual mandate  In fact, it would be justified if we had a sole mandate of targeting 2 percent   inflation over the medium term  Thank you    I am on the subcommittee and I asked to go towards the end, and   number 3 was towards the end  [Laughter]  The subcommittee had to wrestle with wanting to   make sure that there wasn’t undue access that provided the appearance of financial gain, and   trading that off against the need to understand developments in the economy and financial   markets  So it’s really important to find the right balance  I would highlight that, to the extent   that we formalize things, the rules have to be clear and enforceable   Let me start with the second issue, which refers to the potential limitations  I actually do   think that FOMC meetings should be kept confidential other than what’s in the minutes, which   provide the public recounting, so that we basically shouldn’t be talking about these meetings to   anybody in public or in private   In terms of meetings with individual financial market participants, I have already   instituted the practice of having somebody else in the room with me  It can be the head of our   supervision division, the head of the research division, or a communications officer, and the   reason is to make sure that absolutely nothing is being conveyed that’s not already in the public   domain  And I have become much more careful about footnoting speeches that I’ve previously   given to make it clear that it is already in the public domain, so that nothing being conveyed in   our discussion is different from what has already been said publicly either by me or provided in   the FOMC minutes  I think those are all important things to think about  I am in favor of them    I’ve already implemented them   In terms of the limitations to access, I do think some of it’s the frequency  If the same   person who potentially is closely monitoring the Fed is regularly meeting with you, even if   nothing is conveyed during those meetings, I think the appearance of very, very regular meetings   potentially is a problem  So I’ve also changed my practice in that respect—even with somebody   January 25–26, 2011 201 of 282              else in the room, I have tried to make sure that I don’t meet with the kind of regularity that would   in any way provide an appearance of undue access to any one individual or organization   In terms of centralized reporting, I think that could become very cumbersome  I’m   actually not opposed to it, but I have talked to some others who are less comfortable with it  The   one area where it might be useful to report press contacts centrally is if it’s only to one individual   news organization, or one individual reporter, just so that, if there is a leak, there will already be   a record within the organization that highlights whom you talk to and when  I wouldn’t expect   that it would be necessary, but it would provide a way to make sure we could quickly refer to   people’s logs and know who talked to what reporter when   In terms of interactions at conferences, I don’t think we want to limit that  I think it is   important to have social interactions  And when it is in a group setting or when press is there, it   is very unlikely to result in a problem  So I think that either at conferences or when media are   present, then I wouldn’t really be too concerned about who else is in the room  And I certainly   think that we should not speak to forums where there are only clients of an individual firm  That   definitely gives an appearance that you are giving financial gain to one organization  So there   have to be multiple organizations before I would be willing to do that    I think the questions were focused on the individuals that can   directly get financial gain, but I think that we should think about how it should apply potentially   to reporters as well  That’s my own personal view    No  In terms of financial gain, if I only talk to one Wall Street   Journal reporter every other month, and I didn’t talk to a New York Times reporter or a Fox   News reporter or a Bloomberg reporter, I think that would give an appearance of supporting one   news organization over other news organizations  So I do think that we have to be careful, to   some degree, to spread our access to the press around, just as we spread our access to potentially   interested financial parties around  But that’s my own personal view    A fundraiser for a nonprofit would be okay?    If the organizer invites only wealthy alumni from a university for   the sole purpose of raising the endowment of that university, do you think that would be okay?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, we have   received data which, after taking into account the noise created by inclement weather, seems   largely in line with what we had been expecting  What had not been anticipated at the last   meeting were the changes sweeping the Middle East that have contributed to higher oil prices or   the horrible tragedy unfolding in Japan  It’s probably too soon to know whether developments in   the Middle East will cause a temporary spike, which would have very little effect on the outlook,   or a more permanent change in the price of oil  However, assuming that oil prices remain   elevated and adding to that the greater degree of near-term fiscal restraint under discussion in   recent weeks, the net effect of these changes from the past meeting is to leave my inflation   forecast little changed, but to reduce somewhat my outlook for the future growth in the economy   Like the work presented in President Evans’s analysis, work done by Boston staff   suggests that the impact of the oil supply shocks will have minimal impact on the underlying   inflation rate in the medium term  This econometric result likely derives from a number of   factors  First, commodities account for a relatively small share of our economy, as a labor-  intensive service sector has become more important  Second, with longer-term inflation   expectations well anchored, perhaps due to the greater confidence in the Federal Reserve’s   commitment to controlling inflation, a change in the relative price of commodities is unlikely to   pass through into final goods prices  Finally, with significant slack in labor markets likely to   remain in the economy for some time, it is unlikely that rising commodity prices will have much   impact on wages and salaries   March 15, 2011 34 of 165              Together, these factors likely account for why over the past two decades even large food   and energy price movements have had minimal impact on underlying rates of inflation  Thus,   while recent food and energy shocks will cause total measures of inflation to diverge temporarily   from core, we expect total inflation to return to the core inflation rate over time, leaving little or   no imprint on the core inflation rate  Given that core measures remain well below 2 percent and   that there remains significant slack in the economy, I expect it to take some time before the   inflation rate settles at 2 percent   While the effects of oil price shocks on inflation are likely to be quite modest, they are   likely to have a contractionary effect on economic growth  Boston modeling implies that recent   increases in oil prices will shave roughly 04 percentage point off GDP growth and cause the   unemployment rate to be roughly 02 higher than it would be absent the oil shock  In addition, if   the Congress were to implement additional spending cuts this year of $50 billion, that would also   reduce GDP by roughly the same magnitude as the oil shock  While I’m pleased that the   incoming data have been broadly consistent with a mild recovery, the contractionary effects of   the oil shock and fiscal austerity, coupled with continued risks from housing, state and local   spending, and international events, have persuaded me that continued accommodative monetary   policy is necessary to support this modest recovery and to provide some insurance should any of   these risks materialize  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I also believe   we should complete the full $600 billion in the government securities purchase program  On   balance, the oil shock and fiscal austerity have not significantly altered my view on medium-  term inflation pressures but have made me somewhat more concerned about the strength of the   recovery   March 15, 2011 92 of 165              I would note that President Hoenig’s comments as well as the financial stability memo   have highlighted that agricultural land prices are rising quite rapidly in many farm states  I do   not believe that this is a reason to raise rates or to alter monetary policy  However, I do believe it   warrants careful supervisory scrutiny  Higher farmland prices are a reaction to improvements in   developing economies and their ability to spend more on importing food, as well as to a series of   disruptions that have hurt food production in other areas of the world  Tightening monetary   policy will do little to effect farmland prices, but it will almost surely make a slow recovery even   slower  While monetary policy is probably not appropriate for targeting agricultural and other   commodity prices that I do not expect to have broad effect on overall prices, as I discussed   earlier, supervisory policy could be quite effective in the case of surging agricultural land prices    Requiring higher underwriting standards for land purchases and requiring banks to conduct stress   tests to assess the adequacy of their capital in the event of a rapid reversal of farmland prices   does seem appropriate   In terms of the tapering that we had just discussed, I think it’s going to be very difficult to   actually have that communication strategy at this point, so my preference would be not to taper    What were going to be the formal choices that you have?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I think about exit strategy, my   philosophy would be driven by three guiding principles  First, tightening occurs when we shrink   our balance sheet or raise interest rates  If we were to choose to shrink the balance sheet in the   late fall, as in the Tealbook, that would, in effect, be our first monetary policy tightening, even   April 26–27, 2011 61 of 244              though the federal funds rate would still be at the zero bound  In my view, the start of any   tightening action should be primarily focused on when, looking ahead two to three years, the   tightening is needed to prevent us from overshooting our inflation or employment mandate    Second, returning to more traditional monetary policy is desirable and requires shrinking the   balance sheet  We should shrink the balance sheet in a way consistent with achieving the right   macroeconomic outcome  In the short run, that probably means relying on a floor system  And   third, while returning to an all-Treasury portfolio is a long-term goal, it should not be a short-  term goal  Given the fragility of the housing market, I would not sell any of the mortgage-  backed securities until after we have commenced raising short-term interest rates   So how would I apply these principles to the actual sequencing?  Once tightening was   appropriate to avoid overshooting on inflation or employment mandates, I would start by   allowing mortgage-backed securities to roll off the balance sheet as they matured, which would   begin the process of shrinking the balance sheet  After determining the impact of not reinvesting   the proceeds for mortgage-backed securities on long-term interest rates and the economy, and   assuming further tightening was appropriate, I would begin allowing both Treasury and   mortgage-backed securities to roll off the balance sheet as the securities matured  If even more   tightening was necessary, I would consider selling short-dated Treasury securities, which would   reduce our balance sheet more quickly without realizing significant capital losses or having as   large an effect on long rates or mortgage-backed securities   If we use a rough rule of thumb that’s a little bit more conservative than what was   discussed before—$250 billion in excess reserve reductions as roughly equivalent to a 25 basis   point reduction of the federal funds rate—we have roughly six 25 basis point increases in   balance sheet reductions  Should the economy falter, we could slow down redemptions, and if   April 26–27, 2011 62 of 244              further tightening was appropriate, we could speed up the time we would return to a normalized   size for the balance sheet  Given the natural runoffs in the balance sheet once we begin the   redemptions, the balance sheet does begin to shrink relatively quickly if we allow both Treasury   and mortgage-backed securities to run off, as the Chairman earlier observed   If even more tightening is necessary before our balance sheet size has normalized, we   would begin by raising interest on excess reserves  Given the Tealbook forecast, I can imagine   this would be necessary a year or more after we begin the redemption process  I would use the   interest on excess reserves as our principal short-term interest rate until we had normalized the   balance sheet  After we had normalized the size of our balance sheet and begun raising interest   rates, I would commence with sales of mortgage-backed securities  However, depending on   housing conditions, the status of Freddie and Fannie, and our willingness to realize capital losses,   I could imagine extending the asset sales to be more gradual and to have an all-Treasuries   portfolio by 2020   In terms of the four questions asked, for the first one, I am fine with reinvesting the   principal payments from agency securities, but as I just mentioned, I would stagger it  I would   start with mortgage-backed securities and then let the Treasury securities roll off  The reason I   want to shrink the balance sheet is that I have somewhat more uncertainty about how the tools   are going to work with large excess balances, so I would actually prefer a strategy that gets our   balance sheet to shrink initially, just to have more certainty about how our short-run tools are   going to work   In terms of the second question, I think we could conduct it much the way we did the   increase in securities  We would announce a reduction in the balance sheet over a fixed period   of time, but it would be conditioned on what the economic outcomes were, and we could change   April 26–27, 2011 63 of 244              either the time or the amount, but the presumption would be that we wouldn’t change it unless   something relatively significant had occurred   In terms of sequencing in the third question, one of the challenges is that sequencing in   part does depend on conditions  So if we’re going to have a very gradual tightening, then a   strategy of asset redemption may actually take care of, at least initially, some of the tightening   that we would need to do  If it needs to be more rapid, then we have to include not only asset   redemptions, but also the interest on excess reserves going up   And in terms of the three statements in the fourth question, despite all of us having   guiding principles that are different, I think we all agree on all three of the statements    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The judgment on the data since our last   meeting is a split decision  Labor markets are improving, albeit slowly, but spending is slower   than I expected  Most of the good news has come from the labor markets  Payroll employment   in recent months is growing at a rate consistent with a gradual decline in the unemployment rate    The unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point over the past four months, to   88 percent, lower than I expected last fall   This improvement in the labor market is still not affecting labor costs, with wages and   salaries growing quite slowly  The quiescence in wages and salaries is consistent with   substantial slack in the labor market  This assessment of slack is consistent with the significant   April 26–27, 2011 112 of 244              revision in the JOLTS data, which now show many fewer vacancies over the past five years    The revision was primarily a result of reestimating the birth-death model, which had   overestimated the number of new firms and job openings being created during the crisis  The   very low quit rate also suggests that considerable slack remains in the labor market  A worker   concerned about the outlook would be reticent to quit a job for fear of the inability to secure   better employment elsewhere  While the quit rate has risen off its lows, it remains substantially   below its level after the last recession  With existing workers reticent to move and the low   participation rate indicating that opportunities are not attracting workers back into the labor   market, we need much more improvement in labor markets than we have seen to date   While progress in labor markets has been slower than I hoped but more than I forecast,   recent data on spending have been slower than I hoped and less than I forecast  GDP growth   over the past four quarters has averaged only 28 percent, just slightly above potential  At the   beginning of the year, I had expected growth in the first quarter to be well above potential, but   now it looks as if growth will fall well short of that   Over the past four months, most forecasters have been revising down their first-quarter   estimate with each new data release  Like many of these forecasters, I have been surprised by   weaker-than-expected consumption, housing, and state and local spending  A key question is    Given the surprise in incoming data and the likelihood of more fiscal tightening than I originally   expected, how much of this weakness should be carried into future quarters?  While I’m   assuming that this is a lull rather than a trend, the strength in spending for this year is in the   forecast but has yet to be reflected in the data   Despite the significant food and energy shocks, my estimate of core inflation, like that of   the Tealbook, remains well below 2 percent over the forecast period  I focus on core inflation   April 26–27, 2011 113 of 244              because over the period from 1985 to the present, whenever total inflation has diverged from   core inflation, total has tended to return to core, perhaps consistent with well-anchored   expectations  While we need to continue to monitor inflation expectations and inflation trends,   the evidence to date is consistent with inflation over the forecast horizon remaining under 2   percent   Like the Tealbook, my forecast has an unemployment rate at the end of 2013 well above   full employment, and core and total PCE inflation well below 2 percent  However, my forecast   achieves this outcome with a federal funds rate that remains at the zero bound longer than   assumed in the Tealbook  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  Given the   weakness in spending over this quarter, there remains significant uncertainty about the strength   of the recovery  Furthermore, by the end of 2013, I expect unemployment to be too high and   inflation to be too low, even assuming completion of the Treasury securities purchase program   and keeping the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound longer than in the Tealbook   I continue to see many downside risks to the outlook  Problems in Europe, fiscal   austerity measures, tightening in emerging markets, and weakness in the first quarter in   consumption, local government spending, and housing could spill over into future quarters  Any   one of these factors could exert enough drag on future growth to put my forecast at serious risk   Given the low inflation rate, we have plenty of room to encourage faster growth in the   economy  I hope the economy is strong enough that we can begin removing accommodation by   allowing redemptions in the late fall, but that depends on receiving stronger data than we have   seen so far this year   In terms of language, I share President Evans’s concern—I actually like the previous   language in that sentence better     My preference would be to have no timing in this set of principles    This is a sequence discussion, and I’m very comfortable with the sequence, but I’m less   comfortable the more we tie it to timing  And the more we tie it to timing, the harder it’s going   to be to get a consensus on when the timing should start  So I think we should think carefully   about hardwiring the timing  The more language we put in here that gets into timing, the more   likely it is that we are going to have a discontinuity  I really think this should be a sequencing,   not a timing, discussion   June 21–22, 2011 44 of 282               I agree with Governor Tarullo  The goal is to communicate   sequence but maintain the flexibility to react to changes in economic conditions  I’m very   comfortable with the sequence that’s laid out in this memo, but I prefer basically no time   subscripts in the document  So let me just give one example  My own personal preference   would be to shrink the balance sheet first and allow time to pass so that the ability to affect   interest rates is enhanced  If instead we decide to tie the end of reinvesting to the ending of   forward guidance, I would then want to end the reinvesting at a later time than I would if they   were not tied  So my personal preference would be, for example, in paragraph 3, to change the   phrase “At the same time or relatively soon thereafter,” and make that the word “next,” so it   would read, “Next, the Committee will modify its forward guidance”  And then in paragraph 5,   in the second line, I’d like to take out “probably within a few months” and just leave the actual   timing to be figured out, depending on economic conditions    I’m comfortable with the document  I could go with it as it is, but   my preference would be to take out the time dimension    I have one question on the downgrade risk of Bank of America and   Citigroup  Let’s use Bank of America as an example because it has Merrill Lynch underneath it    If Bank of America were to lose its A1/P1 status, would that affect its ability to serve as an   investment bank?  This may be too detailed—and if so I can take it offline—but are we   concerned about the investment bank model under bank holding companies if A1/P1 status is   lost?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to thank the staff for a very   comprehensive overview of financial stability issues and for getting it to us early enough that we   could actually digest it for this meeting  I plan to expand on a theme that has been emphasized   already in the briefing materials and has been an area of focus both at the Board and elsewhere in   the System; it concerns the continuing risk posed by the structure of money market mutual funds    Money market mutual funds played a pivotal role in the disruptions to short-term credit markets   during the crisis  During the crisis, a credit loss resulting from Lehman at a non-bank-sponsored   prime money market fund caused a run on money market funds more generally and evaporated   their demand for short-term credit instruments  I fear they could play a similar role were   European problems to evolve in unexpected ways   Let me be more specific about my concerns  If one looks at the top-yielding prime   money market funds on June 7, their gross yield ranges from 37 to 44 basis points—a very   healthy yield for 2a-7 funds that are restricted on both maturity and duration of assets  However,   of these 12 funds, 9 funds yielded a net return of 3 basis points or less for investors  As a result,   taking less risk would not affect the investors who are only receiving 1 to 3 basis points, but   would have an effect on the management fees  Of the 12 high-yielding prime funds, only 1 was   sponsored by a bank, and it is 1 of only 2 funds to experience growth year to date among those   12  The 4 smallest funds experienced double-digit declines in assets under management   How are these prime money market funds obtaining such high gross yields?  In part, it is   by taking credit risk, including to European financial institutions  Let me give just one example    June 21–22, 2011 98 of 282              The highest-gross-yielding fund has taken a large position in Dexia CDs yielding 66 basis points,   while the Ambassador Money Market Fund—the only fund to see significant year-to-date growth   among these 12—holds a substantial stake in Dexia commercial paper  Dexia is partly a Belgian   and French government-owned bank and has recent five-year credit default swap quotes of   326 basis points, more than double that of Citigroup and Bank of America, who we discussed   earlier for possible downgrades  Dexia has a €43 billion direct exposure to Greece and is on   credit watch for being downgraded  Note that money market fund investments are intended to be   invested in highly liquid, low-credit-risk assets  The high credit default swap rates on European   banks that are among the assets held by money market funds indicate that many financial market   participants view these as having significant credit risk   While the outcome of events in Europe is unclear, it seems that some money market   funds are making investment decisions partly based on expectations of European government   support, not unlike the assumption that was a problem for the Reserve Fund when Lehman failed   without government support  However, taking credit risk with a promise of a fixed net asset   value means that if they are right, they get high management fees, but if they are wrong, they risk   another serious disruption to short-term credit markets in the United States  This may be a   particularly acute risk given the examples I provided of funds with exposure to Dexia  Both of   these funds are managed by small, independent asset managers that may not be capable of   providing the noncontractual sponsor support that has served as the primary backstop to this   industry   What can we do to reduce this financial stability risk?  A group of academics that met at   Squam Lake have suggested capital buffers that convert funds to floating-rate NAVs if the   capital buffer is breached  There are a variety of other suggestions, but two and a half years after   June 21–22, 2011 99 of 282              the run on money market funds, there still has been no agreement  Given the risk to financial   stability, the Federal Reserve should be actively advocating for more progress on this issue  The   Chairman and several Presidents have raised this as an issue publicly  I would hope that we will   strongly encourage the SEC to take action, and, in the absence of a major change, to try to use   the FSOC to encourage more aggressive action  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I would be interested, Mr Chairman, from your own perspective, in   how the FSOC is working and how that process is going  Do you have any observations?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, my business   contacts in New England have turned surprisingly negative  This negative sentiment particularly   pertains to smaller businesses that are not seeing significant increases in demand and are   deciding to put off additional hiring or investments until it is clear that we have a more self-  sustaining recovery  When I press these business leaders on the causes for their change in   sentiment, they focus on domestic, not international, concerns, and particularly cite that   incoming data continue to surprise on the downside, and they do not see what will turn that   around  Unfortunately, I share the disappointment with the incoming data  For most of this   recovery, the Boston forecast, like many other forecasts, has expected that in a couple of   quarters, economic growth would pick up  However, with each additional quarter we keep   pushing back when the self-sustaining recovery begins  Since the beginning of the recovery, we   have only grown slightly above potential, and our forecasts have been too optimistic, resulting in   serially correlated errors   What accounts for the inability of this recovery to make significant headway in reducing   the significant slack in the economy?  First, I think we have underestimated the financial   headwinds generated by the financial crisis  The impaired balance sheet of many consumers and   June 21–22, 2011 111 of 282              businesses reduces their access to capital and makes them sufficiently risk averse that they are   not anxious to take risks even if loans are available  Second, our housing policies have been   unsuccessful  Housing prices are unlikely to rise as long as there’s a large overhang of vacant   and foreclosed homes  We need policies that return people to sustainable housing situations but   quickly remove the inventory of unsold homes  Housing is one of the sources of serially   correlated errors in the forecast, and our research suggests those errors explain a significant   fraction of recent forecast errors, a greater fraction than can be explained by housing’s share in   GDP or its obvious connection to household durable goods purchases  Third, more recently we   have underestimated the move to more austerity at local, state, and federal levels   What’s my current forecast?  Well, the Boston forecast, once again, foresees an   acceleration in economic growth in a couple of quarters  And while it’s technically a self-  sustaining recovery, the growth rates we envision in the out quarters continue to slip lower and   lower  While such acceleration is our best guess, I am becoming less and less confident that we   will actually get that outcome, and even with that forecast of accelerating growth, I’m expecting   the unemployment rate to remain above 8 percent at the end of 2012   So what about inflation?  The DSGE models presented earlier had inflation in 2013   ranging from 03 percent to 15 percent  The Tealbook has inflation measured as core or total   PCE at 15 percent in 2012  The Boston inflation forecast is a little below the Tealbook forecast    Thus, despite some increase in core inflation from extremely low levels, these forecasts all   expect us to be well below 2 percent at the end of the forecast period  I would also note that   some of the increase in current measured inflation is related to higher measures of owners’   equivalent rent  This is striking given that mortgage rates have fallen, housing prices have fallen,   and foreclosures remain elevated  So at a time of increasing affordability for new home buyers,   June 21–22, 2011 112 of 282              their reticence or inability to purchase new homes has caused a shift to rentals  I would view this   as reflecting more the dysfunction of the current housing market than any significant risk that   inflation in the medium term was at risk of breaching my target of 2 percent   If these forecasts are right, we will continue to miss on both elements of our mandate for   several more years  What about the risks to this forecast?  I see significant risks to the downside,   but I will focus only on one, the international risk  While the Europeans may manage a   temporary infusion of money for Greece, I am seeing little evidence of significant mitigation of   the underlying problem  The primary deficit remains problematic  The debt-to-GDP ratio   continues to rise, there seems to be limited political tolerance for more austerity in Greece, and   the political desire in the rest of Europe to subsidize Greece seems to be ebbing with the passing   of time  Given my modal forecast and assessment of risks, it’s critically important that the   economy begin to grow above potential  Tomorrow I will discuss the implications of this   assessment for an appropriate monetary policy that balances all of the risks in the economic   recovery  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I discussed yesterday, we have been   missing on both elements of our mandate for several years  And according to the Tealbook, the   Boston forecast, or the DSGE models in the presentation yesterday, we will be missing for many   more  Economic growth at potential, when inflation is too low and unemployment too high,   should not be acceptable  Unless we begin to see clear evidence of a self-sustaining recovery   above and beyond the temporary surge we expect next quarter as disruptions from Japan and   energy prices abate, our focus should be on what additional stimulus should be considered at   future meetings   Alternative A provides more clarity around the size of our balance sheet and the first   increase in short-term interest rates  Another option would be to reduce the interest rate on   excess reserves to zero  This would provide some marginal incentive for banks to lend  One of   the concerns with eliminating interest on reserves was the effect on money market funds  Given   that money market funds are already placing many of their assets in Europe, and that the possible   exit of smaller, less viable money market funds may make financial markets more stable, this   option seems more attractive than it once did  A third option is to lengthen the duration of our   security purchases  Should the economy start growing less than potential with the   unemployment rate rising and the inflation rate declining, we would need to consider additional   asset purchases  My hope is that at this time, the forecast of a self-sustaining recovery becomes   June 21–22, 2011 171 of 282              a reality  However, if we continue to be disappointed, the longer-term impact of substantial   slack and low inflation rates should not be underestimated  Given the relatively unsupportive   fiscal policy we expect, we need to ensure that we are able to fulfill our mandate within an   acceptable period of time   In terms of language, I want to follow up on Dennis’s comment  We don’t publish the   balance of risks  So I think another thing for Janet’s subcommittee to consider is whether the   charts on balance of risk might also be something that we would start providing publicly  I agree   with Dennis that the risks to GDP growth did change quite substantially in the charts that were   handed out yesterday, and that the charts showed that the risks for inflation have become more   balanced  One way to capture that would be to take the third sentence from paragraph 2 in   alternative A, which says, “The Committee perceives that the downside risks to the economic   outlook have increased somewhat”  I think that captures what is embedded in those pictures  In   your press conference you are likely to either be asked or talk about what our exit strategy is  I   think it’s important to balance that with the reality of the downside risks that this Committee   sees, and that I think the public at large sees  It will help emphasize the fact that the purpose of   talking about the exit strategy is to say that, when appropriate, we have the tools necessary  But   right now is not the time to be actually employing those tools, because we are concerned about   the economic outlook  So the only change to language would be to take that one sentence and   place it in the same spot in alternative B  Thank you, Mr Chairman    This is meant to be a guideline, and it’s not a substitute for   common sense, so I think we have to remember that common sense needs to play a significant   role in how we apply this  The goal is not to stifle research, but if the policy conclusion from   research is, “At the next meeting, they should raise rates,” well, that probably is going to be a   problem  But if instead they say, “The path implied by the model is this,” that probably is not   going to be a problem  I think the research directors can spend some time thinking about some   examples that apply common sense in a reasonable way, but I think part of it is tied to the   specificity  There is a risk to the organization if anyone in the organization, at least from the   perception of the press, can speak broadly for the organization  There is reputational risk that   this is partly trying to address  The San Francisco commentary series is a great place to put   comments on how we’re thinking about models  But if instead of putting it on the commentary   series, one person who sells his own forecast to hedge funds gets the idea that “This is the way   the San Francisco Fed and the Fed in general is thinking about things,” and it’s not common   knowledge, and he goes and sells that knowledge to a hedge fund, that is a reputational risk to   the organization  The solution to that is having satisfactory outlets so that the public at large can   see these types of things rather than giving commercial advantage to any one person or   organization  Again, I think we can come up with some commonsense solutions that reduce our   risk as an organization that we look like we’re giving preferential treatment at times to   individuals or organizations  That’s more what it’s designed to do than in any way stifle the   ability of the research community to do good research and to publicly explain it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m pretty comfortable with the   suggested approach of the treatment of government securities in Bill and Brian’s memo   August 1, 2011 24 of 53              In terms of President Kocherlakota’s comment on defaulted securities, discussion with   asset managers in Boston seemed to indicate that there’s really no prohibition on holding   defaulted government securities by most asset managers, and I think we should have the same   policy  I don’t think it’s at variance with private-market practice; I think, in fact, it’s actually   consistent with private-market practice   In terms of market functioning, when temporary political dysfunctions result in a   tightening of policies that affect other private-market participants, I think that is undesirable   I would just make two other quick comments  One is that I think it is interesting to see   which banks are becoming capital constrained  Another is that, as we think about SIFI   surcharges and the role of some of our clearing banks, getting a better understanding of what the   flow of funds to these organizations is may be useful in thinking about what kind of capital   standards we might want to set for these institutions   In terms of the role of money market funds, I think our concern right now highlights the   need to be sure that we move toward getting a more stable regulatory environment for money   market funds more generally  It’s been a couple of years since the crisis  The SEC has been   moving at a rather leisurely pace, and rather than coming up with alternative ways to deal with   the money market fund problem here, I think we should be continuing to apply pressure to try to   get a more stable solution, because I think right now we’re in a situation where problems in the   money market funds, problems with our own political dysfunction, and problems in Europe have   at least the potential to triangulate in a way that is very, very undesirable  While it looks like   some of the issues with the debt ceiling are going to be resolved relatively quickly, I think it does   highlight that money market fund disruptions have broader impacts because of the assets they’ve   been holding  This is occurring in an environment where they’re already very rapidly reducing   August 1, 2011 25 of 53              their holdings of European credits, and I think, depending on what we did, we could’ve   potentially seriously exacerbated what’s happening in Europe, and I think we want to avoid that    So in terms of the money market funds, I’d rather be talking about a longer-run solution and less   about short-term facilities  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was struck over the weekend by how   many articles mentioned the word “recession” while describing the economic outlook, and that   was before the opening of financial markets on Monday  The memo from Vice Chairman   Dudley highlights how much the deterioration in incoming data since the spring has increased   the New York Fed’s estimate of the probability of recession  Many private-sector economists,   using similar models, come to similar conclusions  With real GDP for the first two quarters of   the year averaging less than 1 percent, it is not surprising that these models are predicting an   elevated recession probability, even ignoring intangibles such as congressional dysfunction,   European political dysfunction, and the first downgrade of the United States in recent history   Recent data have been sufficiently downbeat that a relatively weak employment report is   now viewed as a source of good news  Yet, with the employment-to-population ratio the lowest   since 1983, there should be little rejoicing  It is interesting to note that even those with higher   educational attainment had significant declines in their employment-to-population ratios  When   talking to people around New England, I hear that the only bright spot seems to be rental   August 9, 2011 49 of 162              housing  Buyers not convinced their home prices will increase, buyers with little or no equity for   a down payment, buyers no longer qualifying for credit, and possibly a sectoral shift away from   homeownership have all contributed to an improving rental market  However, those same   factors would indicate that the most interest-sensitive component of GDP, residential investment,   is less sensitive to interest rate movements, requiring larger movements to have an effect   Housing finance is not the only area that has been disrupted  Concerns about the debt   ceiling and European financial difficulties have prompted investors to expand already substantial   cash holdings  As money market funds have significantly increased liquidity, indicators of dollar   funding problems, such as the three-month currency swap rate, indicate an increase in dollar   funding problems for European banks  When European banks have trouble rolling funds with   money market funds, they often return to the swap market to satisfy their dollar funding needs    Stock prices for European and domestic banks have declined substantially  In fact, Bank of   America shares yesterday closed at under $7 a share, a low not seen since the bad old days of   2009  Their credit default swap rate was over 200  Note that with possible downgrades,   uncertainty about lawsuits, and further deterioration in housing prices, there remains a possibility   that the next financial shock could still be generated by a large, troubled domestic bank   Given the large degree of resource slack in the economy, it is quite possible that the   inflation rate will soon be falling  Businesses are worried and labor markets are weak—not an   environment conducive to increases in prices or wages  The Michigan survey measures of   inflation expectations, both short term and longer term, were down  In fact, the Tealbook   forecasts that both total and core PCE inflation will hover at 14 percent by the end of 2012    Models at the Boston Fed expect inflation to be a bit lower  The evolution of the forecast in the   Tealbook since the spring has been striking  The economic growth forecast has been materially   August 9, 2011 50 of 162              reduced, and unemployment is now expected to remain quite elevated through the forecast   period  Inflation is forecast to remain well below 2 percent in the medium term  I unfortunately   concur with this outlook  I fear that, in fact, we are currently underestimating the risk of a   recession, given the change in domestic and foreign financial conditions  I concur with   Governor Tarullo that this may require a more flexible and innovative approach to our policy   discussion  Thank you    There is a two-hander   August 9, 2011 100 of 162               Thank you, Mr Chairman  The staff studies on additional   monetary policy options were quite helpful  I would find it both timely and helpful to explore   these options in detail, as, to date we have spent far more time managing risks associated with   the exit strategy than managing the risks associated with the need for additional stimulus    Unfortunately, we do not have time in a one-day meeting to fully discuss the memos  I strongly   support the September meeting being two days to more fully map out action should the economy   continue along this path  In particular, it would be useful to try to roughly calibrate the effects of   the various policy options  If we are looking to have an impact equivalent to at least a 25 basis   point cut in the federal funds rate, which combination of staff suggestions meets this hurdle?    That way, the Committee could more clearly evaluate the options based on the impacts on the   economy and the difficulties in unwinding the policy when that became appropriate  This would   allow a better assessment of the costs and benefits of further accommodation options  I’m   increasingly worried that what we viewed as a tail occurrence is becoming the most likely   outcome, and we have not yet fully prepared for the policy options should that result   If we were not at the zero bound, I have little doubt that we would today be considering   at least a 25 basis point easing  Most of the reaction functions discussed in the Tealbook B,   imply that we should be easier than we were in June  I am not certain that alternative A provides   August 9, 2011 102 of 162              the best way to achieve further easing  I fear that the change in language we have discussed does   little to signal further easing  It says that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate are   likely to be maintained at least through mid-2013, but this matches the path of the federal funds   rate that the market already expects, as described on page 53 of Tealbook A  A statement that   matches current market expectations is not likely to have much of an effect on market rates   My own sequencing of accommodation would be as follows  Step 1, I would announce a   fixed ceiling on Treasury securities through 2012 and a fixed floor on the balance sheet through   2012, with an escape clause if the unemployment rate falls unexpectedly below 7½ percent or the   core inflation rate unexpectedly rises above 2½ percent  I would couple this with lowering the   interest on reserves 25 basis points  Foreign branches hold many of the reserves, and reserves   pay 25 basis points while three-month Treasury bills have paid close to zero  This amounts to a   subsidy for foreign branches  I see no reason to subsidize foreign branches with our interest on   reserves, and coupled with the new language, I would expect this would amount to the equivalent   of a 25 basis point easing  Should further easing be necessary, I would extend the period of the   ceiling on Treasury securities and the floor on our balance sheet with communication that the   floor and ceiling would continue unless the unemployment or inflation triggers were reached    We could continue to extend out the period of ceilings and floors until we had greater confidence   of achieving desirable monetary policy goals  If the floor and ceiling were extended to three   years and more accommodation was still needed, I would begin by first extending the maturity of   the SOMA holdings by exchanging short-term securities for long-term securities  If that proved   insufficient, I would then expand our balance sheet with purchases of longer-maturity securities   In an unconstrained world, I would take step 1 today  Given the limited time to fully   discuss alternative options, I would prefer to take all of the language in alternative A but exclude   August 9, 2011 103 of 162              paragraph 4  I would include Governor Yellen’s language, and I would actually use core   inflation of 2½ percent as the second trigger  I view Governor Yellen’s proposal as changing   something that is highly conditional to something that’s unconditional unless the triggers are hit,   and so I think it is a much stronger statement to use Governor Yellen’s language  Now, we’ve   somewhat boxed ourselves in by using inflation at the medium term because we’re talking about   a short period of time, and we’re talking about inflation  We’re in effect trying to forecast oil   prices  So I would use core inflation at 2½ percent to take care of President Evans’s concern    And I would use core inflation, but since I doubt I will get consensus on that, I would be   comfortable with Governor Yellen’s language  Thank you    If you’re going to take three dissents, then I think we should go to   the language of alternative A and take out paragraph 4, because I think there was enough support   for that  So if they’re going to dissent anyway, I think we should have much stronger language,   because I think that was the consensus of everybody else other than the people who are   dissenting  If they really feel so strongly about that, I think we should go to alternative A, take   out paragraph 4, and that would characterize how everybody else is viewing the economy    But take out the—    1, 2, and 3     Yes, thank you very much for a very complete set of memos  I do   have a question on the interest on excess reserves memo—probably not surprising  After   rereading your memo again this morning, I looked at the H8 for foreign-related institutions in   the United States, and the cash assets, which include reserves, were $943 billion; Treasury   securities, were roughly $100 billion  I can’t from that look at how much excess reserves are   actually being held  Do you have the percent of excess reserves actually being held at branches   and agencies?    Ballpark?    Half of the excess reserves of the foreign branches—    Just a second part to that question  There’s been a big change in   how foreign branches have been used in the United States  A year ago in August, they were   supplying $323 billion over to Europe or over to their parents, which is more typical  They tend   to raise funds in the United States, and send it over to their parent  More recently, though, that’s   reversed, and it was a $500 billion switch between last year and this year  So they’re now   September 20–21, 2011 22 of 290              receiving on that September 7 date $238 billion from the parent  That’s a very big swing  As I   was trying to understand why that swing would occur—and President Lacker’s observation is   relevant—I noted that three-month T-bills are paying 1 basis point; six-month T-bills, 2 basis   points; and a two-year Treasury is paying 16 basis points, very close to the 20 basis points that   he mentioned  If, for example, a French bank is holding two-year Treasury securities at 20 basis   points in order to be able to meet potential liquidity needs but has an option with a branch to hold   reserves at 25 basis points in the United States, then it seems as though the strategy would be to   sell the two-year Treasury security and put the funds in a branch getting 25 basis points  By   doing so, they get a higher return and reduce the duration risk of their portfolio, and that seems to   be reducing the demand for medium-term Treasury securities because they’re choosing to hold   overnight reserves paying a higher return with lower duration risk rather than holding medium-  term Treasury securities  To what extent is our holding the reserve rate so high having an impact   that is counter to what we’re trying to do with medium-term Treasury securities?  Is it   discouraging demand for medium-term Treasury securities, particularly by foreign banking   organizations?  Do you have any observations on whether you’re seeing that kind of trend   actually occurring?  And to what degree do you think that’s important?    Yes  That sounds consistent with the kind of story I was telling    You might argue, though, that the optics of paying a very high   return on an overnight fund to a foreign banking organization are a little bit different    The optics would show, I think, paying a very substantial premium   that’s higher than what they could get on a two-year  I don’t know if people are going to be as   worried about it for a domestic entity, but if it was widely understood that it was for a foreign   banking organization, particularly because this is an important tool for us when we are exiting,   you do wonder whether it undermines our willingness to be able to use this tool in the future if   September 20–21, 2011 24 of 290              people start being concerned about what its effect is on potentially subsidizing foreign   organizations    One more observation on interest on excess reserves  I did spend   some time talking to asset managers over the past month, and on the retail side, a company like   Fidelity already gives you an option to sweep into an FDIC-insured account  So for the retail,   you already have an option outside of the government or the prime money market fund  At the   wholesale level, the way they described it to me is it’s like selling turkeys at Thanksgiving—you   sell turkeys under cost, but you care about the fact that the entire shopping cart is full—and so   they think of an account as a suite of assets that people are actually doing  The government   securities money market fund pays 1 basis point at Fidelity and roughly that at almost all the   others, but they’re interested in the suite of assets that the people put in  They need a place to   park the funds  Their indication to me was that it wouldn’t change their behavior very much    They aren’t going to lower the rate below zero, but they do view it as a loss leader for the other   services  So I’m not sure it’s going to be quite as disruptive as the memo indicated—at least the   perspective from the asset managers I talked to   And just an observation on the negative interest rate  BONY did announce its negative   interest rate  Shortly after that, the stock price dropped, the CEO left the company, customers   complained, and no other custody bank chose to follow suit  I would say that I’ve talked to two   September 20–21, 2011 28 of 290              custody banks, and they’re gleeful at the negative interest rate  So I’m not sure that is actually a   trendsetter for other organizations  Just an observation that I’m not as worried about that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll follow in the order that the   questions were sent to us   For question 1(a), I do think the maturity extension program is a useful tool  The   estimates of the effect of the maturity extension provided by staff seem quite reasonable  In   talking with financial market participants, they have suggested that the expectation of policy   action of this type is one of the reasons that long-term Treasuries and mortgage rates declined so   much recently  I agree with the comments of several of my predecessors, though, that it’s a one-  time action, and so we’re going to need to deploy additional tools if we see a financial crisis or   the probability of deflation rising substantially  I think it’s a sensible one-time thing to do, but it   is a one-time thing to do   In terms of question 1(b), on the interest on excess reserves, I think that through my   questioning it was probably pretty clear what my view was  I do worry about the optics—that so   much of it’s being held at foreign branches  I do think it helps signaling that we’re serious about   keeping rates low for quite a while  And I do believe it’ll have a fairly modest effect, but given   the signaling and optics, we should think about it  It’s a one-time thing, and if we’re doing one-  time things, this would seem to be the appropriate time to think about it   In terms of question 2(a), I think it is useful to make clear that we are intending to restore   the economy over time to 2 percent inflation and an unemployment rate in a range of 5 to   6 percent, consistent with our forecast submissions  We’ve already stated in the SEP that that is   what we’re expecting to do in the longer run  And I don’t think there will be a big impact from   that, but it’s probably useful to do it   September 20–21, 2011 55 of 290              To the extent that we could be more transparent about our reaction function, a question in   2(b), I think that would also be useful, not only to the public but also to our own deliberations,   where it’s sometimes not as clear as it should be whether our policy positions reflect differences   in our forecast, differences in our long-run objective, or differences in our reaction function    Getting more clarity around this table about which of those three things that we disagree on   actually would help edify everybody and maybe help us have a more focused discussion   In terms of 2(c), I’m actually not bothered by paragraphs 2 and 4  I think they’re   reasonable—other than that they’re in alternative A rather than alternative B  But if I were to   make a suggestion, I would combine 2 and 4 and maybe focus on three elements, particularly   given that, as several people have noted, we haven’t had time to communicate a long-run   inflation target of 2 percent and to have some of the communications  But we do have the SEP   projections, and if we were to do something like this conditional language at this meeting, or a   meeting soon thereafter, I think it is reasonable, until we have had time to communicate, to focus   on the SEP projections and on highlighting that 2 percent or a little bit below and unemployment   of 5 to 6 percent—that has not changed  Also, how consistent is it with the objectives and our   forecast?   And finally, to the extent that we can make our reaction function clear, I think that’s   useful  Several people seem to be talking about an inflation target as if it’s an inflation ceiling;   my understanding of an inflation target is it’s just that—it’s a target that is the midpoint, it’s not   a ceiling  If it is a midpoint, that means at times we would tolerate inflation that’s a little bit   higher, and at times we would tolerate inflation that’s a little bit lower  Particularly at times   when we’re very far away from where we think the unemployment rate should be, it would be   reasonable to take more risk on getting the inflation rate a little bit higher  And we could argue   September 20–21, 2011 56 of 290              whether the appropriate range was 1½ to 2½ or 1 to 3 percent, but I think it’s actually quite   consistent with what already is embedded in how we have described the inflation target   I do think that if we’re moving to be very explicit about inflation being 2 percent, we   would need to have a conversation with the Congress  Over time, I would hope that we’d   gravitate away from the SEP projections to being more explicit about what our longer-run goals   are  But that would take more time  That’s all I have     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am heartened by how many members   are following the Red Sox  [Laughter]    But I must say that I am disheartened that the staff probability of a   recession increasingly exceeds the probability of the Red Sox winning the pennant  [Laughter]   After the last meeting I was struck by how responsive the longer-term Treasury rates   were to our announcement of maintaining very low rates through the middle of 2013  It   highlighted the important role that forward guidance can play as we navigate this very difficult   period  Unfortunately, the continuing debate in Europe on a way forward and a string of weak   economic reports in the United States caused the 10-year Treasury to fall further  For much of   the past month, the 10-year Treasury has been at 2 percent or a little bit less  Similarly, the   10-year rate in Germany has been below 2 percent, and the Japanese 10-year rate has been at   1 percent  This does not seem like an environment in which market participants are focused on   inflation in the United States or other developed countries  My interpretation of this is that most   market participants’ worry index is ordered as follows  The highest concern is about another   possible financial crisis, most likely triggered by European problems; the next-highest concern is   for the very weak economic and labor market data we continue to receive; and a rather distant   third is inflation  My own ordering is identical   My biggest concern is that we will have at least a serious threat of a financial crisis this   fall  I have talked previously about money market funds  However, it’s not only the threat of   investor runs that causes money market funds to have a significant impact on our short-term   credit markets; even without a rapid withdrawal of investors, the money market funds have still   dramatically reallocated funds away from some European banks  This move away from risk is a   perfectly rational response for a lower-credit-risk investment  However, the consequence of   money market funds’ withdrawal from European banks has highlighted another key weakness in   short-term credit markets—the reliance of European bank branches on short-term dollar funding   September 20–21, 2011 124 of 290              for long-term dollar assets  As money market funds and other investors have shrunk as a source   of short-term dollar funding, the maturity of funding has shortened significantly, and in some   cases, peripheral banks have been entirely shut out of short-term wholesale funding  The   wholesale funding of dollar assets with increasingly short-term funds is all too reminiscent of the   SIV problem experienced in 2007   We need to make structural changes in our short-term credit markets so that US dollar   markets are no longer hostage to European credit risk  Structural changes in foreign branch   wholesale funding could avoid some of these problems  My preference in the longer run would   be to require full subsidiarization of all US operations of foreign banks  But in the absence of   that, we should be considering more-restrictive supervisory and regulatory oversight of branches   to prevent their funding model from being destabilizing to the US economy  However, we still   have significant weakness among some of our largest institutions  Bank of America and Morgan   Stanley both have credit default swap rates above 300  Should significant credit rating   downgrades occur in the midst of a European crisis, I am concerned about how quickly their   liquidity will disappear   We’ve been taking unprecedented actions with monetary policy  I would strongly   advocate that we consider whether the same sense of urgency is occurring around financial   stability and bank supervision  The recent announcement on providing dollar funding was quite   necessary, but we need to move more quickly to make sure these types of announcements are not   needed  My worries about financial stability are ultimately grounded in my concern that   financial disruptions will further weaken an already fragile real economy, moving us further   from our dual-mandate goals   September 20–21, 2011 125 of 290              Between the two goals, my biggest concern is the unemployment rate  The economy has   been growing below potential, and I fear that even without a European crisis, the threat of a crisis   and the underlying challenges in housing, state and local governments, and the labor market have   sapped the confidence of consumers and businesses  In discussions with businesses, this concern   is palpable  While Boston is doing better than many other parts of the country, businesses that   have been hiring report being inundated by qualified applicants, from restaurants and grocery   stores to biotech firms  They report that the only labor market problem is that if they identify a   key potential hire, they cannot induce him or her to move, because the worker is concerned about   losing the job if the new employer’s prospects dim  This is quite consistent with the very low   quit rate we continue to observe   Turning to the inflation outlook, the Tealbook foresees an inflation rate below 2 percent   in the medium term  We should not be content with an inflation rate expected to underrun   2 percent when the unemployment rate is so far from full employment  The pricing of corporate   and Treasury securities seems quite consistent with very low inflation persisting  Finally, if one   were to use DSGE models, which I do not find as compelling as some, inflation tends to be   driven by unit labor costs, which continue to surprise on the downside  With labor market costs   staying so low, inflation can become a problem only if firms are rapidly increasing their markup,   an event quite unlikely given the poor growth rates we have been experiencing   We face a very volatile fall, with confidence shaken and growth anemic  We should   focus our policy attention on restoring both elements of the mandate in the medium term, a topic   to be discussed tomorrow  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is a privilege to follow my esteemed   colleague from Richmond  Here we provide the full range of options with just two commenters    [Laughter]   The economic outlook in the Tealbook clearly calls for action, and I would argue that the   Tealbook outlook is on the optimistic side  As I look at the pricing of Greek debt and credit   default swaps, I wonder whether the baseline forecast should include a Greek default  However,   even with a more benign assessment of Europe, my forecast for both inflation and   unemployment are consistent with significant action  My preference for this meeting would be   to do three things  First, I would explicitly condition the forward guidance on economic   outcomes, as President Evans has discussed recently, using language similar to what is in   September 20–21, 2011 216 of 290              alternative A  Second, I would reinvest principal payments of MBS back into MBS  I strongly   support that  Third, I would do the Twist, but signal that should financial instability increase, or   the economy deteriorate further, more-aggressive policy would be considered  In particular, if   conditions were to worsen, we should be considering targeting intermediate Treasury rates   consistent with our conditional language and expanding our balance sheet  While my preference   is a combination of A and B, I can support alternative B with paragraph 3  I do hope that the   forward guidance based on the SEP is considered for our next meeting  I actually agree with   President Kocherlakota that it might be worthwhile considering whether using two years, rather   than a calendar date, would be a more appropriate way of describing time   I normally don’t comment on language, but this time I feel I should  In paragraph 1, I   think the criteria should be that it’s factual and consistent  If we use three-month inflation rates,   we are, in effect, going to be describing commodity prices and oil prices  That doesn’t seem to   be what we are trying to convey  For retrospective, I actually agree with President Evans that we   should be using core or underlying inflation, so we don’t overweight temporary supply shocks    Prospectively, we should be using total, because in the medium-term total and core are likely to   be quite similar  Going forward, we could come up with an agreement that if we are going to   characterize it, then we characterize it consistently in that fashion  In terms of paragraph 3 and   3′, this is a one-time program, as we discussed yesterday  Talking about it in total makes much   more sense than talking about it parsed in nine ways  In particular, when I look at the language   at the bottom of paragraph 3, “The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities   transactions and the overall size of the maturity extension program,” I would not use that   language  I would go back to the August language that says, “The Committee will regularly   review the size and composition of its securities and is prepared to adjust those holdings as   September 20–21, 2011 217 of 290              appropriate”  I don’t think that parsing an extension program into very small bits will be   particularly effective  That language implies that we might consider doing that, and I don’t think   we should  Thank you, Mr Chairman    That’s correct     Thank you, Mr Chairman  President Evans was quite eloquent and   expansive  [Laughter]  I have a great deal of sympathy with his views  I’ll take a different   strategy and use a little more brevity in my remarks   In terms of question 1, flexible inflation targeting can be consistent with the dual   mandate, but being clear about exactly what is meant is critical  Some use the term to place a   heavy weight on inflation and a small but nonzero weight on employment  Others use it to imply   a lexicographic preference between inflation and unemployment, that is, as long as we are below   the inflation target, we have the flexibility to address large output gaps  I would be opposed to   either of these interpretations of flexible inflation targeting  What I would support is a quadratic   loss function with roughly equal weights on inflation and unemployment as in the optimal policy   simulations in the Tealbook, Book B  Were we close to the inflation target but far from our   estimate of full employment, we would be accommodative to reduce the quadratic loss function    Were we close to full employment but well above our inflation target, we would have more   restrictive policy to return to our inflation target and reduce our loss function   In terms of question 2, our current approach of using calendar dates to signal the first   increase in the funds rate is potentially problematic if we are not willing to adjust it to changing   circumstances  For example, significantly greater downside risks or worse-than-expected   economic outcomes after the date is set, so that economic conditions are no longer consistent   November 1–2, 2011 34 of 282              with the original calendar date  I would prefer to announce our intent to remain at the zero   bound until we hit specific economic triggers, such as an unemployment rate at or below   7 percent and an inflation rate of 3 percent or higher  Of course, we would not view such   triggers as absolute and independent of all other economic conditions  For example, a forecast of   exceptionally strong or weak growth as we approached a trigger might force us to take action   earlier or later  I would strongly support moving to conditional commitments, such as the   example in option A     In terms of question 3, I would support considering moving to nominal GDP targeting if   it is necessary to forcefully convey a change in regime  It would be most appropriate if we want   to signal a regime change that requires more aggressive policies moving forward  I view   nominal GDP targeting as preferable to price-level targeting because it is easier to communicate,   performs better in simulations, and does not emphasize just one element of the dual mandate      An announcement that nominal GDP targeting was necessary to get much stronger growth in   output is understandable to the public and could be effective if it was conveyed in conjunction   with more aggressive actions   In terms of question 4, we need to be clear what we’re trying to communicate  If we’re   trying to communicate why we were taking policy actions, then enforcing a common interest rate   path across all participants, such as an assumption of no change in interest rates or the interest   rate path embedded in the futures market, may be appropriate  If our policy differs from the   assumptions, we would show that our forecast with those assumptions is not consistent with our   goals and use that communication to justify a different policy than what was used in the forecast    A potential problem is that it may be difficult to make clear at times why our forecast deviates   substantially from what we expect  A second potential problem is that an interest rate path alone   November 1–2, 2011 35 of 282              may not be sufficient for describing policy over the next several years, given the prominence that   balance sheet policies have played  If instead we are trying to communicate our best forecast for   important economic variables, I would prefer to use optimal policy as we do now, even though   we might disagree on how we get there  Of the two, my guess is the general public is primarily   interested in our best forecast  Thank you, Mr Chairman    My question is for Steve, but it’s a financial stability question,   which is You highlighted the 50 percent voluntary write-down, and the CDSs presumably are   not going to be triggered; I wonder if you have any views on what that means for the CDS   market going forward?  If you thought you were being hedged against sovereign debt default,   then not only for Greece but also for all your sovereign debt, all of a sudden it looks as though   that hedge isn’t a very good hedge  And if you think that sovereigns could play that game not   only for sovereigns but also possibly for bank debt if the bank was large relative to the size of the   November 1–2, 2011 131 of 282              country, you start wondering whether that contract any longer has viability  But all of a sudden   then, do you want to hold sovereign debt if you can’t hedge it?  So it starts having implications   for the yields going forward  So I was wondering if you have views on that  Then I think this is   really a question for another time, maybe, that the financial stability people could pick up on    But given how often the CDSs are cited, I wonder if you have any views on that—or Nellie or   anybody else    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The markets seem to have initially   taken some solace in the Europeans having an outline of actions with no details and in US   economic data consistent with growth that does not improve the employment situation  That   such diminished expectations can generate a market rally is hardly encouraging  As Brian   highlighted, it is even less encouraging that a referendum in a small country can offset much of   those gains  This highlights the fragile financial condition as we try to make our own forecast   My forecast, like that in the Tealbook, provides little to celebrate—positive but weak   growth given the sizable output gap, positive but weak employment growth that leaves us far   from full employment, and inflation that remains below 2 percent  By mid-2013, I expect we   will still have an unemployment rate above 8 percent and an inflation rate well below 2 percent    The Tealbook has a similar forecast  If these forecasts are right, we will be missing on both   elements of the mandate two years from now   Financial market participants remain concerned  Liquidity in many markets is sporadic at   best  Financial institutions, worried about their own liquidity risk, are not supporting markets to   the same degree, making financial market participants less willing to take positions that may be   difficult to exit  My own interpretation is that in many markets, European and American   institutions that have been dependent on wholesale financing are pulling back from activities,   resulting in marketmakers less willing to make markets    November 1–2, 2011 140 of 282              While there has been some increased refinancing activity, and the newly announced   HARP changes are positive, both the movement in mortgage rates and the fiscal willingness to   encourage refinancing remain too timid to have much macroeconomic effect  Our econometric   equations imply that we are well below the level of construction implied by fundamentals at this   time  And buyer concern about future prices and the tightness of credit conditions make a very   gradual return to normal in housing the most likely outcome   My business contacts indicate widespread caution  Given the possibility that deficit   discussions remain dysfunctional and European brinkmanship remains the negotiating tool of   choice, businesses would prefer to defer hiring and investment decisions until there is more   clarity in the outlook   Given the weak performance we have experienced and the weakness in our forecast, our   incremental policy is not the best approach  Critics of Japanese policymakers focus on a slow,   deliberate approach that led to very suboptimal outcomes, with 20 years of slow growth and   inflation below targets  If we do not start seeing more-robust improvement, then the likely fiscal   austerity and continued downside risk from Europe put such improvement at significant risk    We will need to decide whether incremental policies are likely to return us to either element of   our mandate in the medium term  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Yesterday I discussed the Boston   forecast and talked about inflation being at 1½ percent, roughly where the Tealbook was, by   mid-2013  Both the Boston forecast and the Board forecast come from a particular econometric   tradition, so I thought it was noteworthy to at least look at the memos on DSGE models  And   interestingly, from all four of those banks, they came up with roughly the same estimate that both   November 1–2, 2011 204 of 282              the Tealbook and the Boston Fed forecast, which was roughly 1½ percent  In fact, I think 1½ is   a high rather than a low for both those four banks and those coming from a different econometric   tradition   What that would seem to say is that there is some flexibility, if we are going to have an   inflation rate below 2 percent two to three years out, to do more accommodation in order to get a   better result on the unemployment rate  The reason you wouldn’t do that is, one, you might think   that we couldn’t affect the interest rate, or, two, if we did affect interest rates, it would have no   impact  Brian yesterday showed the percent of Treasuries that we’re buying, and showed that in   a number of issues, we’re buying a very significant amount  I have no doubt that if we’re willing   to buy a very significant amount, we have the ability to move down both Treasury rates and   mortgage-backed securities rates  It’s a question of will, not whether we can do it or not  It isn’t   a question of whether we can move those interest rates   So then the question is, if we can move those interest rates, what is the likelihood it   would have any impact?  Some analysts have argued that pushing long rates down through   quantitative easing would have no effect  No effect is a very restrictive assumption, but it has   been cited by a wide number of analysts  That assumption means that housing is unresponsive to   lower rates; that consumption, including autos and durables, is unresponsive to interest rates; that   exchange rates in the foreign sector are unresponsive despite the complaints by many of our   foreign trading partners about the quantitative easing; and that investment is unresponsive to   lower rates   I asked the people who do our model to test the assumption of whether the interest   responsiveness of each of these components is really zero  Not surprisingly, my prior was that   they wouldn’t find that zero was the right answer  And when they did that, they did find that in   November 1–2, 2011 205 of 282              housing, the coefficient was much lower, but they didn’t find that the coefficient was 0—which   is, housing is responsive; it’s not as responsive as it would be without all of the various   headwinds  But in those other sectors, they couldn’t reject the assumption that in the past several   years, interest rates have affected those sectors in the same way that they did prior to the past   several years  So it is interesting that it does seem, from at least the econometric analysis done at   the Boston Fed, that in using the model that we use for the forecast, we actually do find that if we   chose to push interest rates lower, it would have an impact on the economy, contrary to what at   least some analysts have argued   When I look at alternative B, which maintains the exceptionally low rates “at least   through mid-2013,” our forecast implies that the language in alternative A would actually be   more appropriate  Should we leave policy unchanged when both elements of the mandate are   missed in the medium term?  We’re not at full employment, and we’re lower than 2 percent for   the inflation rate  My preference would be to use this meeting to clearly communicate that rates   will remain exceptionally low until unemployment is 7 percent or the inflation rate exceeds   2½ percent in the medium term  At our next meeting, if the outlook once again envisions   unacceptable progress toward our primary goals, we need to consider taking more forceful   action   Were we to have a shock from a large bank failure here or abroad, a European crisis, or   the inability to reach agreement on our debt problems, aggressive monetary actions, perhaps   coupled with a move to nominal GDP targeting to signal a regime change, would clearly be   appropriate  But even our baseline forecast implies a lost decade for many people in the   workforce  We should consider soon whether more vigorous policies are necessary  Thank you,   Mr Chairman   November 1–2, 2011 206 of 282                I’m strongly supportive of this action  I do think the financial   markets are badly disrupted, and it does make sense to address it in a coordinated effort  I do   have two questions  One is whether we have communicated with the other central banks about   the moral suasion issue—that there is an expectation that banks would be borrowing in their   home country when there is access to a swap line  Has that communication occurred, and do we   have a reason to believe that that moral suasion will be effective?  Because I would have a mild   preference for actually having the rate at which both domestic and foreign banks borrow be the   same if we thought that moral suasion would be effective  My second question is on disclosure    One part is whether or not we would be disclosing who’s tapping the lines by central bank in our   own releases  And the second part is whether any other central banks have different disclosure   requirements—in terms of banks borrowing from their central banks or in terms of them   November 28, 2011 20 of 40              borrowing from us  Have we thought through all of the disclosure issues?  Because when we   think of stigma, disclosure is an important component of stigma, and given the Dodd–Frank   requirements for providing more information, I’d be curious about how we were thinking about   those disclosure issues across countries  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data this fall have been somewhat   more positive than I expected, in part because of the diminished expectations created by the   weak data we received over the summer  Like the Tealbook, I see an extended period of only   moderate growth that is insufficient to significantly reduce the unemployment rate or prevent the   PCE inflation rate from undershooting 2 percent inflation over the medium term   The discussions with businesses in my district are quite consistent with this forecast    Most businesses are seeing moderate current sales and hoping to see modest increases over next   year  However, along with uncertainty about the durability of the domestic private recovery, the   uncertainty in Washington and Europe makes them acutely aware of the downside risks to their   December 13, 2011 41 of 198              outlook, and they are delaying investment and employment decisions until the outlook is clearer    The modest hiring by small businesses and the weak small business lending noted in the   Tealbook are consistent with my discussions with community bankers and small businesses  I   am increasingly hearing that to make risky small business loans in this environment will take a   more energized effort by the Small Business Administration  Businesses are not reporting wage   or price pressures, and most businesses have reported overwhelming applications when business   expansion requires hiring additional workers, despite New England performing better than the   rest of the country   I find very few academics or financial market participants who expect the European   situation to be a problem only in the near term  An academic from a prestigious economics   program highlighted that there is an internal office pool on when the first country leaves the   euro  And there is no money on “never,” though I would note that it is difficult to see just when   “never” would pay off  [Laughter]   Financial market participants are reporting increased attention to counterparty risk  They   are particularly reducing their exposure to French banks and are taking a hard look at US   broker–dealer organizations with elevated CDS spreads, including Jefferies and Morgan Stanley    While the Tealbook discusses some of the European linkages to the US, I would add a few   more that are hard to capture in standard models, should things progress unfavorably  First, I am   concerned that the broker–dealer model of financing might not survive a severe European shock    This is one reason why a company like Goldman Sachs has such an elevated CDS spread  Were   a crisis to occur, financial institutions would quickly abandon counterparties with risky funding   strategies  As we saw in the earlier crisis, even secured lenders run from troubled counterparties    This poses a significant risk to any firm that has a large broker–dealer   December 13, 2011 42 of 198              Second, I have spent time at previous meetings discussing risks with funding structures   that are not supported by domestic capital, such as money market funds, non-2a-7 funds that   operate like money market funds, and foreign branches  All of these structures would be   severely challenged in a crisis   Third, I want to amplify on something that was mentioned only briefly in the Tealbook    The asset-backed commercial paper market is stressed  This market has declined dramatically   from levels before the crisis to a market that is now a little over $320 billion  Nevertheless, it   has been an important market for securitizing short-term commercial paper  It is also a market   that has had a significant European presence  European banks have sponsored a surprising   number of conduits and often provide liquidity support  Liquidity support entails serving as an   alternative funding source in the event a conduit is unable to issue new asset-backed commercial   paper—a constraint that many conduits associated with European banks are currently facing    Consistent with this concern, asset-backed commercial paper maturities have declined and rates   have risen  This is another example of a financing structure that might not survive a European   crisis and could cause a tightening in US markets   The baseline outlook is sobering, but increasingly the more severe European outcome is   becoming part of the baseline forecast rather than a stress scenario  The Tealbook highlights that   we will likely miss on both elements of the mandate  Should Europe worsen, as in the   alternative scenarios, disinflation or deflation is quite possible, implying that we very   significantly miss on both objectives  Now is the critical time, both to shore up our financial   institutions, but also to promote as much growth in the economy as possible  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  According to the Tealbook, by mid-  2013 the PCE price index will be growing at 12 percent, and the unemployment rate will be   December 13, 2011 89 of 198              84 percent  I, unfortunately, view this as a plausible baseline forecast with significant downside   risk  Furthermore, the long-term outlook shown on page 32 of the Tealbook, Book A, indicates   that in 2016 we will still be missing on both elements of the mandate  Such a forecast is   consistent with taking more action, as reflected in option A   There has been much discussion of credibility over the past few years  How credible   would a central bank be that misses on both elements of its mandate for five years?  I have little   doubt that if we had been well above full employment for years, and the inflation rate was   forecast to be well above 2 percent for the next five years, that we would be acting decisively    We should behave symmetrically, displaying equal concern when inflation is forecast to be too   low and the unemployment rate to be too high  Some have argued that we cannot have an impact   now that we are at the zero bound  I do not agree  If I thought that our alternative policy tools at   the zero bound could not stimulate the economy enough to raise the inflation rate to 2 percent in   the medium term, I would certainly be advocating aggressively for a higher inflation rate to   ensure we never hit the zero bound again   If we are going to go with option B, I question whether the language of mid-2013 is   appropriate  The Tealbook forecast has us far from our target in mid-2013, and that is based on a   forecast where liftoff does not occur until the fourth quarter of 2014  What are we conveying   when our forecast for liftoff has lengthened by a year and a half and we do not change our   announced liftoff despite the passage of time?  Are we being transparent?  And is that language   helping us?   For this meeting, I would suggest two possible wording changes—change “2013” to   “2014,” or, at a minimum, change “mid-2013” to “the end of 2013,” which is still a year less   than we actually expect in the Tealbook  The problem with the fixed calendar date is quite   December 13, 2011 90 of 198              apparent  President Kocherlakota actually mentioned this when we first adopted it  I would   prefer the language in paragraph 4 of option A to be adopted today  It ties monetary policy to   economic outcomes  However, if not, I would hope that such language is in option B in January     Thank you      Let me make the argument  When I look at Brian’s charts, and I   look at the FX swap rate even after what we did, it is higher than the last FOMC meeting  If I   look at spot LIBOR, it is higher than the last FOMC meeting  If I look at European bank CDS, it   is higher than the last meeting  And if I look at the US dollar–euro, it is higher than the last   meeting   To President Kocherlakota’s point, the policy rules don’t give the distribution around   inflation and unemployment  If you had a very leptokurtic distribution around unemployment, if   it’s a very fat tail so that there is a very high probability of a very severe outcome that you worry   December 13, 2011 112 of 198              about, I don’t think you ignore that  Therefore, I am not sure that taking finance out of   paragraph 5 actually does make sense  We can have this discussion later this afternoon, but   financial stability does deserve to get attention, and it is separate from just looking at the mean   path of inflation and unemployment    Can I ask one other governance question?    If somebody didn’t agree with the statement and chose to dissent,   are they then obligated to communicate what the Committee thought was right?  I want to   understand what a dissent would potentially mean  We’re going to do this every year  Let’s say   that somebody decides that they want a 0 percent inflation rate, and everybody else thinks 2   percent is the right inflation rate, but the person for the 0 percent doesn’t agree at the January   meeting  Is that person obligated to talk about what the Committee’s consensus viewpoint is?    It’s another governance question of how exactly this works at the beginning of the year   December 13, 2011 123 of 198               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just have one comment  This   morning some argued that financial problems should make us less willing to ease, because they   didn’t think it would have much of an impact  Others argued that financial problems should   make us more willing to ease, because we should offset the problems  Either way, if financial   market conditions impact the degree of accommodation that we are going to choose, then we   should acknowledge it  This is to be transparent publicly  I would prefer financial stability be   included, like it was in the earlier draft  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Otherwise, I am okay with everything else     I support 1 through 7  I view 1 through 5 more as providing   operational clarity—I think operational uncertainty is counterproductive—and those should be   communicated in the minutes  Six and 7 are a little bit different  I support the discretion of the   Chairman for the reasons that were highlighted by Vice Chairman Dudley  I view it as reducing   stresses in the liquid markets where the lender is solvent and has the capacity to pay, and I view   that as fundamental to what central bank functions are  So I think 6 and 7, with the discretion of   the Chairman—I think it would be useful to have a meeting if it was possible, but I could easily   imagine circumstances where that wouldn’t be possible and we should be providing discretion   For the reasons that Governor Stein highlighted, I don’t find 8 or 9 repugnant  I do think   that we shouldn’t do it without having severe stress in the markets, but I think we certainly   shouldn’t take it off the table  Thank you, Mr Chairman
