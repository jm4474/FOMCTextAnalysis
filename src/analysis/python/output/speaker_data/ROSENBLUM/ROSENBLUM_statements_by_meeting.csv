8251,2008-07-24,"  I want to thank President Yellen for the detailed discussion of the role   of the Federal Reserve in supporting IndyMac in its final weeks  It reiterates some of the fears I   July 24, 2008 31 of 50    have of what we may face going forward  Extending the term of the TAF to 84 days may   compound the adverse selection process whereby those banks that anticipate difficulties may be   those most likely to want to go for the 84-day period and bid up the rate that they are willing to pay   because they would be anticipating some of the difficulties that we just heard recited   More than that, we in Dallas are worried about the reputation of the Federal Reserve if there   is a series of such follow-up events to IndyMac and how it is going to look for you, Mr Chairman,   if you have to testify before the Congress, which has the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and will criticize   us for making loans for which foresight is far from perfect  “How could you have made such a loan   to a bank that everybody who reads the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and looks at   the Internet knows was in trouble, and how could you do it on such preferential terms?”  Such   questions damage the reputation of the Fed  In addition to the credit risk aspects, we have the   problem of the Fed’s reputational risk, particularly in the halls of the Congress, during a particularly   troubled time going forward   On balance, I think the TOP program does no harm  We in Dallas are willing to support it,   but we still have some reservations  One of my concerns is that, in the document that was sent out   yesterday for the FOMC vote on the TSLF options authorization, there is no mention in the first   paragraph on page 3 about this being a special, short-term, end-of-month, end-of-quarter option  It   is just left there in general terms that we are going to offer up to $50 billion in additional draws on   the facility, and there seems to be a lack of clarification  One question I have is, Is the System going   to put out a list of frequently asked questions or something of that nature to add clarity?  Another   concern that I have is Bill Dudley’s earlier statement that the Fed has other means of easing its   balance sheet constraints should the new facilities tie up more funds or encumber more funds on our   balance sheet  We didn’t really have any follow-up on that point  What are the plans to ease our   July 24, 2008 32 of 50    balance sheet constraints should it become necessary, and does this conflict with the fed funds   targets that the FOMC is trying to hit?  We need some explicit discussion of that or at least to raise   the questions as we go forward, perhaps at the next FOMC meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
