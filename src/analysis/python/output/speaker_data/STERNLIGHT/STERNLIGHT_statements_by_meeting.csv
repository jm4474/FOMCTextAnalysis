16,1976-03-29,"  Not sharply higher, but moderately higher, it--  "
44,1976-04-20,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee  records]   CHNAIRMAN BURNS  Thank you very much  In the future it would be desirable to  submit to the Committee before the meeting a report of how the Desk might have operated under  the criteria on nonborrowed reserves  Now, you might do it at the meeting as well  But I found  the latter part of your report extremely difficult to follow  And I am not sure that I would have  grasped it if I had had the report in advance, but I would have had the opportunity to study it     But we have put indications in our weekly reports and the report that  covers the four-week period ending last Wednesday     It is perhaps not as easy to follow there, where we are all charting  our way through unfamiliar territory, and we will try to improve the [unintelligible]     No, I’ve seen no comment from the market on that at all  I don’t  believe they are really aware of it     [From our talking] to the underwriting houses that seek to make  estimates of what’s coming, I think there’s a general feeling in the market that the volume will be     4/20/76 - 15 -           tapering off as the year goes along  I think there was a feeling a few months ago that there  would be an even sharper drop than has transpired, but there is still a feeling that it will decline  as we go along this year     I wouldn’t describe them as mechanical difficulties, no  But I did  point out that we would have been led to a firmer stance in the provision of reserves even  though, through most of the period until the last few days, it looked as though monetary growth  was pretty much close to its midpoint  So had we been looking through the nonborrowed guide,  we would not have wanted to have a firmer federal funds rate     Yes, we did not sell any  What we have been doing is reducing our  pace of buying so that we don’t cover the maturing amounts week by week     I am not convinced that we could have done better  No     I think that’s right  As I mentioned, we think we came out about  $90 million above, but had we been on the targeting basis we would have come out say $40  million above on nonborrowed [reserves] but with a concomitant firming of the money market     I would say that, as we were going through this, we were trying to  envision what nonborrowed number we would aim for week by week, and unless we were  constrained by the federal funds constraint, we would aim for the target number  So, in that  sense, I think it is a little different from the zone of indifference that we talked about when we  are guided by the Ms in setting the federal funds rate objective  I regarded this plus or minus $50  million range as something that the Committee might be indifferent to in assessing whether the  Desk has [hit] a target or not     It seems to me as I read the output of the Subcommittee on the Directive that they would  direct us to try to hit a nonborrowed number, but a $50 million [deviation on] either side of that  would be regarded as essentially hitting that number  They were not telling us to keep money  market conditions unchanged as long as it looks as though you come within $50 million of the  center of the range  "
70,1976-05-18,"  [Statement--See Appendix]     We were trying to weigh the impact of a number of factors on the  aggregates as we went through the period--developments in Treasury balances, the introduction  of this $2 bill, all these things were evaluated  We were uncertain about the impact of a number  of these factors midway through the period, and that was one factor causing us to be quite  cautious in responding to the evidence in the aggregates  As we went further along in the period,  some of these doubts were resolved on the side of indicating that substantial growth was being  sustained  And we continued to react in a modestly but steadily firming direction       5/18/76 - 33 -           I don’t think that [I] could put [a figure on that]     That does just about sum it up  I would say that even without  precise language in the directive alluding to even-keel, we feel that considerations relating to a  major Treasury financing are part of that background of domestic financial developments, so we  do want to pay attention     I think that’s been true through this whole--     This was part of the reason for wanting to be quite cautious during  the first half of the period     No  We take both into account  "
97,1976-06-22,"  About $200 million of it would have a reserve impact      And as it happens, it would fit rather well with other things that are  happening to reserves  It presents no problem from that standpoint     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee  records]     Well, we are attempting this simulation according to certain  guidelines that we have set out  The guidelines could be somewhat different  I think it could be  done along the lines that we are describing here, and the general result would be as we have  described for each period, on balance  It seems to me we would have tended to move [more  firmly] on the [federal] funds rate than we actually did and would have had more variation in the  funds rate  I remain doubtful that this would really serve the longer-term purposes of policy, but  it’s still rather early to judge the exercise      Well, again, I think it depends on what constraints we set ourselves   We were working with kind of an internal rule that we would not want to see the average funds  rate change by more than 25 basis points per week  We were permitting some backing and  filling of the funds rate as we went through the period on these hypothetical scenarios  If, early  in the period, it looked as though we were going to come out substantially above path, and we  assumed that we would be moving up in the funds rate, and the later evidence had us much  weaker against the path we were assuming, then we would be more generous in the reserve  provision and let the funds rate come down       6/22/76 - 24 -           No one can revise those internal rules so as to screen out those short-term residuals  One  could just construct a different exercise than the one we went through, so I think you are right,  we wouldn’t necessarily have had to have greater variability, but I think we would then have  been in a sense less faithful to the attempt to achieve the nonborrowed target      I think you are certainly right that the market focuses more on overt  operations that they see from us, and it’s natural because that’s what they are seeing directly   When the weekly statistics are published, they learn that we may have acquired bills from  foreign accounts or sold to them  I’m not sure that there’d be very much difference in that regard  if we were working on a nonborrowed reserve target  It seems to me we’d still be conducting  operations either with overt entries into the market or operations that the market did not see as  directly, and they would very possibly still exaggerate the significance of whatever they saw  overtly from the Desk      Well, I think there could be delays in getting the information  together when there were mechanical failures     I think that it is probably easier for the market to try to track us  closely with the fed funds rate objective  That’s something that they can read immediately from  the market just as we can, whereas with a reserve objective, it would be a little more difficult for  them to track us     Well, I think we would observe a zone of indifference within which  we would make no reaction but just continue to hold to the middle of a funds range  If it were,  say, 5-1/4, 3/4--     But it would be something within the range [even] if we haven’t  always agreed on just precisely what--how wide that zone is  We tend to think of it [in terms of,]  if the M1 range, say, was 4 percentage points, then perhaps 2 percentage points would be a zone  of indifference  But as we move beyond that then we would move to the higher or lower side of  the funds range     I don’t think we would go all the way to 5-3/4  We wouldn’t go all  the way to the top of the funds range unless the aggregates were slightly over the top     6/22/76 - 32 -             Well, all right, at the top  "
123,1976-07-19,"  Mr Chairman, I believe we give the latest weekly figure, the last  four-week average, and then a comparison of that last four-week [period] with a four-week  period three months earlier     7/19-20/76 - 48 -     No, but I think you have a rather similar concept     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee  records]     Well, we try to envisage what the Committee might want us to do   It seems to me it’s been the case right along that one could pursue this with different degrees of  rigidity  In this case, we thought that it would  have been more in keeping with the Committee’s  desire if we were to look partly through and not tighten against the background of weaker  aggregates     Well, I think we were trying to envisage how we would actually  have operated, on the assumption that the Committee likes to make its moves, I think, in  deliberate and gradual fashion and not shock the market with sudden new innovations  This  seemed the more reasonable approach to a change in technique rather than something that would  abruptly change the rules of the game     I think all of those could be in a direction of moderating inflationary  expectations--I don’t know that they would be of enormous impact  The markets were about  steady this morning on the early reports that we got  I think the GNP number was just about in  line with what had been anticipated in some earlier guesses about the second quarter  So, I think  it’s in the direction of moderating inflationary expectations but no large impact anticipated     Well, I think our approach there has been to observe a zone of  indifference within which we don’t make any move at all; then as we see the aggregates moving  toward the tops or bottoms of their ranges, making some move in the federal funds rate; and at  the point where the aggregates are reaching the extremes, then going to the top or bottom of the  funds rate range     7/19-20/76 - 65 -     No, just to the middle, it didn’t get to the high side  "
166,1976-09-21,  It’s a timing factor  
192,1976-10-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     I think there is an element of that, Mr MacLaury  I don’t think it’s  all that new  We have sometimes engaged in operations to head off a change of market  sentiment or to foster a change that we thought was warranted, even when the reserve projection     10/19/76 - 8 -   that we were looking at didn’t seem to call for that action  But there seemed to be several  occasions, a few occasions of that type, that called for rather large-scale action, and this, I  thought, was of sufficient magnitude to call it to the Committee’s attention     No, President Eastburn  We were combining the two, giving weight  to both as weekly information comes in, comparing the performance of both of those measures to  the ranges set for them  Had we looked at M1 alone, I think the responses would have been  earlier and more pronounced  The relative strength of M2 was a tempering influence on the  extent of our responses     I believe it was quite favorable  The market well understood the  reasons for which we wanted to do this  We got what we thought were quite good rates  We  were concerned that perhaps we would have to accept considerably lower interest rates in order  to impose that no-withdrawal condition on the market, and we found it did not call for a major  differential  Just a few basis points seemed to be sufficient, and it gave us a greater measure of  assurance for that portion of our repurchase agreement injection     That would be with respect to a path that was developed at the start  of the period  We did not consider modifications of the path as we went along  One could map  out a procedure for modifying that path if one wished     Depending on what procedure one followed in modifying the paths   Yes, I think that’s right     I believe that we were right in following Committee instructions to  come out where we did, at 5 percent  I think we did gradually weaken as we had the evidence,  midway through the period, of weakness in Ml partly offset by reasonable strength in M2  The  latest week of evidence that we had showed Ml still weak, but slightly less weak, and M2  picking up a little bit  I think if we had had the last week’s numbers earlier on, I’m not sure there  would have been as strong a case for going down even to 5 percent  But having gotten there, I  don’t think it was so different as to call for a reversal       10/19/76 - 37 -     Below the midpoint, but still within a zone of indifference as we--       Within about a week    "
231,1976-11-16,"  [Statement-- see Appendix]     I think it would be fairly moderate  There’s been talk of a  possibility of a discount rate cut  It was a little more active a few weeks ago  It is dampened  down in the last couple of weeks as the market perceived stronger aggregates  But I think it  would be a fairly moderate reaction at this point, even so     I think a 1/2 point would be rather a surprise, and that would  generate a sizable reaction, yes     Well, I think it depends on what accompaniment of open market  operations there were at the same time  If we were still around the 5 percent funds rate, I think  the 1/4 percentage point--unless the market perceived that we’re going to be edging down from 5  percent funds--that would be a rather mild reaction, with bill rates not moving any more [than],  perhaps not as much as, that 1/4 percentage point, and lesser rate moves in the longer end of the     11/16/76 - 32 -           [curve]  If there were any accompanying lower federal funds rate atmosphere, depending on just  how much lower and over and what time path, whether it could be a little more reaction on the  discount rate--     Well I think it could be a fairly moderate reaction, and perhaps if the  funds rate were down 1/8 to 1/4 below the 5 percent, and the discount rate came down 1/4  percentage point with accompanying announcements of technical realignment, then the market  rate might be at the short end in the same order of 1/4 percentage point, perhaps     Mr Chairman, could I ask on that whether, in going for a 4-3/4  target within this range, we contemplate the similar timing--  "
259,1976-12-20,"  The policy record would not go out immediately after--     I didn’t have anything to add      [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, the profitability has been good  this past year, although uneven over the past five     I think that’s a fair assessment  I don’t think there’s any imminent  expectation of a further discount rate action     12/20-21/76 - 55 -           Well, you’re referring to my comment that the last cut, the one  announced on November 19, that came in the midst of our gradually reducing the funds rate from  5 to 4-3/4, and [unintelligible] seeking to gradually reduce that rate  The market tries to read  interpretations into each action that the Desk takes or fails to take in any given day  It isn’t  always all that clear over a short period just what the Desk’s intentions are  But I think [if there  was] any doubt in their mind [that] there was some move under way, it tended to be resolved  when it was accompanied by a discount rate reduction     Yes, we would pick up the comments from dealers in talking with  them and probing into reasons that they saw for the market moving as it has     About 60 basis points in bills, and maybe a little more than that on  some issues  I think there has been an element of anticipation of some further decline in the  funds rate, at any rate, to probably about the 4-1/2 percent level  And certainly that got up--you  got a further boost with the reserve requirement change     Yes, I think that release from the period from the first few days of  December on, there was a kind of backing and filling, and a number of participants did think  they were getting to about the low point  And perhaps they reached it     I would think that there could be some modest backup in rates if the  funds rate were just to proceed unchanged from this point on  Not a very great backup, but a  mild one     Yes     Well, I don’t think there’s any great expectation of it  I don’t think  it would come as a great surprise, either  And it would depend on how it was presented to the  market  If it was presented as something that was just catching up with market rate declines that  have already occurred, I think that after some very initial reaction in the market, there might not  be much lasting reaction at all, and they’d begin to look at whether this was going to be  accompanied by any further push down in the funds rate  And if it were not, then I think that  there would be negligible net effect after a week or two     That’s right  That will come at a time when we still have some  projected reserve need, and I think it can be folded very readily into our week-to-week  operations that are largely countering operating factors of some size   MRBALLES  So you don’t see that as having any particular impact on the funds rate,  short-term--pushing it down even further     No, I wouldn’t expect that to happen     That’s right  Yes  "
284,1977-01-17,"  Well, I think I agree that there would be a reaction, proceeding to a  4-3/4 [rate]     It’s very close, Mr Chairman  We are only talking about 1/8, but  it’s something that--     Well, we’re still aiming at 4-5/8     Well, yesterday’s effective rate was 480, but I think the market still  perceives us as aiming for 4-5/8  I think there’s a difference--they’ve seen us resisting--     It depends on how the market saw us implementing it; I think that  might be reasonable  I think, if we moved aggressively to achieve 4-3/4, that it could be more of  a reaction than that  Or if we were just sort of able to slide into it because, as the Chairman said,  we were already there yesterday and funds just kind of stayed there and we didn’t do anything  about it, then it could be less of a reaction     But I’m concerned about trying to implement something quite gradually because of this  upcoming refunding  If there is to be a change, it might be well to have that atmosphere cleared  just a little bit before the Treasury has to come in, or at least before its issues are bid on     1/17-18/77 - 66 -          "
310,1977-02-15,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      I think there has been some expectation of rising rates as this year  goes along  Just taking the period of the past month, this trend that you point out is not so very  pronounced, but I think it would be pronounced if we go back to the beginning of the year   There has been a steepening of the upward sloping yield curves  And I think it was essentially a  fading of the expectation of any further easing and some expectation developing that, as this year  goes along, there would tend to be some higher rates developing     I’ve had some impression of banks drawing more from foreign  sources  "
335,1977-03-15,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       I don’t know that they really have  Some of the recent week-to- week reactions have been a little milder, but there is still a good deal of sensitivity to the weekly  numbers and interest in seeing how the Desk might respond  There is, of course, a consciousness  that the growth was slower in February, so that if there were to be a pickup [in growth rates] in  March and April, the market would perhaps not jump to a conclusion  Unless they got some sign  from the Fed, they would not come to a conclusion that this was going to be followed by some  stiffer posture at the Desk     Very little, as I commented  Very few people in the market raised  the question about it, and it was done in rather a low-key way, and we’ve been unable to detect     3/15/77 - 21 -           any change in the quotations for the eligible versus ineligible issues, either as to the level of  prices and yields or the spreads on those quotations     Well, I think activity had been pretty light in those issues     We haven’t had occasion in the last few months to go in and buy  agency issues when we do get quite a sizable range of offerings       Right  There’ve been too few occasions when we have anything to  do, away from our go-rounds  Those with Treasury coupon issues will occasionally have some  foreign-customer orders, so that it’s worth the dealer’s while to show us occasional Treasury  coupon offers, but it would be rare with an agency     I’ll comment very briefly as indicated in the March 4 memorandum,  Mr Chairman  The [System Open Market] Account Manager continues to find the lending  program reasonably necessary to the effective functioning of the government securities market  and, hence, to our open market operations  The dollar volume of lending was up in the past year  but much less than in proportion to total trading activity in the market     Without system lending in securities, we believe the fail situation could have been much  worse in the past year, and the market would not have functioned as well  The System’s charge  for lending, which exceeds the charge set by other lenders, far more than covers our costs  For  the [Federal Reserve Bank of] New York, earnings from lending securities last year were nearly  $2 million  Our expenses attributable to lending are estimated at something less than 10 percent  of that figure  That’s all I have     Given that we have a charge that’s double what other lenders are  charging and that people are coming to us, we believe that the fail situation would be materially  worse if our lending program was not there  So I think we can reach that conclusion  "
361,1977-04-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     I would say yes, Governor  I think that what we got was a partial  reversal of the swing in the yield curve that had come about in January, which had come, as you  recall, just about when the Administration was announcing its fiscal stimulus plans, and this has  now reversed a good proportion of that as a major part of that plan was modified     That’s where our aim’s been     No, what you’re proposing now is just the standard language, now   I would have liked clarification had the Committee voted for one of those alternatives  I’ve no  problem--     That’s right, I have no problem with that, just on the alternatives  "
386,1977-05-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     I think the adjustment to that 525 to 530 or--     5/17/77 - 20 -             --area, or something like, has been completed     Thereabout, 450 to 5 percent     I think that some market participants would take some comfort in  observing that the System has moved to counteract that burst of growth in the aggregates  I don’t  know if I’d want to go further than that, as to saying that inflationary expectations are  significantly diminished, because the markets were also getting evidence through this period of  continuing price increases  "
449,1977-07-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     Payments went through the next day; there’s the question of what  interest rate adjustments to make, if any, because of the nonday--we skipped a day     I think there was sufficient strength in the aggregates toward the  latter part of this interval so that, if you’d been operating on an aggregates directive, there might  very well have been a need to firm slightly  I think we just barely avoided such a need, and one  of the factors working in that direction was the fact that there was a money market directive     They will be announcing a week from tomorrow, Mr Chairman, in  terms of the quarterly refunding operation  So, from that standpoint, if there were any significant  rule [unintelligible], the midpoint would probably be [unintelligible] making its presence in the  market early  I don’t know that these smaller rules that [unintelligible] are contemplating--     They are refunding just over $3 billion, and they might add $2-1/2  billion or $3 billion before or on top of that  So it’s a sizable--  "
478,1977-08-16,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     There’s been a good deal of talk of the discount rate change and a  fairly widespread expectation of a move of at least 1/4 [point], with some people beginning to  talk of a change of as much as 1/2     I find it a little bit hard to answer  The market has moved less than I  would ordinarily expect it [if it were] to accompany the move up to a 6 percent funds rate  In  that sense I wondered, as this process has gone on, whether that adjustment has fully taken place,  and yet when I couple this with the fact that the dealers remain in a net short position and have     8/16/77 - 23 -           even deepened their short position, I come to conclude that perhaps the adjustment has pretty  well occurred even to a 6 percent funds rate     I think they’d tend to move toward covering some of that short  position     567     I don’t have a figure in my head on that, but it’s tended to pretty  well just be a measure of the difference between the three- and six-months bills     Any congestion in the--     No, the Treasury’s sales went very well, and dealers took down  about the normal proportion they would usually take down--roughly half, a little less than half in  this case, and they rather quickly sold out of that     Corporate bonds--the calendar’s been moderate, and the issues have  gone fairly well, with little evidence of congestion     The effective rate on the day was just about 6--601  Some of the  trading was above 6, and late in the day the trading was largely at 6-1/8     Well, yesterday we had some very heavy foreign account selling of  bills  Much of that was in order to purchase coupon issues  Yesterday was the delivery date for  the Treasury’s new issues  There had been some sizable foreign-account takedowns of these  new issues, and that was a big chunk of the foreign sales     I would think that the market has fully discounted 1/4 percentage  point  I don’t think they have fully discounted 1/2 percentage point  I think there would be  some adjustment     Well, that has moved up not quite as much as federal funds  I think  they’re in about the 5-5/8, 3/4 area now  It perhaps hasn’t made a full adjustment to the 6  percent federal funds rate     I think it would, within about another two weeks     Three weeks     8/16/77 - 28 -             Because of a three-week moving average     Correct     I think you’d want to be projecting 5 before--     I would appreciate clarification--if you widen the ranges for the Ms  by dropping the bottom, are we to consider them again to have symmetric midpoints or  asymmetric midpoints?  It would make a bit of difference in the rapidity with which we move  "
504,1977-09-20,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     I think these foreign purchases seem to be a steady force in the  market  It’s hard to predict what might lie ahead  A lot depends on just what the UK’s fortunes  are  There have been other foreign buyers  Some have been going in the market  A number of  them of them have been just taking amounts directly from the Treasury on new issuance  But I  think there, too, it tends to relieve what could otherwise be upward rate pressures as we come to  a point where disintermediation might be a factor     I would think so, yes     It has not provided a serious problem to us  We have been asking  foreign accounts to hold down the volume of these repurchase agreements until we get  clarification of just where we stand on this situation that was reviewed by the Committee earlier  as far as the Internal Revenue [Service] is concerned     That is correct     9/20/77 - 28 -     I would say it exceeded our expectations, and we kind of played it  by ear from day to day  It was a complicating factor in the conduct of operations during that  period     Yes, it did seem to proceed with particular speed this time, based on  past experience  It seemed to move quicker that way     I think, on balance, they would expect higher money market rates,  particularly  There would be more division of views as one went out on the maturity curve     Well, the bill positions have increased in the last month, a good part  of it, I think, because of the Treasury getting back into some net additions to bill supply, whereas  they had been, since the earlier part of this, paying off bills or, well, since about the beginning of  the summer, just holding steady on bills  And their coupon positions--they were holding net  short positions in an anticipation of higher rates to come, and the size of that short position has  varied as that expectation has varied     They’ve moved out of the short position into about a small net long  [position] in early September, but now they’ve reestablished a moderate net short position again  in the last figures we’ve had     I mentioned that the six-month bill remained unchanged  I think the  year bill was also--     Yes, that’s right     There have been some  And there’s also been some liquidation by  some of the foreign accounts that are moving out of bills into the intermediate coupons     Well, I think they’re troubled by--they’re trying to sort out their own  analysis  I think if you polled them, they would talk about expecting some rate increases     Well, there certainly has been a flattening of the yield curve  I  wouldn’t want to venture, offhand, where we stand  These are the views--     Strength of demands for credit?     I’m still not sure--do you mean the strength of demand for credit or  demand for investors?     I’d say there’s a good bit of demand there of liquidity and demand  for a variety of instruments     It could work to slow that effort, but I think the rates--as I think that  we would still be able to have a--     It’s pushing, yes  "
529,1977-10-17,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee  records]     I think so, Governor Wallich  Well, both the directive and the sense  of the discussion at the meeting gave us what we thought was a course of normal procedure to  move in a gradual fashion  The strength was apparent, as I said, just within a day or two after  the meeting, and we just about immediately moved from 6-1/8 to the 6-1/4 midpoint, and then, as  we had that initial strength confirmed and then got further indications that we were not just at the  top but slightly over the top of the ranges, then we moved up in a measured way to the top of the  funds rate [range] that the Committee had specified     10/17-18/77 - 36 -           We give primary weight to the Board’s estimates  We look at the  New York estimates just as a kind of measure of, well, it’s just kind of a reminder that these,  after all, are projections, and not necessarily the final word on the subject     Well, I think there’s a continual communication with the Chairman   that includes discussion with senior staff members as we go along     It was really only in the aggregates--by October 6--that we were  really above the range, and at that point we were aiming for the 6-1/2 percent top of the funds  rate, and this was--as these steps are taken as we go along, there’s a consultative process in  which we are in touch with senior staff of the Committee here     I think that if we were 1 or 2 percentage points above the tops of the  ranges, this clearly raises a question that should be brought to the Chairman’s attention     I’m not sure what domestic balances you mean?     Yes  I’m not sure I do see any direct connection there  There tends  to be a reaction in the exchange markets to our money supply figures, which Scott had  commented on, though I gather this very last time there was less reaction than there had been on  other occasions when we would have to show a big increase in the aggregates--the dollar tends to  strengthen, but not so much this last occasion, I believe     Yes, that’s right     Well, as I see it Mr Chairman--maybe this is making it too  mechanical  I think there’s a zone of indifference in either case, but there’s a wider zone of     10/17-18/77 - 67 -         indifference with a money market directive, and if you want to try to roughly put a number on it,  as I conceive--     If you got very close to the extremes  "
557,1977-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Statement--see Appendix]   That’s all I have     Well, we have made moves in the funds rate during Treasury  financing periods on a couple of occasions  I don’t know that I can recall when we took this     11/15/77 - 31 -         specific action of selling Treasury bills outright in the market during a financing operation  But I  think, last spring and the spring of the previous year, we were moving up the funds rate in the  midst of a financing     If you mean by the same thing as sale of outright bills in the market,  I think--     I can’t recall the details of that  "
582,1977-12-19,"  But just because it went that route of another publicized Committee  decision, you could possibly get a bit more of a rate effect because you had to do it that way      [Statement--see Appendix]     They have tended to lighten their positions, Governor Coldwell, and  I’d say that that’s consistent with more of a feeling that rates are likely to rise next year  They     12/19-20/77 - 65 -         don’t see it as an immediate event, but they tend to feel that, sometime in the first quarter or first  half of next year, rates are likely to move higher       Well, I’ve heard it expressed--I think it extends across the board,  mainly, President Roos     Well, it seems to me, President Eastburn, that with a money market  directive such as we have had, that one would want to be very closely approaching the outer  limits of the indicated range before making any move in the funds rate     With an aggregates directive, it would be not quite as wide a zone of  indifference  I hesitate to get into the precise numbers on the thing, but at times we have  thought, when you get within about 1 percent[age point], say, of the outer bounds, that, with an  aggregates directive, then it’s time to consider moving away from what had been the central  point [of the federal funds rate range], I think      I don’t think we quite would have reached that, not much, but it  would have been moving on the horizon     That is how I would understand the final decision  "
623,1978-01-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      I’d say the predominant view now is that we’re aiming at 6-3/4   percent, although there’s a little bit of lingering uncertainty that maybe we’re going to be heading  toward 7 percent within a short time       I think that’s possible, Governor  I think one reason it was large was   that people were very much taken by surprise by the move and there was a lot of lightening of  inventories that went on right away--very immediately, the first thing Monday  morning  I don’t  know how much further improvement there might be as the idea is further instilled that 6-3/4  percent is the objective  I would think perhaps not too much       It has backed down some      The bills have come down about 10 or 15 basis points from where they   went initially and there has been maybe 6 or 8 basis points of improvement in other sectors  There  is perhaps room for somewhat more but I wouldn’t think a whole lot       They will be announcing a week from tomorrow on their quarterly     1/17/78             42  refunding operations      I would think so  Then again it depends on what sort of financing they   do  If they follow the recent pattern and have auctions, then there is a little more flexibility as to  the timing of anything the Committee would consider  There’s been some talk in the market of  coming with a fixed price issue on this occasion, which I think could circumscribe the flexibility of  adjusting the funds rate target       Well, I assume that this would mean not moving below 6-3/4 percent--  not even considering a move below 6-3/4 percent--unless we were down at the low end of the  ranges  And if we were down at that low end, we would want to be in touch with the Committee    "
648,1978-02-28,"  [Statement--see Appendix]            You could have a change in the law      I think it would be difficult for the market to absorb big sales of agency   issues on short notice      I=m not aware of such consideration      I think it would be hard for the market to absorb sales      Small sales?  We have allowed some runoff to occur in agency issues   as these reach maturity  That=s just a runoff      We did undertake in the past, on two occasions, sales of relatively   short maturities of agencies  On one occasion it went quite smoothly; on another occasion, it was  rather upsetting       On the order of one or two hundred million, is my recollection   "
663,1978-03-10,"  That is how we would have looked at it, absent these special factors   that Mr Axilrod has mentioned   "
687,1978-03-21,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      We have pointed it out to them and have sought additional flexibility   Of course, they have to do something with their funds  They want to put them in some earning  form and we have urged some of them to give us greater flexibility as to the maturity of bills that  they can buy, stretching out to longer issues--stretching out to coupon issues and on occasion going  into special Treasury issues for the time being  That has ameliorated the problem somewhat but a  number of these accounts are pretty much locked in by their own internal rules to very short-term  investments       No, for some of the accounts, the initial step is usually to take what  dollars they have accumulated and immediately buy bills  But some of them have been on  programs of funding out some of their holdings  Germany and Japan have gone a considerable way  in this direction and the United Kingdom has as well       We have pointed out the available range of investments to them      I think they are aware of that      I’d say it’s one of great caution, with no great conviction about an   immediate change of policy  There’s a feeling that because of the performance of the aggregates  and the economy no early move toward firming is likely  They are very much aware of the  international situation  I think if that cloud were not hanging over the market right now, there  would probably be a strong rallying move in the market because of the way the aggregates have  slowed down recently  But given the uncertainties about the dollar and the feeling that the  economy could rebound, there’s considerable wariness  Still, the underlying feeling is that as the  year goes along we are likely to see higher rates but that probably that move is a few months off       I would say so  Those positions are quite modest at this time      Slightly positive, but fairly close to even   "
711,1978-04-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Statement--see Appendix]       I would agree with that, President Morris  I didn’t think I was  apologizing but just explaining the rates as they were and the action we were taking under the  circumstances       4/18/78             43  "
751,1978-05-16,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       Well, bills, particularly short bills, are widely regarded and accurately  regarded as just being in very short supply  Our Desk was a big buyer of bills for foreign accounts  from late last year to the first few months of this year  That has lessened--turned around a little bit- -but that type of buying has been replaced, I think, by some buying of short bills by people who see  prospects of rising rates and want to stay in the shortest, most liquid, investment in the short term  as a hedge  They recognize that [rates on] bills are out of line in some historical sense  There are  those reasons for their being sold--foreign accounts, captive-type customers, and others who  [unintelligible]       I think the market perceives us as at kind of a tight 7-1/4--7-1/4  ranging a little [above it]       I think the account of it in the New York Times this morning was not a  bad one  The comment was that he thinks the target is still 7-1/4 but it’s a damn curious 7-1/4       The rate had averaged 7-3/8 through yesterday but today it’s a little  softer  It started out at 7-5/16 and it has been at 7-1/4       Well, I think a perception that the aggregates were consistently above  the midpoint of these ranges--    "
777,1978-06-20,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       If something were done in a very highly visible form just in the next day  or so, I think that might be a bit [upsetting] because they=re bidding on a coupon issue  But they  would not be that surprised by something that developed by the end of this week       I don=t think that would be a problem    "
802,1978-07-18,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       I think it would be difficult to implement  Once we’d gotten there,  then the market could perhaps over time be made to understand that is what we wanted  But the  process of getting it up just 1/8 without everybody thinking we want it up 1/4 is impossible       I think it may be hard to achieve that 7-7/8 without overshooting       I think so, but again, there would be a risk that the market could  assume that we wanted 8 and it could take a while to batter it down from the 8 percent level       Well, I think we at the Desk would like to have some idea in mind of  what we are to aim for       There is an auction of 1-year bills tomorrow and 2-year notes on  Thursday  And then they will announce a week from tomorrow the terms of the August refunding,  which will probably be about a 6 or 7 billion dollar [offering]       I think that should be workable, Mr Chairman    "
827,1978-08-15,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       Thank you  I acknowledge Lady Luck as part of it, giving a helping  hand in carrying that out, too       No sir       No, I'm sure you will be clarifying whatever the--       I think they might very well because we have a reserve need over the  next few days and it would be a probably convenient time--if we wanted to accommodate 8  percent--just to kind of permit that to happen       I think that would be an acceptable approach, Mr Chairman, yes       I think that would be fine    "
878,1978-10-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       No, I was not aware of that       I'm glad to hear that         10/17/78 43             "
902,1978-11-21,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       I think that could have been a reason on the part of some participants       It seems to be reasonably clear to me, Mr Chairman  It's hard to be  very disorderly within a 1/4 point range  The fed funds range is really quite a good one and very  appropriate in the current market    "
926,1978-12-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]          Well, as I mentioned, the dealers had a very poor year in 1977--the  worst since we have kept records of this  As a group, the primary dealers had losses on the order of  $100 million  This past year was not that bad, but it was a poor year  The figures we have together  at this point suggest a magnitude of roughly $30 million lost through nine months of the year  This  is a volatile industry; people are used to ups and downs, but I am concerned that there are some  longer-term factors at work there  I think [given] the growth in the number of dealers, they tended  to be very aggressive in their competition with each other, paring down margins  They have tried  to take positions because they can’t make money on the spreads as much anymore  They seem to  guess wrong quite frequently and take losses on positions  Just a series of factors, mostly  [involving] the aggressiveness of their competition, has impaired the profit opportunity  I think the  electronic means of communication that they have now has tended to [unintelligible] up the  competition as they scramble to make the best possible market to customers  And then many  customers are operating almost like dealers in the rapidity of their buying and selling activity in the  market       In ’77 losses were very general  Only a few dealers made very slim  profits and almost all of them made losses  There’s been more of a scatter--more dispersion--this  past year  A few have turned in a not too bad performance and some have been quite heavy losers          Well, I think the Treasury depends on a vital, healthy government  securities industry for the underwriting of its debt  I think market participants depend on a healthy  industry just because many seek to make liquidity adjustments in the government securities market  We are dependent on it in the execution of monetary policy--having a vital market out there where  we can buy and sell securities as we need to adjust reserve positions       Well, as I mentioned, there was wide dispersion in the ’77 losses  In  this past year, maybe about half of the firms have had losses  And some of the losses were quite  substantial--enough to give, on balance, a loss for the industry as a whole       Less than earlier, although there are still firms that seek to get in, not  because they expect to come in and make a lot of money in the government securities but because  they see it as necessary to round out their activity  A large corporate underwriting firm may see  this as a desirable adjunct to its business in the corporate area       Well, every once in a while one or another dealer comes up with the  suggestion  I wouldn’t say the Treasury might have to give it renewed consideration       I think one could say that to some extent, yes  I think that’s part of  this desire to enter an industry where the profit experience has been poor recently  They still want  to get in just [for the] prestige factor because they see it as a desirable way to peddle their corporate  securities    "
951,1979-02-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see  Appendix ]    It depends so much on what one expects the  particular factors affecting reserves to do that I don‘t know whether  it would be logical to tie [that authority] merely to the length of  the intermeeting periods Maybe we should undertake some further  study of it and, if it seems appropriate, come back with a  recommendation for a possible increase in that standard leeway    $ 3  billion is the standard  "
975,1979-03-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see  Appendix I    I would say that the thinking is back to 10  percent to slightly higher    I think we have, yes    Well, we have a differential now, Governor,  and I think it's one that generally induces the dealers to look  elsewhere before they come to us, although as you mentioned there has  been an increase this past year I think that is largely just because  of general shortages of collateral in the market    We are charging about double what they would  have to pay elsewhere    Well, the difference between 3/4 percent and  1-1/2 percent is already a substantial incentive for dealers to try to  find collateral anywhere I think over this past year, with the  growth in the use of the repurchase agreement by banks, there has just     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -37-   been that much less collateral in the market I don't think that's a  lasting situation; at least I hope it's not  "
996,1979-04-17," At the moment there is certainly ample  collateral around, but some of those bills will be maturing later this  week and next week, so we could get back into a situation of scarce  collateral    The greater part of it was for intervention,  yes    At the moment there’s a temporary bulge in  dealers’ holdings of very short-term issues, particularly of Treasury  bills, so I think the day-to-day financing costs are toward the high  end of some range of variation But I expect that to be transitory;  those rates will probably come down in the next couple of weeks    CDs have been under some special influence  because banks have been willing to pay off CDs, and they have obtained  more of their financing recently from Eurodollar takedowns The  commercial paper rate seems to me to be about in a normal relationship  to the funds rate    Yes  "
1018,1979-04-27," Yes I am, Mr Chairman    As for market conditions, I don’t think I’d have anything  significant to add to what Steve has given I’d perhaps just note one thing--that, as he said, the  longer end of the market has been heavy and I would think that’s in part also because inflation  expectations are continuing quite strong Also, and this is very hard to quantify, I think there is a  bit of disappointment in the market that there wasn’t a firming after the last meeting that  participants in the long market could have interpreted as a strengthening of System intentions to get  a grip on inflation But, as I say, I don’t know how much to make of that factor As for the federal  funds rate, in the last full week that has averaged 1009 percent; in the previous couple of weeks it  was just a shade under 10 percent We have, of course, been continuing to aim in the 10 to 10-1/8  percent range On your question about what the Desk would be aiming for in the absence of new  instructions, it seems to me that the strength in the aggregates is such as to call for a response from  the Desk And it appears to me that something on the order of a 10-1/4 percent funds rate would be  about what I would be recommending in light of the performance of the aggregates     4/27/19 4   The other factor I want to call to the Committee’s attention is the delicate timing that  we face now because of the Treasury funding that Steve also referred to The Treasury announced  the 10-year and 30-year auctions that are coming up on next Tuesday and Wednesday If there  were to be any adjustment to our funds rate objective, I think it would be important to make that  intention clear to the market today if possible and Monday so that market participants could bid in  [those auctions with] some reasonable knowledge of where policy is now  "
1039,1979-05-22," Well, the System has its objective and I  think we want that objective to be apparent to the market We felt at  the time that it was particularly important that the message get  through clearly and quickly or it might otherwise have [been an issue  as the Treasury auction] approached Sometimes it's convenient to let  the market tighten on its own if that is the [desired] direction of  change and just step in to indicate the bounds of any change that  might be indicated But in this case the change was made on a Friday  and the Treasury's auctions were going to be on Tuesday and Wednesday  We wanted to make it known that we were aiming for something higher  and, since our initial step would be in the direction of pushing the  funds rate higher, we wanted to be sure we would have time to indicate  to the market just how high--to indicate an upper bound as well I'd  say it's ordinarily important to let the market know what we want, but  at times like that it is particularly important to let it know very  promptly    I'd say they've become more conscious of the  flattening or softening in the economy at least for the near term  Whereas a few weeks ago there was a fair amount of sentiment that  rates were likely to push higher in the near term, I'd say that is not  the expectation at the moment At least there is a feeling that for  the near term there is likely to be little change, though many people  in the market still feel that over a little longer horizon, say the  next several months as against a shorter outlook of only the next  month or so, there might well be a need for higher rates because of  persisting inflationary pressures The sentiment among quite a few in  the market is that the economy has not reached a peak and might well  continue on a strengthening course, although only moderately gaining  strength    They have There had been a tendency to  keep their inventories of securities very low or modestly short until  the time of this last refunding In that refunding they took on a  substantial supply of the 10-year and 30-year issues As I mentioned,  the distribution of those issues was quite slow, although it would     5/22/79 -6 -    appear that even when some retail demand developed some of the dealers  at any rate were not all that eager to get rid of their supply Some  apparently are a little more willing now to hold on to their supply in  the anticipation that maybe those securities will rise in price I  wouldn't call that--    In the longer area there is a net long  position, which was not true a month ago What they did was to take  on a long position--this is in the over 5-year area--with the  refunding and it has been whittled down some But they still have a  net long position    Just about even at this point, I would  think, or maybe slightly negative   M R   EASTBURN Peter, could I ask you a question about the  discount rate? Is the market now in a mood to make a distinction  between a technical adjustment of, say, 1/4 point and not confuse that  with a signal for tighter money?   M R   STERNLIGHT It might well be because I think there is an  appreciation [of the current situation] among market players Even  though they don't see the grounds for a general push to higher rates,  they are conscious of the growth in the volume of borrowing, and they  are aware that borrowing has gotten up to the level that on some past  occasions has triggered a rate increase So I think that might be a  fair characterization    Within 1/2 percentage point  "
1082,1979-07-11," [Statement--see Appendix]    Well, some dealers had them, but for the  most part they were keeping fairly low inventories  dealers made any great killing on this rally because they've been so  cautious right along Taking the dealers as a group they've held  rather a lean inventory They've stocked up when a new issue came  along but then they've wanted to sell out their holdings quite soon  They've been caught too many times recently waiting for that great  rally and have been disappointed in it   I don't think the    No, I was speaking of them as a group Some  have done reasonably well, but as a group they have not held large  inventories at the time when prices rose substantially    I have not in this recent period I think  that has often been a factor, particularly in the longer-term markets;  but it almost seemed notable for its absence during the past month    Well, that's the implication of the  arithmetic; yes, I think that would follow  "
1125,1979-07-19," Mr Chairman, Peter Sternlight May I just interject? With respect to any possible implementation of that increased upper end of the range, I think there is the Treasury financing to consider If you were looking at doing something a week from now, that would be right in the midst of the Treasury auction   That's right, Mr Chairman Funds were at a 1040 percent average today I don't think there will be any great problem   I don't think so "
1151,1979-08-14," It's in the area of 4 to 6 years--something like that   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would just like to say first that I appreciate very much the Committee's earlier action and expression of confidence [Statement--see Appendix]   In issues over one year, as of Friday which is my last figure, they had about a $460 million net long position No doubt it is lower now because we did some sizable buying of coupon issues yesterday We bought almost a billion dollars of coupon issues yesterday, some of which would have come from the dealers' inventories and some from customers I would guess that they are probably at close to an even position in over 1-year issues   Well, that goes up and down as the market gears up for a Treasury refunding and then takes on those securities Typically [dealers] have wanted to be moderately short in their positions because they had that kind of view of the market They had gotten into a deeper short position as this Treasury quarterly refunding approached They used the refunding to build up a long position and by now they have distributed securities that they had taken on and have gotten back to close to an even position again, I would say   They seem to want to be in about a balanced or slight short position    8/14/79   I didn't give that precise a figure   They report it both ways They give the average length including Fed holdings and government accounts and excluding them They have achieved a significant lengthening on either basis I wouldn't say that our behavior has been a major factor in enabling them to lengthen the average   It might be up to around 4 years or so I think our average length might be slightly longer We have been conscious of that and for that reason on the recent quarterly rollovers we have steered a somewhat greater proportion of our rollovers into the shorter options "
1179,1979-09-18," [Statement--see Appendix]    They're trying to tie the debt ceiling to  the budget resolution, but whether that will--     9/18/79 -5-    Well, it’s either double or three times     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -45-    It has been on about a 6-month review    Well, the way the funds market has gone this  week, the funds rate has been averaging, through yesterday, 1139  percent But actually, the funds rate on the day yesterday was about  11-1/2 percent and today it was starting out on the firm side We  went in early because the funds rate had moved to 11-5/8 percent, so  we were trying to hold down the funds rate at--  "
1194,1979-10-05," There has been word from our Desk--1 think  these rumors actually started in the foreign exchange markets but a  few of the domestic dealers have been calling us on this--about a  rumor that Chairman Volcker has resigned And this is having a  downward effect on the securities market    Steve reported on the aggregates and the  interest rate changes I just want to convey also the extent of  apprehension and the expectancy in the market that something is being  shaped up to deal with the current situation AS far as the funds  rate goes, as Steve mentioned there were upward pressures around the  end of the quarter We had trouble getting out all the reserves that  we would have liked and we had the fed funds rate averaging 1190  percent in that week on several days it was higher We have still  been aiming for 11-1/2 percent, but with an approach of being tolerant  of rates somewhat above that and strongly resisting anything below  that Yesterday many people in the market were getting the idea that  we were probably really aiming at something like 11-5/8 percent And     10/05/79 -4-   in restating our approach today, we are making more acknowledgments of  that in light of the background situation We have been saying that  we are aiming for about 11-1/2 percent or somewhat higher but if it  got up to 11-3/4 percent we would continue to resist a rate as high as  that And now Scott Pardee has some comments  "
1214,1979-10-06," Mr Chairman, those of us who have the  Axilrod-Sternlight memo in wire form have a different pagination    My guess, for what it's worth at this point,  is that pushing borrowing to a billion and a half dollars might tend  to push the funds rate higher, but that's just my feeling    Another tricky little thing, if we are going  to start something [different] as of right now, is that we are within  a statement week The statement week has just two days left as well  as a partial holiday, which is usually associated with lousing up the  estimates So there may not be very much of--    Play it by ear  "
1233,1979-10-22," Mr Chairman, I thought I might fill in on  Steve’s comments just by giving you some [details] of the surrounding  market developments and summarizing some of [the developments since]  October 6   The market at that time reacted, as you know, with steep  rate increases and close to disorderly conditions Bill rates moved  up 100 basis points and long bonds were up 50 basis points By the  Friday after the announcement, October 12, some stability was  beginning to emerge and it gained some greater foundation by the  following Wednesday, October 17, although the atmosphere was still  fragile and uncertain However, at that point we were not really  getting the pressure on bank reserve positions we had been seeking  We had started, as you recall, with the idea that funds might trade in  the area of 13 to 13-1/4 percent with borrowing of about $1-1/2  billion But after seeing new strength in the aggregates even before  the further strength that Steve reported on--that is, even by October  12--we were thinking that we ought to be increasing the pressure on  nonborrowed reserves such that borrowing would be pushed up to the  $18 billion area   In the week ending last Wednesday, October 17, we did get a  funds rate of about the 13-1/4 percent that we were seeking then and  we got a bulge in borrowing on Wednesday that brought the weekly  average up to $15 billion That was still somewhat under the average  borrowing we wanted; and since it came [in the form of] a late  Wednesday bulge, there was not really the sense of reserve pressure  associated with it that we thought was needed In the meantime, we  began to get more data on the aggregates and they looked even  stronger, as Steve has summarized So then we thought that borrowing  ought to be getting up to the $25 to $29 billion area To apply  this greater pressure on reserves, we sold some bills in the market on  October 18 That did push up the funds rate to 14 percent by last  Thursday afternoon and predominantly to 15 percent on Friday, with  some trading in volume at 16 to 16-1/2 percent   The market, which as 1 mentioned had begun to find some  stability in the few preceding days, so ld  off sharply further on  Thursday and Friday in a worsening atmosphere, as participants sensed  a more restrictive Fed move and worried about the upcoming Treasury  auctions Three-month bill rates moved up another 70 basis points on  Thursday and Friday and yields on long coupon issues were up about a  quarter percentage point  close to the ragged edge, or maybe even over it, on Friday afternoon  There was a real question of auction coverage as we approached the  Treasury financings for this week   In my judgment, the market was getting very   This morning the funds market opened at 16 percent but fairly  early on went up to as high as 18 percent Other market rates were  pushing somewhat higher in very thin markets  trading going on--just a few transactions--and the atmosphere was very  poor We went into the market at 945 am and offered overnight  repurchase agreements At that point we didn’t even have our reserve  numbers We did learn subsequently that reserves had fallen short of  our estimates over the weekend by a sizable amount so that even though   There was almost no     10/22/79 -3   borrowing rose to a little over $3 billion on Friday, as Steve  mentioned, we still think there is a need for reserves in this current  week So we felt that we could go ahead and do a sizable amount of  overnight RPs and we did about $37 billion of them We’re prepared  to do more if the funds rate stays as high as the 17-1/2 percent [that  prevailed] as we were [conducting our] RP transactions My report  just as this call [got under way] was that the funds rate was  beginning to ease back from the 17-1/2 percent level to 17-l/4  percent, so we‘re staying our hand for just now We’ll watch that  closely and be ready to go in again if we get a sense that the funds  rate is remaining excessively high In the meantime we stand with the  question that Steve raised about the consistency of meeting our  reserves objectives within the funds rate constraints that the  Committee has set That’s all I have, Mr Chairman    We were looking at a need for additional  reserves  RPs I don't think we could continue doing that much overnight for  the next two days; that would be overdoing it I don't know that we  would have to do that much again on Tuesday and Wednesday, but at the  moment there is some room for additional day-to-day reserves   We did supply some by doing the $3-314 billion of overnight    It's hard to hear you, Governor Rice    I understand that it was, Mr Chairman,  though I didn't see it picked up in the press But our press officer  told me that it was definitely pointed out at the briefing  "
1257,1979-11-20," I think that would make it 34 or 35 or  something close to that    Yes    Well, there are a couple of firms that have  been added to the reporting list with whom we do not yet trade One  that was added several years ago but hasn’t quite brought itself to  sufficient volume for us to trade with is the Crocker Bank Also,  Smith Barney was added to the reporting list just a few months ago and  it is getting very close to the point of having a trading  relationship   M R   KIMBREL What is the split between banks and nonbanks?    About 1/3 of them are banks     11/20/79 -6-    We’ve got reserves that are generated by  deposits in the aggregate and [we look at] other factors that generate  reserves    We'd be guided by how reserves are coming  out in relation to path, president Balles  "
1285,1980-01-08," [Statement--see Appendix]   That was for all of '79   If I can interject, these last few days seem difficult to explain; the rather low level of borrowing is just not    1/8-9/80  what one would associate with a funds rate of around 2 percent over the discount rate And, as Steve mentioned, because of that we made an interim adjustment in what we were aiming for in nonborrowed reserves, feeling that to try to press nonborrowed reserves down to the path level in this current week would have meant going into the market and extracting reserves when the funds rate was around 13-3/4 or 14 percent That obviously didn't make sense; and in effect we've been running this week with an assumption that an adjustment of about $500 to $600 million should be added to the nonborrowed or taken away from the [borrowed] reserves   Well, I think you sorted out those points very well, Governor Wallich Borrowing has always had this kind of dual role It's a source of reserves, but it's a source of reserves with a string on it and is certainly less expansionary than if those reserves came from open market purchases or even from float or some other factor beyond our control We've found ourselves having to make adjustments for the possible change in attitudes of banks toward the window I alluded to one just now We are not sure--and any conclusion drawn from the last few days would be very preliminary--but to the extent that there may be something to it, we have made an interim adjustment to allow for that greater reluctance to use the window these last few days and have been willing to provide more nonborrowed reserves accordingly    1/8-9/80   Well, we're puzzled, particularly because during the first two weeks of this last [period], as Steve said, it looked as if banks might be getting back to a more normal relationship of borrowing and the discount rate And this current week just seems to be a little world of its own; I think it is really too [early] to draw any conclusion from it   I tend to associate that with the year-end pressures to a considerable extent, perhaps more than the new operating techniques because, after all, they didn't jump to hold high excess reserves right after October 6th   It has been surprisingly stable, yes   I think there is some appeal to that, President Roos, except that in a period like this where we felt there was an overriding reason for making these adjustments in the path, I would wonder if in this whole dialogue to the public announcing a path  -9-    1/8-9/80  and then having to modify it could lead to considerably more uncertainty and confusion than if we could have some understanding that we have to exercise some flexibility as we apply this procedure   Well, I would certainly hope that we can get to the point where we can explain more to the public about the general methodology and how we formulate these paths and carry them out At what point we might want to or be able to post the path on the wall while we're going through a period, I don't know I feel it's too early to reach a judgment on that   Well, I don't know if you're speaking of the whole period or just this current week   Not in this recent period "
1313,1980-02-04," Yes, I'd like to add a word or two I feel much less convinced than Mr Axilrod that there would be significant benefits from a switch to contemporaneous accounting I can see the theoretical case that he makes I'd be among those who feel that in the longer run even that theoretical case makes very little, if any, difference I can see some impediments to the Desk's operations under a contemporaneous system in that we don't know required reserves in the week we're operating in Perhaps more significant than that, when some deviation in required reserves stems from a factor other than the behavior of the monetary aggregates--for example, a bulge in interbank deposits or something of that nature that essentially we would want to accommodate rather than resist as part of our reserve targeting--I think contemporaneous accounting could send us off in a perverse direction So, I came out feeling that there is not all that much advantage to it And having the minus on the membership side--I don't know how strongly to evaluate it, but I am told that it still does have some significance--just made me pretty dubious about the desirability of a change   I don't think I'll take that long, Mr Chairman Shall I go ahead?   [Statement--see Appendix]  -19-    2/4-5/80   I hadn't focused on a particular quantity, Governor Wallich It's just that ""expectations of inflation"" seems to be the most commonly cited factor for this very marked rise in the longer end of the market, with the longer bonds up about 100 basis points over the past month And there is the budget message; even though it perhaps more frankly acknowledged inflation than some past Administration messages, there is still the feeling that if the Administration is saying it's that bad, it's going to be even worse I guess this is the kind of thing that greets one at times like this   I suppose just fear of the unknown, really We're coming out with something new, and it's partly that It's partly perhaps a misconception that since these new series are likely to include some elements that have been growing rapidly the aggregates will tend to show more rapid growth That's the feeling If there is some account taken of the checkable deposits and money market funds--   No, but they have expressed skepticism about the recent seasonal Certainly I have heard the comment that the slow growth in the past few months may have partly reflected an inadequate seasonal adjustment for that period   Well, I think they might feel that some of their skepticism was well placed   [Unintelligible] foreign deposits   We run on a reserve path What we're aiming for is a reserve path that's built on the midpoint if you pick a range or the approximate point if you pick an approximate point "
1354,1980-03-18," Shall I proceed, Mr Chairman?   [Statement--see Appendix]   I really don't think it would have mattered a great deal, President Morris I have not regarded the lagged accounting as a significant impediment to achieving the [path], as long as we are able to make the kinds of adjustments we make in the nonborrowed path to bring speedier adjustments to the growth of the aggregates I don't think it matters a great deal    3/18/80   Well, even with contemporaneous accounting, we are going to get bulges at times; and if we didn't provide the reserves, [the reserve needs] would be met at the discount window The banks would have to borrow, or would have to do something, to get the reserves to meet their requirements   I think that is right   Certainly so, given the new look at the discount window   I would say that what we have in mind from day to day is more of a nonborrowed objective Although as I described, in certain circumstances, such as when we get a bulge of borrowing over the weekend that may have been caused by banks anticipating a discount rate action, it seems sensible to come in below, let's say, a nonborrowed interim objective   Oh, I get a tentative figure every day, yes   If we don't provide the reserves in nonborrowed form, they will have to get the reserves either through borrowings or be deficient in their reserves   Well, it depends on what degree of pressure we want to impose on them at that moment   The Committee has set bounds on the funds rate If total reserves were the overriding objective, bar nothing, then we could drive interest rates up to just about any point, I would think   And we did that   Well, of course, the discount rate was moved in the middle of February along with the Desk taking measures to impose greater reserve restraint There was a certain amount of pressure that emerged almost automatically out of the process just by our sticking to our nonborrowed path when the banks were demanding additional reserves That automatically imposed some increased need for borrowing And then a further downward adjustment was made in the nonborrowed path to increase the degree of pressure, and at about the same time the discount rate was raised So by forcing the banks to borrow--I think it was around $18 billion--at an even higher discount rate, we put still greater upward pressure [on rates] What we got, as I described, was a very substantial move in short-term rates of 3 or 4 percentage points over a few weeks And I think it got some banks feeling that they were staring very hard at the possibility of a crunch and the prospect of just not being able to fund themselves So in that sense the program is working; it has [produced] very real restraint for the banking system I don't know that bigger moves or earlier moves in the discount rate would have done anything more than was being done [through our operations] I don't know that we should have [done] more because I think we were imposing quite a bit of restraint   Well, we were in the midst of a period of sizable reserve provision and it was a judgment that we should divide up that purchase We anticipated the need to provide for an outright increase in the portfolio of some $1-1/2 billion It seemed appropriate to do the bulk of it in the bill area, but we had not bought any coupon issues for a few months and just in accord with the past dispersion of our buying it seemed appropriate to do some portion of it in coupons   We want to keep in mind that we don't want to buy at a time when issues are very scarce and we'd have a sharp impact on prices Certainly the fact that the coupons were available would make some marginal difference in our decisions   We did a bum job of stabilizing!   In a way, I have been surprised, given the extent of rate moves in the market, that there haven't been more problems cropping up in the GNMA area It may be that they had enough of a scare last October when there were fears of problems in the GNMA market From that point on, I have had the impression that activity has been curtailed in those GNMA futures Some of the regulators have gotten after their constituents--the S&Ls and credit unions and banks to some degree--to warn them about undertaking investment activities that may not be suitable to their investment objectives But, at the same time, I can't rule out the possibility that some of those problems could crop up again I don't have a sense of any pending disaster there, but there could be some more [unintelligible]  -15-    3/18/80   New York has a stronger estimate for April, partly because of the tax refunds   Yes, that's part of the difference; I really don't know if that's the whole difference   The overall difference is about 8 percentage points but my impression was that the tax refunds accounted for about 3 or 4 percentage points of that   It's worth keeping in mind that one reason borrowing has been high was the anticipation of something happening in the discount rate Something did happen and there's a much greater uncertainty factor than usual, given the whole surcharge situation now I think there is more need for flexibility in whatever understanding the Committee reaches on that borrowing level "
1377,1980-04-22," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the aggregates have proved once again their lack of short-run predictability We thought we had a sure thing going with April because [the money supply in] April has bulged every year for the past 4 or 5 years it seems   I'm not sure that I can pinpoint any special factor I don't know if Steve wants to add anything In New York our faces are even redder than those of the Board staff because we were anticipating an even greater bulge   Well, I don't really want to claim any paternity for the money projections that are made in New York! I look at all those projections with great skepticism In projecting a fairly strong May and June, basically I think our people felt that they did not see a reason at this point to change the quarterly growth patterns, which they tend to feel a little more confident in than the month-to-month gyrations And to have the quarterly growth come in as they had seen it before, having had a weak March and April, one is driven to project a rebound in May and June   They would be basing it on their own [forecast], but that is not a very different outlook in this case   It's about 17 percent   That really has more to do with the construction of the paths than specific Desk action Having the ""or less"" gives me a little sense or tone of being a bit more accommodative of lower growth Steve might want to comment on that "
1397,1980-04-29," I wouldn't have anything to add [on the aggregates and reserves] I'll just add the thought that as we were aiming for the nonborrowed reserves on the path, [we have seen] along with those weakening aggregates a further decline in rates, especially short rates The bill rates in yesterday's auction, for example, were down nearly 2 percentage points for the 3-month bill and about 1 percentage point for the 6-month bill   I commented first to Chairman Volcker that I didn't have anything to add to Steve's commentary on the aggregates But with respect to interest rate moves in the past week, I noted that at the short end there had been a further marked decline--particularly in bill rates In yesterday's auction, rates were down from a week earlier by close to 2 percentage points for the 3-month bill and around 1 percentage point for the 6-month bill  The Chairman then asked me about market attitudes I think there has been some surprise in the markets at the extent of the rate declines I do not get a strong sense at this point, I must say, of great concern in the markets about the extent of the declines Nevertheless, my own inner feeling is that such a concern could build up if we were to continue to get sizable declines and if there were a market sense that we were permitting, with little or no resistance, substantial further declines in rates But I would honestly have to say that up to now I do not sense great alarm, from the domestic markets anyway, about the extent of the decline in rates   That's true I'd say red-facedly that we obviously had a stronger April than the Board staff had--far stronger than it turned out We continue to be higher for May than the Board staff I think we're projecting about 8 or 9 percent growth   Well, not below but it could be darn close to it   Well, looking at day-to-day rates, Mr Chairman, the funds rate has come down most recently to about 14    4/29/80  percent I would have said a few days ago that funds had lagged a little against some other market rates but I think it has had a fairly substantial decline now   I suppose that's right, but at 14 percent it would be some 3-1/2 percentage points under last week's average Mr Chairman, would I be right in inferring from the approach that you suggested that there is no great reluctance to see the funds rate move somewhat below 14 percent or down toward the 13 percent level?   If it happened in the pursuit of our paths-- "
1416,1980-05-06," The last I heard it was 11-7/8 percent The market is really waiting to see what actions the Desk might take because there is a sense of reserves being available today    5/6/80   Well, I think it depends on the Committee's decision, Mr Chairman   Well, compared with our interim nonborrowed reserves objective, we're looking at a need to take out something like $500 to $700 million But one might say that there isn't a great need to take that out, given how far below we're running on total reserves, as Steve has outlined   The funds rate presumably would soften, down to whatever lower bound the Committee agrees on   I think it could, yes "
1440,1980-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   We are trying to achieve nonborrowed reserve levels that have been associated with the Committee's targets I don't think we are able to achieve, on a month-to-month basis, the Committee's monetary growth targets   Right   No, not in terms of the monetary base But we do have specific figures for nonborrowed reserves that we are trying to achieve--in this case for both the 4-week interval and week by week We have an objective that can be modified from one week to the next because of technical factors On one occasion we added some to the nonborrowed [path] because we were so far below on total reserves going through this period   Total reserves are certainly lower The nonborrowed figure, as I mentioned, is coming out about on track   Well, as I say, on nonborrowed we are coming out about on track for this period For the total reserves, I think one can get a different view depending on what intervals one takes I tend to think of this as the four-week block of time between Committee meetings And total reserves are coming out well below the path, by some $850 million, on our estimate   Well, part of the whole procedure that we are on now involves an almost automatic adjustment, because if total reserves are coming in weak and money supply is coming in weak, aiming for nonborrowed reserves means that there is going to be less demand for borrowing I described how the borrowing had fallen off and with that [interest] rates had dropped off quite sharply  -10-    5/20/80   In part what happens is that it is an almost automatic response because as we aim for the path of nonborrowed reserves it calls for less borrowings, and conditions ease And over time--not within a month's time but over some longer time--this is supposed to generate greater monetary growth   I'm not sure we could achieve it; I think we could come closer than we did if there were no federal funds rate constraint   We did run into the funds rate constraint during the period, and the Committee acted on it   Not from what I see here, particularly If monetary growth should speed up, certainly it would be possible  -12-    5/20/80   It seems to me that when we had a 20 percent top, we were a little eager at times to put some reserves in when we were getting very close to that top "
1462,1980-06-05," I didn't hear your question, Mr Chairman    6/5/80   Well, I agree with Steve that on the path he outlined we are likely to be encountering that lower bound of the funds rate I think it has been somewhat fortuitous that in the latest week the average rate moved up to about 10-3/4 percent from the 9-1/2 percent of the previous week In meeting this week's reserve need I think we are likely to find that 9-1/2 percent checkpoint constraining And it could inhibit our meeting the Committee's reserve path "
1534,1980-08-12," [Statement--see Appendix]   It's more prevalent than it was I don't have fully up-to-date figures on that I expect that they are really long and really hurting to some degree   It's about a week or two We're only getting those futures positions twice a month now, so we're not quite up-to-date on that   We're implementing a whole new set of dealer reports We began one schedule, which we've been getting for just a month Within the next few months we'll be getting a report that will have the futures position daily, but we don't have that phased in yet   Well, there is some adjustment In fact, we make modest technical adjustments in the path, which are worked out mostly by Ed Ettin and Steve Axilrod in consultation with the Desk There was a modest adjustment allowing for the higher level of excess reserves, although it went up only a small extent of the way, in the review that was conducted a few days ago I think your point is certainly a valid one Nevertheless, I would note that in a sense that [bulge] in excess reserves is not causing us to aim for significantly higher levels of borrowed reserves currently because at the same time the banks have been wanting to hold a lot of excess reserves they also--irrationally, perhaps--have come in [to the discount window] and done a fair amount of borrowing So one could argue that we should also have allowed for the reserves they got via the borrowing route But in the forward-looking part of our path we were not deliberately forcing the banks to borrow much more than that roughly $100 million level that had been the starting point for borrowings when the path was set up for this recent period   Yes, usually we have assumed that a high excess reserve week would be followed by a week in which excess reserves would be subnormal But this time we figured that there may have been something unusual in the demand for excess, so our assumption was that excess reserves would come back more or less to normal rather than to subnormal   Well, at some other level, I could say that in a way we did respond to that In that last full week that had the $1 billion plus of excess reserves we were trying to take out the excess, but we had no expectation that we were going to be able to    8/12/80  wring out all of it To have wrung it all out probably would have sent the funds rate soaring As it was, when we were taking out as much of the excess as we could, the funds rate was fairly easy at around the 7 percent level   You're only responding to the funds rate then, aren't you, Governor?   I think we'd like to have a band for the federal funds rate a few percentage points wide so we have the most flexibility It depends at any particular point on approximately what level of borrowings we're looking toward In the recent period, when the objective was to have borrowings around the $100 million level, the relationships have made pretty good sense, with the discount rate at a point such that funds could vary from moderately below to something above the discount rate [It helps] to have the discount rate somewhere well within that band where we would expect the funds rate to be moving   Well, I don't know Yes, if borrowing is going to average as low as $100 million, I would expect the funds rate would more often fall below [the discount rate] than above To pick numbers out, I'd say from 8-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent surrounding, in a somewhat lopsided way, a 10 percent discount rate   No, not for all time I think it has made sense given the objectives that the Committee set out a month ago on wanting to achieve the aggregates that it specified   It could have an effect on the way we tie in a level of borrowing in our path I'm not sure I want to try to extemporize entirely on how it might impede our [operations] But instinctively I feel it would call for some adjustment in the way we have operated in the past with a borrowing level that tends to fall out as the differential [changes] We have had borrowing levels that rise because demands for required reserves exceed what we have allowed for in the path If we also had a discount rate that was going to be moving up along with that, it could set in motion this kind of ratcheting process unless we made some adjustment   I think M2 gets less attention largely because it only comes out monthly There has been some notice taken of it   Well, it's true that you won't announce this today You will be announcing in a few days that at the July meeting the funds range was 8-1/2 to 14 percent So if the market should see the Desk being more accommodative--if the numbers worked out that way --and funds were trading in the 8 to 8-1/2 percent range, then I think they would get the idea before [the new range is released], perhaps even in the next--   With borrowing averaging $100 million, I'd expect it to be a little more often below 10 percent than above, perhaps in a range of 9 to 10-1/4 percent   Mr Chairman, if that estimated $3 billion increase [in M-1A] holds up, I don't think anything would flow automatically from that in terms of raising the borrowing because we would build the paths assuming that $3 billion   Yes "
1548,1980-08-22," I think at first blush they will be slightly pleased at the approximately $3-1/2 billion decline Then they'll get to looking at the upward revision and become a little more concerned about it On balance, I think it's going to be a slight negative "
1571,1980-09-16," [Statement--see Appendix]   I'm not sure It depends somewhat on the time period one takes Mid-June was just about the low point in the market rates The funds rate had come down in June, I believe, to the 9 percent area   Well, I'm not sure which follows which Normally, some of these other rates tend to build on the funds rate or on dealer financing costs, [which] tend to track fairly close to the funds rate As one goes out in the maturity spectrum, there is a descending degree of tracking to the dealer financing costs   I don't think it was a serious inhibition I would not say that it was something that caused us to intervene; I would say that it was something that modified in some modest degree the form of intervention We had some reserves to drain to meet our paths We undertook those draining operations rather gingerly; for a few days, we got some help from the Treasury by getting them to raise their balance so that reserves could be taken out without the Desk having to enter the market in an overt way and be seen taking reserves out aggressively   I don't think it stopped us at any point, really, from reaching our paths   We were not holding down the funds rate; we were seeking in late August to reach our reserve paths in a way that avoided putting aggressive new upward pressure on it In any event, the funds rate at one point touched the lower bound of 8-1/2 percent in July, around mid-July, and was up to nearly 11 percent in August So it may be to some extent just a choice of the time period in your comparison   Well, if you used something like the past 5-week interval, the funds rate would be up something like 1-3/4 percentage points--from around 9 to, say, 10-3/4 percent--which is roughly [comparable to the move on] other short-term rates   Total reserves were [above the path]; we were about on target on the nonborrowed reserves If the aggregates had not overshot the target, yes, that surely would have made--   Just in the last week or two, I would share that sense There was one incident during the period, which I mentioned, when we did some RPs and the markets really took off; but they just may have been reacting because they had overdone their sell- off during August I wouldn't want to bet a lot of money that they have really matured to the point where they will take our operations as fully in stride as we'd like from day to day   That's true, but--   Well, with the Times change, there is a better man on the bond market But this period of misunderstanding did not involve just that one paper or just the press, Mr Chairman I think it was people in the market, too    9/16/80   It's Foldesse He is writing it sometimes, I think   Maybe he's on vacation   As to whether the rate level has been a problem, it has [made it] difficult in these last couple of weeks in terms of aiming for nonborrowed reserves in that we expected some greater borrowing It has been hard to gauge just how much that borrowing would be I think one of the factors was that the funds rate was 1/2 or 3/4 or sometimes even a point above the discount rate and there was an attraction to the discount window, which makes it harder to judge I wouldn't say that it is a serious problem for us at this point nor do I get the sense that it has been that serious-- some of you [from the Reserve Banks] probably know better--in the administration of the window As to market expectations, there was some feeling around late August that there might be a move on the discount rate That has died down some Possibly it has begun to crop up again lately, but I have not heard too many comments on that   I think at the moment it would be something of a surprise, yes   I don't see it making the job easier   I'm not sure we have a closely reasoned rationale for just how we arrive at those [adjustments] This is done in consultation with Mr Axilrod and his staff, but it was with Ed    9/16/80  Ettin at the time I believe Were you there, Steve? We have close consultation with the Chairman as well On this occasion and in other instances when that kind of adjustment was made, it was typically for some fraction--often roughly but not precisely half--of the overage or underage of total reserves from the path I must say that on this particular occasion it was also because we had had a bulge in borrowing in the Labor Day week And if no such adjustment had been made--if we had not reduced the nonborrowed path--it would have left us in a position of expecting almost no adjustment borrowing for the balance of the period In a way one might say we backed into it by saying, in effect, that we probably wanted to keep adjustment borrowing in the $400 to $500 million area And that contributed in a major way to that $150 million decision   I don't think it's that--   Yes, we could There's always that question of how much we want to compensate for that high borrowing We faced that kind of decision in [this statement] week   This week could average about $11 billion   It was $13 billion through yesterday   1080 percent   Well, it's an important part of the Committee decision I wish we were better able to give you guidance to know what the relationship of the funds rate and borrowings is   I may have missed it, but I don't think you formally approved the Open Market Desk's [intermeeting] operations "
1595,1980-10-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   The drop in required reserves is on the order of $3 to $3-1/2 [billion] There's also, depending on what we do with definitions, a large increase in excess reserves Of course, we don't expect to offset that raw figure for excess reserves In fact we are still having staff discussions on that   That's right  -12-    10/21/80   The $3 to $3-1/2 [billion] would be a net of the phase down [in required reserves] for member banks and the first phasing in for nonmembers   We were following our nonborrowed path during those periods For the most recent period, as I mentioned, we will be coming out very close to the path on the nonborrowed reserves Total reserves are running above path essentially because of the strong growth in the aggregates We have not accommodated that increase The banks have been obliged to get those additional reserves from the discount window And in the course of seeking those reserves, they've had to bid up the funds rate; and we have had the interest rate increases that I mentioned We did take some further [tightening] action during the period, as I mentioned As we saw the total reserve path running at $400 or $500 million above the path, we acted to reduce the nonborrowed path by $200 million midway through the period That had a reinforcing effect on bolstering the need for borrowings and stepping up the pressure on the banking system   I think it's essentially the latter, President Roos, because by sticking with our nonborrowed reserve path for the period we are saying we are going to provide nonborrowed reserves in line with the path and the additional reserves will have to be obtained at the discount window And banks are subject to those pressures that emerge when there has been a persistent sizable borrowing   Yes   Well, as I said, by sticking with the nonborrowed path, pressure emerges on the banking system; and we did accelerate that pressure somewhat by reducing the nonborrowed path We could have gone still further with that We conformed with what has been about the norm in such behavior, which is to reduce the nonborrowed path by roughly half of the overrun on total reserves   I think so   The pressure could have been increased a little further, with of course an impact on interest rates   I'm not confident that I need the added leeway--   If the Committee votes for this, we will have a path that's based on these aggregates, and the nonborrowed path [will be constructed] using that borrowing assumption If the aggregates come out at ""B"" or a little above, then presumably the demand for reserves is going to be a little higher than we're targeting and we will just stick with the nonborrowed path, so the implied borrowing level would come out somewhat higher than this   We have not typically done that unless we're considerably above [the path] When it was running $300 or $400 or $500 million above last month, yes, we did make adjustments then But at $100 million above, we wouldn't be inclined to make such an adjustment "
1620,1980-11-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   I was apprehensive a month ago about the kind of flow of information we might have as we came up to the November 13 date I was gratified that we did not seem to be getting as much confusion and uncertainty [as I expected], at least, as that week began Things seemed to be settling down in a reasonable pattern Now, I have to allow that I was thrown off by the demands for reserves that we experienced yesterday I just don't have an explanation of that I am not sure whether it had more to do with the changes coming out of the Monetary Control Act or whether it was just some unsettlement in the immediate wake of the new discount rate and penalty rates Until I can see more on the behavior in terms of desired holdings of excess reserves and so on, I just don't have a good answer But at least up until now, we have not felt a need for a significant departure from what had been our mode of operation   Not much changed but somewhat higher, yes   It pretty well held those opening gains after the money supply numbers   Funds trading opened at about 17 percent and went up to 17-1/2 percent--this was shortly after 11 am--and we went in and have offered some overnight repurchase agreements   I know that after we went in to do the RPs, the market strengthened very slightly further, but not enough to be noticeable   What I might say about the 17 or 17-1/2 percent that we are getting today is that I don't see our approach as accepting it We are putting in reserves I regard that very high rate of yesterday and today as something of an aberration I would think, given what we're aiming for, that it ought to be getting down more than--   Yes, but there are enough uncertainties in that reserve path that we feel this is one of those occasions that we just have to use a little discretion around that   I would expect it to be more like 15 percent, given the borrowing level of $16 billion that we've been aiming at this week "
1641,1980-11-26," I have nothing very interesting In some very light trading, [the funds rate was] somewhere around 18 percent and [unintelligible] "
1660,1980-12-05," As for the market reaction today, we started out with a quite firm money market, Mr Chairman Funds opened briefly at 19-3/4 percent, went up to 20 percent, and even touched 21 percent briefly this morning They slipped back to about 20 and then were 20-1/4 percent around 11 am At that point we went in because, having drawn up these reserve paths as Steve described, we had a need for reserves in this week We put in some repurchase agreement funds over the weekend We had some difference between the Board staff's estimate and the New York staff's estimate, with New York seeing a larger need The amount [of repurchase agreements] that we did fully met--in fact slightly more than met--the New York staff's estimate, and we did that amount because funds were trading at 20-1/4 percent then I thought we were just experiencing a burst and a kind of psychological lifting of the funds rate Following those repurchase agreements, the funds rate inched down to 20 and then to 19-3/4 percent And then around 130 pm or so, the rate dropped off rather sharply, and to me rather surprisingly, to 18 percent It looked as though the big buyers had their demands satisfied and they were seeing    12/05/80  some supply from agencies, banks, and regional banks around the country  I don't know if you want me to go into this, but I had given an estimate at the time of our usual morning conference call that, given this level of borrowing of around $1-3/4 billion, I would have expected the funds rate to back [down] from the 20 percent plus level to perhaps 19 to 20 percent That would still be my feeling I remain somewhat puzzled as to the latest drift off to the 18 percent area As for the market reaction elsewhere to the discount rate [increase], there was an initial very modest decline in the Treasury market, with [a move in] the long end of the market of around 1/2 point and most of that has been recovered now So there's about no change on the day in the longer end of the market The shorter coupon had been off as much as 3/4 point, but has recovered some so those [issues] are only off about 1/2 point The greatest remaining change is in the bill area, particularly the short-term bills; the 3-month bill is up almost a full percentage point to about 1580 percent Finally, CDs seem to be up about 1/2 percentage point; the 3-month CD is around 1840 percent and up And the prime rate, I should mention, is pretty generally becoming 19 percent now, [led] off by Citibank   [Unintelligible]   Could I [chime] in on something? I think Steve is referring to the current statement week Governor Teeters, if you are asking about the following statement week, I believe we would have to provide reserves then "
1679,1980-12-12," Well, the markets have had a pretty turbulent period The money market rates have been shooting up very sharply in the last several days Some of the rates are steady today because they have been pushing up, especially for [unintelligible] and commercial paper But they are steady, of course, at a very high level In some other sectors, [such as] the Treasury bill market and the Treasury coupon market, there has been some recovery in prices-- declining rates--today, making up a modest part of the erosion of recent days The federal funds rate averaged 1880 percent in the last statement week Funds were trading at about 20 percent yesterday; the rate is around 19-1/2 percent today It is very, very hard to say where things might settle down with this range of borrowing that Steve mentioned of $16 to $17 billion I would expect the funds rate could stay in that 19 to 20 percent range for a little while, although perhaps after things settle down more that degree of borrowing might be consistent with a funds rate a shade lower than I mentioned    12/12/80 "
1702,1980-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   If I could add one point on that The rally of the last couple of days is based on a rumor about the money supply and also on reports from the incoming Reagan Administration to the effect of some [likelihood] of a national emergency program, which the markets seem to be interpreting, for whatever reason, rather bullishly for the bond markets   I think it could well be [the case] in time Right now I would tend to associate $1-1/2 billion of borrowing with something more like the 20 percent upper end of this funds range   Just because that has been the recent behavior of banks There seems to have been a considerable--whether it's regional differences--   It could well be And I share Steve's view that in time we ought to associate $1-1/2 billion of borrowing with something a little lower in the funds rate, 17 or 18 percent maybe But I'm not sure how long this psychologically higher funds rate may last I'm not sure we are about to depart from it quite yet "
1730,1981-02-02," They're reinforcing   But that might give you more of an impact than you want Both of those could work in the direction of more rate volatility, and that is something to be weighed along with that   If I could add a little to that I don't think I could provide any evidence about what happened to the volume of investment, but there were truly adaptations in the market because of the fluctuations in rates in terms of more variable-rate contracts or floating-rate contracts Also, there was some tendency by corporations, municipalities, and so on to have shorter-term borrowings   Very much so How much of that was because of the greater rate volatility or how much was a trend in those futures markets because they were just recently developing would be very hard to untangle   We had a rule of thumb, as Steve has mentioned--I don't know how religiously we followed it--that we would move the nonborrowed path by about half of the undershoot or overshoot But that was conditioned at times by other factors When the Committee indicated in the adoption of its objectives that, say, the objective was 4 percent but it wouldn't mind if that were a little faster or a little slower because of where we were coming out vis-a- vis the annual targets at that point, that was the conditioning factor in whether we pressed for more or less adjustment   Well, I'd have to work that out with my colleague, Mr Axilrod In my own view, there is room for more of that kind of adjustment Certainly one can look at some periods last year, like the August-September period, and say that we surely should have moved the path more I think one can come to a different conclusion about last spring when the adjustments were on the other side Some regular upward adjustments of the nonborrowed path might have helped us restore [monetary] growth more rapidly, but that could have sent us into even stronger growth by the third quarter and perhaps would have been unwise in retrospect So, it's not clear that on all occasions more rapid adjustment would have been the answer   I think we had an awareness [of that effect] but I don't think that necessarily stopped us from adjusting--   It was about 19-1/2 percent   [Statement--see Appendix]   It's about $1,350 million so far this week   But this week so far it's $135 billion   Well, our guessing hasn't been very good on this, but if I made a guess--   --I'd think it would drift off somewhat with $13 billion in borrowing "
1753,1981-02-24," Yes, I'd like to--   My call to Steve, Mr Chairman, was about the fact that the funds market situation has changed since our morning call today But Steve might want to give more background on this The general situation is that we are looking at a need--to meet our path objective--for substantially more reserves in this statement week We've been going through the week finding the funds rate below the 15 percent lower bound, and on Friday and again yesterday we took action to drain reserves, which did not really cause the funds market to firm up very much at all This morning we were looking at a very large need to add more reserves Funds had inched up to 15-1/8 percent We were prepared to provide some modest amount of reserves, meeting a part of the need by passing through some of our customer repurchase agreements But between the time our call concluded and we were set to go into the market to do that, the money market eased again Funds were back at 15 percent and I thought I would defer that modest action to add some reserves to the market So, that was what I wanted to convey to Steve at that point We're sitting now with funds at 15 percent and apparently a large need to add reserves this week of something like $16 billion to $18 billion on a weekly average basis The banks have large cumulative reserve deficiencies and they just are not acting on that basis at this point   No I think Steve covered it As he said, the short rates have come down because we've been aiming for the nonborrowed [reserve path] such that borrowing was on a declining track So funds have come down from the 17 percent area to a shade under 15 percent; in fact the funds rate average is 14-7/8 percent so far this week It is interesting that as you go out longer in the maturity spectrum rates have actually moved up since the time of the meeting a couple of weeks ago with continuing concern in the market about longer-term prospects in the economy, budget policy, and so on So it's very much a swinging around of the yield curve with those short rates coming down and the long rates going up modestly   We didn't hear the question in New York   Well, they tended to come down; of course, they had been running very high in December and January These recent levels have been a bit more in the $200 to $400 million area How this week is going to work out, I don't know, because right now the banks seem to have a big cumulative reserve deficiency that they are in no mood to cover   Peter Sternlight, here; he was called away   I think so, although given that he's not here to cast a formal vote, he might just as soon not have it be formal "
1776,1981-03-31," [Statement--see Appendix]   That is correct, yes   That's my understanding of what was done   About $900 million This week they are running higher, and the average may move up some this week My recollection of that would be that there was flexibility, [based on] the Committee's decision, to have made some further adjustment if it had proved necessary to keep--   -- the funds rate from tending to slide off below 15 percent; but as it was shading up, it didn't [prove necessary]   We were looking at about $900 million last Friday as the average borrowing in the second 4-week period   Maybe I didn't report on it clearly enough I don't see a simpler way of accomplishing the Committee's objectives   Well, one week it was 13-1/2 percent on average Another week it was just a hair below [15 percent]   Just before that February 24 telephone discussion, President Roos, when the funds rate was flirting with the lower bound--it was tending to drop down to 15 percent or lower--there was one day when our projection suggested that maybe we should be draining a little, but because the funds rate was dropping below 15 percent we drained a fairly sizable amount, more than we would have done just on the reserve numbers alone I think that was a Friday; the following Monday, when the projection showed no need to drain, funds ran below 15 percent and we did drain that day I'd say there were those two occasions when we were guided by the funds rate   Well, reserves had been growing slowly but, also, the Committee had not held its telephone consultation After that, as the Chairman said, the funds rate did not constrain us and it dropped down a bit   You're talking about the second four weeks?   We didn't readjust it back because we had never really adjusted that second four-week part of it   I think it might have been to a lesser degree I can't say for sure exactly where it would have been   About $160 million [more] of borrowing   I don't have anything to add to the short memo that went around on that We believe that the lending operation to avert delivery failures remains a useful item in the good functioning of the government securities market and, in that sense, is reasonably necessary to its smooth operation and, thus, an aid to the conduct of open market operations And it's a modest money maker for us It much more than covers its cost of operation   Oh, 6 or 8 years   That's right, yes   Well, I was not referring to the System's open market operations but to the volume of traffic through the System's clearing mechanism   Yes   No, but in a--   This week it's coming in a little higher It's averaging about $1-1/2 billion because one large bank borrowed substantially this past Friday and that is tending to raise this week's level The implicit level that we're shooting for in this week  -46-    3/31/81  is about [$1150] billion, but it seems to be running higher than that   It's 16-1/2   This week it's averaging 1507 percent so far   Last four weeks?   Mr Chairman, you referred to giving some weight to M2 judgmentally In the recent period, there was an opportunity to do that because the M1s were running weak and we could modify the extent to which we would change the path because of that But that [situation] wouldn't necessarily arise in the future You might not have the opportunity to give weight to a strong M2 if, for example, the M1s were running right about on path Even if M2 were running very strong, I wouldn't see that same kind of opportunity to give discretionary weight to that   But we might be right about on path  -54-    3/31/81   If M-1B were on target, we might be just about on path If that were the case--   There's a range of uncertainty on these "
1799,1981-04-28," Well, as you said, Mr Chairman, the banking system has been slow in catching up with the increased degree of pressures that should be falling on it as the aggregates strengthened and as their demand for reserves grew Much of that, as Steve noted, is that they just didn't cover their reserve needs last week But yesterday and today it is catching up more forcibly so that the funds rate, which had been averaging pretty close to 15-1/2 percent for a few weeks, was around 16 percent yesterday Today it started out around 16 percent but it got up to the 17-1/2 percent area We're looking at a very large reserve need in this week just to meet path And even if we met path, there would still be a need; but because available collateral has been in short supply we haven't been able to put in very many of the reserves that we had planned to supply today We said [when we presented] our program this morning that we would be putting in something like $4 billion in two-day RPs and we've only been shown about $1-1/2 billion; we may do a couple of hundred million or more than that later So, we're building up to what looks like a very large reserve need and borrowing need over today and tomorrow Probably most of it will fall on tomorrow That's all I have, Mr Chairman "
1819,1981-05-06," Mr Chairman, as the Committee members know, the markets reacted to the discount rate move with fairly sharp rate increases Rates had already been moving up in the wake of the very tight conclusion to the previous reserve week, the week ending the 29th, and then when the money supply number was published Friday, there was a further upward rate move And after the discount rate action on Monday there were still further increases, leaving the market in a very demoralized state, I'd say, early yesterday morning From that point, things seemed to gel better; sentiment turned around to some extent But there has been a lot of worry about whether the Treasury would get any kind of decent bidding for its three-year auction It turned out to be very substantial bidding at the rates that developed as that auction went on The [auction average] rate was a record high, 158 percent But earlier that day the market was talking about 16 percent or higher Today the atmosphere continues to improve The 10-year auction has been held, with offering rates of around 1455 or 1460 percent, again fairly good And market rates have come down from the peaks they hit yesterday morning The 3-month rate, which had touched 17 percent, is down to about the 15-1/2 percent area; the CD rate had touched 19 percent for the 3-month issue and now it's around 18-1/2 percent As Steve mentioned, we had a high funds rate at the beginning of this week, which I think was probably more a function of an extremely tight ending of the April 29th week than of our own effort to control reserve restraint on the system The funds rate had been averaging 20 percent on Thursday and Friday and then it worked its way down, partly with the help of substantial borrowing over the weekend The funds rate today started out around 17-1/2 percent and it's around the 17 or 16-1/2 percent area this afternoon That's all I have "
1841,1981-05-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   I think a better understanding of our procedures has been developing There was some renewed confusion or uncertainty when the February policy record was published in early April because there seemingly was a different significance to the meaning of the federal funds rate constraint But with the record laid down there and some further comments that were made by the Chairman around that time there has been a better understanding of the significance of the funds rate limits as well, mainly as checkpoints rather than tight constraints   Well, I have no comment on that!   Well, as I said, I think there is a better sense of what we are about that is permeating the markets It's a message that [could use] further repetition or elaboration as opportunities [arise] in testimony or speeches or interviews to convey just how the procedures work and our approach to the funds rate as a set of checkpoints I've heard the question from market people If it only has the significance of a checkpoint, why do you have it in your directives at all? I think that's certainly a legitimate point for the Committee to want to discuss   I think the directive does, in effect, say that [it's a checkpoint] now   It seems to me that the change in language-- I think it was at the December meeting--[clarified it] Up to then I think the wording called for it more as a real constraint, whereas I read the current wording as more of a checkpoint That's because we are instructed to maintain reserves along a certain path consistent with the growth path for the aggregates that the Committee voted for and, if it appears that over a period of time the funds rate is not going to be consistent with maintaining reserves on that growth path, then the Manager is to notify the Chairman, and so on   Well, I think we did respond promptly We didn't get the rate effect until well along in April Knowing how the whole month turned out, if we could have been omniscient at the beginning of the month, I suppose we could have been even more vigorous early in the month I'm inclined to be skeptical as to whether it would have made a great difference on how the April growth rate itself would have turned out   We didn't during that first four-week period, Governor Teeters; we did in the final three weeks As I interpreted it--and Steve may want to comment--I thought perhaps there was not a need to do that in those first four weeks because there was lighter-than-expected borrowing in the very early part of April And because of that we were going to be imposing on the banking system a demand for even greater borrowing as we got further into April, which in itself looked as though it was going to be exerting significantly increased reserve pressure without the need to make these discretionary, if you will, downward adjustments in the nonborrowed reserve path We were looking for borrowing to have to rise up to the $16 or $17 billion area, well above that initial $1150 million level, as we got further along into April  -20-    5/18/81   Well, those were just technical adjustments due to the multipliers   I think it would have taken [steps] that would have had to be done in March   Yes That would be my view   Well, I said I'm not aware of disastrous losses There were certainly losses taken, mainly in early April because they had some big [positions] at the end of March But our impression is that losses were taken by big, well capitalized dealers They were unhappy, clearly, but they were not put into a state where they couldn't function There were some smaller [problem] situations, not among the major primary dealers but, as I said, among fringe operators I can really think of just one smaller dealer operation that was put out of business   Well, no The dealers did have some losses in March In general, it's true that to some extent they were helped out by hedging in the futures market Obviously, there were other participants on the other side of the futures market who have lost, but it just seems to be well diversified We have not heard of terrible calamitous problems there   Well, in the current three-week subperiod, we went beyond that kind of adjustment and moved the nonborrowed path more in relation to the overshoot Initially we appeared to be running about $550 million above on total reserves, and the initial downward adjustment in the nonborrowed path was $250 million Then a week later, it looked as if we were running over by $375 or $400 million and a further downward adjustment was made in the nonborrowed path because of that There was also another adjustment; in the May 6th week we had deliberately accepted some shortfall in nonborrowed reserves because borrowing had been running higher than expected It was kind of the aftermath of that super tight week at the end of April So, another $100 million or so downward adjustment was made in the nonborrowed path for that reason In total, the downward adjustment in the nonborrowed reserve path relative to the total reserve path was $485 million, which in this case was somewhat more than the amount by which total reserves were running above their path   The borrowing that we are aiming for--the borrowing consistent with this week's nonborrowed [path]--would be about $1860 million Borrowing for the 3-week subperiod would be about $2 billion But if you want to take where borrowings actually have been this week thus far, it's $17 billion "
1855,1981-06-17," Well, Ed has summarized what has happened to a number of the market rates That has developed essentially as the market has taken heart from observing the weakness in the narrow money supply The market is in somewhat of a suspended state of animation, though They've observed the funds rate hanging at what they regard as a high level--in the 18-1/2 to 19-1/2 percent range--and they're somewhat puzzled about that And that tends to temper what might even be a stronger positive reaction to the weakness in money supply and to some of the numbers in the economy that suggest softening as well We are winding up this week, because the banks tended to borrow rather lightly early in the week, with some tightness Funds were trading around 20 percent today after averaging around 18-1/2 percent earlier in the week I would think that there might be a considerable bulge in borrowing shaping up for today   Mr Chairman, this is Sternlight May I just get in a clarification of what Ed Ettin laid out as the borrowing prospect for the next three weeks? We were talking about it earlier and when he said $17 or $18 billion for borrowing, that was before the downward adjustment for the weakness we've been getting in M-1B   That $180 million applies just to the first four weeks; I don't think that it carries through "
1918,1981-08-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think it depends on what that amount of borrowing is, President Morris If borrowing were up toward that $2 billion level, as it was at the beginning of July, then I would think that 18 percent is very much a solid floor that would be hard to penetrate As borrowing gets down more toward $1 or $1-1/4 billion, somewhere around that area, there's enough borrowing done by banks that don't encounter the surcharge that there could be penetration [below] the surcharge rate   If I could comment just a little further on that I think Governor Teeters put her finger on a very important part of the reason By that late June/early July period the short market and the long market, too, to some degree, had gotten ahead of themselves, anticipating declines in the funds rate that didn't come about To an important degree it was the disappointment in not seeing that develop that permitted this apparent anomaly of the funds rate giving some grudging ground but short rates moving up because the market had expected more of a decline in the funds rate   Most of the widening had already occurred by six weeks ago, but there was some further widening, maybe another 1/4 percentage point or so   We just had a long FNMA issue that sold about 140 to 150 basis points above the [comparable] Treasury issue I think six weeks earlier their premium might have been more in the area of a little over 100 basis points A more normal [spread], going back six or nine months ago, might have been more in the area of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point   Yes   Well, it is borrowing that's not really subject to the pressure on discount window usage that is associated with adjustment borrowing And it's a source of reserves to the banking system just as though it came out of float or from an addition to Fed holdings of securities   Yes   That is right, yes   Well, I think there's an attitude among banks that there's something rather shameful about having to pay the surcharge It's like being caught with your hands in the cookie jar or something So, it's true that there hasn't been very much There was one week or two when there was a fair amount of such surcharge borrowing But banks making an effort to avoid that is what tends to keep the funds rate around the surcharge level And when they are trying hard to avoid it, as banks seem to have been doing yesterday, for example, they're willing to pay 19 and 20 percent just to stay away   Yes, it is   Out of a total portfolio of about $130 billion, $49 billion is in Treasury bills, most of them short-term bills Another sizable amount--I don't have the number at hand--would be short-term coupon issues due within a year But I would think we'd look mostly to the bill area if there were a need, for example, to allow for a substantial amount of extended credit borrowing by thrifts   That sounds about right    8/18/81 "
1943,1981-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   By the end of the day 1/2 to 3/4 of a point It had been up more than that earlier, but [the gain] got trimmed back   I think attitudes are still mostly cautious They're not really seeing extensive investor buying [though] there has been some Until they see more of that, it has more of the characteristics of a technical rebound with short covering and not a lifting of spirits   Well, there's a whole scale of valuations when we value securities for repurchase agreements And it's a sliding scale; it depends on the maturity of the issues For example, with Treasury bills over one month [in maturity] we went from 10 to 25    10/5-6/81  basis points That is where we would value the securities against the current quoted market In very rough terms it was about a doubling of the margins   A lot of lenders have been raising their margins, and I'd say our margins are in line with those of the more conservative lenders I wouldn't say everybody is up there Some lenders still rely primarily on whom they're lending to rather than looking to the margin itself for protection   Right Well, I don't know Steve might have a comment on it I have given up trying to explain short-term variations in the money supply   A lot of market people expect it because it's one of those weeks in which we have the Social Security payments on Friday in the first week of the month Often in the past that has been accompanied by large increases   You're talking about the financing need in the fourth quarter?   I think the Treasury looks for something in the mid-$30 billion area; $35 billion or so is what the market expects   The path for M2 was something like 14 percent   Right We are absorbing the excess  -50-    10/5-6/81   14 percent   Yes, because we had high funds rates   The borrowing was higher than the $900 million or so "
1968,1981-11-17," Statement--see Appendix   The decline in borrowings over the past six months was a consequence of the lower-than-path money growth Money grew less than was targeted, [but the target] was the basis for setting path patterns for total and nonborrowed reserves In particular we pretty much stuck with our path for nonborrowed reserves as money grew more slowly and the banking system needed less reserves Because of that slower money growth borrowing came down, and that has been reflected in a considerable decline in rates   Well, there have been adjustments of that kind There have been adjustments in the other direction when money growth ran way ahead of desires There was a small adjustment of the nature that you've described within this last period; the nonborrowed path was raised because we were falling below in money growth as the period unfolded   $55 or $56 million or something like that   If I could add one other point that seems relevant to me As you know, there has been a considerable decline in rates as money growth has weakened relative to the longer-run paths I think we've gotten away with that in the market in the sense that the basic credibility of the Fed's longer-term restraint policy has not been seriously questioned A minority of voices--maybe one or two--has been heard here and there on the fringes raising a question, but by and large the Fed's credibility has not been questioned I think a very vigorous response to achieve an M1-B target when it was falling considerably short would have very much endangered that [credibility] to the point where it would have been questioned in this period   It's judgment, Governor--I can't prove it-- just from the way that our responses are watched so diligently by an army of Fed watchers in the markets They are watching to see what our response will be and there are suggestions from various quarters that money is falling short and we ought to be doing this or that to repair that situation I had the impression that we were getting close to the point where credibility could be questioned each time we made some overt move, whether it was on the discount rate or putting in reserves at some particular funds rate level or something We've always run little risks of that kind We came through it without really setting off any significant reaction but I don't think we were that far from that on various occasions as we came through this declining rate period   Right   Even more for a couple of weeks in April It was between 100 and 200 basis points a week for a few weeks   I think so, sure   Well, carefully   The range is 12 to 17 percent   The reserve path is relevant to just the 5 weeks It's not quite the average for the month of December; it's the 5 weeks ending December 22 or whenever it is   7 percent in November and December?   We were expecting at that point a pretty hefty growth in August, like 11 percent "
1997,1981-12-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   Mr Chairman, if I may, I also have a recommendation to make namely, that the leeway for changes in holdings in the System Account, which the Committee voted to enlarge to the $4 billion level, be left at that $4 billion level up to the time of the next meeting Our projections make it look as though we might need to absorb something like $3 billion of reserves during January, essentially reversing much of that seasonal need that we met in the last several weeks That concludes my remarks, Mr Chairman   Yes, and we may have done another $150 million today because we took some notes from one foreign account    12/21-22/81   Well, the leeway needed to last only through today or tomorrow, so we were willing to run it right up to the line After this meeting a new leeway is established We may have a little more to add on an outright basis but as soon as we get into January we'll have to swing around the other way It is to provide the leeway for a possibly large move in the other direction, a large absorption of reserves, that I think it might be useful to leave that limit at the $4 billion level   It would run, I believe, from the day after this meeting--that would be Wednesday--through February 2   Yes   I think there's some puzzlement about the strength that market analysts have seen I don't have any sense that they are associating it with the economy being stronger Some of them see other special reasons; some have the same sort of temporary parking place idea that we've kicked around here   A precautionary [move to] higher savings rates There are varying estimates about the strength of the economy, but I haven't really gotten much sense of people relating the aggregates to that   A lot of people in the market expect that also Steve might want to comment on the particular Bluebook reference   The New York staff has a little more of a drop   I wouldn't disagree with that I would tend to think of something like $250 million of borrowing as perhaps likely to keep the funds rate just around the discount rate, $350 million maybe 1/4 percentage point over it, and $450 million a little more-- maybe 1/2 point--over it   The discount rate becomes a kind of anchor around which the funds rate clusters once there's enough borrowing to make that discount rate meaningful If there's so little borrowing that a great majority of banks hardly ever [come to] the discount window, then the discount rate isn't too meaningful and we fall into this zone of indeterminacy I don't know whether it's $200 or $250 million or what, but once there's something like that level of borrowing then there will be enough borrowing so that the discount  -54-    12/21-22/81  window is a meaningful alternative that a number of banks want to avoid; they will be willing to pay the rate in the funds market rather than come to the window And the more of that borrowing gap there is, the more demand for funds there will be by banks that want to stay away from the window; so, they'd be willing to pay up a little higher in order to stay away [from the window] "
2024,1982-02-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, if the Committee had set the kind of money growth rates that actually transpired over the past month, it would have accommodated what has happened without getting the rise in borrowing and the rise in the funds rate that has occurred   I don't remember It was a relatively large amount; whether that was a record amount of those technical adjustments I'm just not sure   Yes, we had to adjust upward, then, for the [OCD] growth   Well, as I said, some of the move up was a more or less automatic fallout of a strengthening in demand for reserves We did, well along into the period, make a discretionary downward adjustment in the nonborrowed path of $190 million, I think it was, which added to that borrowing gap There is continual consideration given to the size of those adjustments And the factors bearing on it on this occasion had to do partly with trying to reach judgments about how lasting this bulge would be If there had been a sense that this bulge was likely to be more lasting, and particularly if there had been a sense that it was occurring against a background of a strengthening economy instead of a still weakening economy, my view is that there probably would have been more of a discretionary downward adjustment made to build up that borrowing gap even further   Given the events of the last week or so, it wouldn't come as a total surprise, but I don't think there's a preponderant expectation of a move either I think there would be some reaction to either of those, probably less so if a move were confined just to the surcharge It hasn't been fully discounted; some people would say that they don't expect such a move because they still don't see the turnaround in the economy that they think would be part of the background of such a move   $15 billion is what we have been aiming for; the actual came in at $23 billion   This week borrowing is [averaging] $17 billion so far   I would have said about 14-1/2 percent   It touched 16 percent yesterday The effective rate yesterday was 1568 percent or something like that "
2050,1982-03-29," That's right I think the judgment could be made [that it's necessary] on a continuing basis I don't know that there is anything in the legal basis on which it was set up that required an annual determination of that kind and, therefore, I have suggested in my memorandum to the Committee, which Mr Bradfield supported, that it could be incorporated in the continuing authorization for operations   That's right, yes    3/29-30/82   It's also the question of whether it is looked at separately by the Committee or considered as part of this entire authorization for domestic operations   [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't know if it's so much a particular level They might feel relaxed about 8 to 10 percent, but it's more whether they get some sense of how we're reacting to it that would make them feel easy or uneasy about it I think even 8 to 10 percent could bother them if they felt it was causing us to keep reserve supplies more restricted   I wouldn't be surprised if it were around this 8 to 10 percent range, but I haven't really heard enough to give a good accurate answer   Yes, there is; it has been in the process of taking place these last couple of weeks or maybe even earlier But it's partly this concern that there will be a big bulge that is leading some participants to have an expectation now of higher rates in the next few weeks   Well, I think they were impressed by the evidence of how the January situation was handled They say that there was a bulge but that to some degree it was accommodated They feel it was reacted to in the sense that rates did rise, but they feel, too, that it wasn't such a strong reaction--that we were [not] just determined that virtually at all cost we had to push money growth back to path And some of the comments that the Chairman made at the congressional hearing, I think, supported that interpretation I think they would expect a similar scenario if there were a bulge in April They would be looking to see whether we would accommodate the bulge to some degree in the expectation of having it unwind pretty soon afterward   I think it's about 30 percent, isn't it, Steve?   Oh, 40! I thought I saw 30 percent   I don't think the market knows it for that reason I think they believe it just [on the basis of] a more simplistic assumption along the lines of Well, it had gone up in 5 or 6 of the last 7 years, so there's likely to be a big rise this year too   I think that's right   Well, I'm sort of a victim of the experts who give us those views, too But, in fact, the fiscal expert at our Bank just went through an analysis of this and, even though the deficit is running close to or slightly behind the previous year's deficit, he's still looking for a deficit of somewhat over $100 billion for this year  SPEAKER(?) Over $100 billion?   For this fiscal year it's about $108 billion, I think More of the tax reduction impact comes along late in the fiscal year--certainly in the after-July portion of it And the defense build-up is a slow train to get moving, but once that spending gets on its way--   I'm not sure of that    3/29-30/82   Well, I did just get his estimates of the quarterly financing needs of the Treasury, which include not only the unified budget deficit but the off-budget estimates That was going to be something like $13 billion in the April-June quarter and about $40 billion in the July-September quarter   I have had the same hope, but--   That would be my expectation If we tried to hold very rigidly to a path in weekly periods, let's say, we would get even more rate fluctuation I find it very hard to answer President Winn's question about whether our actions contribute to greater or lesser variability in money growth I think it probably depends some on the time periods chosen My feeling about it is that looking at periods of a couple of quarters at a time, let's say, what we're doing works in the direction of achieving the desired growth rates Now, there could be things in our response mechanism itself that lead to some fluctuations of one or two months in character, just because we see a bulge and respond to it and that depresses growth a month or two later There could be that kind of cycling, but that might be a minor variation around the more underlying trend we're trying to achieve   In June or July maybe  -13-    3/29-30/82  SPEAKER(?) June   June The expectation a month or two ago had been that we might hit it in May But they were doing a little better for a while, so I guess it has been pushed back to June   Borrowing of $14 billion is implicit in this week's objective   The last several weeks would average more like $1-1/4 billion   It's averaging $12 billion so far this week   But $14 billion is--   Over the last several weeks borrowings averaged about $1-1/4 billion; in the preceding several weeks it was more like $1-1/2 billion   Funds today are at about 15-1/4 to 15-3/8 percent I think the rate is being affected by these pre end-of- quarter statement date pressures   I believe the last several weeks averaged about $126 billion or something like that "
2076,1982-05-18," It was down, but not snowballing It seemed to be steady at that opening mark of down 1/4 to 1/2 or 5/8 of a point It was not snowballing   Well, I'm sure that a lot of firms are talking about it I'm sure this is getting around We were not hearing about it at our Desk, though I don't know that it was getting out to the extent that it would be on the news ticker   I'm sure that any reserve impact of whatever the Committee decided it was necessary to do in the way of cushioning a decline could be quickly offset   A small part is in bills and a long position of around $2-1/2 billion is in notes and bonds We don't have a detailed maturity breakdown at this point   I thought we ought to get more evidence of a really moving situation   It all seems anticlimactic, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] And, of course, in the wake of this other securities firm that is in great difficulty today, there's an additional great note of caution about financing arrangements even for the highest quality of credits   When I mentioned that I was talking about the Drysdale situation that the Chairman spoke of [earlier]   No, that was the one I was alluding to That concludes my statement   Oh, yes I would think that was very likely a record It had been quite high in February, and we had something of a problem of the Treasury's Fed balance having to go up to about $7 or $8 billion then when the Treasury's [overall] balance had gotten up into the mid-$20 billion area But when it got up to nearly $30 billion overall, the balance at the Fed went up to a little over $12 billion for a few days   Yes   That could be I don't know   Well, in the last report I had received on those currency shipments to Argentina, they totalled about million from the beginning of April up to then, which was about a week ago now So, it's not a very big deal [in relation to M1] The estimate that I saw was [an addition of] about percent to M1 growth in April Of course, for those who look at currency growth or who follow the monetary base closely, there would be more of a difference in those measures   I don't know   The level implicit in the path is a little over [$1 billion]--about $1044 or $1045 million But, as Steve said, borrowing has been running around $750 to $800 million so far this week   I don't know The way borrowing has been running I wouldn't be surprised if it stays around that $800 million level today because tomorrow we may be looking at something that's averaging $800 million Now, how we shape operations tomorrow might depend on the decision reached here today If the borrowing assumption were to come out around that $800 million level, let's say, I'm not sure there's a great point in obliging that final day of the week bulge in borrowing that would bring borrowing up to the $1040 million average "
2123,1982-07-15," I'll only add, Mr Chairman, that the fed funds rate has come down some in the past week, averaging about 13-1/8 percent rather than the 14 percent plus levels of the previous week And it's also in that 13 to 13-1/8 percent area today "
2143,1982-08-24," [Statement--see Appendix]   I did [refer to it] as a plus factor, although I said that when it finally came it was somewhat overshadowed by other events   Well, it has been undergoing some day-to-day changes Through the end of the week, just taking Thursday and Friday, it was running on the low side and averaging about $175 million Yesterday there was a considerable increase because of one large bank borrowing a sizable amount, and that brought the weekly average to $350 million And it's fairly possible that that bank will be in again today; we don't know if they are or for how much I was just gauging that if they were in for a similar amount today and then not in on Wednesday, and the other banks stayed in to the extent they had been in the early part of the week, we could wind up with borrowing averaging around $400 to $420 million or something on that order for this week   That had been the pattern for a number of weeks, although there could be a change this week because of an effort by some banks particularly to avoid a Wednesday borrowing If they sensed a need to be in, they tried to get in before Wednesday   I wouldn't say all, Governor Rice Some of it has been the seasonal borrowing, of course, and that is partly rate sensitive But even with the seasonal borrowers there is apparently some desire to stay within the line and not disrupt that even though 10-1/2 percent is above the funds rate of 9 percent There was a conference call of the discount officers yesterday and it looked as though in some areas some of the borrowings were being done by banks that, while not in the severe problem category, did apparently have some limitations on their access to the funds market And that seemed to be a factor in their turning to the discount window rather than to the funds market   Well, I think there has been some surprise, just as we have been surprised, at funds trading below the discount rate Also in the market thinking, I believe they have factored in an expectation of a further discount rate cut of 1/2 point anyway in the near term And with that factored in, they tend to think of funds probably settling in around the 9 or 9-1/2 percent area   Assuming a further discount rate cut, frankly   Yes   If it were there for a day or two, that would be the tendency I think if it were there in some size for even as long as a week, that would probably call for some revamping of how we looked at that level of borrowing   If it were significantly higher, I think we'd have to make allowance for it If it's for just a couple of days in this week, I think it will--   I don't know There is nothing published about our reserve paths that would call for necessarily classifying it as emergency borrowings   Oh, yes   It's seen as adjustment borrowing in the public figures; but I think we could still regard it more like nonborrowed reserves if that looked appropriate to us   Yes Well, that was a smaller scale situation where the adjustment borrowing had built up and then after a merger situation that borrowing was considered extended credit and was formally moved out into the nonborrowed category "
2181,1982-10-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, they will be looking at different things I think there will be some effort to see whether there's a way to restructure the basic repurchase agreements to do pretty much the same thing but in a more acceptable manner in that it would stand up better than [now] To some extent there may just be a lessened willingness by a number of ""lenders"" in the market who provide funds, particularly to smaller, less well-capitalized firms When the issue is settled--and I get a little sense of this already and that could spread with [unintelligible]--I don't think it would affect the Desk's technical ability to [make] repurchase agreements But it could thin out the market in which we do those agreements or we could have somewhat less [access] to instruments or operations [of this kind]   Oh, yes   Well, they've been cooperative right along in doing that and are particularly keen to cooperate now They prefer the--   In an [unintelligible] way, yes We are exploring whether we would want to extend it beyond that Certainly if we hear of any problem situations that go beyond the regular reporting dealer group, we would want to take a look quickly at those situations   Thus far, yes   That is my impression   [Unintelligible] from the market who have written commentaries and from discussions with market participants   I would agree with that   $500 million is what we've been using in the path; it is actually $560 million   $300 million   But on occasion we'll get another borrower, either them or somebody else, and that will raise the question of whether borrowing is going to [include or exclude that bank]   Operationally, I don't see it as having a function during the period When it is published and people look at it, seeing that there was a range would give them more of a sense of continuity with past procedures If the Committee values that, I think there's an argument for keeping it in Frankly, to leave it out I think gives more weight to the view that a change is being made "
2207,1982-11-16," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, there are a lot of parts to your question, President Black Just as a technical matter, I think in using and revising the reserve path there are some [specific] procedures called for We had to do some of this adjustment for different factors even when we were targeting M1 But there are further adjustments of this kind to allow, as you say, for the fact that many components of M2 don't generate reserve requirements Steve may want to comment on this, but what we have done as we've gone along is to revise the path as though there were reserve requirements against M2 in general, in a sense making up for the fact that some important components of it didn't have reserve requirements When you ask if it is effective to control M2 via this means, I would have to say I have some real doubts as to how good our control mechanism is on M2 But I think that would be true almost whatever rules we live by at the Desk I do think what we're following, though, is an effective response mechanism to growth in M2 that is either on track or below or above track It is something whereby the performance of M2 can generate a greater or lesser provision of reserves that then impacts on the money market, on the economy, and so on, and eventually on M2 I think that this is a sensible procedure   Well, we would look at the whole range; we typically do when we buy bonds   Yes It could be roughly $800 million to $1 billion That would be a rather normal bite, I think   We have a reserve need running over the next few weeks We already bought a large amount of bills at the beginning of this statement week and it would be a very normal pattern to follow up with a coupon purchase in the market    11/16/82   I don't think so, Governor There have been several occasions when there were coupon purchases on the Committee's meeting date   It might draw some mild--   I don't think it would affect it very significantly The market might draw some mild encouragement from it, but I wouldn't think they would make a big deal of it   The new issues were delivered yesterday It's a real question, with those coming at a current market yield and some of the other recently offered issues because of their high coupons having more attractive yields, whether we should buy them on a yield basis We are apt to buy very few of the new one that just came into the market   Oh gosh, several months   I think it was early last summer The size would be a normal size; we did $800 million about 3 or 4 months ago   Well, we have a reserve need to meet for next week and, given its persistence, it ought to be met in sizable measure through outright purchases So, if we don't buy coupons, we'd probably want to do another sizable purchase of Treasury bills It would be somewhat of a surprise to the market for us to do that because they have come to expect that after doing some sizable bill buying for a while we would intermix that on occasion with coupon purchases I think they would take it as a deliberate shunning of the coupon market if we didn't get in there I don't think it absolutely has to be today; it seems like the most logical day to me from the standpoint of our reserve needs If we did it tomorrow, then people could read that even more in the context of the Committee meeting than if it is being done on the day of the meeting   Well, Governor, when we buy coupons it is just that It's not all long-term bonds We buy the whole range of coupon issues To intermix bills and coupons I think would be a terribly cumbersome, totally novel, excursion in the market   The borrowing level now?   This current week [we expect] $550 million because we started out with $3 billion in borrowing on last Thursday   I think $250 million on borrowing would tend to produce a funds rate right around, or a shade below, the discount rate   Right   I don't think we'd have much scope for a downward movement in the funds rate with a $250 million borrowing level without a discount rate change   We sometimes get calls that some statistical release from Commerce or somewhere is out early, yes   I don't really think so There would be times when an immediate release would have a market impact that we might not want At times it could help to bring about the desired thrust in policy earlier I may be out of order saying this, but having been associated with this for many years and having filed one of the statements in that Merrill suit in which I took a position on the ill effects of immediate release, I would say, after thinking about it long and hard for many years, that I don't think I could make that same kind of statement today because of the different nature of the directive "
2234,1982-12-20," I can do mine now, Mr Chairman   Okay, fine [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I don't know if I would attribute the backup to the discount rate The discount rate reduction certainly didn't have the impact of earlier reductions in reducing longer-term rates; one heard the comment from a few people that maybe the recent money growth would lead to a reemergence of inflation at some point down the road, so that investors were less inclined to continue the interest they had had in the longer-term market I would regard this last discount rate move as having been about neutral for the longer market The fact that rates have backed up in the longer end I would attribute more to the supply [of new issues] coming in the longer-term sector Treasury supplies have been quite heavy and the corporate supply and tax exempt supply are also on the sizable side   Well, during the recent period, some of it was around the Thanksgiving weekend There is often a lot of churning then This tends to be a season of the year when we have high excess reserves; but as I indicated, the actuals exceeded even the above- normal allowance that we had made for it I'm just surmising now, but the flows associated with the new accounts could explain some of it Also the period around the mid-December dividend and tax dates is often a time of greater demand for excess reserves Nothing else comes immediately to mind as a special factor   The intermeeting leeway is $3 billion   I'm asking for $4 billion   To absorb the reserves   Well, we were operating with instructions to be accommodative of some overshoot of M2 as well as of M1   Well, I may have to give you two different answers for that We've been aiming at around $250 million or a little below; it's been $230 million in the recent weeks A number of recent weeks have tended to come out above that because of exigencies --some shortfalls of reserve projections or greater demands for excess In the current week borrowing is averaging around $300 million As for where the market thinks it is now, they probably would just take an average of the recent weeks, which would be between about $250 million and [$350] million   It's 1 percent for the year, but 3 percent because they expect a lot of it to be concentrated in the first quarter   Well, varying around 8-1/2 percent, but maybe a little more likely to be under than over   Under the 8-1/2 percent discount rate   Not that far, Governor I think with $175 million it would be more likely to vary under the discount rate, between 8 and 8-1/2 percent, but not necessarily closer to 8 percent than to 8-1/2 percent   Roughly, yes That falls out of these time- honored relationships, but they don't necessarily hold up in the short run   Where it's a big identifiable borrowing, we make an allowance for that "
2252,1983-01-14," Peter Sternlight on this We've been talking to some of them, especially in that first week or two when they had heavy outflows, and it looked like they were coping with it pretty well through having positioned themselves to have greater-than- normal liquidity And in the last couple of weeks, as you have seen, those outflows have tapered off a good bit And we even hear from the market that some of the funds are beginning to reach out a little, in a gingerly way, to get somewhat longer maturities So, they seem to feel that the worst of their hemorrhaging is over "
2286,1983-02-08," Shall I proceed, then?   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, $200 million is what we were aiming for As I mentioned, the last two full weeks have come out at about $150 million This week so far it's at about $110 million, although I wouldn't be surprised if it got up a little higher than that with Wednesday's borrowing   We were aiming [for that]    2/8-9/83   I'm not sure I'd know how to answer that because the shifts have had a big impact, most recently slowing the growth of reserves quite a bit With the shift out of the reservable big time deposits into the MMDAs that are reservable and extracting from that, I'd say maybe you're looking for the underlying M2 growth or something, which--   I think the staff has been estimating fairly moderate growth--in the 8 percent area "
2311,1983-03-28," I'd just remind the Committee that the last change in that standard authorization was made in 1974, when the Committee raised it from $2 to $3 billion I think the recommendation is logical It seems to me, with longer intervals between meetings and larger dollar volume changes in the typical factors affecting reserves, such as seasonal currency flows, that a change is in order And I think this proposed change would reduce the frequency of occasions for going back to the Committee for intermeeting changes of the leeway but would still call the Committee's attention to really large needs for change In the past two years, for example, there were 8 occasions when we came to the Committee for a change in the leeway Had the leeway been $4 rather than $3 billion, there would have been just 3, rather than 8, such occasions   I would expect so, Mr Chairman   Well, I don't see why under present procedures they wouldn't be able to settle a cash management bill the same day If I can just elaborate on this first point This ruling from a lawyer sounds very open ended, but it has to be judged an inadvertent overdraft--something that arose despite prudent and proper planning   I don't know if there's any interest provision   I think I speak for both Mr Axilrod and myself when I say I see this as a fairly close judgment call The activity is of some use in implementing reserve objectives, although it's not really so critical that we could not get on without it At the same time, we see the financial risks of continuing the activity as fairly low By doing RPs only in paper regarded as ""prime"" by the market and engaging only in short-term transactions with reputable dealers who are obliged to buy the paper back in a few days, the System incurs little risk in our view Perhaps a more likely source of difficulty, though, is the possibility that we would be presented with paper that we had some reason to question It could be awkward to turn down a name that had previously been regarded as prime, lest that very refusal escalate the questions being raised  If we were not now involved in doing RPs in BAs, I don't think I would suggest getting into the activity even if it did help us somewhat in meeting reserve objectives At the same time, given that we are occasionally involved, one must weigh the impact of withdrawal at a time when confidence in the national and worldwide banking system is still fairly tender--though less so than last summer and fall Withdrawal could be taken as a sign of lack of confidence in the banking system and not merely a judgment that the activity was not essential in meeting reserve objectives or showing support to the BA market On balance--acknowledging that it's a narrow rather than an overwhelming balance--I'd favor retaining the authorization and so recommend to the Committee It should be recognized, though, that under a continued authorization, it may well be deemed expedient under certain circumstances to continue accepting names that may be starting to come under some question, lest our refusal aggravate doubtful situations   We normally do it in conjunction with doing RPs on behalf of the System When we have some temporary reserves to inject, we have the choice of whether to engage in RPs on behalf of the System or to just pass through to the market some of the foreign  -10-    3/28-29/83  account temporary investment orders It is done largely on the basis of the size of the need we have to put reserves into the market If it's a fairly sizable need or we're going to do multi-day RPs, then we do them on behalf of the System and we normally do them on acceptances as well as Treasury and agency securities I would say it works out on an average to be a few times, maybe two or three times, a month   It would be noticed if we did fail to include acceptances when we were doing RPs on behalf of the System If we reverted to just leaning more often on passing through the customer RPs and less often on our own RPs--a modest change in that direction--I don't think it would attract great attention   Well, I'd probably suggest just announcing a future date beyond which we would cease that activity   Well, I'd say that the market has matured to the point that it doesn't warrant any vestige of Federal Reserve participation in it as a supporting arm and that it's of such modest usefulness in open market operations that that reason for staying with the activity has distinctly diminished And to provide an adjustment period for the market, we can announce a date X months ahead beyond which we would not do it I don't see a way to phase it out in step- by-step procedures   There might be   I suspect that there would I don't know; it's hard to say   Well, we've been thinking about that, as the memorandum noted My inclination is that as long as we're satisfied, as we have been, with the financial strength and so forth of those firms, I don't think I'd recommend discontinuing activity with them But I think we would be very reluctant at this point to take up with any new firms that were active only in acceptances and not in the whole range of government securities   I'd say it's a pretty small factor  -12-    3/28-29/83   [Statement--see Appendix]  -21-    3/28-29/83   Well, as I mentioned, that spread between the prime rate and the rate on CDs or other things that I think the prime tends to take its cue from has gotten relatively narrow I think it's at the point that would very likely call for a move Obviously, as the funds rate moves up and other short-term rates move up, at some point a prime rate move would very likely be kicked off I think the whole set of public policy considerations that banks will look at will play a role here I'm just guessing, but if funds got up to around 9 percent or somewhere in that area--maybe more toward 9-1/4 or 9-1/2 percent--there probably would be very strong pressures for the prime rate to move   Yes   The CD rates are now 9 to 9-1/8 percent-- something in that area   I think that was part of the background I'd say this came about just in the day-to-day implementation when we had discussions on our morning conference calls or with senior Board staff I don't know whether Mr Axilrod wants to add any comments on that   They're doing it keyed to something like what the money funds pay; that has crept up a bit as market rates have come up   What I said yesterday, President Horn, is that I sense a great feeling of uncertainty in the market As to what kind of reaction there would be, on some occasions I've gotten the sense that the intermediate and longer end of the market would take quite comfortably--in some cases even welcome--a firming in short rates as evidence that the Fed was still actively concerned with inflation and wanting to put a lid on monetary growth But there also have been other occasions when the whole market has reacted Last Friday when Kaufman's report came out--and maybe it was a little exaggerated when it hit the ticker--the whole rate structure moved a bit, both short and long rates In the preceding week there had been a rather different picture, with short rates edging up but nothing at all happening on the longer rates I think there was a sense among some people who took a somewhat longer, broader view that the higher short rates would not have to impact, even temporarily, on the longer end So, I'm left in a bit of a quandary on just how the market is reacting  -53-    3/28-29/83   That could be   I'd say just about that that $250 million in borrowing would tend to give you a funds rate of 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent "
2347,1983-05-24," [Statement--see Appendix]   I tend to believe that they think of it as a free reserve target, Governor Wallich And they probably think of it as centering around zero or very slightly plus   Well, in fact, they do Yes   Well, I don't think they regard it as a federal funds target in the sense of pre-October 1979 I think they would feel, with some reason, that if we are aiming at free reserves or borrowing we are aiming at something that has a likely range of variation in the federal funds rate but not a federal funds target in that very narrow sense where the Desk pin-pointed within 1/8 point or so a particular funds level and intervened every time that there was ever so little a variation from that   I think they see it as a federal funds range [once removed] but not a tight target   The Senate should be taking it up in the Finance Committee today I think the Treasury desperately needs them to finish and then Congress can finish action by the end of this week They will literally run out of money early next week   Then we could get a whole bunch, yes   The Carter bonds Yes, I think they were   The new withholdings schedules went out a few days ago   Well, as you said, we've been there but to be aiming at it [is a distinction] Whereas I felt aiming at $250 million was associated with funds of 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent, I'd expect to see funds trading more toward the 8-3/4 percent side and maybe edging above that on occasion  -31-    5/24/83   Well, for a weekly average, it only got up there in the week in early April when there were those special end-of- quarter pressures Other than that, I think the highest it recently reached was 880 percent   Well, I think they're debating that very point with probably a majority thinking no change But there would be some who would expect some snugging   Mr Chairman, even leaving out that week of April 6 that had the $14 billion borrowing, that average that you cite is still affected by a couple of weeks where we had a wire breakdown or some special event that pulled that average up Aiming at $250 million, there's just more room for misses on the up side than the down side and I think that's the result that emerges "
2359,1983-06-23," I can chime in on that With regard to the Chairman's suggestion of $400 to $500 million, I would associate that with a funds rate around 9 percent or a little higher   A little, but not a major part recently I think some of the higher borrowing, particularly in the first couple weeks in June, was associated with reserve shortfalls for various    6/23/83  reasons--mostly some high Treasury balances and on occasion unexpectedly high demands for excess reserves I don't have a recollection of any major computer-related or wire problems in the last two weeks "
2410,1983-08-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  [CHAIRMAN VOLCKER Questions?]   Well, I think it worked satisfactorily in this period I don't know that it will always be that satisfactory It depends on the behavior of excess reserves, which tended not to be as high this last period They averaged a little over $400 million, and we were pretty much programming them in our path-building at the $350 million level One week we moved that up to $400 million If we    8/23/83  were to get weeks when there was a much stronger demand for excess reserves, it could be more troublesome to operate on that basis But it has not been a significant problem   I think there has been some rise [in excess reserves] this year; it abated a bit in just the last month or so We essentially have somewhat higher levels of excess this year than earlier; and I tend to relate that to some of our Reserve Bank operational reviews of overdrafts and things like that, which I think have made some bankers want to hold higher levels of excess reserves   I don't entirely I think the size was a factor in the extent to which the market backed up It came down again very fast, but I think it may be premature to say that the market has really digested this; it may be regurgitated again, too   I agree with that And I agree with some looseness of that relationship, because we seem to be getting borrowing a little over $1 billion and yet the funds rate looks as if it's going to average a little under 9-1/2 percent When I look back at some rough equations I tried to draw up, $700 to $900 million might suggest to me 9-1/2 percent or a little higher on average, but it--   Yes   We got a lot of borrowing early in the week There was one week when we were just about explicitly making the kind of adjustment that President Guffey referred to We were prepared to accommodate--to make some allowance for the high level of borrowing in that week, as it closed out We were going to make an allowance for high excess reserves as we were closing out the week but then it turned out that the reserve factors caused a big miss that pretty much offset the kind of allowance we thought we were making there   Right But that net borrowed reserve figure comes out of the Committee's discussion on borrowing and-- "
2438,1983-10-04," [Statement--see Appendix]  [Secretary's note The Committee ratified the transactions of the Desk]   The funds rate is firm at 9-1/2 or 9-5/8 percent--a slight improvement   Borrowings have been running closer to $1 billion this week Banks may want more excess reserves than we're allowing for Our projection has us slightly above the [reserve] path, which is staying put, and getting some RP withdrawal that will put us closer back to the path   There were three recent weeks when the borrowing was about $700 million   I think it's ""sought in recent weeks""   The policy record can refer to the difficulties with the Treasury balances   We use the range   If we use the individual weekly paths, they have a specific value over time "
2467,1983-11-14," [Statement--see Appendix]   Over the intermeeting period our projections indicate a possible need to add something in the area of $4 to $5 billion to System holdings, and I think we could run into the normal $4 billion intermeeting limitation I would suggest enlarging the leeway to $5 billion until the next meeting, Mr Chairman   It's not an average, no At any point within the period we would not be able to increase outright holdings by more than $4 billion from the starting point   It does not include the repurchase agreements   That is true Correct   That's true   On a commitment basis we're not changing the System's holdings [when we do RPs]   Well, this was reviewed--I forget when--and we went to the $4 billion limit The Committee has gradually raised this [limit] When it was reviewed a year or so ago, I think it was raised from $3 to $4 billion; the feeling was that with $4 billion  -28-    11/14-15/83  there were likely to be maybe one to two occasions a year when we would have to come to the Committee [for a higher temporary limit] I think the Committee's preference then was to set it a point where once or twice a year we did face the limitation and had to come before the Committee rather than to set it so high that it very rarely, if ever, needed review   Fairly typical for this time of year, yes   Yes   I think they do, yes The Treasury has a low point in [its cash balances around] the mid-month and [then] they can get through to about the end of the month "
2496,1983-12-19," Well, I think Steve summarized the note that came from us But the little that I would add at this point is that we still would have, I assume, nonborrowed reserve targets for each reserve period I would see those as remaining the central focus of Desk activity With a two-week rather than a one-week period, our perspective would change somewhat, but I think the main focus would still be on the full reserve period With a longer settlement period, we would probably give more attention to the profile of excesses or deficiencies within the full period To some extent, we still would look at weekly reserve levels, but there wouldn't be the same need as now to strive to meet those individual weekly targets But we probably would want to avoid sizable accumulations of excesses or deficiencies within the two-week span I don't see any need for different operational techniques from what we work with now    12/19-20/83   I think it might depend on how one responds to the point that Steve was outlining about the degree of automaticity the Committee may want to permit to occur   Probably for the reserve effect it would be a couple of days later; it was folded into all the other reserve factors that we take account of   No There wouldn't have been an immediate reserve impact anyway But we would have acted as soon as we had the information and folded it into all the other reserve factors   [Statement--see Appendix] That concludes my report on operations, Mr Chairman I do have a recommendation about leeway for the next period Specifically, I think it would be advisable to retain the $5 billion intermeeting leeway for changes in outright holdings that was adopted at the last meeting The difference is that this time the enlargement would be needed to cope with seasonal declines in currency and deposit levels Also, if the intermeeting period extends into early February, we would come up to that final phase-down step of reserve requirement ratios for member banks coming out of the Monetary Control Act That's all I have, Mr Chairman   That's the objective, yes Some weeks come in above and some weeks below   I think the pressures may linger a day or two [longer] "
2522,1984-01-30," [Statement--see Appendix]   Currency The outright change was an increase of about $16 billion, and a big rise in currency in circulation was the main factor Currency was up something like $14    1/30-31/84  billion when I last looked There was some decline in our foreign currency holdings over the course of the year, which would have been another reason for the outright increase But that currency increase is the chief thing that comes to mind   The free ride is over in the vault cash And in that period I think it was exercised in just a modest degree I didn't hear very much about the free ride on the deposits side The fact that there are 10 to 12 days that never get reserved didn't get much attention   There was a period of a couple of weeks when vault cash in effect counted double It counted with the normal lag that has been going on--   --but also banks get more on their [vault cash] schedules in the first couple of weeks of February   Well, we've paid them to hold more But they didn't do as large [unintelligible]; they did it to only a minor degree   It is up 02 now; it had been slightly down   Well, $200 or $300 million perhaps, in light not only of CRR but also the phase-down in reserve requirements   Yes "
2550,1984-03-26," Just the weekly report goes to the Treasury   As noted in my memo to the Committee, Mr Chairman, I felt the decision on whether or not to continue doing repurchase agreements in BAs was a very close one In fact, I had initially written a summary for my own staff summarizing the pros and cons, which came out marginally for staying with the operations We kicked it around for a while and were persuaded, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, to come out on the negative side But again, for some of us anyway, quite narrowly That was our evaluation of, on the one side, the modest usefulness of continuing the operations and, on the other side, a small but nonnegligible risk of continuing those operations   Well, that we do part of our operations in them when we do repurchase agreements For the System Account it has worked out in the last year that about 7 percent was in BAs When this issue was reviewed a year ago the average had been more like 10 to 15 percent When Mr Axilrod and I presented a memo just a year    3/26-27/84  ago on this subject we also thought the decision was close and came out narrowly for continuing the operations One factor that weighed in that narrow balance was that our withdrawal might add to general market anxieties about the banking system, which we regarded then as less acute than in the previous summer and fall--that is the summer and fall of 1982--but still present in some measure We are now another year past that relatively sensitive period of 1982, so that reason for not withdrawing seems to carry a bit less weight In the meantime the use of BAs in our repurchase agreements has diminished somewhat further So, in my view, those factors tip the scale from narrowly in favor of continuing to narrowly for withdrawing But as our recommendation stated If the decision is to withdraw, it should be with several months' notice to the market   We would try to duck it If it were known in the market, then I think the market would not present us with such a name because that just wouldn't be a good name circulating in the market But if we had some information and the market in general didn't, then we would hate to make the waves that would be made by rejecting it, so we probably would take it   It could, yes; and that tends to be a fairly sizable proportion of what we do   Yes, but Governor, we don't really have that choice When we are doing RPs, we will make agreements with the different firms to do an even $5 million or $10 million and so on It's only late in the day that we find out what actual acceptances are being presented They don't present us with a million at such and such a rate in a particular bank that is named then; the names usually come up later   Well, that we have found this of limited usefulness and that the market is mature and certainly doesn't need our participation for support purposes, but so as not to be precipitate we are making the change as of 3 months hence or 6 months hence or whatever I'd say something like that   The outright [purchases and sales], yes   It's not used in a significant way   I think that's a distinction that still applies for re-discount at the discount window, and relief from reserve requirements would still hinge on that aspect I don't think that would be affected   No We have a requirement for what is eligible for our purchase but that goes to the market acceptability or tradability of the name   Going back some years, yes When government securities were in short supply it was helpful but it hasn't been that critical   Yes   That's what was done when we withdrew from the outright [market] There was no formal change in the authorization   I think we did   Yes But I don't know whether agreement was reached on what that time interval should be I would suggest about 3 months   [Statement--see Appendix]   It looks very much as though it could be that large or even a little larger   Our figures have it up to about $40 or $42 billion, something like that I think the Board staff's projections are not quite that high, but not far from it   They cut back a little on Treasury bills a couple of weeks ago I've been having conversations suggesting a review of that But I don't think we'll get very much help there   [The Treasury balance] comes down again in early May, fairly fast I don't have a very clear time profile, Governor Rice   In early May I think there could be debt limit problem, yes   I agree with a little over $1 billion--say, $11 billion--for 10-1/2 percent I think borrowings of $1-1/2 billion would produce more than 11 percent [on the funds rate]   It was $600 million in January and $500 million in November and December   We don't have experience with that   That probably induced some of the borrowing   I think that the funds rate did have some of that expectational element But I still think that much of the discount rate would be translated into a higher funds rate unless you did something to borrowing "
2576,1984-05-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think some of that collision is seen as taking place in the longer area The Treasury has continued its program of issuing longer debt So it was not only that current sense of what is pressing on the market but, with that sense of strong private credit demand, there was some uplifting of inflation expectations there too that I think had an impact at the longer end    5/21-22/84  I must say, though, that I share your view of surprise as to the extent to which the yield curve has steepened   When the borrowing first began we still had a fairly high funds rate To have gone in then overtly to do substantial mopping up could have been seen as a very disruptive factor, I think, and we just let a pile of excess reserves build up Increasingly in the last few days we've worked down that pile of excess With the amount we took out of reserves today through some matched sales we have pretty much wiped away the impact of the special borrowing that has occurred thus far and we even made a small allowance for some anticipated continuing borrowing We have been a little gingerly in anticipating how high this level of borrowing will be in the remaining days In a numerical sense I think we have just about caught up with that mopping up process now But in a psychological sense some of the ease that was created because of the earlier buildup in excess reserves is still in there   No It has not been so labeled   Well, I'm not sure Are you asking about the whole range of operations or the particular mopping up of the excess reserves?   That part has gone very smoothly Once the banking system came to realize they had all this excess, they have been very eager to show us propositions and have us pay them something for the excess reserves that they now see as unwanted So, that has gone quite smoothly The market, in general, had developed some greater volatility just because of that massive pessimistic feeling I think it is calming down somewhat from that, but it's still fairly--   I think that would remove one important contributing factor   The budget deficit problem is there too, but I think there is hope that something will go through And the market is also waiting for clearer evidence of a more reasonable pace in the economic expansion   Yes, it's taking increasingly high yields [to attract them] Some have begun to come back in again, but still in a fairly modest way   I would say they do not have anything very significant left It is very hard to measure their positions because so much is hedged against futures positions Even though they in a sense took down big chunks from the Treasury, they had already made arrangements to sell some of it I would say their positions now are no more than a few hundred million that could be attributed directly to the financing   It has, yes It has also had the volatility    5/21-22/84   No There was one day of extremely volatile price movements when the price limit situation was reached and they had to discontinue functioning for a couple of hours But even that--   That's the only instance that I recall   Well, some of them try to get very fully hedged At some point they live with a certain element of uncertainty because they take down securities from the Treasury They don't know whether their bid is going to win securities or not, so they probably hedge some of it in expectation that they will win some securities but they may be preparing to have some net long position in the hopes of moving some of it out profitably   Well, it poses great problems for the Treasury and the functioning of the government I think they have to begin something in the course of this week because the Congress is due to recess   They will be out I think they probably have enough to last beyond when the Congress goes home but not until the Congress comes back They have to get action by the 23rd or 24th   Well, we've said time and time again that that's a rather loose relationship I would think the funds rate would run around 10-1/2 percent but I couldn't dispute strongly that it could turn out often at 10-3/4 percent As to why after the discount rate the central tendency was an increase of only a quarter of a point, I think that could well be because the discount rate move was fairly well anticipated about that time and in part already had been built into expectations [Unintelligible] what you are looking for as a response   I'm not sure I'd place it any differently Clearly at the beginning of CRR we were getting a particularly heavy demand for excess reserves That seems to have settled down a bit We seem to be getting excess reserves reasonably close to the $600 million level that we're putting in the path now As to the significance in the restraining impact of different levels of borrowing, I'm not sure I'm able to discern enough yet to give a better answer   Well, 10-1/2 percent   I think it's a loose relationship   Well, I think the catch-up occurred even more rapidly I should fill the Committee in, Mr Solomon Late yesterday afternoon the funds rate moved up to the 12 percent area or even higher and it has been at 10-1/2 to 11 percent this morning In fact, we're having to put back a small amount of reserves today; we had some revisions in the path I think we accomplished that catch-up and maybe slightly more than accomplished it in what we did yesterday So I think it is back to--   Well, we did get this change in the path that reflected a number of revisions in required reserves for this whole period totalling some $260 million; I think that was figure And in the matched sales we did yesterday we got a lot of offerings and we did about $5 billion out of $8 billion offered thinking that we would just be taking away some of the unwanted excess But I think when all the shouting was over the banks suddenly realized that they were not as flush as they had thought when they were making aggressive offerings to us in the morning, and they saw themselves as still having some need Also, apart from Continental, one has to think of the borrowing during this period, which has been averaging about $750 to $760 million So I think it was to be expected, if we're going to be on path as we go toward the end of the period, that some greater firmness would work itself into the market as this period winds up I wouldn't have guessed that that would happen late Monday afternoon; I would have thought it would occur maybe Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday But it seems to be happening a day earlier than I had estimated "
2630,1984-08-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   I consider it transitory in the sense that I don't regard it as permanent, but I have some real question about whether it will reverse very soon I think it might tend to narrow gradually but I don't have a strong sense of confidence as to the timing or extent of that   Well, that would depend a good deal on the nature of the discussion around the table here I think [the answer is] mechanically, yes, but there are nuances in the day-to-day execution of policy in that we'd want to take guidance from the Committee's sentiment   I mentioned the reluctance to borrow as the most reasonably clear and persuasive reason to me I didn't mean to dismiss entirely the Continental borrowing and the cutting of new channels I'm not thoroughly persuaded; that has some plausibility to me, but I can't really pin down well in my mind just how the whole process worked   We've had that information from two or three of the very large banks And some of them think that it's true of others, but not everyone admits to it in a direct way   That is possible   We have plenty of short-term securities to sell   Again, it's very uncertain and a lot depends on the extended credit If I were sure that that were going up substantially, we wouldn't really need the [additional] leeway and I would just wait until the situation arises I'm just asking as a matter of prudence because I see the possibility at this point   An increase from $4 to $6 billion, Mr Chairman   That more or less assumes extended credit unchanged   It was a conference call among the discount officers, and there was no substantiation of that "
2655,1984-10-02," [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't know that it would It could have some different effects Our experience is that seasonal borrowing does seem to respond to interest rate pressures, and I think that's the logic for coupling it with adjustment borrowing On the other side, it doesn't have the same pressure to repay quickly that adjustment borrowing has and that's the logic on the other side of it   I'd tend to leave it alone, I think   Well, if we had done that in the recent period, I think it would have tended to push rates higher than they went because we had the seasonal component building up   If we make the suitable adjustments in the borrowing level, which work into the path, we could work with either of those However, the Committee may not want to do that [kind of] short-run adjusting I tend to think of the combined total as a better number to work with, but I think it can be argued either way    10/2/84   Adjustment borrowing?   The seasonal, yes   I'm hard put to say what there is right now because after that funds rate [unintelligible] did give some ground, and one could say that there has been evidence just in the last few days of some lessened reluctance to use the window We've had several sizable banks come in early in the reserve period On the other hand, the funds rate has been back toward the high side in this current week It is averaging about 1121 percent so far in this statement period, which suggests that maybe this is just statement-date pressure--that would be my guess as of the moment--and that there is some return toward normalcy underlying this But I would have to see another several days before I could conclude that with greater conviction   The nationwide total for excess has not gone up, unless it's changing this very reserve period we're in In the full reserve periods that we have had, that had not shown any more--   Yes, a tendency within the period for more conservative management but nothing for the period as a whole "
2679,1984-11-07," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think some who went in on it felt that it was worth something, just for the prestige or the advertising factor One had that sense on the bids that came in, and I think that some modest losses probably were taken in the course of doing that Certainly, one hears that the next time around the spread is not likely to be as large as that 32 basis points--that maybe half that would be justifiable That was the feeling I was getting   Just a week ago, I believe I am confident it was mentioned Well, I can't say I read the wire of the call I know that it certainly was reviewed at the conference call   Last Thursday or Friday   I was going to add a comment on the question Steve was raising earlier about why the banks have lagged in bringing down their rates on MMDA accounts I think one reason might be that they see that as a rather easy way to get in some more retail money and lessen their dependence on day-to-day liability managed funds I think some of them are conscious of the problems the big banks have had and wanted to strengthen their deposit base that way That could have been a factor   There might be reserve problems because of the holiday then, but I don't think it presents any problem for edging the borrowing down "
2704,1984-12-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   I think they believe that a significant reduction would have an impact, yes   Well, I would say that there are at least    12/17-18/84  seasonal problems But Steve might want to comment   Based on some of those market surveys taken among the larger banks, people in the market are looking for a sizable rebound from the $7 billion drop--on the order of $4 to $6 billion   I would suggest $6 billion, yes   To add to that, I think the $250 million of borrowing is likely to give you a steady state kind of situation--a funds rate very close to the discount rate, although we're not really in a steady state and the market widely expects something to happen to the discount rate So, I expect $250 million of borrowing for the next little while to be associated with fed funds trading closer to 8 percent on average as the market broadly expects something on the discount rate As to the long-term rates, I think there will be a slight declining effect from lower short-rates I wouldn't expect a perverse effect on this occasion   It's averaging $260 million so far in this period but we would expect to see some lull   About 8-3/4 percent   The market sees it as 7 percent in an elastic way   We drained some reserves I didn't hear what happened to the funds rate, Mr Chairman   Well, I'm going to respond to your question earlier about what happened over the course of the morning The funds rate was 7 percent We went in to drain some reserves We got a lot of offers--$7 billion plus--and we did just $1 billion Funds were last trading at 6-3/4 percent   Yes "
2745,1985-02-12," Yes I am Sure   [Statement--see Appendix]   At the maximum, $44 billion It wound up at just $43 billion, but we had so much uncertainty, particularly about what was going to happen to Continental's borrowing, that I think it was useful to have that flexibility during the period   Right   Yes   The path gets adjusted as we proceed    2/12-13/85   The guiding principle in drawing the path is to accommodate required reserves and the estimated demand for excess reserves and then the allowance for borrowings that comes out of the Committee's discussion And if, as we proceed through a period, we find that required reserves are growing more substantially, we fold that information--when we get it--into a revision of the path Most of those revisions--   Yes   That would have been an alternative and could come into the discussion also   Well, we're shooting to accommodate required reserves--   --at that level of borrowing   Well, there's close coordination in the operational sense of Sam and his people being aware of what we're doing each day and vice versa And on something like the drawing of the paths--whether we're talking about up to $300 million with a bias on the accommodative side or later modifying that bias--that is all    2/12-13/85  coordinated through conversations with senior staff here and ensuing discussions that keep the Board informed Certainly, we are keeping the Committee informed in our reports on the market the morning call and the weekly reports   Well, certainly we were aware of what was happening day-to-day on the dollar And there were some individual days when the strength of the dollar had a fair input into the timing of our operations--the decision of just when to go in to put reserves into the domestic market   No I think that we did have some concern about what was happening when funds were getting up to 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent, and we [began] shaping our operations in a way that I think helped to bring it down to 8-1/4 percent, though I wouldn't say that that was specifically a target   No sir   Both were 6 to 9 percent "
2770,1985-03-26," Mr Chairman, I don't think I have anything significant to add to the short memorandum that I sent to the Committee on that subject As noted there, we had half a dozen occasions last year when we asked for increases in the intermeeting limit It was never a problem to get [the Committee's approval of] those increases, but since we asked for increases in fully half of the intermeeting periods I think it was becoming almost a routine matter that was going beyond the purpose served by that intermeeting limit That purpose, it seems to me, is to flag really unusual changes If the limit were put up to a $6 billion level, I think it would still serve that purpose of flagging unusual changes in that leeway I might mention that in the period that is coming up now we may very possibly need an increase even beyond the $6 billion But I would rather wait until we are further into the period and have a better idea of just how much of a temporary increase we may want to request   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think what was so frightening in the Drysdale case, Governor, was that there were a number of dealers that were heavily involved And until Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover came through and agreed to meet those interest payments that Drysdale was unable to make on that fateful day, there were a number of dealers who were threatened with very serious losses and there was a real question of the ability of these major market makers to function in the market The market was on the edge of becoming rather seized up and just unable to function well This time there was a kind of disgust, a view that another one of these small dealers has misbehaved and inflicted some losses in various places in the economy But this was not seen as entering the central marketplace in the same way as Drysdale   There were some that took losses, too, but they were rather modest--certainly modest against their own capital strength   Yes The firm that was doing the clearing for them was already in the process of unwinding its clearing operations   We have rolled over maturing holdings of agency issues but we have not added to holdings of agency issues for a couple of years now, Mr Chairman We have been watching the spreads in the agency market because we were concerned about just these kinds of questions And in the eyes of the market--although we hear of an occasional case where an investor or two wants to reduce its exposure there--in general those spreads are holding quite narrowly for Farm Credit [issues] and for [those of] the other agencies too In fact, one could probably raise questions about all of those agency securities--those of the Home Loan Banks or of Fannie Mae, which have had some loss experience But in general those spreads are holding up very well and the Farm Credit Banks have been putting on a strong, and to me a fairly convincing campaign, to the effect that the system as a whole has quite a lot of strength in it There was one Intermediate Credit Bank in Spokane that needed help from the rest of the system but in general they present what seems to the market--and to me in what I've seen--a fairly good picture   Yes    3/26/85   We typically roll over the maturing ones into similar amounts   I don't have a figure in my head   I think very [unintelligible] in the market I think it would tend to detract from the--   It's about flat There might have been a modest decline, but I don't think it was a big decline They certainly have not been net money raisers   We have been aiming at $350 million of borrowing but, as I said, for a couple of reasons--the main one being the greater demand for excess reserves--it has come out higher I think particularly in that reserve period when borrowings averaged over $600 million there were some really special factors Perhaps more indicative is this current reserve period when it's averaging about $470 million thus far And even there I think it is probably being lifted some because of the greater demand for excess reserves   There were times like that   9 percent or higher Higher than [unintelligible], particularly if we continue to use something like the current excess reserve number Frankly, if the demand for excess reserves continues to run ahead of what we're using now, then I think  -30-    3/26/85  the borrowing is going to tend to come out, say, $100 million or so higher than what we plug in there   Well, it is the number that's used in constructing the path for nonborrowed reserves, and the nonborrowed reserves are a target   We have been doing that recently We have been making an allowance in this current reserve period; even though $600 million is in there for excess reserves, we've been thinking of it as somewhat higher and not rushing in to take out what has looked over the last couple of days, for example, like more than enough reserves for the path   Slightly more   No, I think that would be--   They probably would guess that we had aimed at something like $400 to $500 million, because I think they dismissed that $600 million plus that we had in one two-week period They probably would be thinking $400 to $500 million   If we really were to achieve $350 million, I think the implication for the funds rate would be something a little under 8-1/2 percent, maybe 8-1/4 percent It really depends partly on what we put in for excess reserves too, Mr Black I think if we were to stay with $600 million, which has been proving to be on the low side, then using $600 million for excess and $350 for borrowing is really like imposing a somewhat higher level of borrowing--the $350 million would be more like getting $450 million And with that, I think you'd get maybe 8-1/2 percent on fed funds My own feeling is that if you're going to have some flexibility on the borrowing, you have to have some on the excess too, which we have to a degree "
2794,1985-05-21," No, in the Manager's weekly report we do not include the projections in what has been going to the Treasury I would think if you approve this, we'd send the same [to the Chairman of the Council]   [Statement--see Appendix]   No, I'd agree with that--shaded to the down side   I think that was the main factor in the weakness in M2 but I don't know how many percentage points   Just yesterday there were--   That would only take out about $200 million in the period average I would say that what we'll publish this week will be high because most of them are in   My feeling is that without thrifts this period's average will be at something like $600 million  SPEAKER(?) We could still get some borrowing in New York today   It would still be around $100 million now [unintelligible] extended credit when we make some allowance-- "
2818,1985-07-09, [Statement--see Appendix] 
2843,1985-08-20," I could add a little comment on that too Governor Martin What we are hearing anecdotally also suggests a lesser pace of foreign buying, but continuing interest in the intermediate and long-term area I don't get any sense, particularly from the dealers who have active Japanese operations, of a shortening of maturities They are taking a little less but are continuing to look at the 10-year and longer area   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we were following their funding operations closely on the heels of that, and they did experience a slight widening of spreads--maybe by 05 or something like that It was not a big reaction They have a quite liquid operation; they have an enormous local deposit base They generally are sellers rather than buyers in the overnight fed funds market They have had a little erosion of the commercial paper funding of the holding company but, based on our observations, I would say they are weathering it pretty well   The current spreads would range from about 5 to 15 basis points on maturities up to one year--and those had been just about even with Treasuries earlier--to maybe 40 or 50 basis points on some of the longer maturities, which earlier had spreads of maybe 20 to 25 basis points   Not that I am aware of I think the market is looking for them to announce a term issue within the next few weeks   Given all the hedges on positions that are taken these days, it has become very difficult to make sensible comments about where dealer positions are My impression is that there has been a pretty good distribution from the refunding that was just paid for a few days ago I'd say they are on the moderate side   Yes I think in the UK also there has been more of an attitude of looking at it as reciprocal--looking for specific olive branches and reciprocity before Japanese firms are welcomed into the developing gilt market in London We have been following the situation and I'm still collecting impressions of just what the situation is in Japan; but my impression so far is that at least a respectable number of US firms--8 or 10 or something like    8/20/85  that--have quite good access to Japanese investors, in terms of selling US securities in the Japanese market   They usually have to take a special issue from the Treasury   We are using $400 million in the path; it has been averaging, through yesterday, slightly over $500 million   The last full two-week period was $480 million "
2868,1985-10-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   Those extra loans were unwound, yes sir "
2893,1985-11-04," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, ""drop-dead day""--when they have to trot out some gimmick   They did some disinvesting of trust funds a few days ahead of the normal schedule in order to make benefits payments to Social Security and other pension recipients just in the last couple of days--last Friday and today Conceivably, they could do some disinvestment of trust funds even further ahead of time But that's something they have talked about in their inner circle discussions at Treasury but have no intention, as far as I know now, of doing There was mention, I think, in one of the letters that went up from Secretary Baker to the Congress about the possibility of selling gold but they said that the Administration is totally set against doing something like that There are probably half a dozen other things that are conceivable but that they have said they just don't want to do   It will be just about used up by the $3 billion cash management bill that they announced early this afternoon and will carry through tomorrow I think that will leave about $1 billion   Well, the firming of the funds rate has been rather minuscule; it has changed from a 790 percent average to an 8 percent average, approximately It is conceivable that some of the changing pattern had to do with low Treasury balances in the money center banks, which may have put them under a little more pressure to buy in the fed funds market, but I'm not sure it was very significantly that I think it may have been more a carrying through of the slight adjustment that had been made in our degree of borrowing pressure before the last meeting that was achieving its maturing effect in the recent period    11/4-5/85   I don't think so We had a good handle on what it was Typically, that takes place in terms of the actual reserve impact with a couple of days' lag, and we were totally on top of what was happening there   There are likely to be Yes, there is the normal 3-, 10-, and 30-year issues that would have been up for auction this week that have been postponed They just did last week the 4-, 7- and 20-year issues that had been postponed by about a month because of debt limit problems   Well, I think at that level that the funds rate would tend to be around 7-7/8 to 8 percent My thinking with $500 million is right around 8 percent, maybe 8 to 8-1/8 percent   One little thing that has happened is that seasonal borrowing has come off some recently, and I think that tends to make the given level [unintelligible] a tiny bit more   I think there's--   It's also the final day of the reserve period, and I think that's--  -33-    11/4-5/85 "
2918,1985-12-16," [Statement--see Appendix]   They are just about caught up now They were backed up and had to follow the passage of the debt ceiling bill with an immediate same-day auction of 3- and 6-month bills, and they already had announced some of that month-end batch of coupon issues-- the 2- and 4-year issues Those will be coming along, I think, later this week and next week and that puts them pretty much back on schedule   For the moment they are paying off paper They have bank lines that they really do not consider will hold given the material changes that have occurred in the company's prospective fortunes And they have alternative plans for achieving the liquidity to continue meeting their paper maturities which [involve]  that they are just in the process of developing, we understand   We do our usual thing increase our holdings to offset currency in circulation and rising required reserves    12/16-17/85   Well, I think you are right I think that a half percentage point move on the discount rate would bring funds down about that same half percentage point It could be a little less because maybe a move has been discounted to a tiny degree But if it set expectations going of things being on the easy side, you could get that full half point on the funds rate   I think $400 million is a little more assured of getting a rate under 8 percent now than $450 million   I think if you went for something like $200 million, the easier reserve conditions, there would be such a strong expectation of the discount rate following that you would get that very strong expectational effect And you could tend to get funds even below 7-1/2 percent before the discount rate moved   Well, close to the half point after that   We've been using $450 million in the path Actually, so far in this period, which ends tomorrow, borrowing has averaged just $200 million because, as Steve said, we tend to get low levels until the very end of the period   It was 7-13/16 percent the last I heard "
2943,1986-02-11," It is averaging just a little under $200 million   No, we didn't Statistically [unintelligible], but funds were high   I think that's about right In the context of, say, 6 weeks ago, when we were saying $350 million we were tending to associate that with 7-3/4 percent But the intermeeting experience and changing market expectations about the discount rate would probably lead me to think that if you want even greater assurance of being around 7-3/4 percent, something centering around $300 million is more appropriate   Yes, something centering around that   I think there has been enough variation from period to period that there wouldn't be that much notice taken if we were centering around the $300 million   Well, in the recent period it has been averaging about 7-7/8 percent; I think something centering around the $300 million ought to give us something like 7-3/4 percent or maybe a hair over that   Well, today it happens to be at 8 percent for reasons that are a little obscure right now   It would probably work on expectations; as the Chairman said, that's a big part of the daily framework in which the market participants set the funds rate If they see economic numbers come out that lead them to think that we're going to be more accommodative, even before we do anything there could be a tendency toward a lower funds rate Beyond that, there is the opportunity in the context of the directive you're writing to make adjustments in the borrowing level That could have its impact on the funds rate as well   It would work in the direction of a lower funds rate    2/11-12/86   It did get up almost to 8-3/4 percent in that period when there were a lot of year-end pressures But the market recognized that as something rather special and they weren't greatly concerned   By roughly the amount [of the discount rate cut] "
2968,1986-04-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   It has been smothered over by the impact of the quarter-end, as you mentioned President Melzer But our impression, both from seeing that activity on Thursday and from a number of conversations with funds managers, is that it was no great problem I think they saw it coming and were pretty well prepared for it We did get the sense that some of the rise in excess reserves in the past few months was already foreshadowing this greater attention to the overdraft potential   Well, it normally would be less than that I think it's fair to say that bills are currently priced with an expectation of the funds rate being lower than the recent 7-3/8 percent--call it, on average maybe 7-1/8 or 7 percent, or something like that I'm not sure there's any one single figure that is normal,    4/1/86  but I think the spread now is toward the wide side of what has been a typical range It maybe centers around 1/2 a point or something like that   I think it has begun to pick up just slightly; and I would look for it to pick up somewhat more as we get into--   $300 million, I think, becomes slightly less constraining   About $70 million, I think, is the last-- "
2993,1986-05-20," I could add to that As Sam said, they are certainly [active]; in this last bond auction they took roughly of a $9 billion auction The interest does tend to be a little sporadic and one gets the impression in talking to people in the market that sometimes it's waning or sometimes waxing stronger We have talked to some of the Japanese firms about it and we get the impression that there is more time and effort put into diversifying out of government securities into other dollar securities and into investments in the securities of other countries, but with some interest continuing in the dollar and in US government securities   [Statement--see Appendix]   I think there has been some move to capture profits on some longer-term investments and to move somewhat shorter in the yield curve I think they're staying invested, though--   --especially given fairly weak loan demand And that also would be characteristic   Well, they have been taking their lumps recently as market prices have moved down There are some loss situations around--nothing super heavy among the bank dealers that I'm familiar with, but there are some adverse experiences   If I may take a minute on that, Mr Chairman The domestic account management has been submitting weekly reports to the Committee since 1922, describing the week's open market operations and the market background against which they were undertaken While not best-sellers, they have provided a useful current review and an important historical resource when researching past developments Since going to the two-week reserve maintenance period a couple of years ago, it has occurred to us that a two-week reporting period would also make more sense This would provide a more meaningful time interval on which to report how we've gone about meeting the Committee's reserve objectives which are set, of course, on a two-week time frame Moreover, preparation of the report every second week should permit better use of staff resources to work on other assignments and possibly achieve staff savings But I don't want to dangle any hopes on this score, Mr Chairman Committee members will continue to get daily reports on actual Desk operations and market developments and also a brief summary report sent out before each Committee meeting "
3043,1986-08-19," [Statement--see Appendix]   Thank you You said some of what I would say in your introduction but the question naturally arises as to why this is on the agenda The chief reason is that on some recent occasions when Desk operations were undertaken or contemplated basic  -12-    8/19/86  questions were raised, as you mentioned, as to the need for or the desirability of those operations In any event, it's probably a good idea to take a fresh look at subjects like this from time to time [Statement--see Appendix]   So far this year we have not   Well, as the Chairman mentioned, he has a discouraging word now and then Typically, we have done it in periods of heavy reserve need--once in the spring, usually Going back to something you said earlier, Mr Chairman, I don't think the times are arbitrary It has been done when there is a big reserve need, usually in April or sometimes in that heavy seasonal need around the year-end period I guess the last time was actually early December '85   Yes, at the auctions--   At the auction we would only roll over the maturing amount As I mentioned, a few years ago at an auction-- particularly these big quarterly refundings, where there would be an option of going into any of three issues--we were dividing our holdings in about the proportion that the Treasury offered them to the public But that was tending to lengthen our portfolio because the Treasury was putting its emphasis on offering more longer-term debt In recent years we've tended to slant the mix more toward the shorter- term options, and in the last year we've tended to move even further in that direction of slanting our rollovers toward the shorter-term options   Well, we buy depending on what's offered to us There will be more offerings of the actively traded issues, but    8/19/86  sometimes there will be an attractive offering of some less actively traded ones And I think that probably tends to improve the market in some of those less active issues   I think it often works that way, yes   We sold some short-maturity agency issues a few years back I don't think we've ever sold coupon issues   I think we want to be prepared In 1984 when Continental was borrowing massively, we had to lighten the portfolio by several billions of dollars over a short period of time, and it was very useful to have ample supplies of Treasury bills to be able to do that   We have some $95 billion or so of bills now   We have not I think it's a good question-- whether we shouldn't develop that potential   Well, there's a lot to be said for being able to develop some flexibility to sell coupon issues as well as bills   Rates were shooting up then   You can run them off too   Well, probably some educational effort and starting out with shorter maturities We did a little conditioning like that before we sold some short agency issues And that was taken reasonably well Of course, there are really not all that many occasions when we sell bills The potential is there, but I think we've gone over a year now without selling a bill The long-term trend is up   On the selling of coupons, or--?   Sometimes they will bring up the matter, saying ""You haven't been around recently to buy coupon issues,"" or something of that fashion I have not raised it   There are a lot of coupons due within a year that mature every month or every--   I think we pretty generally have rolled over coupon issues It would be a complicated thing to work out In the case of bills, Mr Chairman, if we run some off--which is a reasonably common occurrence--then the Treasury automatically announces that they're selling X billion so that the market will pick up more But when they announce their coupon offering, what they offer to the Fed is separate from what they offer to the public If we ran some off it would, at least under current procedures, hit them as a cash loss   I could provide that, certainly   Yes   I think the Chairman had reservations about dealing in this market   And there may have been times when we would pass a period just because at the time we had the reserve need the market was under this or that special influence that we didn't want to be in the-- "
3070,1986-09-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, under the system of contemporaneous reserve accounting we depend on reports and revisions during the reserve maintenance period And sometimes we get sizable revisions If there is a revision midway through the period we can cope with that fairly well, but we are vulnerable to hearing something as late as the last day And we can even get a report after the period is over that requirements were materially different from what we thought they were on the last day we had an opportunity to operate I wouldn't say that a revision of this size on the last day is typical but it's not unheard of to get a pretty big revision very late in the period   Well, I think we're getting some changes even in the M1-type   Only the M1-types of deposits--   Very close to $100 billion    9/23/86   Right   Yes   I think the liquidity is very ample now I don't know if I'd draw that [conclusion] just from the comparison that you made, but there has been ample liquidity And it seems to me that liquidity has grown, even, with the policy of recent years But we have done a moderate proportion of our long-term provision [of reserves] with occasional purchasing of coupon issues   Twelve   They would not be bothered by our leaning more toward the short-term option   I wouldn't see any significant announcement effect from leaning toward the shorter options I don't think [unintelligible]  SPEAKER(?) No, no From buying smaller amounts?   I don't know how much ""smaller"" would be--   In typical trips to the market recently it has been something like $1 billion or $1-1/2 billion, in that kind of range We only did $4 or $5 billion [unintelligible] We could certainly buy a couple of billion   I might point out that sometimes in those periods of strain, we feel constraints--that we should not get in the market because we don't want to be seen as interfering with the market's own adjustment process   Yes, that's [unintelligible] in the market   As to how short we would be, I don't know On this last quarterly rollover when the Treasury was offering roughly equal amounts of 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year issues, we did about 2/3 in the short option and correspondingly small amounts in the two longer options I think leaving those longer options still smaller but keeping some minimal contact with the--   Well, having some small holding of them can be useful in our lending securities program I wouldn't make a whole lot of that, but after Drysdale it was useful to have securities that we could lend just to help sort out delivery problems in the markets   I think the proportion of bills will continue to creep up   I think it will continue to creep up, continuing what we are doing   Yes, the coupon holdings would tend to shorten on this rollover--   [You mean] a couple of coupon purchases   I understood the consensus to be to continue what we've been doing   By not taking as much of the long options   Right "
3095,1986-11-05," [Statement--see Appendix]    11/5/86   We were steadily moving up our allowance for excess reserves We had moved the standard allowance up to $900 million in the first few months of this year Since about March or April we have tended to fall a trifle shy of that $900 million level And now we think that maybe the demand was augmented somewhat in the early months of this year by some seasonal factors So, I'm not convinced of any basic decline in the demand for excess reserves I think it has probably leveled off and what we are seeing now is just a little resistance for seasonal reasons We will have to be watching carefully as we get toward the winter months again to see whether we need to review that and go back to something like the $900 million level "
3118,1986-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I heard more about them coming into the market after that Baker/Miyazawa agreement that Sam referred to I am not aware of any great shift in the maturity area They certainly have been interested in the intermediate and longer end and I guess if anything there perhaps has been a little renewal of interest in the longer end Early in the year they were in the long end, and then were more in the intermediate area, and have shifted back somewhat to the long end, or a mixture of different areas anyway now   Well, I think there was probably a mix of views at the time as to how much improvement we would get   From the very start, CRR meant that we had to live with ongoing revisions of required reserves as we went through a reserve period That's been something we have had to cope with "
3142,1987-02-10," If I could add to that There was a lot of focus in our bond market on what the weak dollar might mean to foreign interest, especially Japanese interest, in the current Treasury refunding That turned out finally, after some backup in rates as the auction approached, to be pretty good interest  A footnote to that, though, is that with these firms becoming more internationalized not every thing they take is necessarily for resale back in Japan; but, certainly, the great bulk of it is    2/10-11/87   Certainly, we hear those same comments on diversification that Sam referred to either into the stock market or from Treasury issues into other securities such as Ginny Mae's or corporate issues--even some of the higher-yield corporate issues   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I think it can have a lasting effect I would hate to say that anything is permanent, given the changeability of things I wouldn't be totally astounded if the funds rate drifted back to something under 6 percent Maybe that would come about as seasonal borrowings picked up more But, at least barring some new factor right now, as I said, I tend to think more of a funds rate in the 6 percent area in association with $300 million of borrowing   In more normal times the revisions don't occur with such speed So, one can fold in the new revisions in an orderly way and they wouldn't have the impact that they had in that December period   Yes   There has been a little of that A lot of it came in the wake of the oil price [moves] by OPEC and the other countries lining up with OPEC in the last couple of months Then the dollar weakening also fed those views that there was more to be concerned about prospectively on inflation I wouldn't say it was a very major factor but it was there   My impression is that it would be both of those factors There was some abatement of the supply of tax exempts and, as you stated, there are fewer alternatives for sheltering income   Well, it depends upon your standard of measurement Measured by the borrowing target that we are aiming at, it has been unchanged But I have to admit that a somewhat higher level has emerged, even screening out the super high levels around the year-end   To October for 5-7/8 percent "
3166,1987-03-31," [Statement--see Appendix]   I think that's part of the add need ahead It makes very good sense to buy coupons for some portion of that   Well, we have been talking about it and I think as we work out this need, which runs to several billions of dollars, there is room for bills and coupons as part of the--   Well, if it got to 8 percent as a long- standing matter that would obviously be a concern; even 7 percent, I think, would cause one to sit up and take some considerable notice We are getting a high rate today just because it's the quarter-end The very early report I saw had today's funds rate opening at 6-3/4 percent That was a surprise To see it getting up to 7 percent or higher on this day--   On a lasting basis, I'd feel concern about rates that were considerably over 6 percent, given the current set of expectations and the current kind of borrowing need that we have in our reserve paths   Borrowings came in just close to the $300 million, and in this current reserve period they're running around $250 million, which is consistent with the recent period   There is a big seasonal add need, mostly from currency and partly from required [reserves] We are adding to it somewhat by the foreign exchange intervention that [has occurred]-- several hundred million a day at the recent pace But for this current reserve period, at least on the numbers we were looking at yesterday, there is roughly a $3 billion need to meet in the remainder of this period, and we are just about halfway through; and then there is about a $5 or $6 billion need in the subsequent reserve period and slightly more than that in the period beyond that These estimates are cumulative; there are some additional needs beyond the $3 billion, which accumulate to about $5 or $6 billion in the next period and to $6 or $7 billion in the period beyond that   Well, our basic stance has been to meet the needs, following the directive to the extent that there is some day- to-day discretion about the pattern of reserve needs as they unfold We try to implement in a cautious manner, [and be aware of] anything that could be helpful or avoid exacerbating the international situation I don't think it makes a tremendous difference; it's more at the margin  -10-    3/31/87   It came down to the 6-1/4 percent area after having been as high as 6-3/4 percent So it wasn't working out-- "
3177,1987-04-29," I think both things that have happened on the reserve supply could be well be related to the tax situation, particularly the individual taxes that have been coming in very heavily right about April 15th And since it takes a while to process those, particularly the individual payments, we've been getting much, much higher Treasury balances than had been expected At the same time, I think individuals must have built up their transaction accounts to be able to make those payments So, we've got a very large indicated increase in the April 20th week And we're just finding out in the last day or two that where a sharp rundown had been assumed in the following week, we're not getting much indication of that rundown So, it's giving us much higher required reserves In just the last three days we've had to move up the path based on required reserves by something like $1-1/4 billion At that same time, our estimates day-to-day of the Treasury's balances at the Federal Reserve rose because those balances pretty much filled up the capacity at the tax and loan accounts at the commercial banks The estimated balances at the Federal Reserve have risen by several billion dollars We are trying very hard to fill that reserve need while at the same time keeping in mind the desirability of not losing a little of the advantage we got a few days ago in the market by deliberately hanging back in what we thought then were fairly moderate reserve needs With all of that, borrowing thus far in this period is not badly out of line; it's averaging just a little over $400 million right now for this current reserve period The funds rate is averaging something like 644 percent, although over the last couple of days it has been more in the 6-5/8 to 6-3/4 percent area But, as the Chairman said, in the last couple of days the market has gotten a sense--it's not 100 percent sure--that there has been some snugging or deliberate lessening on the Desk's part of its generosity in providing reserves   We had been using $300 million up to this point, but I'd say in the last day or two we've really been behaving more as though it was a shade higher And my understanding is that we're prepared to use something a little higher now--I assume $400 million   I think there is such a mixture of expectations out there that it's very hard to sort all of this out Just taken by itself--if there weren't that expectational element of something possibly lurking on the discount rate--we might be having a funds rate of 6-1/4 to 6-1/2 percent or something like that, maybe just 6-1/4 percent As it is, it has been more like 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent in recent days And that's kind of what I would have expected to see ahead, even without a discount rate increase If that were to happen as well, then I think we'd see the rate somewhat higher--not higher by the full amount of any discount rate increase, because I think something already has been allowed for in the market   I think it has a lot to do with that, Governor Johnson As you say, the Treasury has been paying down bills since early this year There really just has been a technical shortage of bills at the same time that there has been some extra    4/29/87  demand in the market because of some of those proceeds of foreign exchange intervention, either by those countries who intervened by themselves in the market or, in some cases, executed transactions over our Desk We have been a bit of a counterbalance to that because some that we normally would have done for System account reserve provision purposes might well have gone in the bill market We did more than usual in the coupon market; we've been there three times in the last four weeks for a total of something like a little over $6 billion  SPEAKER(?) In coupons?   In coupons, yes sir   They'll be announcing their refunding today   Well, they'll announce it later   I think the market doesn't really expect much of a change on that score   Pretty much a carbon copy of what was done in February, notwithstanding the question about whether foreign participation would be there in the same degree as before   It must be around 3/4ths to 7/8ths; I don't know Since last October, you say?   Yes "
3199,1987-05-19," [Statement--see Appendix]   It has been very hard day-to-day to predict what that spread is likely to be We have such a mixture of expectational elements still in there The high Treasury balance has receded as an operational factor; it's not entirely gone, but it has receded some I think the fairly substantial anticipation that something may well happen on the discount rate--and that we are not    5/19/87  too unhappy with funds in a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent or even 6-7/8 percent range--contributes to the funds rate staying up there, even though in some pure theory sense, going back to earlier model relationships of what funds rate we'd expect with $400 million of borrowing, I would come out with something considerably lower than the recently prevailing rates I would agree with what the Bluebook suggests of a tendency for the rate to drift back to, or below, the 6- 1/2 percent level One could even make a case for something like 6- 1/4 percent on the funds rate with planned borrowings holding at $400 million   If the funds rate drifted back to that, I think that would be cause for renewed pressure on the dollar, yes Sam might want to comment on that, too   Yes Most people I've heard comment on it would be thinking in the $500 to $600 million range for borrowing, though I've heard some talk about $400 to $600 million, and I've heard one who thought it was above $600 million But most would put it in the $500 to $600 million range   Well, yes But, certainly, the period when it was $11 billion they realized was extraordinary and unusual; and the period just before that, when it was nearly $700 million, they tended to think was on the higher-than-intended side as well   Federal funds are about 6-3/4 percent Borrowing was about $600 million yesterday, so it is averaging a little over $500 million We are well over our reserve paths for right now, at $600 million or so, and we plan to just let that work its way into the money market If those estimates are right, things ought to ease off considerably We ought to lose a bunch of the remaining repurchase agreements that are on, although so far that is happening quite slowly   As the reserve period draws to a close tomorrow, if the numbers that we are looking at stand up, there ought to be a big easing at the end of this reserve period   What troubles me a little is that there is still this kind of overlay of expectation of a discount rate move I wonder, even if action were delayed on that, if we would immediately,  -40-    5/19/87  or starting next reserve period, put in $600 million and still look for a discount rate in addition whether that wouldn't give a little more than--   --what people are looking for That would suggest, one would think, maybe $500 million or something as an in- between, to keep options open   They think we are putting in $600 million now "
3224,1987-07-07," [Statement--see Appendix]   It seems to me that it is the nature of the Bluebook discussion to bring that kind of shift to the Committee's attention in a normal way before it's in the--    7/7/87   Governor Angell put his finger on it in saying that you need to ask if it is more like the adjustment credit or more like something that we want to compensate for totally, like the extended credit I think it has some elements of both, and probably is closer to the adjustment credit   Yes, possibly "
3249,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   At times, there certainly did seem to be an abatement in their interest in the debt market; as for the equity market, we are continuing to hear that they are pretty active And they have certainly continued to participate in Treasury auctions; in this last auction they were there in the 10- and 30-year issues As for purchases in the secondary markets, at times over the period we were hearing of some pulling away from buying in our market as their own rates were pushing higher   Well, Sam Cross or Ted Truman might be in a better position to comment At least as it was passed along to me, I got a sense that it was a bit more of the policy move type of thing   We are anticipating a sizable buildup I wouldn't say it's an unmeetable problem at this stage I don't think we'll approach the record levels that we had last April when their total balance got up to $54 billion or so, and the balance at the Fed    8/18/87 -4-  was $30 billion I think their total balance could get up to the $40- 50 billion range and that could put the balance at the Fed somewhere at $25 billion, or something like that It could be a substantial reserve-draining factor   Well, I considered that But for almost any number I would pick, Governor, I could imagine circumstances that would take it a little beyond that So, I'm picking what I think might well do it, but I just want to put the Committee on notice that it could conceivably come in beyond that If I presented $12 billion, I'd like to feel more confidence than I can feel at this stage of [unintelligible]   I wouldn't see it as a danger I think it may just be that the Committee would want to keep close to the situation and realize that if some even larger increase were needed, you'd like to be informed in some formal manner and have a chance to note that   As best our projections look   I was shrinking from that, Mr Chairman, because I just did not have that degree of confidence, but I'll stick my neck out at $12 billion   It does get published and people will look at it and say ""Gosh, did they really think it was going to go that high?""   There has never been any difficulty in getting the authority as we needed it, if a situation arose "
3273,1987-09-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I wouldn't be surprised if there were some kind of a spike I don't know what the average would work out to be We'll be seeking to put in reserves, so that if our estimates are close and our estimates of the demand for excess are close, the average will come out around the $600 million level There is always an element of uncertainty as to just how far a spike takes you But I think there is a lot of realization in the market that this is a very difficult period for reserve management   I think if you measure it just from the time the discount rate moved, there would be some flattening The short rates came up more than long rates I think if you looked at the    9/22/87  whole intermeeting period, it is about similar at the short and long end of--   I am not sure what to say I wouldn't say that there was a very widespread expectation; there was some expectation of the move, and there were even some people who were thinking in terms of a larger move And, initially, there were some who expressed disappointment that it wasn't larger, although I would have to think that a small, vocal, minority was expressing that view I suppose there is a sense in which [your observation] is true; people who recognized that the dollar had been under pressure and was likely to be continuing under pressure have come to expect that our rate structure and our policy formulation process will be under that kind of pressure So there was that element of resignation to the process   Not in any imminent sense, but I think there is an expectation that the dollar is going to remain under pressure, given that we have this awful trade balance picture; and that would be the kind of atmosphere under which there would have to be further policy response   It would take some bulge in borrowing to get up to the $600 million [average] I don't have yesterday's figure yet, but borrowing had been averaging $460 million through Sunday So there would have to be some bulge, probably, on the final day And as I said, if you ask the people who follow these things closely, most of them would probably think of us as using $500 million, although some would say a range of $500 to $600 million If they saw a number like $600 million coming out, some of them might regard that as indicative of a little firmer aim than they had estimated earlier On the other hand, they also were aware that it was very tough to manage reserves in this period So, I don't know that they are going to jump    9/22/87  immediately to any very strong conclusion if the borrowing comes out at $650 million, or something like that   Just because of the juxtaposition vis-a-vis the Committee meeting date, possibly more [than a few]; but I think more of them would just tie it to knowing that Wednesday is the settlement date of the reserve period   Well, the concern is very much tied to the dollar And when concern about the dollar [is high], the market is more concerned with what would tend to happen with respect to inflation The market has been reasonably well impressed with the actual price index numbers that have come along in the recent period But they do worry that, in the course of redressing the trade deficit, we are going to be imposing more demands on our resources--that there may well have to be further adjustment in the value of the dollar and that that will do things to import prices, and so on   Well, I think that even with the trade picture, it is partly domestic pressure because, as you are redressing that trade imbalance, you'll be putting more pressure on domestic resources   I would expect a modest firming My guess is that you would get funds rates averaging in the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent area I think we are averaging 715 or 720 percent so far this period    9/22/87   I have not really heard discussion of that particular factor However, while people are well pleased with the deficit coming out this fiscal year at $160 billion, or somewhat under, there is deep concern that without the Congress getting something together on fiscal restraint, it will be heading up by $20 billion or more next year   I haven't been very good "
3281,1987-10-20," Mr Chairman, I'd like to think that there's a particular element of flexibility here because I suspect there may be some greater reluctance by banks to borrow in this kind of-- "
3304,1987-11-03," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, in fact, we upped that a little further yesterday, President Melzer, to $15 billion based on what we were seeing from actual holdings of excess by some of the smaller institutions that already had a lot, and because some of the major institutions had built up such a lot of excess that we didn't think they could get rid of it all and still have some positive balance on the day That's relevant to this current reserve period; we will be looking again at the next reserve period I have no reason to think that we would be thinking in such high terms for the next reserve period, but we'll have to evaluate it as we get into it   I think it's a bit of an on-and-off thing now It certainly is not the overwhelming presence and the tick-for- tick linkage that was there early in the year, although on some recent days the bond market has weakened in response to the dollar weakening But, as I mentioned, I thought one reason for that linkage having been muted recently was that [market participants] saw the earlier weakening of the dollar as likely to be followed very rapidly by some tightening of monetary policy, whereas in the current context, they don't see that as following on so quickly There is still concern, though, that a weaker dollar is a discouraging factor either to new inflows of foreign capital into our market or perhaps a reason for foreigners with existing holdings in our market to want to pull out So there does remain some sensitivity, but I think it's less   I have some impression of some of those tensions abating, some subsiding of the flight to quality Somebody was saying a couple of days ago that the flight to quality has landed; I think that is probably going too far But I think there is some backing away from that Nevertheless, I think it remains a basically sensitive picture I just had a report a few minutes ago indicating a further stock price decline today It was down 40 some points in the opening half hour or so   I think it's terribly hard to say My sense would be, as you say President Parry, that there has been some reluctance to borrow; but it's very, very difficult to come up with even the rough and ready kinds of pronouncements that we have tried to make in the past about a relationship between borrowing and expected funds rates   Well, I think there has to be a lot of flexibility in anything we try to--   I guess it would depend partly on whether it was perceived that what was happening was occurring for some deliberate reason on our part or despite what we were doing The interpretation of it would depend on how our role was seen in the whole thing A good many people would say that's in the range of their expectation, I suppose If I had to pinpoint an expected range now, narrowly, it might be 7 percent or a shade under; but I don't think 7 or 7-1/8 percent cropping up occasionally would be terribly disturbing in that context, either   Yes, that has been the past standard    11/3/87   They certify that they are not borrowing to facilitate a short sale   In mid-October, the beginning of that period, the outlook was that we had a reserve need for what is now the current period but that in the following period there would be only a modest reserve need So, if we had done a lot of outright buying then we would have had a concern that we would come up to an overabundance of reserves and it could be awkward, as these are not the kinds of markets where we would want to try to be going in and draining reserves As the period went along, we kept getting revisions of the out periods, so it looked as though we would have a more long-term need If one had it to do over again, it might have made sense to have done some purchases outright I don't think our broad purposes of providing liquidity were ill-served by concentrating on repurchase agreements, though This gave us a chance to have a rather continual presence and to be providing relief to what was potentially one of the very sore points in the system, the ability to get day-to-day financing So I don't think that part of it worked out too badly   Yes, Mr Chairman, I have a leeway request Current projections suggest a somewhat enlarged need for outright purchases in the upcoming intermeeting period Normal seasonal needs for currency and increased required reserves could be enlarged even further if current financial market tensions persist While we may want to leave a sizable margin of needs to be met with repurchase agreements, it would also be useful to have the flexibility for substantial outright activity I recommend a $3 billion temporary increase in the normal $6 billion leeway, although we may not need very much of the enlarged amount   No, I think that would make my point; I regard that kind of thing as within the flexibility that is stated in the directive "
3329,1987-12-15," I have very little to add to either what was in the memorandum or what Don has just outlined Maybe the one point is that, as Don just mentioned in his comments, the market is fairly well aware of this current emphasis on the funds rate in the implementation of policy, with greater weight placed on day-to-day funds rates From comments that I hear, the market seems to be fairly understanding of it Some of the people I regard as more thoughtful observers in the market would be troubled, I think, if they thought there was a long-term reversion to something that could be called ""pegging of the funds rate"" That's exaggerated, but I think that's what it would tend to become to be known as That carries with it the baggage of a past association with periods of what many regarded as inadequate policy responses in times of excessive money growth I don't think that argues that one has to go back immediately to what was being done--particularly since in the very near term, we will have all the uncertainties associated with the year-end period--but it is something to keep in mind as we look a little further at it   Well, I think the market has calmed down considerably from the extremely turbulent and nervous state of late October I would hesitate to say it's totally back to normal I think there is still some background nervousness and we are getting into a period when there's a lot of uncertainty anyway, just because of the possibility of pressures associated with the year-end   Borrowing has been very light, and we have scratched our heads about what the reasons for that might be We do hear some comments to the effect that some banks are saving their recourse to the discount window, perhaps anticipating pressures around year-end There may be some who just want to take extra pains to avoid the window because they are concerned that their own credit ratings could be coming under some review, and they just don't want to subject themselves to any additional attention that might come from using the window Seasonal borrowing is just about at its low point I know it doesn't stand up all that well in the correlations, but I still think that some--   You can get a good deal of variation even when you're following a borrowings target more closely, just because one incident can bring banks in for some special reason and you have to make allowance for that Even on a borrowings target, I have often had to report to the Committee that borrowing was considerably higher for this or that particular reason But--    12/15-16/87   These last few weeks borrowing has diverged from what we would have predicted based on experience, looking back a few quarters   The particular comment that I heard related to just that four-day period beginning the 31st   That could be   Yes   I don't think so   Much of it got into extended credit   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] I also have a leeway recommendation, Mr Chairman   I think that at the short end that probably is true and that a further factor is the Treasury debt management, which has been continuing to shrink the supply of bills very slightly recently But that [unintelligible] also   The quality concerns have been the more major factor there, I would judge  MRBOEHNE Looking ahead to year-end, how do you go about dealing with a period like this operationally? We expect much more funds rate volatility; how do you proceed operationally through this period that we have coming up?   Well, it could take a certain amount of feeling our way as we go along, because every one of these periods is kind of unique unto itself But just the way the calendar works, this time is particularly unusual We have a maintenance period that ends December 30 and another that begins December 31 How much of the normal year-end pressures might work into that December 30 period right now is a big question mark in my mind I think we just have to get a sense of it as we go along through that period I'm sure there will be some particular pressure that is left for that December 31 date That Thursday begins a long weekend Right now our reserve estimates do not show a very large reserve need coming up to that period, partly because some of the weakness of money has brought down expected required reserve levels We probably will have to make some allowance--maybe in the December 30 period and almost certainly in the next period that begins December 31--for additional demands for excess reserves I think we will get clues from the money market itself as to how to respond as we go along   Well, I think it's appropriate to begin thinking about it, and letting it work if it didn't cause too great a swing in money rates I would want to be a bit leery about it through the year-end period, and maybe just let a little show through--   I think that's right   [Statement--see Appendix]   Just a footnote on Don's comment If it turns out that a number of banks borrow on December 31, on that long weekend, that could throw the borrowing number for that particular period into-- "
3340,1988-01-05," Well, we hear about continuing operational problems, and they may be having their further effects today I think we will work our way past them and I'd expect to see funds coming back down to roughly the area they were in the last few full reserve periods   About the 6-3/4, 6-7/8ths area, yes   Well, borrowing is clearly going to average very high, as I say--   In the $300 million area It would average $13 or $14 billion in this period   We use $300 million in the path   As I say, mathematically, if it dropped down to the $300 million area for the rest of the period, it would still come out $13 or $14 billion for the period, on average, because it averages now over $3 billion for the first, whatever it is, 5 days "
3364,1988-02-09," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, on this occasion, there were discussions that I had with the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the  -45-    2/9-10/88  Board And there's a kind of continuing dialogue I have with Mr Kohn or whoever is sitting in his chair--he happened to be away during some of the time we were having these discussions But it came out of discussions and communications between our domestic Desk and the Chairman, essentially   I said we were getting away from that great sensitivity and moving toward the borrowing objective, as January proceeded   I think that there had to be some moving back from that approach when we were putting in place this slightly easier stance, just to put across the fact that that modification of the stance was occurring   Well, as I mentioned, in this period when we needed to drain--which was also coming when we were putting in place this slightly more accommodative stance--we proceeded in what I call a gingerly manner, sometimes deferring for a day or so the actual draining operations, waiting to see more evidence of the availability of the reserves that we thought were there before going in to mop them up   The procedures for the commentary on--   There was a big range of trading yesterday And in the morning yesterday we did go in and drain a lot of reserves; we took out $5 billion   Right It was late in the period   Right Funds softened afterwards and they got as low as 1 percent late in the day yesterday I don't yet have the effective rate but I think it was around 6 percent I didn't see any reference to wire problems   Maybe I just didn't see it Today funds are again around 6 percent or a shade under We're going to be draining some additional reserves For one thing, it has been very hard to evaluate the demand for excess reserves, which we think is high in this period, although we're not sure from day-to-day just how high Also, we are getting daily revisions in the amount of required reserves It has just been a difficult period to operate in But I readily acknowledge that we projected a draining job but were hesitant in meeting it because we wanted to let some of that softening show through But, wanting something to show through, you always run the risk that more shows than you want to have show I don't see any way to avoid it; there are some risks on both sides of that coin   Well, the borrowing has been about $150 million in the last two weeks and in the previous reserve period it was $175 million, I guess But with the $150 million some [unintelligible] were weak "
3388,1988-03-29," [Statement--see Appendix]   It could be something like that On the attitude toward borrowing, I think that one reason why a big difference didn't show up is that those attitudes were already kind of cautious Also, there had been a lot of borrowing; there was about one billion dollars of adjustment credit ongoing so that there was a lot of room for those cautious attitudes to show up But you're right--there was a much more noticeable widening of spreads of bank [unintelligible] and Treasury securities We've seen rather little of that [this time], and I think that probably does reflect just learning to live with that kind of situation   I would have a little sense of that, yes And I know that it doesn't show up in all the [unintelligible] that are done But it does seem to me that, particularly given these low levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowings, that is a bit of a factor   The only thing that I would do is underscore the point Don made with respect to fed funds compared to borrowing I    3/29/88  think that they are not so much contrasting positions, but points on a continuum I think of ourselves now as pretty much back to so-called ""normal"", but remembering that ""normal"" does involve close awareness of what's happening with the funds rate It did before mid-October of last year, and it does now   I don't think there was anything abrupt that happened in 1972 We were getting into closer and closer federal funds targeting that ended rather abruptly in 1979   Well, I think there was a reluctance to make the moves in the federal funds rate that, in retrospect anyway, would have been a little more appropriate   I'd regard that as an aspect of the procedure that lent itself to that constraint   It reflects what was put in the path "
3411,1988-05-17, And the maintain would only be initially 
3434,1988-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I think it did make a difference, President Boehne I think that's how it was able to unfold that in undertaking a change in the borrowing which we thought would be associated with a 7-1/4 percent funds rate, it got us to something more like 7-3/8 percent, or even 7-1/2 percent with the addition of some seasonal pressures here I've heard a number of times the commentary back from the market that they perceive us as operating now very much more on reserve numbers and not as much on the funds rate So, I wouldn't share your evaluation of recent weeks   Well, that gave us a little pause, too We quizzed them quite a bit about that because we look for lasting commitment But I think they're quite different markets It was pretty obvious from the word go that the primary dealer group in the London gilt market was overpopulated and that firm along with several others did choose to opt out of that market We thought they made a plausible case to us about the difference in conditions in the two markets And they have performed satisfactorily, in our judgment, in the US securities market   Right   We were hearing that Governor Johnson The [long] bond has declined in price today on reports that maybe that proposal would be put into this technical bill on adjusting the tax measure From my conversations with people at Treasury, my impression is that they would not be at all surprised to see the additional bond authority put into that bill, but they have rather little expectation that it will work its way through the legislative process in time for the August refunding   Maybe a week or so back there seemed to be sporadic comment of that nature I would say there is not all that much of it right now; I would say it is not a widespread expectation at this point   Well, I think if we're keeping the borrowing level about the same, there would be a tendency to have virtually the whole of it pass through--   To the funds rate   We did get that big upward revision in the path a day or two ago   I think to the extent that where it is now is largely a function of these quarter-end pressures, I would think it would be very close to that anyway--shade an eighth off maybe--   I think there was that concern that as a longer--   I think as a longer-term matter our judgment then was that staying with the $500 million could tend to push the funds rate back down Then the question was whether that was really appropriate in light of the kind of directive that had come out of the May meeting But I think it kind of got overwhelmed by these seasonal pressures as the month went on   They seemed so to me, yes   This is on the statement date today; it was 8 percent earlier today   Today is the quarter-end statement date Funds were trading earlier in an 8 percent area, even a little higher We did some early repurchase agreements and the funds rate came down below the 8 percent level the last I heard It is still pretty high   Well, yesterday   When we get past the quarter-end pressures, I would expect that, certainly   I think it's terribly hard to say, Governor Johnson When the Committee had its conference call on June 22, we were looking at funds rates that had come up to 7-3/8 to 7-1/2 percent; and we thought then that putting in place a $550 million would tend to validate and accept that Over the final week of the month, we've gotten higher funds rates with these quarter-end pressures In the period that ended yesterday, we ended up with borrowing at $520 million we never did get even the modest bulge that we thought we'd get on the final day And I guess the funds rate averaged about 757 or 758 percent for the 2 weeks--I don't know, I don't have the statement  -59-    6/29-30/88   My guess would be that as these quarter-end pressures fade, the funds rate will get back toward something like what we looked at in mid-June--if we stayed at $550 million that we'd get back to 7-1/2 percent or a shade under So I feel comfortable saying that with $600 million it'd likely be around 7-1/2 percent, but I couldn't argue strongly that it would not be 7-1/2 percent or a shade over also "
3500,1988-09-20," Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement-- see Appendix] "
3543,1988-11-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think it's a question of excluding any particular firms from a particular country that meet our criteria I think the political concerns that arose probably sharpened our sensitivity to the issue, but I think speaking from my own view of it anyway I do have a concern at least about the rapidity of the growth in representation from some particular corners of the globe   Just because I have a concern about the relatively aggressive pace of entry, and this is a way of slowing down that relatively aggressive pace of entry from a particular foreign sector in my mind  -22-    11/1/88   Well, that may have a very similar impact   Right now we have 46 on the list including a couple that would be just on the edge of 1 percent But they meet it, and over the past few years there has tended to be some giving of ground by firms that had the biggest share Theoretically, you could have 99 firms doing 1 percent It won't work that way, but it might work out that it would be very hard to get over 1 percent  -23-    11/1/88   Yes  SPEAKER(?) What's the biggest share?   I guess about 8 or 9 percent "
3555,1988-11-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman Can you hear me all right?   [Mr Sternlight reported on recent open market operations His remarks were not transcribed]   Yes, although it has been a little hard to hear all of your words, Mr Chairman; it does fade in and out But I agree if you're saying that we have not been publishing $600 million borrowing numbers The market tends to think that we've either set a lower number--in fact, I read a market letter last evening that was guessing that we had moved to $400 million--or most people think we have just given some more elbow room in our reserve objective endeavors, sensing that there's been this greater reluctance to borrow So, I don't think they'll get a sense of easing; I think if anything under what you outlined--that we would tend to be more accepting of funds around 8-3/8, which I take could be on either side of 8-3/8--they may feel that there's been a very, very slight firming   I would agree with Don on that "
3580,1988-12-13," [Statement--see Appendix]    12/13-14/88   Well, I think there was a realization as we went through November that we must have made some allowance for what the market also perceived as a change in the relationship between federal funds and borrowings In fact, on the very day the Committee was having that conference call--November 22--I happened to read one of the market letters, and the writer assumed that we were probably using something like $400 million rather than $600 million, so that particular analyst happened to hit it right on the head The further source of confusion or uncertainty was the spikes in borrowing from some of these technical problems The market has an idea that those have been a factor I don't think they know the precise dimensions of it, but they generally have become aware of the problems in the wire mechanisms and in fact are aware that a particular bank was unable to move its funds out, and the ones who were supposed to get funds know very well that there were problems and hangups from that   Well, we generally speak of an expectation of a funds rate that would prevail given a certain level of borrowing And I think right along we've felt that there is some degree of flexibility of--oh, I don't know--at least 1/8th percentage point on either side of whatever is the central point And certainly for a given day it's even more room than that It's more the persistent deviations that would be a problem As the deviations build up to be greater than 1/8th or 1/4th percentage point and more persistent, then I think it creates the kind of problem that led to the discussion held on November 22 where it was felt that maybe a discrete adjustment of the borrowing level was in order I don't know if I have the precise formula It is something that's talked about daily and in discussions that people at the Desk would have with Don {Kohn] and his associates   Well, we came through periods in this recent intermeeting interval where the deviations got to be sufficient so that the concern about the funds rate moving too far did become a constraint I think I can say that in the period just since the November conference call, there was a fair amount of flexibility given to letting the funds rate move We started out saying at that November call that we expected funds to be around 8-3/8 percent, and it seems to me it was largely market expectations that brought the rate up to 8-1/2 and 8-5/8 percent on a number of days We were putting in reserves at that time, but we were doing it mainly with an eye to the reserve needs and not with such extraordinary intensity that getting funds back down to 8-3/8 percent was an overriding    12/13-14/88  objective I think we were allowing some flexibility in the funds rate that emerged in that period in the context of the information that had come along in the market and given the asymmetric directive and all   I think the market expects that probably we'll be exercising more restraint over the near term Many people would expect to see by year-end, [unintelligible] or maybe going into early next year, that funds would push higher, that there would be additional restraint exercised against the strength of the economy   Well, I don't know that we were in on both sides in a single day, but certainly we had multiple entries on given days when we were targeting the funds rate  SPEAKER(?) Well, in the same week   I would agree with that I think a discount rate increase had been very imminently expected just after the employment numbers I think it's still kind of expected It does not seem to be that much on the edge of the table as it was maybe a week or so ago in the market   But be aware too that we are coming into the year-end period and seasonal factors could add on something to that first 1/4 "
3605,1989-02-07, [Statement--see Appendix] 
3630,1989-03-28," [Statement--see Appendix]   [That's] borrowing used in the construction of reserve paths, about which we had a good deal of uncertainty I say uncertainty, but I had a fairly strong suspicion that we were overstating or were using a higher level than was consistent with what banks would actually come to the window for, given the range of the funds rate that we were expecting During those first few weeks of this intermeeting period we would make adjustments, particularly if it went well into a reserve maintenance period, for what was turning out to be a lower level of borrowing by $200 or $300 million as this period went along And as that persisted week-after-week the decision was made--we consulted with the staff and the Chairman on it--to make this downward technical adjustment in the level of borrowing used in the path, but we were not expecting that to be accompanied by any change in the range of expected funds rates   No, no   I said indexed because it was indexed to a degree of pressure that we expected to be associated with [a certain] range of federal funds trading It's indexed in that sense   I think they certainly realized that we have had problems with it Periodically I see things suggesting that they think we are getting back more to the use of borrowings but probably    3/28/89  not all the way back to where it was, let's say, prior to the stock market crash--which was the time of the major departure   Sorry Maybe I twisted that around But they think that we are--   Getting back toward use of borrowings   I think we're getting back toward the borrowings but [not] all the way to what we were pre-October '87   Yes   As I understand it, Governor, it was not so much a bad bet on what was going to happen to the general level of rates but rather some sophisticated rate spread movements that they anticipated that just did not pan out as they expected That's not to say I agree--   It's surprising to see as sophisticated a participant as they are coming up on the wrong side on that I will say that in the past couple of years when, in general, the government securities dealers have had a pretty rough time that firm drew on perhaps a more sophisticated view and a better knowledge [of the market] and has fared better than the pack by a fair margin I'm really more concerned about a great number of other dealers who seem really unable to hack it with the current degree of competition in the government securities market   Yes, they did have that big hit from a bad bet on what was going to happen to the shape of the yield curve   No, I think there were many firms that engaged in those strategies, though probably in lesser dollar magnitudes than Salomon Brothers But I don't think it's at all that unusual to the degree--   Further questions for Mr Sternlight? Would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk?   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the upcoming intermeeting period, current projections suggest a maximum reserve need on the order of about $7 or $8 billion The main factors we think will be increased currency in circulation, higher required reserves and, by early May, some rise in Treasury balances at the Fed While some of this can be met with repurchase agreements, which do not count against leeway, I believe it would be prudent to enlarge the standard $6 billion intermeeting leeway temporarily by $2 billion to $8 billion "
3657,1989-05-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   There are 4 major Japanese securities firms that started their own operations in the United States There are 3 other situations of existing firms that had been domestically owned and have been bought by Japanese banks within the past few years So there are 7 in all   I think it has been part, and perhaps the most prominent part, of the whole move toward internationalization, but not the entire thing We have had entrants from other countries as well and some additional new firms who have come in on the US side In the last 7 years we've had an increase in the number of primary dealers, primarily from foreign entrants but not exclusively And I would say that the increased number of dealers, along with some slowdown in aggregate activity and just the way the markets have gone in the past few years, has tended to make it much more difficult to run a profitable operation Last year more than half the dealers showed losses in their government securities operations   Well, there has been concern about that There has been an allegation that officialdom in Japan seems to share information with Japanese firms, whether banks or securities firms The Japanese realize that there is that criticism from the market, and I think they are trying to do things to change what has been their modus operandi They seem to have a philosophy of not wanting the market to be surprised by new statistical reports or policy changes or whatever So they apparently have some tradition of sounding out some market sources and word gets around from this kind of thing That may  -10-    5/16/89  be what you're referring to And it is an issue that causes concern amongst US firms operating in Japan   We had this large need, which in fact turned out to be bigger in the short run than we had thought it was going to be But because of the way some other longer-term factors were operating, the longer-term need did not look as great as we went through the period We kind of geared ourselves to doing through outright purchases approximately what looked like the long-term need-- although we went somewhat beyond that and we're now in the position of having to do a little draining as we come up to this next reserve period I would say we determine the mix on the basis of how we think we and the market can best manage those reserve adjustments We knew we were leaving a lot to be done with repurchase agreements but we've had really good experience in doing heavy amounts of repurchase agreements, particularly if we give the market a few hours advance notice Announcing to the market at 300 pm on a previous afternoon that we're going to look for propositions for repurchase agreements the next morning seems to give us very sizable propositions That has worked well and I think took us, in pretty good shape, through a period like this one with a very heavy, but temporary, reserve need   Thirteen are foreign-owned   Primarily foreign-owned There would be some others with some partial [foreign-owned] shares And 7 out of the 13 would be Japanese This is a rough recollection, but I think the market share of the foreign-owned is in the low 20s--about 21 or 22 percent So, 13 out of 43 would be about a third of the total; but they tend to be a little smaller, representing about 21 or 22 percent of the market   Well, because we added through our intervention about $13 billion to foreign currency holdings, that was a long-term factor putting in reserves Had that not happened we would have had that much more to be added through domestic Desk operations I wouldn't say it's an impediment to our operations We  -11-    5/16/89  get notified immediately and fold it into our reserve projections But in a sense, if you will, it is sterilizing the intervention   I think the market tends to take account of it although there may be a bit of a lag in comprehending fully the extent of it from one day to the next It might be a minor factor adding to their uncertainty   Yes, I think the rate would be in the area of 9-3/4 or 9-5/8 percent   I think that's correct When they talk about their views they don't expect any overt or active policy move toward ease But what emerges from the rate relationships, as your earlier statement suggested, does seem to imply--looking out over a  -34-    5/16/89  few months--some slight easing just in the existing market relationships   Yes   That's about right   Or even earlier this year, when we had that cut of $200 million in mid-February, we did not consider that an easing but a technical adjustment  -36-    5/16/89 "
3675,1989-06-05," Certainly, Mr Chairman [Statement--not transcribed] "
3726,1989-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   That is a contributing factor Just on the basis of the reserve outlook, we're very near the end--at least on the latest projections that I've seen, which were as of yesterday when we were nearly done with the prospective draining for this period There's a small draining job of roughly half a billion or so for the next reserve period, unless things change because of the Mexican developments or foreign exchange developments Any of those things, and some other factors also, could change our reserve outlook As for the market people, there are two camps of thought about the funds    8/22/89  rate Some expect to see funds right around 9 percent give or take a small margin; others would be thinking more of 9 to 9-1/8 percent I don't think there's that much expectation imminently of the Fed wanting to see the funds rate pushed down noticeably further to 8-3/4 percent or something like that Some see that as something that could come further down the road, but not in the very immediate future But I must say I have a little question in my mind currently, and we've had this question right along, about gauging the proper relationship of borrowings and funds rates now It's hard to make a strong case on these things, in any event But I have a slight doubt at the moment as to whether, with $550 million of borrowing, we really should be expecting funds to be 9 percent or a shade above or more right around 9 percent or maybe even a hair under A lot depends on just what happens with seasonal borrowing, which has stayed pretty high; it has come off a little but is still pretty darn high   I don't think it has been a particular problem They had high balances at the end of June; they were more or less forced to have the high balances because there are big seasonal tax receipts And they had more than used up the capacity of the banks to hold these note balances; that capacity is around $31 or $32 billion, as I recall And those balances did come off in July They have been holding pretty well around their normal Fed balance of $5 billion as a working balance recently   It has not really been a great problem   Yes   Well, we have sometimes had discussions with them about whether it would be useful for them to make greater use of cash management bills that could get them by some of these post-tax date bulges in cash and the like They traditionally have been reluctant to make much greater use of cash management bills, feeling that that was a relatively costly way to fund the debt But, that's kind of an ongoing debate that we have with them   Yes, that's certainly true   Well, I think it's very hard to categorize Clearly, the Treasury did step up their borrowing when it finally emerged how the compromise was going to come out They tacked on at the last minute some $5 billion to a cash management [bill] It was rather explicitly tied to the need for the $20 billion of budget expenditure in this fiscal year And they have rather promptly added to the regular weekly bills They might have had to add, anyway But my impression is that they added somewhat more to that and also to the 2- and 5-year issues that are being sold this week I think it's planned, though, that some of that $20 billion, if not all, will be spent; my impression is that they're aiming to spend it That would be coming out on September 30 and would lower cash balances by some $6 or $7 billion--maybe more than that   Well, it's not tied dollar for dollar   The way we're looking at it, from the Treasury financing standpoint, I'd say they already have come into the market for $6 or $8 billion   I don't know   My impression is that they were going to aim for $20 billion instead of $30 billion, or something like that "
3751,1989-10-03," Thank you This is going to be an anti- climax! [Statement--see Appendix]   Of modest magnitude I think there is an expectation, on balance, that the greater likelihood is for some easing down the road If I drew up a central point consensus, something within a few months would probably capture it   I think it's a mixture of both, President Forrestal Those who have that expectation anticipate seeing a bit more softness in business But they think the foreign exchange factor certainly would be working that way too   Oh, I think it's likely The foreign exchange intervention wasn't adding as much as at some earlier points in the year but it was still adding fairly substantially So, without that factor, we would have had to be doing some outrights as currency in circulation was increasing   I wouldn't say it was a problem at all in our execution of operations As a mechanical factor, we're amply well informed about the extent of the foreign exchange intervention and we just fold that in as a reserve factor in our planning of operations  -19-    10/3/89   No, I wouldn't say it's any problem in that way "
3761,1989-10-16," Yes, I am, Mr Chairman Let me start with just a brief comment about what the markets had been doing from the time of your last meeting at the beginning of October up until last Friday Rates had come off moderately--say, 10 to 40 basis points for bills; 35 to 45 in the 2-to-5-year area; and about 20 basis points for the long bond I think this was against the background of some feeling in the market that perhaps a further easing move, which had been lurking in the back of people's minds, was maybe becoming a little more imminent, particularly when the employment report was released in early October Then on Friday, in the aftermath or along with the very sharp drop in stocks, there was a flight to quality and rates came down appreciably further So, now the change--again from October 2nd--would be off about 80 basis points or so in the bill area, about 65 to 85 in the short Treasury coupons, and about 35 to 40 basis points for the 30-year bonds  This morning we are getting a small taking back of some of those big gains late Friday, but there would still be these appreciable declines since the beginning of October Given that there was a kind of flight to quality, we didn't have that move across the whole range of prices, so something like the [unintelligible] spread has widened about 15 basis points or so, and the spread of Eurodollar CD rates against Treasury bills widened out a bit on Friday In other parts of the market, of course, the junk bonds were not sharing in the moderate decline in rates earlier in the month and they came under further pressure on Friday I don't have a particular yield change to quote, because that market has been so illiquid it's very hard to get a sensible reading; but clearly, that high-yield junk market has been under pressure and there is very limited market-making in those bonds In terms of federal funds, we had been right around 9 percent at the time of the Committee meeting at the beginning of the month Since then, rates have been a little under that, hovering around 8-7/8 percent We were mostly in a reserve-draining mode through this period That included taking out a moderate amount of reserves this past Friday Rates softened further after that, despite our having taken some funds out And this morning we started with a funds quote of 8-5/8 percent and it has drifted off at 8-9/16 percent I haven't seen any new reserve numbers yet, but based on what we were looking at on Friday, we thought we still had a little more draining of reserves to do The market, of course, has seen these headlines that have been referred to, and frankly, I'm not sure what they expect of us in light of that, but also [in light of] the obviously comfortable funds market That's all I have, Mr Chairman    10/16/89   Well, the yields were coming off in the early October week, kind of along with Treasury issues I couldn't really get a good read on what happened to those in the Friday market, Ed Well, I just won't speculate on it It was certainly not like the pounding that the junk market took, but I don't know that they got the benefit of the big lift--I doubt it--that the Treasuries got either   Well, that was the expectation based on [what we had on Friday] I didn't see any new projections from this morning, President Melzer, but that was about what our outlook was I'm sure we're not going to go in and take anything out this morning I think the question will be how far we feel committed by any expectations growing out of those newspaper articles I think we'll have the necessary flexibility to deal with it "
3768,1989-10-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman As you know, the US stock market rebounded considerably yesterday The Dow Industrial index came back about halfway from its big drop of Friday; some other measures [showed] less of a recovery As stocks came up, the expectations of a flight to quality faded, so Treasury issues actually gave back most of their big Friday gains One press story that I saw this morning talked about dealers having gotten caught after loading up with securities on Friday and then they even used the phrase ""got slaughtered"" yesterday I'm rather skeptical of that we'll check into that more, but our spot checks during the day yesterday did not suggest any big loss pattern like that They made quite a bit in the bond market Friday and gave back some of it yesterday; but I don't think that there were massive moves I don't think there was the inventory around to have done that kind of loading up on short notice  This morning we've had some gyrations in the market Bond quotes were initially up moderately from the overseas trading; they fell back on that bad trade number that Sam mentioned and then came back a little most recently, so they were showing some very slight gains over last night's close Compared with last Thursday evening, that leaves Treasury bill quotes down something like 20 basis points; coupon yields backed down and then were up about 5 to 10 basis points The high-grade corporate area showed lesser swings than Treasury bonds    10/17/89  but broadly in the same direction The junk market you have to think of really as two different markets--or one market and one virtually non-market The better grade low-rated issues had been down sharply on Friday and weakened somewhat further yesterday morning and then recovered to show little change on the day for a number of issues and even some net pluses on the day Apparently, there was no big move to redeem shares in junk bond funds, which had been one of the fears late Friday and yesterday morning And we were hearing of some buying of the better grade junk issues by some of those high-yield funds As for the other so-called ""punk junk,"" that market is still in the tank It's highly illiquid; there is a waiting calendar of high yield issues to come in this quarter, and one hears repeatedly that there may have to be considerable revamping or restructuring of some of those deals before they can be successfully launched  On our operations, we added some reserves yesterday, essentially because the markets were so expectant of seeing us after some of that weekend press The reserve numbers showed us to be about on path or maybe a shade over path after making some modest allowances for excess reserve demands and borrowings earlier in the period Fed funds were fairly comfortably around 8-9/16 percent at the time, but we added about $2 billion through a customer RP Funds were steady to actually slightly firmer over the balance of the day The effective rate yesterday was 863 percent and that left us [averaging] 886 percent so far this reserve period Funds started out today trading at 8-11/16 percent, so there may not have been quite as much overabundance as we thought we might be creating by putting in some reserves yesterday As to where the market now thinks we are or might be heading in regard to policy, I would say that before the Friday stock market plunge there already had been some sentiment developing-- although certainly not a firm conviction--that we were encouraging or allowing a little more accommodative stance, with perhaps something like an 8-3/4 percent funds rate, as opposed to something around 9 percent, being permitted to emerge I think that view has gained some further adherents in the last couple of days, though there are still some participants who would say they are not yet convinced that we've made any clear move away from something around 9 percent At the same time, because of the last couple of days, there are some who feel that the rate is now more likely to settle in around 8-1/2 percent because the Fed will be impressed with the stock market and the junk bond market fragility as well as other factors that already had been there in the general economy I think that you had a fair amount of support early yesterday and maybe somewhat less so as the day went on, but it has by no means disappeared That's all I have, Mr Chairman   Yes   I would say that some do hold that view As I said, I was hearing more of that earlier yesterday Later in the day funds had firmed, and I was hearing less of that kind of talk Also, some of the people looking at what we did yesterday felt that one really couldn't gauge it by the normal measures--that we were dealing with the extremely jittery stock market and that it was almost irrelevant where funds were at the point that we went in As to the decision to go in, even though the stock market was not tumbling yesterday morning, it was so jumpy--it had come down early and then it did come back--that I felt, because of the sense of expectation that had come out of the weekend press, that not to do something when there was that great widespread expectation of our coming in-- If things had turned sour in the stock market later in the day, I felt it would have resounded very unfavorably on the Fed's supposed adherence to what people had thought was some kind of commitment--however inaccurate or accurate that perception might have been In any event, I don't know that there is going to be that much of a problem of a sense of whipsawing As I say, funds are at 8-11/16 percent starting this morning I don't know yet what the reserve outlook is; but if we're able to stay out today, I think that might be a very nice outcome for this whole situation   There have been those views In fact, we thought there was a draining need when we finished our operations on Friday Then, as I said, we got some revisions that put us just about on path or with a very, very small draining need Some others still see that draining need There have been a few analysts, though, who thought there was an ""add"" need So there is a range of views there   No, tomorrow is the [end of the] final week   Yes And that is a period, incidentally, in which we're looking at a very substantial overabundance of reserves and we'll have to go in overtly and take some out    10/17/89 "
3777,1989-10-18," This is not a question--Peter Sternlight here The market has lots of questions about how certain transactions stand with the California institutions and we're trying to pass along as best we can what we hear about the situation But there is a lot of uncertainty Even though we know the Reserve Bank is operating, there are questions that market participants in other areas have about counterparties in the Twelfth District or California   It's just that we're hearing questions on this   Yes, Mr Chairman I would say nervousness certainly continues in the domestic stock market There was a moderate buy [unintelligible] on balance yesterday, although at one point at mid-morning there was a pretty sharp sell-off [and] the Dow was off about 60 points for a few minutes It came back and ended up the day about 18-1/2 points or about 1/2 percent lower; that would be true of the broader S&P 500 as well Just as we're speaking now I see the opening on stocks for this morning is a further modest decline-- about 16 or 17 points on the Dow Returning to yesterday, Treasury bonds ended up modestly lower on the day They had been up at first; they were knocked back by the bad trade number; they recovered from that, and then went off moderately in the afternoon--largely, we thought because of some supply prospects The TVA refunding issue was enlarged by $1 billion and the market senses the approaching big Revcorp issue that I think will be announced formally today Bonds are up a little this morning on the housing starts decline The high- grade corporates came off a little yesterday also on the TVA and other supply prospects The junk market was mixed, with some of the better quality names slightly higher and some of the weaker ones, or ones with some particular news affecting them, coming off a little more on the day Treasury bills were not much changed yesterday; they are down a few basis points this morning Fed funds yesterday were around 8-5/8 to 8-11/16 percent The effective rate was 870 percent; that gave us an 885 percent average so far this reserve period, which has just one more day to go We're starting out with funds trading at 8-3/4 percent this morning  As to the Fed's operations, initially yesterday we were well positioned to stay out of the market Reserves looked to be just about on path after allowing for high borrowing earlier this reserve    10/18/89  and funds, as I mentioned, were 8-5/8 to 8-11/16 percent Just as we were shaping up our final plans for the day, the stock market was experiencing that selling spasm that I mentioned and we were also hearing a couple of things on the reserve front suggesting a little less availability Moreover, the market was pretty much looking for us to come in again with something on the day, so we finally decided on discretion over valor and did pass through $1-1/2 billion of customer repurchase agreements The market remains somewhat mixed in its expectations about policy I'd say most are looking for us to come out of this period with funds centering around 8-3/4 percent, but I think there are certainly more than a few who would look for 8-1/2 percent Others are not yet convinced that we have deviated more than temporarily from 9 percent But if the funds rate were to return to the 9 percent area, I think there would be some sense of disappointment in the market I do not have that feeling about centering on 8-3/4 percent, if that's what emerges As to what we might face today, I don't really know I think there will be more than usual uncertainty because of the earthquake situation We probably won't have our usual confidence, even our low confidence, in the numbers That's all I have, Mr Chairman   I don't know at this point Yesterday when we put in funds, we did that reserve injection when funds were 8-5/8 percent Funds tended slightly firmer over the course of the day It may be that there really is [a shortfall] We thought we were just about on path, but we were hearing--there are always these marginal reserve factors--that the foreign central bank pool was going to be a little bigger than we had thought initially and there's so much that can vary just on the size of the Treasury balance So, we may have had a reserve shortfall; we may be getting another revision in the path That was one estimate that we were hearing just about the time our conference call was over yesterday So we may actually have a bit of a reserve need; I just don't know But we may not have a good reading on it because of the uncertainty coming out of San Francisco "
3800,1989-11-14, [Statement--see Appendix]   Fine [Statement--see Appendix] 
3828,1989-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes   I doubt it, President Forrestal I think part of their reaction [reflected their] sense that we have been focusing more closely on funds rates in the last year--or pretty much  -59-    12/18-19/89  since the stock market break of late 1987 And I think that sense of a closer adherence to the funds rate has gotten around the market   I think it could be We would have welcomed opportunities to do that An obstacle to doing that is this sense of the borrowing/funds rate relationship not being as reliable as in the past And I think that's partly what has kept us more closely bound to the funds rate   Don may want to comment also, but clearly we have recognized more explicitly in the last year, I would say, the changes in seasonal borrowing and we have made adjustments to the borrowing level in recognition of that I think of the seasonal borrowing as in a kind of in-between zone Banks clearly are not under the same pressure to repay those as they are with adjustment credit borrowing But there is some sensitivity of seasonal borrowing to the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate So in that sense it probably would be a mistake to focus just on adjustment borrowing; but it probably should be regarded in a somewhat different light--as we have been regarding it recently--than the adjustment borrowing   Yes  -60-    12/18-19/89   Well, we certainly had the reserve need for the period I wouldn't have been surprised if funds had firmed later that day because we were projecting it as a reserve deficit day in a reserve deficit period   They slipped further that very day As I said, it may have been that, as participants were beginning to move toward that misimpression of an easing, the banks that needed funds began to slacken their purchases What would go through their minds, I suppose, is Why buy at 8-3/8 percent if it's coming down to some lower level?   Well, even the beginnings of somebody raising the possibility of an easing started to generate some reaction among the funds market participants; and the situation kind of fed on itself The softening that occurred in the funds rate later that day probably fed back to more market participants, which strengthened their sense that there was probably an easing underway   It got down to 8-1/4 percent, or maybe a little lower   Yes   On our daily conference call?  -61-    12/18-19/89   As I recall, there was no [Reserve Bank] President on the call that day   We had our usual discussion with senior staff at the Board; as we were having that discussion funds were trading at 8-7/16 percent I think a question was raised as to whether the market might misinterpret that; and my judgment was that, no, they would not misinterpret it Now, it was during the call itself--we began at 1130 and the call was already well under way-- when we saw the funds trading at a couple of the brokers slip off further to 8-3/8 percent And we decided to leave the program in place One can second guess this, but my judgment was still that it would not be misinterpreted It was misinterpreted   I'd like to interject, Mr Chairman, that I don't see the seasonal borrowing program as giving us significant problems of implementing policy at the Desk Now, there may be good reason to review that program and revise it; but I don't see it as a problem for implementation of policy "
3879,1990-03-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I don't know that I have very much to add to the kind of philosophical comment I put in the Annual Report I do think that what we do now is somewhat different than the overt fed funds targeting of the 1970s But it certainly has become pretty darn close to it in substance You can call it a wistful look at the past I think there are regrettable things about fed funds targeting and I am hopeful of being able to get away from it more I think it's going to be difficult to do until we have more confidence in something like a relationship of borrowing and the spread of the fed funds rate over the discount rate But just in our day-to-day operations I think we can carefully seek out opportunities not to let ourselves be too tightly trapped into the perception that we target the funds rate, because part of the box that we get ourselves into is built up just out of our own interactions with the market We carefully appraise each day's operation What is the market expecting of us? What will they make of it if we do this or don't do that? And it's only by rather carefully taking opportunities to stretch their tolerance that I think we can begin to build away a bit from an excessive focus on the fed funds rate   Well, we certainly had been sending some very clear signals to Drexel, too, about how they managed their affairs We felt very deep concern about the charges they took and the wrongdoing they admitted to, and we had them on very stern notice about what we expected of them just from the standpoint of being good citizens in the market As to general changes in market behavior, as I mentioned, there is this greater tenderness about the financing of investment banking firms that does still linger in the wake of rumors that were rampant for a while but have quieted down now It has made many firms look carefully at their own exposure just so they won't get themselves in excessively exposed positions; they will take that lesson to heart In the areas that I regard as Drexel's greatest excesses, in the junk bond underwriting, I think that lesson really was being delivered well before their demise just because that market was virtually coming to a halt during much of last year You just can't do those things, and probably shouldn't be trying to do those things, with highly leveraged buyouts to the extent that they were during their heyday   Well, I would say we have a concern about all firms Obviously, we want to be sure that the entity we deal with is properly capitalized and that it conducts itself properly   But we have said in our standards for primary dealers that we have a concern about their general financial standing and the reputation of the parent or other affiliates as well as the immediate entity that we deal with It's not that we go out of our way to give a lot of advice on how they conduct themselves; but if we felt disturbed about their conduct in some other area, we would feel it was incumbent on us to say something   Well, our role is not a regulatory role It's just part of our business relationship with a counterparty We don't want to do business with an entity whose reputation we're not comfortable with   I don't really have a final answer on that   In our calls with some of the major money center banks we do hear some reference to that But I think they're talking more just about what they hear generally I don't get the sense that they're talking about their own situations having been impacted that severely, although some of them do tell us that they have been taking a more conservative view in their lending It's a    3/27/90  mixed sense that I get It's not so much because of regulators bearing down but more just that in light of general conditions in the last year or two they have wanted to take a more restrained view about their lending programs   Well, there have been some articles in the press talking about the whole subject and some of the market participants--nonbanks as well--will refer to that Some of them see it as a factor in shaping their economic outlook to some degree   I have not encountered that, Mr Chairman   Well, that would pretty clearly put us beyond our ability to collateralize except by looking to the foreign currency, if we were up by that   By looking to the foreign currency for use in the collateralization because even at present levels we see--   --the risk later this year of coming down to, say, the $3 to $5 billion area of margin   Right now as we look ahead for the rest of this year, if we don't make use of the foreign currency holdings for collateralization of the currency, as I said, we would come down to a margin of $3 to $5 billion   Well, there are a couple of low points We [project] one low point in late May, another in July, and another in October; it depends on the ups and downs of the Treasury balances and reserve requirements   Only in exchange for maturing issues   We definitely don't have that power "
3888,1990-04-11," I don't think I have anything that significant to report on the domestic side Conditions have been pretty steady We're continuing to aim for reserve availability that would give us a funds rate around 8-1/4 percent That's about what we have And we're in a period of adding reserves for seasonal reasons in rather substantial amounts Since the last meeting we've added a little over $5 billion to our outright holdings The rate changes in the market are quite modest bills and short coupons are down 5 or 10 basis points; those on the longer end are up a few basis points So, it has slightly changed the shape of the curve, but it's essentially flat Maybe the most noteworthy thing was the auction yesterday There was another auction of 40-year Refcorp bonds and they got a pretty mediocre reception I wouldn't say it was as poor or as shocking a response as the one three months ago, but it was still pretty unwelcomed It was a combination of the 40-year maturity and the Refcorp name having negative implications, partly in the context of some of these revised estimates that are coming out on what the full extent might be of the Refcorp problem That's about all I have, Mr Chairman "
3911,1990-05-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   We had thought that there could be a problem in May Our subsequent reviews suggest that it doesn't look as tight for the balance of this year as we had thought a month ago That's not to say that the problem may not still be there; but it's not going to be as severe for the rest of this year as I might have thought some 6 or 8 weeks ago   There was an enormous change in sentiment just about the time of that one set of employment numbers in early May I think more went into it than just that number It wasn't just any single number; it was the unemployment rate as well as the flat    5/15/90  report on nonfarm payrolls and information that looked more comforting on employment cost measures all wrapped up together in that "
3959,1990-08-21," Shall I proceed?   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the experience of the opening five or six months of this year is a little better than last year I wouldn't be surprised to see some further decline of several dealers There are still more than enough, certainly, to serve our needs and the needs of the market We got along nicely for a decade or so with a number that varied in the mid-30s, and I think that would be a very satisfactory kind of number now   It's possible that we'll have some further decline [in the number of primary dealers], yes   Maybe I shouldn't respond because I haven't seen official estimates on that anywhere in that area But as I said, that assumes a soft economy--skirting along the edge of recession or in some of the private estimates an actual recession--so there is definitely a weakening of revenues No budget package had the thrift bail-out expenditures greater than in this current fiscal year "
3979,1990-09-07," Peter Sternlight, Mr Chairman I think you had it just right The consensus from the market, as we have gathered it to this point, is that they see a move as less imminent or less immediate, though it's certainly in their minds that the economy is weak and they wouldn't rule out a move in a slightly longer horizon-- meaning weeks or months rather than days, I would think "
4000,1990-09-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman We've continued to aim for reserve conditions consistent with a fed funds rate around 8 percent Operations have been conducted against the background of market expectations of a more or less imminent monetary policy easing move That sense of imminence seemed to reach a high about a week ago    9/17/90  when the market focused very intensely on the employment report for August Since then, the anticipation of an immediate move has faded a bit, but there are still expectations of a fairly near-term move as the economy is seen as quite soft, though not collapsing And outside of monetary policy, there are expectations--related to the view that an agreement on a budget deficit reduction package is close to being reached--about market reaction to any such package Since the August meeting short rates have come down somewhat--about 15 to 20 basis points for bills--while longer-term rates are about unchanged to slightly higher depending on one's precise starting point That leaves the long bond yield right now a shade over 9 percent, about 903 percent when I last looked That's my brief summary, Mr Chairman "
4024,1990-10-02," [Statement--see Appendix]   Right   Well, we have been uncomfortable for a year or more--two or three years maybe, going back since the October 1987 stock market decline--with the extent to which we give a lot of attention to the funds rate rather than feeling that we have some element of flexibility where we would aim at a borrowing gap and have a rough expectation about the funds rate but where there was room for the funds rate to vary some around that I think what has put us in the kind of box that we're in now is a weakening of the relationship between borrowings and the funds rate spread over the discount rate I wish there were greater flexibility so that the market could accept our doing things when the funds rate is a bit to the easy or firm side of what they think is the central point without their getting all that excited about the policy implications of our actions I think it would take some kind of public statement to get the market off its fixation [on the funds rate] And even then, it's going to be hard to do because the market is always reaching for something to guide itself And unless we can put something else out there--and I'm not sure what else we have now to substitute for the current security blanket--   Yes, I think that could help   No I think that would be--   Yes    10/2/90   Maybe so There was a day recently that we were able to provide some reserves--I think it was through multiday RPs--and funds were [trading] a hair under 6 percent and that was accepted by the market They thought there was a big reserve need and they didn't think anything of it on that occasion But at the moment I'm more conscious of the occasions when we felt our hands [were tied] because of the expectations of an imminent easing that Don referred to, and we didn't move lest they misinterpret our--   No, I do not think so   I think it would be a positive I would not expect a big rally because there's still that concern about inflation   In that context I would not expect the long end to move up; right   Well, I like to think of what we have as a range anyway But the market would immediately put the rate in the middle of the range and if they're looking for--   If they are looking for ease, then anything to the lower side of that range will make them begin to think it's the first step on the easing side; conversely, if they are looking for tightening   I tend to think of it as a range anyway, but the market doesn't   That wouldn't be a problem; that would be the middle of the two-week reserve period "
4049,1990-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   At some point I think there could be, but I don't think a modest further move of the funds rate would cause difficulty in that regard   I think that's right   The dewarehousing that Sam referred to and that I noted relieves the immediate concern I think we could still run into a problem early next year We came close on some days in the recent period--closer than we had expected because of the very slow growth of money and, hence, reserve requirements But the dewarehousing gave us some more breathing space I don't really look for a very tight squeeze again until maybe February   I think the comment was that there has traditionally been a little premium paid by Japanese banks borrowing in the fed funds market and that has tended to increase in the recent period   There are various reasons for it; some of it is the market perception of the Japanese banks and some is that those banks seem to be concentrating more of their funding in the overnight market   I think it's just the reluctance of some participants in the market to extend their range of contacts The sellers in the funds market are typically the smaller regional banks    11/13/90  that are not used to dealing in the international markets They just have had a preference for selling their funds to their traditional correspondents To get them to reach out and sell to any foreign banks has taken a bit of a step-up in rates   There has been a tendency for all of the foreign banks to pay up a little, although the increases recently have been more or less confined to the Japanese banks The European banks have not seen a step-up in premium   I just don't know whether it would have had that much short-run impact   Well, I think there has been a pulling back by the Japanese but what impact that would have has been offset, because in a soft economy other demands for credit have been lightened And there is this quality differential factor as well, where Treasuries have been in demand because they are seen as the premier type of investment as against virtually any other kind of investment    11/13/90   Foreign demand was on the light side It had been on the light side in August also, as you may recall The Japanese dealers were there but it was not altogether clear how much was really going back home to Japanese investors To some extent I think they put in an appearance and then just turned the stuff over in the US market They were not very big participants; they were moderate size participants   In the 3-year note it turned out to be very little because they were bidding but other people outbid them, so they only got around 5 percent In the 10- and 30-year issues my recollection is that it was more in the 15 to 20 percent range   That sounds about right   Individuals were about normal, I'd say   Yes, it would if we were making big discount window loans What they put up as collateral might or might not be countable in backing currency It would depend on what--   Well, there is a fairly tight spot in February, as Don noted, so we wouldn't have to get any really major borrowing   It might   Legal authority, yes   Yes, the money funds   Yes   I think this would involve a rule that would dictate the accounting practices that they follow In order to continue accounting for investments in the fund, keeping the unit value at $1 or whatever, they would have to follow certain accounting rules And the rule that was being proposed would have set a very stringent standard as to what proportion of their assets could be in less than the top rated forms of commercial paper or bank deposits    11/13/90   That's right   Well, I would welcome some greater day-to- day flexibility in the funds rate I don't know whether it has an awful lot to do with this   I don't think that would be detrimental If you went for a substantial narrowing, I think that would "
4064,1990-12-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman As you know, right after the mid-November FOMC meeting we moved to lower the funds rate 1/4 percentage point from 7-3/4 to 7-1/2 percent It took a few days to achieve that because of some other temporary pressures in the market, but the market got the point in a few days Today, as was mentioned, another 1/4 point move was made, and that was rapidly [digested] by the market Funds were trading at [7-1/4] percent at the time and we passed through some customer RPs In fact, over the course of the day funds have drifted off a little further to 7-1/8 percent and there was even some trading at 7-1/16 percent just before I walked in for this call Since mid-November Treasury bill rates have come down by 15 to 25 basis points, with maybe about half of that occurring today Coupons are down even more [unintelligible], by 25 to 35 basis points; there too about half of it occurred today Private sector rates have not come down as much; typically they lag And a few short-term rates, such as those on 1-month CDs, actually have moved up a little because the time has come to bridge the year- end period and we are at the same time facing some concerns about year-end pressures But those pressures themselves have come all in the last week They seem to have reached a crescendo about the end of November and have abated noticeably since then It's not that they couldn't swell up again, but at the moment they have abated  Policy [has been seen] right along as having been in an easing mode, given the backdrop of weak news on the economy and soft aggregate numbers punctuated with what the market [digested] of the mid-November fed funds move and the reserve requirement reduction and then today's federal funds move It seems to me that the easing has been seen in the market as well justified, and in that setting the longer-term rate has come down as I mentioned The discount rate is getting some increased attention in the market; I'd say more and more people are looking for [a cut in] it I wouldn't say a move has been entirely priced into market thinking, but to some extent a move in coming days has been priced into the thinking as of this point As some of you may know, a few smaller banks--the Southwest Bank in St Louis, another St Louis bank, and then First Fidelity in New Jersey-- have moved on the prime rate by 1/4 percentage point today That's all I have, Mr Chairman "
4087,1990-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes   Well, the banks will make their individual decisions on this; it's a question of what levels they will feel comfortable with We've spoken to some of the money center banks who have been reviewing where they will be with the reduction in reserve requirements Several of them are considering establishing these required clearing balances because they say, for example, that the balances they would have to keep at the Fed would be coming down to a range that just doesn't give them enough of a margin of comfort for daily operations   Well, the comments I've heard have had to do more with just the avoidance of overnight overdrafts Some of the studies by the Board's staff suggest that not very much impact is expected on the daylight overdraft side of it   It looks as though we will need to in early January; I think Don would know   Yes   I think the reserve requirement move was seen as being helpful in [terms of] the year-end situation With respect to a further easing of reserve pressures or a reduction in the funds rate, I think some have felt that the steps taken recently helped in reducing some of those year-end pressures But to say that that is a factor may just be imparting my own speculation about what their thinking process might be; maybe they're looking forward to another move near term As I say, there was a high expectation, particularly after the last employment report, that there would be another easing by year-end; but it tended to get set back a little by the producer price report last Friday   There has been some discussion about whether there are technical impediments to the funds rate coming down to the level of the discount rate or perhaps even below the discount rate I think it would be feasible for that to occur--that the market would accept it They would probably continue to look for the discount rate [cut] in due course, but they might think there were reasons--perhaps concerns over the dollar or whatever--that the Fed was holding off for a time on the discount rate   It would take some careful implementation whichever way one goes on this So, yes, it would have some effect; but I think it can be done either way   I don't really have a strong point of view   I'm not sure how they would interpret it; I think they might regard it as a temporary circumstance   Certainly, the concern is still there It seemed to reach its peak about the end of November and came off In the last couple of days we've seen some move back up but not with that near panicky feeling that seemed to be there in November An awful lot of preparation was undertaken for year-end and in some cases we're hearing that institutions have prepared themselves to be able, within limits, to take on some credits at year-end where they think they will find good business opportunities to do some of that So, at this point anyway, I'm not looking at it as a terrible looming problem, but it's certainly something that we're going to keep a very close watch on right up to the year-end   Well, I think it has been provided mainly to the US operations and then they may have done operations to move some of the funds I can't say what might have happened after that step But as to why there was this greater sense of demand--maybe Ted or Gretchen would want to comment too--there was some greater reluctance among US banks to extend lines to Japanese banks to the same extent as before, because even though US banks were being downgraded and were regarded with less favor, so were Japanese banks There was less willingness to extend some of those lines and less willingness particularly to serve as intermediaries between, let's say, smaller US banks that would have funds to provide and the ultimate Japanese bank as buyer Whereas before a major US bank might have been willing to sit there in the middle and take its 1/16th or 1/8th, they might say that it's not worth 1/16th or 1/8th to have this exposure to an entity that's coming under some question   I don't really see it that way because I think what we have now just is a very low level of borrowing And we don't really have a good substitute to put in the place of the focus on the funds rate If anything, as we go through this transition period in the reserve requirements, I think we're going to have to lean even more on the funds rate I really just don't see a good alternative to that   Well, it's coming darn close to that   I would agree that it can be conveyed I think something about like that move is what a number of people in the market expect That would also help in being able to convey [an intention] like that   No   I think people are looking for some action but not necessarily immediately If nothing were done going well into January, let's say, I think that would be an element of disappointment to the market   I think the intensity of pressures reached a peak about the end of November and then subsided We've seen some increase in rates again in the last couple of days but--as I see it anyway--without the same sense of stringency or near panic that seemed to be there in late November I wouldn't want to say it has run its course I think we could still be in for some pressures that you'd want to monitor and maybe deal with in some way   Well, in terms of what the market looks for, I think one of the critical things will be the next employment report which I believe comes out January 3rd or quite early in January If that looks weak again and if they haven't seen some [easing] by then, they will look for it and be quite disappointed if they don't see it Normally, you'd expect year-end pressures to unwind about a week after the turn of the year We do have the added complication of the reserve requirement reduction and how banks respond to that and how we respond to their response   I don't have a particular sense of that "
4099,1991-01-09," If I could interject I think you have to consider that those standard reserve growth measures are very distorted by what has been happening over the year-end The standard series that the staff works up on that makes an adjustment for the lower reserve requirement but it doesn't, as I understand it, make any adjustment--we wouldn't know what adjustment to make--for desires to hold excess reserves That, of course, has been tremendously distorted as we have dealt with the year-end problem and the desires of banks to behave very cautiously over this period   Well, Mr Chairman, it has been a little like trying to ride a roller coaster without a track ever since the period just before year-end We haven't known what allowance to make for excess reserves, given the complications of the year-end and the phase-in of the reserve requirement reduction [We have been] making allowances but they're very rough estimates Somewhat by default we might place more guidance on, of all things, the federal funds rate; but that rate has been exceptionally volatile--soaring and plunging as combinations of year-end pressures and the inflexibilities of unusable excesses did their work When we were facing these heavy year-end pressures, rates were quoted way up there around the turn of the year, particularly rates being paid by foreign, and especially Japanese, institutions I did get some very large repurchase agreement operations We did finally subdue the pressures for financing over the year-end date but in the process we built up a mountain of excess reserves that had [produced] at that time, although not all that consistently, abjectly easy money market conditions  Through virtually all of this the market has clung to its belief that we were aiming at, or that somewhere lurking in the background was, a normal 7 percent funds rate that they saw us as having pretty clearly moved to just after the December FOMC meeting But that perception changed yesterday, as you've already mentioned Funds were trading early yesterday at 7 to 8 percent and there was a widespread view in the market that we had overprovided reserves earlier in this maintenance period, which included the year-end So, there was a general expectation that we would come in and drain    1/9/91  reserves, consistent with something like our 7 percent central expectation for the funds rate We didn't go in and drain because we were on the verge of this policy shift that you outlined We also had a bit of concern that we were looking at a deep reserve shortage for the day and that funds would tighten up just because of the reserves of the day and what we were looking at for the period But we were well aware that by staying out we would [foster the] expectation in the market that there had been a policy move, and that is what seems to have taken place They aren't 100 percent convinced but they're pretty close to 100 percent convinced that there was a policy change, probably to a 6-3/4 percent funds rate Some of this volatility should shake itself out once we get past this year-end period, but we may end up with somewhat more volatility than we are accustomed to in the funds rate just because the reduction in reserve requirements has reduced the level of reserve balances that banks need to keep at the Fed to meet their reserve requirements And they have to be more careful just on a day-to-day basis to avoid overdrafts on their reserve accounts So, that diminishes their flexibility for averaging out ups and downs over the reserve maintenance period   That was certainly my understanding, and I put in the program [wording that we had] every expectation that our absence from the market could very well be interpreted as a move   Well, I think some of the papers talked about the market having a measure of uncertainty I'd say they're 90 percent convinced; they're not absolutely convinced "
4134,1991-02-05," I don't think there's anything remarkably different about foreign participation I'm hearing that there was good foreign participation in the three-year note that was just offered today There is rather limited talk about what participation there might be in the longer maturities, but that's related more to the portfolio decisions of those foreign holders rather than about the particular [amount of] dollars at this point   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I think it has been something of a problem We've been somewhat lucky in that we've been able to communicate policy moves as well as we have without that process getting confused So, I wouldn't say it was such a problem that it kept us from doing the essentials of the job, but it was something of a problem As to whether it's a temporary or more lasting phenomenon, I think the severity should be ameliorated from what it has been as the players get used to the new factors and partly because we're just now coming through a reserve period where the need for maintaining balances at the Fed to satisfy reserve requirements is exceptionally low It's a seasonal low point for balances at the Fed because cash is seasonally high and reserve requirements are seasonally low Also, there has been a gradual build-up--rather modest so far, but ongoing--in these required clearing balances More and more banks have looked at the possibility of [establishing] these required clearing balances to pay for Fed services and that has gone up about $500 or $600 million since mid-December I know that's true of a number of large banks; and undoubtedly many small banks also are looking at it now So, I expect to see something more there But I don't know if that's going to be enough to erase the problem totally I suspect there's going to be some lingering element of greater volatility looking ahead As to what can be done about it, probably the best thing--if one could have a wish list on this--would be to be able to pay interest on required reserves But that would take Congressional action We've been considering, and some market people have suggested, the possibility of bigger reserve carryovers I think that could be of a little help but rather limited; it takes more looking to decide just how much help it might be   Also, there has been a suggestion that the banks have more than one period in which to use excess that developed in a given period The suggestion has been made to have the Desk enter the market later on the same day I would see very little net gain from that just because we're physically limited in how late we can go in and still achieve delivery in the day So much of the greater volatility has come after that point in the afternoon But we really don't have much more information, let's say, at 100 pm than we have at 1100 am that would give us much gain from later entries   And a great majority of banks, of course, are not bound at all They have been meeting their needs fully with all cash anyway   Well, required [clearing] balances are around $23--   We have noticed, of course, the relationship of RP rates and the funds rate We have done some looking into what might have brought about the relatively higher RP rate Traditionally that has been a little under the funds rate It may have something to do with just the volume of securities being financed; it may have something to do with name problems, in terms of some of the parties getting their financing I wouldn't say it has been that much of a problem in trying to get to the funds rate that we want We generally have an idea of the amount of repurchase agreements we want to do and we stop where we have to in order to get that amount done But we'll also be conscious of where the stopout rate is and where it might fit in relation to what we are hearing from the market as to their expectation of the stopout That might be a small factor in our decision about just how much to do on occasion, but I think it's a pretty small factor   I don't think so   Making for a very high funds rate at times [unintelligible] to come to the window Yes, I should have mentioned that   No extended period   Well, as I say, we go in at that hour when we have our reserve numbers assembled On rare occasions we've gone in earlier because we had to be sure of being able to do the job or because we wanted to register at an earlier hour some viewpoint as to conditions that were ongoing So, there's a limitation at one end involving when we would have reserve information in our hands and that sets [the timing] at around 1100 to 1130 am At the other end, if we're going to get delivery and have our operations effective that day, it can't be much later than 130 pm or so So there's not an awful lot we could do under present institutional arrangements about the volatility that comes in mid and late afternoon and on into the early evening, which is when we get some of the greatest extremes of variability   I don't see a direct problem in terms of implications for open market operations I think there are broader issues to consider, which the System certainly would want to think through in a legislative way  -13-    2/5-6/91   Quite well There was strong bidding I just got a brief report on that and it came out about where we were expecting, at a 698 percent average   I did not hear "
4157,1991-03-26," I don't have much to add to Don's summary Clearly, the discount rate and the anticipated funds rate have tended to move broadly together, and I think that's to be expected given that they are responding to similar sets of information as interpreted by similar and partly overlapping sets of policymakers Our paper tried to strike a balance between the presumption of similar movement and at the same time some recognition of the value of flexibility and discretion in those cases where full uniformity in the size and timing of moves could be questioned Reasonable judgments may vary a bit on precisely where one draws the line as to how strong the presumption is of parallel movement Consultation, of course, need not mean something other than parallel movement It's just an opportunity to review the situation in light of additional information That's all I had to add, Mr Chairman   Sure   Thank you, Mr Chairman   [Unintelligible Statement--see Appendix]   Well, they certainly had been looking at it and they had noted the concerns that the Chairman and others expressed when we were in the period of very slow growth The close attention to it seemed to fade as they no longer were looking for slow money growth as a reason to be expecting further easing moves I wouldn't say that I'm hearing any concern about an excessive pace of money growth at this point What I hear more is along the lines of ""Well, it looks like your M2 measure is getting into the middle of its range and isn't that nice""   I think it would That thought could be put into the language [of the press release about] a discount rate change so that they wouldn't look for any change in the funds rate On your first point, though While I realize there are others like yourself who have that sense of discomfort, it has not been an impediment to our operations to have the rates right on top of one another And even with respect to the point we make about wanting to see a little more use of the discount window, I'm not sure I see it as that much of a problem because at the times when banks would come in to use the window we'd typically be getting some pressure on the funds rate So, whether it's being lifted from a 6 percent base or a 6-1/4 or 6-1/2 percent base, I think there would still be that same incentive to turn to the window rather than pay such funds rates   I think that little signal on borrowing probably helped to trim some of the volatility that might have [occurred] on a few days in the recent period   It might be a little more awkward than what we have now I still think it would be workable; there might perhaps be a little more volatility in the funds rate, but I'm inclined to think it would not be impossible   That's right   Have the funds rate a 1/4 or--   Well, as I commented in my remarks, there were a few days after the move on March 8th when the market perceived that funds were going to be trading more likely around 6 percent And with the discount rate at 6 percent, there were some who were thinking that we had to do something with the discount rate to have a workable relationship But with the passage of time and with some comments that had been picked up by the market, I think they became reconciled to the reality that it does seem to be a workable arrangement "
4214,1991-05-14," [Statement--see Appendix]   It was quite strong in the 3-year, rather modest in the 10-year, and about average in the [30-year] bond The bond had really light coverage I think the major deficiency there was domestic demand; customer demand was really on the light side   There was, as you note, a botched bid; but it still would have been quite light coverage   The tail wouldn't have been as big, but--   We're working on it, Governor; we don't have it yet but I would say that even an automated system is not going to remove totally the possibility of botches from time to time   I don't remember specifically; I don't remember their being out of the [ordinary]   I'm a little surprised at the extent of it I think the big widening of spreads occurred, and particularly got exacerbated, during that somewhat scary year-end period when some genuine systemic concerns were beginning to emerge As it was clear that we were getting through that period and that the economy was, though in a downturn, not in utter collapse, I think there was reason to expect there would be some narrowing So, the fact of some narrowing shouldn't be any surprise; but the extent of it has been a little more than I would have predicted   It's very hard to sort out I think both of those factors are there, President Keehn Recently the most potent concern has been just the sheer supply But lurking in the background there is concern not so much about a lot of inflation expected but of recovery expected and concern that there will be more competing demands for long-term financing   There was that one occasion when the funds rate was sagging in mid-April and there was even some speculation beginning to build up that we were deliberately being tolerant of lower rates, and we thought it was good just to clear up those misperceptions by going in early one day And I think the market got that message quite clearly on that occasion Through virtually all the rest of the period the market seemed pretty clear in its perception of what they thought we basically were aiming for "
4222,1991-06-10," Mr Chairman, I can be pretty brief about open market operations since your mid-May meeting Operations have been steadily geared to reserve conditions consistent with a 5-3/4 percent funds rate We've come pretty close to that on average For a couple of days in late May there was some persisting softness in the fed funds market, leading to market speculation that we might be paving the way for another easing move And we took the occasion to drain some reserves in an overt manner, even though at that point in time we were looking at a reserve [add] need for that reserve period    6/10/91  That pretty much seemed to disabuse the market about any near-term easing as a likely event The flow of information more recently was such as to discourage thought of further policy easing in any event Some observers even feel that the next move could just as well be on the firming as the easing side, although that is not to say that they expect anything any time very soon Interest rates over the period were at first down a bit as the market was digesting the mid-May financing More recently, yields have backed up amid reports suggesting at least a bottoming of the economy's decline and maybe a glimmer of an upturn On balance, we've had rates moving up by, say, 10 to 25 basis points The highlight, of course, was the focus of all the attention on the employment report, which came out just this past Friday On 30-year bonds, yields have been pretty close to 8-1/2 percent; 848 percent is what we were looking at a couple of minutes ago That compares with about 8-1/4 percent at the time of your mid- May meeting and an 821 average when that issue was at its auction I think that summarizes my report on the markets "
4291,1991-08-20," [Statement--see Appendix]   It has not presented any undue difficulty, President Parry I anticipate that it could make for slightly more volatility in the funds rate And if the Committee were to adopt a course that had a lower funds rate expectation than the discount rate, I would look even more for possible difficulty on that score But in the present situation, there is no particular difficulty   If we were expecting a lower funds rate than the discount rate?   I wouldn't think it would be a terribly serious problem even then I think you'd have to be reconciled to somewhat greater fluctuation in the funds rate   I would welcome, I think, some greater flexibility in the funds rate, although I recognize some of the counter arguments that Dave's paper referred to But I can think of instances where we have felt somewhat constrained by what was happening in the funds market from doing the reserve injection or reserve extraction that we thought ought to be done from a reserve management standpoint   Yes   Several times, I would say   Something like that   I don't think long term it has any really serious impact If a very big, unfilled need or a very big excess developed, it might cast its shadow over our operations in the next reserve period and, if there had been a desire to effect some policy change, it conceivably could have delayed that change I can't think of a specific instance when that occurred, but that's the kind of [situation] where I could imagine it having some undesirable effect But I don't regard it as a really serious impediment Just from a manager's standpoint in dealing with reserve positions, it has been a mild or moderate frustration at times to feel that we're hemmed in by the funds rate But I've gotten used to it [Laughter]   Yes, I guess so But we feel that the funds rate is a constraint at this time The reason we feel it is a constraint is that we don't want to mislead the markets [Unintelligible] I presume an approach that I might develop in consultation with Don Kohn and the Chairman "
4325,1991-10-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] "
4343,1991-10-30," Mr Chairman, even our inaction today may leave some question about the possibility of a move or of our being on the verge of a move because the funds rate has sunk to 5-1/16 percent So, by our just staying out, people will wonder whether we are--   Right "
4365,1991-11-05," [Statement--see Appendix] That concludes my report, Mr Chairman I do have a request on the intermeeting leeway    11/5/91   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Secretary's note Mr Sternlight recommended a temporary $2 billion increase in the leeway His remarks are included in his statement in the Appendix]   Well, Mr Chairman, as I said in my statement, I think the market is looking for further easing probably a further 1/4 point on the funds rate and probably also a discount rate move That has to be on their minds as they bid on these Treasury offerings Yet, I can't escape the feeling that it's somehow potentially disruptive to have those changes actually implemented right within the period of bidding for the Treasury securities If something had been done early this morning, a couple of hours before they come up to bidding for the 3-year, so be it We did that in August, I believe, when a small change was implemented the morning of the 3-year auction We did get a certain number of complaints from    11/5/91  the market even about that But with a move that occurs right within the bidding period we would hear even more about it You can say, well, why wouldn't an easing move if anything be a plus for securities if they take them? But you have to remember that they're in the midst of a distribution process where they are shorting; they are selling on a ""when-issued"" basis the issues that are about to be bid for So, you could catch some market participants in that stage of having sold ""when issued"" to some customers with the expectation that they will then be putting a bid in the auction I think that's an awkward position to be leaving them in So, I have just a gut feeling that it's preferable to wait Now, how long should you wait? It seems to me Friday would be about the earliest that I could feel comfortable with I could even make a case for having it carry over to early next week But I would feel most strongly that it would be preferable not to implement a visible change just within these bidding days of today, Wednesday, or Thursday   [Unintelligible]   Well, we think we have a moderate add need We didn't do anything today because funds were sitting right at 5  -38-    11/5/91  percent If we wanted to transmit a signal tomorrow, we probably could do overnight system repurchase agreements and it probably--   At our normal time   I don't know I'd have to think about that; I wouldn't be inclined to   I don't know My inclination would be to do something-- To go back to this question of damage, I don't see terrible damage from doing it, and I really have a lot of sympathy for what Governor Angell and others have said If there's a change in policy, it ought to be transmitted to the market Maybe I've been too close to the markets on this, but I think we'll get some adverse reactions   But as the Chairman has said, they're all big boys and they know that we're facing these policy decisions and could be acting They know we're having a meeting today   It probably is a better way to make sure the message gets across immediately I don't think it will remove some of the down side that I see I'm kind of swinging around in my own view "
4409,1991-12-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, Secretary Brady acknowledged at a couple of recent Congressional hearings that they are looking at the question of the extent of their reliance [on them] He seemed to be trying to downplay the effects that might follow from that, noting it is only a modest portion of their net borrowings; 7-1/2 percent or so is done in the 30-year area I believe that, after a very sharp reaction following that first day's reference, a clarification came out [from the Treasury] to the effect that people should not look for them to abandon totally the long bonds So, the market was left with the impression that there might well be some scaling down but probably not an abandonment   Well, it has some resemblance, although in the case of Operation Twist there was a positive desire to see short- term rates higher as a balance-of-payments remedy; that element has not been present this time The Treasury might just [want to] leave both ends lower   We hear such a range of views that it would be hard to say whether there's a real coalescing I have heard very strongly put views from some in the bond market who think it would not do much good at all; and they are very troubled with the idea of tinkering with the Treasury's regularity and reliance on the long end On the other hand, there are some who feel that some modification could be useful and recommend it as at least a partial step   I think [the order] gets attention when there are changes   It gets the analysts' attention and they write about it in their market letters and so on "
4421,1992-01-09," I don't think I have anything unless there is a particular question, Mr Chairman   It's hard to say how many will come forward The potential universe with those capital standards I believe would be about 75 broker-dealers and something on the order of 250 domestic banks but also 100 and some foreign institutions The potential number we're talking about is a few hundred but I don't think anything like that number is going to come forward this year It's a guess, but if I were to make a stab, I'd say a few others might show their faces within a month or two after we put this out That's just pure guesswork "
4446,1992-02-04," [Statement--see Appendix]   They did on occasion, President Parry I perhaps should have mentioned that, although it did not seem to be a big factor in the recent period But in the fairly recent past I was hearing as one reason for the rise in domestic long-term interest rates the competitive pull particularly of German rates "
4471,1992-03-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman Domestic interest rates have moved up since your meeting in early February, though with a good bit of backing and filling in response to particular news reports on the economy and partly related [policy] anticipations, which at times folded in and then worked out against expectations of further monetary policy easing The persistent influences over the five weeks were a nearly unrelenting sense of endless supply and more recently a bit of growing confidence in the economy The economy is not seen as in a strong rebound, but there is a more widespread view that we've probably seen the low point and can likely anticipate a moderate advance Money growth has been getting a bit more attention as the period has gone on While fed funds rates are pretty close to the 4 percent level, bill rates have risen about 15 to 40 basis points The two-year area is up nearly 1/2 percentage point; the five-year note is up about 30 basis points; and the long bond is down about 10 basis points, putting it at about 790 percent today Those changes actually are off the highs, but a couple of times during the period the long bond has touched 8 percent; it has seen pretty good investor interest The two-year rate at one point backed up to [a level] about 60 or 65 basis points higher than it was at the time of your last meeting  Policy expectations in the market are pretty generally on hold just now A few people, probably economists more than investors, feel that there could be another easing somewhere down the road It is not a very widespread view And a few are beginning to anticipate a firming in policy, but this is seen to be a number of months away at the earliest The predominant view, as I say, is just a straight down the middle anticipation for at least some months ahead It seems to us that concerns about fresh fiscal stimulus, although they have been there in marked form at times and are still in the background, have abated along with a bit of a growing sense that Congress and the Administration may not be able to get anything together in the near term on that problem As to operations, we had some reserve needs late in the period We've been meeting them recently largely through repurchase agreements as we look forward to a big release of reserves next month through the reduction in reserve requirements That's all I have to report, Mr Chairman    3/11/92 "
4495,1992-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I'm commenting on it as I see it from the market's perspective of enormous Treasury issuance and still pretty heavy corporate issuance I realize that if you fold in everything, including the bank loan demand and so forth, that it's weak or not all that substantial But just from the standpoint of what the trading markets are coping with it has been substantial   Well, as I said, we are following up on those stories On the 7-year note we had a rather formal, organized roundup of additional information and have contacted a number of the dealers to talk specifically about how they are conducting their operations in that issue We've also had several conversations with respect to the December 5-year issue, which has been a kind of on and off special It went off and then in the last couple of days came back on special There, too, it has seemed to us that these were the results of understandable investment decisions by market participants We don't get any sense of market manipulation activity that, at least at this point, makes us feel that we have to proceed further in that vein   [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes   It's more a question, President Syron, of having ample holdings in the very short areas so that if on short notice we had to lighten our portfolio by substantial amounts within a matter of months or even weeks we could do that by either running off bill holdings or selling very short-term securities   Yes   There would be a disruptive effect if we sold large amounts in the longer end   Thank you   I do, President Melzer That makes me very leery of doing anything, as I say, very noticeable in that direction That's why I would suggest holding any greater effort in that vein very much at the margin   And I think it would have that effect That particular statistic on the average maturity is very dependent on how we handle not so much our market purchases but our rollovers and quarterly refundings We've tilted those quite strongly toward the short options That was what we had outlined as a plan to the Committee in the mid-1980s, following the discussions that Don alluded to And by virtue of steering our holdings very strongly toward the three-year option each time, that has tended to work, just as a factor in itself, to bring down that average maturity    3/31/92   Right "
4520,1992-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I'd like to make a recommendation on leeway for the next [intermeeting] period, Mr Chairman   [Statement--see Appendix] "
