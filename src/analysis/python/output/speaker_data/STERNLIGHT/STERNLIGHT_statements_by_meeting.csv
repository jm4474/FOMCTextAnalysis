51,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   At times, there certainly did seem to be an abatement in their interest in the debt market; as for the equity market, we are continuing to hear that they are pretty active And they have certainly continued to participate in Treasury auctions; in this last auction they were there in the 10- and 30-year issues As for purchases in the secondary markets, at times over the period we were hearing of some pulling away from buying in our market as their own rates were pushing higher   Well, Sam Cross or Ted Truman might be in a better position to comment At least as it was passed along to me, I got a sense that it was a bit more of the policy move type of thing   We are anticipating a sizable buildup I wouldn't say it's an unmeetable problem at this stage I don't think we'll approach the record levels that we had last April when their total balance got up to $54 billion or so, and the balance at the Fed    8/18/87 -4-  was $30 billion I think their total balance could get up to the $40- 50 billion range and that could put the balance at the Fed somewhere at $25 billion, or something like that It could be a substantial reserve-draining factor   Well, I considered that But for almost any number I would pick, Governor, I could imagine circumstances that would take it a little beyond that So, I'm picking what I think might well do it, but I just want to put the Committee on notice that it could conceivably come in beyond that If I presented $12 billion, I'd like to feel more confidence than I can feel at this stage of [unintelligible]   I wouldn't see it as a danger I think it may just be that the Committee would want to keep close to the situation and realize that if some even larger increase were needed, you'd like to be informed in some formal manner and have a chance to note that   As best our projections look   I was shrinking from that, Mr Chairman, because I just did not have that degree of confidence, but I'll stick my neck out at $12 billion   It does get published and people will look at it and say ""Gosh, did they really think it was going to go that high?""   There has never been any difficulty in getting the authority as we needed it, if a situation arose "
106,1987-09-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I wouldn't be surprised if there were some kind of a spike I don't know what the average would work out to be We'll be seeking to put in reserves, so that if our estimates are close and our estimates of the demand for excess are close, the average will come out around the $600 million level There is always an element of uncertainty as to just how far a spike takes you But I think there is a lot of realization in the market that this is a very difficult period for reserve management   I think if you measure it just from the time the discount rate moved, there would be some flattening The short rates came up more than long rates I think if you looked at the    9/22/87  whole intermeeting period, it is about similar at the short and long end of--   I am not sure what to say I wouldn't say that there was a very widespread expectation; there was some expectation of the move, and there were even some people who were thinking in terms of a larger move And, initially, there were some who expressed disappointment that it wasn't larger, although I would have to think that a small, vocal, minority was expressing that view I suppose there is a sense in which [your observation] is true; people who recognized that the dollar had been under pressure and was likely to be continuing under pressure have come to expect that our rate structure and our policy formulation process will be under that kind of pressure So there was that element of resignation to the process   Not in any imminent sense, but I think there is an expectation that the dollar is going to remain under pressure, given that we have this awful trade balance picture; and that would be the kind of atmosphere under which there would have to be further policy response   It would take some bulge in borrowing to get up to the $600 million [average] I don't have yesterday's figure yet, but borrowing had been averaging $460 million through Sunday So there would have to be some bulge, probably, on the final day And as I said, if you ask the people who follow these things closely, most of them would probably think of us as using $500 million, although some would say a range of $500 to $600 million If they saw a number like $600 million coming out, some of them might regard that as indicative of a little firmer aim than they had estimated earlier On the other hand, they also were aware that it was very tough to manage reserves in this period So, I don't know that they are going to jump    9/22/87  immediately to any very strong conclusion if the borrowing comes out at $650 million, or something like that   Just because of the juxtaposition vis-a-vis the Committee meeting date, possibly more [than a few]; but I think more of them would just tie it to knowing that Wednesday is the settlement date of the reserve period   Well, the concern is very much tied to the dollar And when concern about the dollar [is high], the market is more concerned with what would tend to happen with respect to inflation The market has been reasonably well impressed with the actual price index numbers that have come along in the recent period But they do worry that, in the course of redressing the trade deficit, we are going to be imposing more demands on our resources--that there may well have to be further adjustment in the value of the dollar and that that will do things to import prices, and so on   Well, I think that even with the trade picture, it is partly domestic pressure because, as you are redressing that trade imbalance, you'll be putting more pressure on domestic resources   I would expect a modest firming My guess is that you would get funds rates averaging in the 7-1/4 to 7-3/8 percent area I think we are averaging 715 or 720 percent so far this period    9/22/87   I have not really heard discussion of that particular factor However, while people are well pleased with the deficit coming out this fiscal year at $160 billion, or somewhat under, there is deep concern that without the Congress getting something together on fiscal restraint, it will be heading up by $20 billion or more next year "
107,1987-09-22, I haven't been very good 
165,1987-11-03," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, in fact, we upped that a little further yesterday, President Melzer, to $15 billion based on what we were seeing from actual holdings of excess by some of the smaller institutions that already had a lot, and because some of the major institutions had built up such a lot of excess that we didn't think they could get rid of it all and still have some positive balance on the day That's relevant to this current reserve period; we will be looking again at the next reserve period I have no reason to think that we would be thinking in such high terms for the next reserve period, but we'll have to evaluate it as we get into it   I think it's a bit of an on-and-off thing now It certainly is not the overwhelming presence and the tick-for- tick linkage that was there early in the year, although on some recent days the bond market has weakened in response to the dollar weakening But, as I mentioned, I thought one reason for that linkage having been muted recently was that [market participants] saw the earlier weakening of the dollar as likely to be followed very rapidly by some tightening of monetary policy, whereas in the current context, they don't see that as following on so quickly There is still concern, though, that a weaker dollar is a discouraging factor either to new inflows of foreign capital into our market or perhaps a reason for foreigners with existing holdings in our market to want to pull out So there does remain some sensitivity, but I think it's less   I have some impression of some of those tensions abating, some subsiding of the flight to quality Somebody was saying a couple of days ago that the flight to quality has landed; I think that is probably going too far But I think there is some backing away from that Nevertheless, I think it remains a basically sensitive picture I just had a report a few minutes ago indicating a further stock price decline today It was down 40 some points in the opening half hour or so   I think it's terribly hard to say My sense would be, as you say President Parry, that there has been some reluctance to borrow; but it's very, very difficult to come up with even the rough and ready kinds of pronouncements that we have tried to make in the past about a relationship between borrowing and expected funds rates   Well, I think there has to be a lot of flexibility in anything we try to--   I guess it would depend partly on whether it was perceived that what was happening was occurring for some deliberate reason on our part or despite what we were doing The interpretation of it would depend on how our role was seen in the whole thing A good many people would say that's in the range of their expectation, I suppose If I had to pinpoint an expected range now, narrowly, it might be 7 percent or a shade under; but I don't think 7 or 7-1/8 percent cropping up occasionally would be terribly disturbing in that context, either   Yes, that has been the past standard    11/3/87   They certify that they are not borrowing to facilitate a short sale   In mid-October, the beginning of that period, the outlook was that we had a reserve need for what is now the current period but that in the following period there would be only a modest reserve need So, if we had done a lot of outright buying then we would have had a concern that we would come up to an overabundance of reserves and it could be awkward, as these are not the kinds of markets where we would want to try to be going in and draining reserves As the period went along, we kept getting revisions of the out periods, so it looked as though we would have a more long-term need If one had it to do over again, it might have made sense to have done some purchases outright I don't think our broad purposes of providing liquidity were ill-served by concentrating on repurchase agreements, though This gave us a chance to have a rather continual presence and to be providing relief to what was potentially one of the very sore points in the system, the ability to get day-to-day financing So I don't think that part of it worked out too badly   Yes, Mr Chairman, I have a leeway request Current projections suggest a somewhat enlarged need for outright purchases in the upcoming intermeeting period Normal seasonal needs for currency and increased required reserves could be enlarged even further if current financial market tensions persist While we may want to leave a sizable margin of needs to be met with repurchase agreements, it would also be useful to have the flexibility for substantial outright activity I recommend a $3 billion temporary increase in the normal $6 billion leeway, although we may not need very much of the enlarged amount "
166,1987-11-03," No, I think that would make my point; I regard that kind of thing as within the flexibility that is stated in the directive "
217,1988-03-29," [Statement--see Appendix]   It could be something like that On the attitude toward borrowing, I think that one reason why a big difference didn't show up is that those attitudes were already kind of cautious Also, there had been a lot of borrowing; there was about one billion dollars of adjustment credit ongoing so that there was a lot of room for those cautious attitudes to show up But you're right--there was a much more noticeable widening of spreads of bank [unintelligible] and Treasury securities We've seen rather little of that [this time], and I think that probably does reflect just learning to live with that kind of situation   I would have a little sense of that, yes And I know that it doesn't show up in all the [unintelligible] that are done But it does seem to me that, particularly given these low levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowings, that is a bit of a factor   The only thing that I would do is underscore the point Don made with respect to fed funds compared to borrowing I    3/29/88  think that they are not so much contrasting positions, but points on a continuum I think of ourselves now as pretty much back to so-called ""normal"", but remembering that ""normal"" does involve close awareness of what's happening with the funds rate It did before mid-October of last year, and it does now   I don't think there was anything abrupt that happened in 1972 We were getting into closer and closer federal funds targeting that ended rather abruptly in 1979   Well, I think there was a reluctance to make the moves in the federal funds rate that, in retrospect anyway, would have been a little more appropriate   I'd regard that as an aspect of the procedure that lent itself to that constraint   It reflects what was put in the path "
241,1988-05-17, And the maintain would only be initially 
343,1988-09-20," Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement-- see Appendix] "
408,1988-11-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think it's a question of excluding any particular firms from a particular country that meet our criteria I think the political concerns that arose probably sharpened our sensitivity to the issue, but I think speaking from my own view of it anyway I do have a concern at least about the rapidity of the growth in representation from some particular corners of the globe   Just because I have a concern about the relatively aggressive pace of entry, and this is a way of slowing down that relatively aggressive pace of entry from a particular foreign sector in my mind  -22-    11/1/88   Well, that may have a very similar impact   Right now we have 46 on the list including a couple that would be just on the edge of 1 percent But they meet it, and over the past few years there has tended to be some giving of ground by firms that had the biggest share Theoretically, you could have 99 firms doing 1 percent It won't work that way, but it might work out that it would be very hard to get over 1 percent  -23-    11/1/88   Yes  SPEAKER(?) What's the biggest share?   I guess about 8 or 9 percent "
464,1989-03-28," [Statement--see Appendix]   [That's] borrowing used in the construction of reserve paths, about which we had a good deal of uncertainty I say uncertainty, but I had a fairly strong suspicion that we were overstating or were using a higher level than was consistent with what banks would actually come to the window for, given the range of the funds rate that we were expecting During those first few weeks of this intermeeting period we would make adjustments, particularly if it went well into a reserve maintenance period, for what was turning out to be a lower level of borrowing by $200 or $300 million as this period went along And as that persisted week-after-week the decision was made--we consulted with the staff and the Chairman on it--to make this downward technical adjustment in the level of borrowing used in the path, but we were not expecting that to be accompanied by any change in the range of expected funds rates   No, no   I said indexed because it was indexed to a degree of pressure that we expected to be associated with [a certain] range of federal funds trading It's indexed in that sense   I think they certainly realized that we have had problems with it Periodically I see things suggesting that they think we are getting back more to the use of borrowings but probably    3/28/89  not all the way back to where it was, let's say, prior to the stock market crash--which was the time of the major departure   Sorry Maybe I twisted that around But they think that we are--   Getting back toward use of borrowings   I think we're getting back toward the borrowings but [not] all the way to what we were pre-October '87   Yes   As I understand it, Governor, it was not so much a bad bet on what was going to happen to the general level of rates but rather some sophisticated rate spread movements that they anticipated that just did not pan out as they expected That's not to say I agree--   It's surprising to see as sophisticated a participant as they are coming up on the wrong side on that I will say that in the past couple of years when, in general, the government securities dealers have had a pretty rough time that firm drew on perhaps a more sophisticated view and a better knowledge [of the market] and has fared better than the pack by a fair margin I'm really more concerned about a great number of other dealers who seem really unable to hack it with the current degree of competition in the government securities market   Yes, they did have that big hit from a bad bet on what was going to happen to the shape of the yield curve   No, I think there were many firms that engaged in those strategies, though probably in lesser dollar magnitudes than Salomon Brothers But I don't think it's at all that unusual to the degree--   Further questions for Mr Sternlight? Would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk?   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the upcoming intermeeting period, current projections suggest a maximum reserve need on the order of about $7 or $8 billion The main factors we think will be increased currency in circulation, higher required reserves and, by early May, some rise in Treasury balances at the Fed While some of this can be met with repurchase agreements, which do not count against leeway, I believe it would be prudent to enlarge the standard $6 billion intermeeting leeway temporarily by $2 billion to $8 billion "
528,1989-05-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   There are 4 major Japanese securities firms that started their own operations in the United States There are 3 other situations of existing firms that had been domestically owned and have been bought by Japanese banks within the past few years So there are 7 in all   I think it has been part, and perhaps the most prominent part, of the whole move toward internationalization, but not the entire thing We have had entrants from other countries as well and some additional new firms who have come in on the US side In the last 7 years we've had an increase in the number of primary dealers, primarily from foreign entrants but not exclusively And I would say that the increased number of dealers, along with some slowdown in aggregate activity and just the way the markets have gone in the past few years, has tended to make it much more difficult to run a profitable operation Last year more than half the dealers showed losses in their government securities operations   Well, there has been concern about that There has been an allegation that officialdom in Japan seems to share information with Japanese firms, whether banks or securities firms The Japanese realize that there is that criticism from the market, and I think they are trying to do things to change what has been their modus operandi They seem to have a philosophy of not wanting the market to be surprised by new statistical reports or policy changes or whatever So they apparently have some tradition of sounding out some market sources and word gets around from this kind of thing That may  -10-    5/16/89  be what you're referring to And it is an issue that causes concern amongst US firms operating in Japan   We had this large need, which in fact turned out to be bigger in the short run than we had thought it was going to be But because of the way some other longer-term factors were operating, the longer-term need did not look as great as we went through the period We kind of geared ourselves to doing through outright purchases approximately what looked like the long-term need-- although we went somewhat beyond that and we're now in the position of having to do a little draining as we come up to this next reserve period I would say we determine the mix on the basis of how we think we and the market can best manage those reserve adjustments We knew we were leaving a lot to be done with repurchase agreements but we've had really good experience in doing heavy amounts of repurchase agreements, particularly if we give the market a few hours advance notice Announcing to the market at 300 pm on a previous afternoon that we're going to look for propositions for repurchase agreements the next morning seems to give us very sizable propositions That has worked well and I think took us, in pretty good shape, through a period like this one with a very heavy, but temporary, reserve need   Thirteen are foreign-owned   Primarily foreign-owned There would be some others with some partial [foreign-owned] shares And 7 out of the 13 would be Japanese This is a rough recollection, but I think the market share of the foreign-owned is in the low 20s--about 21 or 22 percent So, 13 out of 43 would be about a third of the total; but they tend to be a little smaller, representing about 21 or 22 percent of the market   Well, because we added through our intervention about $13 billion to foreign currency holdings, that was a long-term factor putting in reserves Had that not happened we would have had that much more to be added through domestic Desk operations I wouldn't say it's an impediment to our operations We  -11-    5/16/89  get notified immediately and fold it into our reserve projections But in a sense, if you will, it is sterilizing the intervention   I think the market tends to take account of it although there may be a bit of a lag in comprehending fully the extent of it from one day to the next It might be a minor factor adding to their uncertainty "
529,1989-05-16," Yes, I think the rate would be in the area of 9-3/4 or 9-5/8 percent   I think that's correct When they talk about their views they don't expect any overt or active policy move toward ease But what emerges from the rate relationships, as your earlier statement suggested, does seem to imply--looking out over a  -34-    5/16/89  few months--some slight easing just in the existing market relationships   Yes   That's about right   Or even earlier this year, when we had that cut of $200 million in mid-February, we did not consider that an easing but a technical adjustment  -36-    5/16/89 "
587,1989-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   That is a contributing factor Just on the basis of the reserve outlook, we're very near the end--at least on the latest projections that I've seen, which were as of yesterday when we were nearly done with the prospective draining for this period There's a small draining job of roughly half a billion or so for the next reserve period, unless things change because of the Mexican developments or foreign exchange developments Any of those things, and some other factors also, could change our reserve outlook As for the market people, there are two camps of thought about the funds    8/22/89  rate Some expect to see funds right around 9 percent give or take a small margin; others would be thinking more of 9 to 9-1/8 percent I don't think there's that much expectation imminently of the Fed wanting to see the funds rate pushed down noticeably further to 8-3/4 percent or something like that Some see that as something that could come further down the road, but not in the very immediate future But I must say I have a little question in my mind currently, and we've had this question right along, about gauging the proper relationship of borrowings and funds rates now It's hard to make a strong case on these things, in any event But I have a slight doubt at the moment as to whether, with $550 million of borrowing, we really should be expecting funds to be 9 percent or a shade above or more right around 9 percent or maybe even a hair under A lot depends on just what happens with seasonal borrowing, which has stayed pretty high; it has come off a little but is still pretty darn high   I don't think it has been a particular problem They had high balances at the end of June; they were more or less forced to have the high balances because there are big seasonal tax receipts And they had more than used up the capacity of the banks to hold these note balances; that capacity is around $31 or $32 billion, as I recall And those balances did come off in July They have been holding pretty well around their normal Fed balance of $5 billion as a working balance recently   It has not really been a great problem   Yes   Well, we have sometimes had discussions with them about whether it would be useful for them to make greater use of cash management bills that could get them by some of these post-tax date bulges in cash and the like They traditionally have been reluctant to make much greater use of cash management bills, feeling that that was a relatively costly way to fund the debt But, that's kind of an ongoing debate that we have with them   Yes, that's certainly true "
588,1989-08-22," Well, I think it's very hard to categorize Clearly, the Treasury did step up their borrowing when it finally emerged how the compromise was going to come out They tacked on at the last minute some $5 billion to a cash management [bill] It was rather explicitly tied to the need for the $20 billion of budget expenditure in this fiscal year And they have rather promptly added to the regular weekly bills They might have had to add, anyway But my impression is that they added somewhat more to that and also to the 2- and 5-year issues that are being sold this week I think it's planned, though, that some of that $20 billion, if not all, will be spent; my impression is that they're aiming to spend it That would be coming out on September 30 and would lower cash balances by some $6 or $7 billion--maybe more than that   Well, it's not tied dollar for dollar   The way we're looking at it, from the Treasury financing standpoint, I'd say they already have come into the market for $6 or $8 billion   I don't know   My impression is that they were going to aim for $20 billion instead of $30 billion, or something like that "
649,1989-10-03," Thank you This is going to be an anti- climax! [Statement--see Appendix]   Of modest magnitude I think there is an expectation, on balance, that the greater likelihood is for some easing down the road If I drew up a central point consensus, something within a few months would probably capture it   I think it's a mixture of both, President Forrestal Those who have that expectation anticipate seeing a bit more softness in business But they think the foreign exchange factor certainly would be working that way too   Oh, I think it's likely The foreign exchange intervention wasn't adding as much as at some earlier points in the year but it was still adding fairly substantially So, without that factor, we would have had to be doing some outrights as currency in circulation was increasing   I wouldn't say it was a problem at all in our execution of operations As a mechanical factor, we're amply well informed about the extent of the foreign exchange intervention and we just fold that in as a reserve factor in our planning of operations  -19-    10/3/89   No, I wouldn't say it's any problem in that way "
705,1989-11-14, [Statement--see Appendix]   Fine [Statement--see Appendix] 
769,1990-03-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I don't know that I have very much to add to the kind of philosophical comment I put in the Annual Report I do think that what we do now is somewhat different than the overt fed funds targeting of the 1970s But it certainly has become pretty darn close to it in substance You can call it a wistful look at the past I think there are regrettable things about fed funds targeting and I am hopeful of being able to get away from it more I think it's going to be difficult to do until we have more confidence in something like a relationship of borrowing and the spread of the fed funds rate over the discount rate But just in our day-to-day operations I think we can carefully seek out opportunities not to let ourselves be too tightly trapped into the perception that we target the funds rate, because part of the box that we get ourselves into is built up just out of our own interactions with the market We carefully appraise each day's operation What is the market expecting of us? What will they make of it if we do this or don't do that? And it's only by rather carefully taking opportunities to stretch their tolerance that I think we can begin to build away a bit from an excessive focus on the fed funds rate   Well, we certainly had been sending some very clear signals to Drexel, too, about how they managed their affairs We felt very deep concern about the charges they took and the wrongdoing they admitted to, and we had them on very stern notice about what we expected of them just from the standpoint of being good citizens in the market As to general changes in market behavior, as I mentioned, there is this greater tenderness about the financing of investment banking firms that does still linger in the wake of rumors that were rampant for a while but have quieted down now It has made many firms look carefully at their own exposure just so they won't get themselves in excessively exposed positions; they will take that lesson to heart In the areas that I regard as Drexel's greatest excesses, in the junk bond underwriting, I think that lesson really was being delivered well before their demise just because that market was virtually coming to a halt during much of last year You just can't do those things, and probably shouldn't be trying to do those things, with highly leveraged buyouts to the extent that they were during their heyday   Well, I would say we have a concern about all firms Obviously, we want to be sure that the entity we deal with is properly capitalized and that it conducts itself properly   But we have said in our standards for primary dealers that we have a concern about their general financial standing and the reputation of the parent or other affiliates as well as the immediate entity that we deal with It's not that we go out of our way to give a lot of advice on how they conduct themselves; but if we felt disturbed about their conduct in some other area, we would feel it was incumbent on us to say something   Well, our role is not a regulatory role It's just part of our business relationship with a counterparty We don't want to do business with an entity whose reputation we're not comfortable with   I don't really have a final answer on that   In our calls with some of the major money center banks we do hear some reference to that But I think they're talking more just about what they hear generally I don't get the sense that they're talking about their own situations having been impacted that severely, although some of them do tell us that they have been taking a more conservative view in their lending It's a    3/27/90  mixed sense that I get It's not so much because of regulators bearing down but more just that in light of general conditions in the last year or two they have wanted to take a more restrained view about their lending programs   Well, there have been some articles in the press talking about the whole subject and some of the market participants--nonbanks as well--will refer to that Some of them see it as a factor in shaping their economic outlook to some degree   I have not encountered that, Mr Chairman   Well, that would pretty clearly put us beyond our ability to collateralize except by looking to the foreign currency, if we were up by that   By looking to the foreign currency for use in the collateralization because even at present levels we see--   --the risk later this year of coming down to, say, the $3 to $5 billion area of margin   Right now as we look ahead for the rest of this year, if we don't make use of the foreign currency holdings for collateralization of the currency, as I said, we would come down to a margin of $3 to $5 billion   Well, there are a couple of low points We [project] one low point in late May, another in July, and another in October; it depends on the ups and downs of the Treasury balances and reserve requirements   Only in exchange for maturing issues   We definitely don't have that power "
824,1990-05-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   We had thought that there could be a problem in May Our subsequent reviews suggest that it doesn't look as tight for the balance of this year as we had thought a month ago That's not to say that the problem may not still be there; but it's not going to be as severe for the rest of this year as I might have thought some 6 or 8 weeks ago   There was an enormous change in sentiment just about the time of that one set of employment numbers in early May I think more went into it than just that number It wasn't just any single number; it was the unemployment rate as well as the flat    5/15/90  report on nonfarm payrolls and information that looked more comforting on employment cost measures all wrapped up together in that "
871,1990-08-21," Shall I proceed?   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the experience of the opening five or six months of this year is a little better than last year I wouldn't be surprised to see some further decline of several dealers There are still more than enough, certainly, to serve our needs and the needs of the market We got along nicely for a decade or so with a number that varied in the mid-30s, and I think that would be a very satisfactory kind of number now   It's possible that we'll have some further decline [in the number of primary dealers], yes "
872,1990-08-21," Maybe I shouldn't respond because I haven't seen official estimates on that anywhere in that area But as I said, that assumes a soft economy--skirting along the edge of recession or in some of the private estimates an actual recession--so there is definitely a weakening of revenues No budget package had the thrift bail-out expenditures greater than in this current fiscal year "
931,1990-10-02," [Statement--see Appendix]   Right   Well, we have been uncomfortable for a year or more--two or three years maybe, going back since the October 1987 stock market decline--with the extent to which we give a lot of attention to the funds rate rather than feeling that we have some element of flexibility where we would aim at a borrowing gap and have a rough expectation about the funds rate but where there was room for the funds rate to vary some around that I think what has put us in the kind of box that we're in now is a weakening of the relationship between borrowings and the funds rate spread over the discount rate I wish there were greater flexibility so that the market could accept our doing things when the funds rate is a bit to the easy or firm side of what they think is the central point without their getting all that excited about the policy implications of our actions I think it would take some kind of public statement to get the market off its fixation [on the funds rate] And even then, it's going to be hard to do because the market is always reaching for something to guide itself And unless we can put something else out there--and I'm not sure what else we have now to substitute for the current security blanket--   Yes, I think that could help   No I think that would be--   Yes    10/2/90   Maybe so There was a day recently that we were able to provide some reserves--I think it was through multiday RPs--and funds were [trading] a hair under 6 percent and that was accepted by the market They thought there was a big reserve need and they didn't think anything of it on that occasion But at the moment I'm more conscious of the occasions when we felt our hands [were tied] because of the expectations of an imminent easing that Don referred to, and we didn't move lest they misinterpret our--   No, I do not think so   I think it would be a positive I would not expect a big rally because there's still that concern about inflation   In that context I would not expect the long end to move up; right   Well, I like to think of what we have as a range anyway But the market would immediately put the rate in the middle of the range and if they're looking for--   If they are looking for ease, then anything to the lower side of that range will make them begin to think it's the first step on the easing side; conversely, if they are looking for tightening   I tend to think of it as a range anyway, but the market doesn't "
932,1990-10-02, That wouldn't be a problem; that would be the middle of the two-week reserve period 
997,1990-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   At some point I think there could be, but I don't think a modest further move of the funds rate would cause difficulty in that regard   I think that's right   The dewarehousing that Sam referred to and that I noted relieves the immediate concern I think we could still run into a problem early next year We came close on some days in the recent period--closer than we had expected because of the very slow growth of money and, hence, reserve requirements But the dewarehousing gave us some more breathing space I don't really look for a very tight squeeze again until maybe February   I think the comment was that there has traditionally been a little premium paid by Japanese banks borrowing in the fed funds market and that has tended to increase in the recent period   There are various reasons for it; some of it is the market perception of the Japanese banks and some is that those banks seem to be concentrating more of their funding in the overnight market   I think it's just the reluctance of some participants in the market to extend their range of contacts The sellers in the funds market are typically the smaller regional banks    11/13/90  that are not used to dealing in the international markets They just have had a preference for selling their funds to their traditional correspondents To get them to reach out and sell to any foreign banks has taken a bit of a step-up in rates   There has been a tendency for all of the foreign banks to pay up a little, although the increases recently have been more or less confined to the Japanese banks The European banks have not seen a step-up in premium   I just don't know whether it would have had that much short-run impact   Well, I think there has been a pulling back by the Japanese but what impact that would have has been offset, because in a soft economy other demands for credit have been lightened And there is this quality differential factor as well, where Treasuries have been in demand because they are seen as the premier type of investment as against virtually any other kind of investment    11/13/90   Foreign demand was on the light side It had been on the light side in August also, as you may recall The Japanese dealers were there but it was not altogether clear how much was really going back home to Japanese investors To some extent I think they put in an appearance and then just turned the stuff over in the US market They were not very big participants; they were moderate size participants   In the 3-year note it turned out to be very little because they were bidding but other people outbid them, so they only got around 5 percent In the 10- and 30-year issues my recollection is that it was more in the 15 to 20 percent range   That sounds about right   Individuals were about normal, I'd say   Yes, it would if we were making big discount window loans What they put up as collateral might or might not be countable in backing currency It would depend on what--   Well, there is a fairly tight spot in February, as Don noted, so we wouldn't have to get any really major borrowing   It might   Legal authority, yes   Yes, the money funds   Yes   I think this would involve a rule that would dictate the accounting practices that they follow In order to continue accounting for investments in the fund, keeping the unit value at $1 or whatever, they would have to follow certain accounting rules And the rule that was being proposed would have set a very stringent standard as to what proportion of their assets could be in less than the top rated forms of commercial paper or bank deposits    11/13/90   That's right   Well, I would welcome some greater day-to- day flexibility in the funds rate I don't know whether it has an awful lot to do with this   I don't think that would be detrimental If you went for a substantial narrowing, I think that would "
1053,1990-12-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes   Well, the banks will make their individual decisions on this; it's a question of what levels they will feel comfortable with We've spoken to some of the money center banks who have been reviewing where they will be with the reduction in reserve requirements Several of them are considering establishing these required clearing balances because they say, for example, that the balances they would have to keep at the Fed would be coming down to a range that just doesn't give them enough of a margin of comfort for daily operations   Well, the comments I've heard have had to do more with just the avoidance of overnight overdrafts Some of the studies by the Board's staff suggest that not very much impact is expected on the daylight overdraft side of it   It looks as though we will need to in early January; I think Don would know   Yes   I think the reserve requirement move was seen as being helpful in [terms of] the year-end situation With respect to a further easing of reserve pressures or a reduction in the funds rate, I think some have felt that the steps taken recently helped in reducing some of those year-end pressures But to say that that is a factor may just be imparting my own speculation about what their thinking process might be; maybe they're looking forward to another move near term As I say, there was a high expectation, particularly after the last employment report, that there would be another easing by year-end; but it tended to get set back a little by the producer price report last Friday   There has been some discussion about whether there are technical impediments to the funds rate coming down to the level of the discount rate or perhaps even below the discount rate I think it would be feasible for that to occur--that the market would accept it They would probably continue to look for the discount rate [cut] in due course, but they might think there were reasons--perhaps concerns over the dollar or whatever--that the Fed was holding off for a time on the discount rate   It would take some careful implementation whichever way one goes on this So, yes, it would have some effect; but I think it can be done either way   I don't really have a strong point of view   I'm not sure how they would interpret it; I think they might regard it as a temporary circumstance   Certainly, the concern is still there It seemed to reach its peak about the end of November and came off In the last couple of days we've seen some move back up but not with that near panicky feeling that seemed to be there in November An awful lot of preparation was undertaken for year-end and in some cases we're hearing that institutions have prepared themselves to be able, within limits, to take on some credits at year-end where they think they will find good business opportunities to do some of that So, at this point anyway, I'm not looking at it as a terrible looming problem, but it's certainly something that we're going to keep a very close watch on right up to the year-end   Well, I think it has been provided mainly to the US operations and then they may have done operations to move some of the funds I can't say what might have happened after that step But as to why there was this greater sense of demand--maybe Ted or Gretchen would want to comment too--there was some greater reluctance among US banks to extend lines to Japanese banks to the same extent as before, because even though US banks were being downgraded and were regarded with less favor, so were Japanese banks There was less willingness to extend some of those lines and less willingness particularly to serve as intermediaries between, let's say, smaller US banks that would have funds to provide and the ultimate Japanese bank as buyer Whereas before a major US bank might have been willing to sit there in the middle and take its 1/16th or 1/8th, they might say that it's not worth 1/16th or 1/8th to have this exposure to an entity that's coming under some question   I don't really see it that way because I think what we have now just is a very low level of borrowing And we don't really have a good substitute to put in the place of the focus on the funds rate If anything, as we go through this transition period in the reserve requirements, I think we're going to have to lean even more on the funds rate I really just don't see a good alternative to that   Well, it's coming darn close to that "
1054,1990-12-18," I would agree that it can be conveyed I think something about like that move is what a number of people in the market expect That would also help in being able to convey [an intention] like that   No   I think people are looking for some action but not necessarily immediately If nothing were done going well into January, let's say, I think that would be an element of disappointment to the market   I think the intensity of pressures reached a peak about the end of November and then subsided We've seen some increase in rates again in the last couple of days but--as I see it anyway--without the same sense of stringency or near panic that seemed to be there in late November I wouldn't want to say it has run its course I think we could still be in for some pressures that you'd want to monitor and maybe deal with in some way   Well, in terms of what the market looks for, I think one of the critical things will be the next employment report which I believe comes out January 3rd or quite early in January If that looks weak again and if they haven't seen some [easing] by then, they will look for it and be quite disappointed if they don't see it Normally, you'd expect year-end pressures to unwind about a week after the turn of the year We do have the added complication of the reserve requirement reduction and how banks respond to that and how we respond to their response   I don't have a particular sense of that "
1113,1991-03-26," I don't have much to add to Don's summary Clearly, the discount rate and the anticipated funds rate have tended to move broadly together, and I think that's to be expected given that they are responding to similar sets of information as interpreted by similar and partly overlapping sets of policymakers Our paper tried to strike a balance between the presumption of similar movement and at the same time some recognition of the value of flexibility and discretion in those cases where full uniformity in the size and timing of moves could be questioned Reasonable judgments may vary a bit on precisely where one draws the line as to how strong the presumption is of parallel movement Consultation, of course, need not mean something other than parallel movement It's just an opportunity to review the situation in light of additional information That's all I had to add, Mr Chairman   Sure   Thank you, Mr Chairman   [Unintelligible Statement--see Appendix]   Well, they certainly had been looking at it and they had noted the concerns that the Chairman and others expressed when we were in the period of very slow growth The close attention to it seemed to fade as they no longer were looking for slow money growth as a reason to be expecting further easing moves I wouldn't say that I'm hearing any concern about an excessive pace of money growth at this point What I hear more is along the lines of ""Well, it looks like your M2 measure is getting into the middle of its range and isn't that nice""   I think it would That thought could be put into the language [of the press release about] a discount rate change so that they wouldn't look for any change in the funds rate On your first point, though While I realize there are others like yourself who have that sense of discomfort, it has not been an impediment to our operations to have the rates right on top of one another And even with respect to the point we make about wanting to see a little more use of the discount window, I'm not sure I see it as that much of a problem because at the times when banks would come in to use the window we'd typically be getting some pressure on the funds rate So, whether it's being lifted from a 6 percent base or a 6-1/4 or 6-1/2 percent base, I think there would still be that same incentive to turn to the window rather than pay such funds rates   I think that little signal on borrowing probably helped to trim some of the volatility that might have [occurred] on a few days in the recent period   It might be a little more awkward than what we have now I still think it would be workable; there might perhaps be a little more volatility in the funds rate, but I'm inclined to think it would not be impossible   That's right   Have the funds rate a 1/4 or--   Well, as I commented in my remarks, there were a few days after the move on March 8th when the market perceived that funds were going to be trading more likely around 6 percent And with the discount rate at 6 percent, there were some who were thinking that we had to do something with the discount rate to have a workable relationship But with the passage of time and with some comments that had been picked up by the market, I think they became reconciled to the reality that it does seem to be a workable arrangement "
1157,1991-05-14," [Statement--see Appendix]   It was quite strong in the 3-year, rather modest in the 10-year, and about average in the [30-year] bond The bond had really light coverage I think the major deficiency there was domestic demand; customer demand was really on the light side   There was, as you note, a botched bid; but it still would have been quite light coverage   The tail wouldn't have been as big, but--   We're working on it, Governor; we don't have it yet but I would say that even an automated system is not going to remove totally the possibility of botches from time to time   I don't remember specifically; I don't remember their being out of the [ordinary]   I'm a little surprised at the extent of it I think the big widening of spreads occurred, and particularly got exacerbated, during that somewhat scary year-end period when some genuine systemic concerns were beginning to emerge As it was clear that we were getting through that period and that the economy was, though in a downturn, not in utter collapse, I think there was reason to expect there would be some narrowing So, the fact of some narrowing shouldn't be any surprise; but the extent of it has been a little more than I would have predicted   It's very hard to sort out I think both of those factors are there, President Keehn Recently the most potent concern has been just the sheer supply But lurking in the background there is concern not so much about a lot of inflation expected but of recovery expected and concern that there will be more competing demands for long-term financing   There was that one occasion when the funds rate was sagging in mid-April and there was even some speculation beginning to build up that we were deliberately being tolerant of lower rates, and we thought it was good just to clear up those misperceptions by going in early one day And I think the market got that message quite clearly on that occasion Through virtually all the rest of the period the market seemed pretty clear in its perception of what they thought we basically were aiming for "
1210,1991-08-20," [Statement--see Appendix]   It has not presented any undue difficulty, President Parry I anticipate that it could make for slightly more volatility in the funds rate And if the Committee were to adopt a course that had a lower funds rate expectation than the discount rate, I would look even more for possible difficulty on that score But in the present situation, there is no particular difficulty   If we were expecting a lower funds rate than the discount rate?   I wouldn't think it would be a terribly serious problem even then I think you'd have to be reconciled to somewhat greater fluctuation in the funds rate   I would welcome, I think, some greater flexibility in the funds rate, although I recognize some of the counter arguments that Dave's paper referred to But I can think of instances where we have felt somewhat constrained by what was happening in the funds market from doing the reserve injection or reserve extraction that we thought ought to be done from a reserve management standpoint   Yes   Several times, I would say   Something like that   I don't think long term it has any really serious impact If a very big, unfilled need or a very big excess developed, it might cast its shadow over our operations in the next reserve period and, if there had been a desire to effect some policy change, it conceivably could have delayed that change I can't think of a specific instance when that occurred, but that's the kind of [situation] where I could imagine it having some undesirable effect But I don't regard it as a really serious impediment Just from a manager's standpoint in dealing with reserve positions, it has been a mild or moderate frustration at times to feel that we're hemmed in by the funds rate But I've gotten used to it [Laughter]   Yes, I guess so But we feel that the funds rate is a constraint at this time The reason we feel it is a constraint is that we don't want to mislead the markets [Unintelligible] I presume an approach that I might develop in consultation with Don Kohn and the Chairman "
1261,1991-10-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] "
1313,1991-11-05," [Statement--see Appendix] That concludes my report, Mr Chairman I do have a request on the intermeeting leeway    11/5/91   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Secretary's note Mr Sternlight recommended a temporary $2 billion increase in the leeway His remarks are included in his statement in the Appendix]   [Unintelligible]   Well, we think we have a moderate add need We didn't do anything today because funds were sitting right at 5  -38-    11/5/91  percent If we wanted to transmit a signal tomorrow, we probably could do overnight system repurchase agreements and it probably--   At our normal time   I don't know I'd have to think about that; I wouldn't be inclined to   I don't know My inclination would be to do something-- To go back to this question of damage, I don't see terrible damage from doing it, and I really have a lot of sympathy for what Governor Angell and others have said If there's a change in policy, it ought to be transmitted to the market Maybe I've been too close to the markets on this, but I think we'll get some adverse reactions   But as the Chairman has said, they're all big boys and they know that we're facing these policy decisions and could be acting They know we're having a meeting today   It probably is a better way to make sure the message gets across immediately I don't think it will remove some of the down side that I see I'm kind of swinging around in my own view "
1314,1991-11-05," Well, Mr Chairman, as I said in my statement, I think the market is looking for further easing probably a further 1/4 point on the funds rate and probably also a discount rate move That has to be on their minds as they bid on these Treasury offerings Yet, I can't escape the feeling that it's somehow potentially disruptive to have those changes actually implemented right within the period of bidding for the Treasury securities If something had been done early this morning, a couple of hours before they come up to bidding for the 3-year, so be it We did that in August, I believe, when a small change was implemented the morning of the 3-year auction We did get a certain number of complaints from    11/5/91  the market even about that But with a move that occurs right within the bidding period we would hear even more about it You can say, well, why wouldn't an easing move if anything be a plus for securities if they take them? But you have to remember that they're in the midst of a distribution process where they are shorting; they are selling on a ""when-issued"" basis the issues that are about to be bid for So, you could catch some market participants in that stage of having sold ""when issued"" to some customers with the expectation that they will then be putting a bid in the auction I think that's an awkward position to be leaving them in So, I have just a gut feeling that it's preferable to wait Now, how long should you wait? It seems to me Friday would be about the earliest that I could feel comfortable with I could even make a case for having it carry over to early next week But I would feel most strongly that it would be preferable not to implement a visible change just within these bidding days of today, Wednesday, or Thursday "
1372,1991-12-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, Secretary Brady acknowledged at a couple of recent Congressional hearings that they are looking at the question of the extent of their reliance [on them] He seemed to be trying to downplay the effects that might follow from that, noting it is only a modest portion of their net borrowings; 7-1/2 percent or so is done in the 30-year area I believe that, after a very sharp reaction following that first day's reference, a clarification came out [from the Treasury] to the effect that people should not look for them to abandon totally the long bonds So, the market was left with the impression that there might well be some scaling down but probably not an abandonment   Well, it has some resemblance, although in the case of Operation Twist there was a positive desire to see short- term rates higher as a balance-of-payments remedy; that element has not been present this time The Treasury might just [want to] leave both ends lower   We hear such a range of views that it would be hard to say whether there's a real coalescing I have heard very strongly put views from some in the bond market who think it would not do much good at all; and they are very troubled with the idea of tinkering with the Treasury's regularity and reliance on the long end On the other hand, there are some who feel that some modification could be useful and recommend it as at least a partial step   I think [the order] gets attention when there are changes   It gets the analysts' attention and they write about it in their market letters and so on "
1427,1992-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I'm commenting on it as I see it from the market's perspective of enormous Treasury issuance and still pretty heavy corporate issuance I realize that if you fold in everything, including the bank loan demand and so forth, that it's weak or not all that substantial But just from the standpoint of what the trading markets are coping with it has been substantial   Well, as I said, we are following up on those stories On the 7-year note we had a rather formal, organized roundup of additional information and have contacted a number of the dealers to talk specifically about how they are conducting their operations in that issue We've also had several conversations with respect to the December 5-year issue, which has been a kind of on and off special It went off and then in the last couple of days came back on special There, too, it has seemed to us that these were the results of understandable investment decisions by market participants We don't get any sense of market manipulation activity that, at least at this point, makes us feel that we have to proceed further in that vein   [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes   It's more a question, President Syron, of having ample holdings in the very short areas so that if on short notice we had to lighten our portfolio by substantial amounts within a matter of months or even weeks we could do that by either running off bill holdings or selling very short-term securities   Yes   There would be a disruptive effect if we sold large amounts in the longer end   Thank you   I do, President Melzer That makes me very leery of doing anything, as I say, very noticeable in that direction That's why I would suggest holding any greater effort in that vein very much at the margin   And I think it would have that effect That particular statistic on the average maturity is very dependent on how we handle not so much our market purchases but our rollovers and quarterly refundings We've tilted those quite strongly toward the short options That was what we had outlined as a plan to the Committee in the mid-1980s, following the discussions that Don alluded to And by virtue of steering our holdings very strongly toward the three-year option each time, that has tended to work, just as a factor in itself, to bring down that average maturity    3/31/92   Right "
1481,1992-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I'd like to make a recommendation on leeway for the next [intermeeting] period, Mr Chairman   [Statement--see Appendix] "
