6771,2002-01-29,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  John and I will be sharing  our briefing this morning, and we will be referring to the material that was handed out  earlier entitled “Board Staff Presentation on the Implications of the Zero Bound on  Nominal Interest Rates”  This afternoon, we will report on work that we have  undertaken in the past few years on the implications for monetary policy of the zero  bound on nominal interest rates  In these efforts, we have benefited from research  carried out by others at the Board, the Reserve Banks, and economists outside the  System  With short-term interest rates unusually low and the economy still weak, the  question arises as to what might happen if further deterioration were to set in   Specifically, might the Committee find itself pushing the funds rate to zero in the near  future, and wishing it could do more, in an attempt to combat rising unemployment  and falling inflation?  Your first exhibit presents one scenario illustrating how this  might occur     We start with the extended staff outlook that appeared in the Bluebook, shown as  the solid black lines in the panels In this baseline, as the economy continues to  recover past 2003, the need for monetary stimulus gradually diminishes, and so the  nominal funds rate rises to 4 percent by mid-decade  Now suppose share prices were  to drop almost 50 percent by this summer—a big drop to be sure, but one that would  still leave the P-E ratio for the S&P500 above its historical average  If the Committee  aggressively responded to weakening activity and the implied fall in the economy’s  equilibrium real rate, the nominal funds rate—the red line—would fall to zero  quickly Even so, and assuming the funds rate remained at zero for two years, the  FRB/US model predicts that the unemployment rate would still continue to climb  through 2003 and would not fall below 6 percent until late 2004  In response to such  heightened labor market slack, the downward trajectory of core CPI inflation would  be more pronounced than in the baseline As indicated by the first bullet in the  bottom panel, this scenario highlights a current vulnerability of monetary policy  In  some plausible future situations, you may not be able to take the nominal funds rate  as low as you would like So, while some deterioration in economic performance  following a stock market crash would be inevitable, the zero bound accentuates the  damage  This point is illustrated in the top and middle panels by the blue lines, which  show what would happen if it were possible to drive the funds rate below zero  In  this imaginary world, the nominal funds rate turns negative for a time, yielding a  smaller increase in the unemployment rate and less of a decline in inflation   2 Materials used by Mr Reifschneider and Mr Williams are appended to this document (appendix 2)                   January 29-30, 2002 Page 12 of 194  The fact that prices fall more rapidly when policy is constrained by the zero  bound has important consequences The reason is that declining inflation with the  nominal funds rate stuck at zero causes the real funds rate to rise—as the red line in  the middle right panel shows for late 2002 through early 2004  This unintended  policy tightening exacerbates the rise in unemployment and under extreme conditions  can become self-reinforcing  Still, the economy in this example does eventually  recover because the baseline outlook embodies strengthening demand and tightening  monetary policy, so that after a time the nominal funds rate is high enough to enable  policy to be quite stimulative if necessary—even if not quite as much as you might  like in all circumstances  But if the baseline outlook were for a much weaker  recovery and instead showed the nominal funds rate, say, remaining flat at its current  level, then the ability of the economy to right itself in the event of a major disturbance  would be called into question   Your next exhibit takes a more general look at the economics of the problems  posed by the zero bound In conducting our research, we have made three important  assumptions  First, we assume that monetary policy affects real activity in the short­ to-medium run primarily through its ability to move the current and anticipated level  of the real funds rate and, therefore, real bond rates and other asset prices through  arbitrage Second, we assume that the so-called quantity effects of monetary policy  are not that important; in particular, changes in the monetary base have little or no  direct influence on real activity or inflation  (I should note that Marvin will have  more to say on this subject) Third, we assume that inflation displays considerable  inertia and depends on inflation expectations and the level of resource utilization,  among other factors     As noted in the middle portion of the panel, under these assumptions the zero  bound has three main effects  First, it limits the monetary stimulus that can be  employed to offset a contractionary shock  If the nominal rate can go only as low as  zero, the real funds rate can be driven only to the negative of the current inflation rate   Second, the constraint on policymaker action causes resource utilization and the  inflation rate both to move lower than they otherwise would in the wake of an adverse  shock As was noted earlier, if the situation is severe enough, this can become a self- reinforcing downward spiral, with falling resource utilization pushing inflation down  further and falling inflation pushing real interest rates higher, putting yet more  downward pressure on resource utilization  Under extreme conditions, this  unintended erosion in the real funds rate will continue unchecked to produce a  deflationary trap   The practical importance of this threat to stability depends on several factors,  which are listed in the bottom portion of the panel  First, the less responsive are  output and inflation to changes in the real funds rate, the greater the amount of  maneuvering room needed to offset any disturbances that might come along  Second,  the greater the magnitude and persistence of shocks hitting the economy, the greater  the range of funds-rate variation required to maintain stable employment and                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 13 of 194  inflation Third, the slower a central bank moves to head off excessive economic  weakness, the greater the risk that a deflationary spiral will develop  Lastly, the  lower the average amount of room to adjust the funds rate, the greater the risk of  being constrained by the zero bound In part, the size of this average cushion is  outside your control, because it depends on the real interest rate consistent with stable  inflation and full employment in the long run—our so-called r*  However, you can  influence the cushion’s size through your choice of how low to drive the average rate  of inflation   Your next exhibit provides a quantitative assessment of the implications of the  zero bound for economic stability  This assessment closely follows the approach that  we took two years ago in the paper that we prepared for the System conference on the  subject and that was distributed to you last week  As noted in the upper panel, our  goal is to estimate the effect on average economic performance of lowering the target  rate of inflation which, as I just noted, influences the relevance of the zero bound   Our approach to estimating these effects is to simulate FRB/US, subject to random  shocks similar to those experienced over the past thrity-five years  In these  simulations, we assume that households and firms form their expectations in a  forward-looking manner that takes full account of the systematic behavior of  monetary policy By simulating the model over and over, we can compile a large set  of pseudo “histories” of the economy, from which we calculate statistics on average  performance  We run each of these simulations under the assumption that monetary  policy responds to changes in economic conditions according to the Taylor rule, in  which the nominal funds rate, denoted by “I”, is set equal to the sum of four terms—  the equilibrium real interest rate r*, the rate of inflation, one-half the current output  gap, and one-half the difference between actual and target inflation    Two main lessons from this exercise are summarized in the middle panel  First, at  low target rates of inflation, the funds rate falls to zero frequently  This can be seen  in line 1 of the table at the bottom of the page, which shows the percent of time the  funds rate is at zero for three different core CPI inflation targets—0 percent,  2 percent, and 4 percent Our simulated policymaker puts the nominal funds rate at  zero nearly 30 percent of the time with an inflation target of zero, but only about  10 percent of the time with an inflation target of 2 percent and only 3 percent of the  time if the target is 4 percent  Returning to the middle panel, the second lesson to  come out of these simulations is that economic performance deteriorates in our model  when the inflation target is below 2 percent or so  One manifestation of this  deterioration is an increase in the variability of the unemployment rate, shown in line  2 of the table As the target inflation rate rises from zero to 2 percent, the standard  deviation of the unemployment rate drops sharply from 18 to 15 percentage points   But a further increase in the inflation target to 4 percent has only a small effect on the  standard deviation of the unemployment rate  A similar break in performance at an  inflation target of about 2 percent is evident in line 3, which shows the frequency of  deep recessions Here, the number of major downturns expected per 100 years falls  from 5¼ to about 4½ when the inflation target is raised from zero to 2 percent but  then slips by only a small amount if the target is raised further to 4 percent  Although                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 14 of 194  these numerical results are specific to the FRB/US model, other models yield  qualitatively similar findings  John Williams will now continue our presentation   One of the unnerving things about working on this is exactly   the problem that you pointed to at first, which is that we have models that were fit over a period   where we didn’t hit the zero bound at any point in time  Now we’re running simulations in   which we drive the nominal fed funds rate into a region where there’s a very pronounced   nonlinearity, the zero bound When we run the model—and as you said, it’s a mostly linear   model, although we can run it in ways that have certain nonlinearities in it—at that point it’s not   linear, and all sorts of odd things start happening  We worried a lot about how far to push these   results and how generally applicable they are because certain changes to the model can make the   problem less severe and certain changes to the model can make the problem a lot more severe    We listed some of those at the beginning of our remarks     If you think that the economy in terms of real activity is a lot more interest sensitive than   we have built into the model, then you’d be more sanguine about the zero-bound problem  In   that regard I’m fairly confident that we’re probably okay because interest sensitivity in our   model, if anything, tends to be on the high side of what a lot of people think  The area in which   we often get into the most discussion with other people about whether we’ve got it right is   inflation dynamics in the model  If you think that inflation dynamics don’t work this way and   you believe that some other mechanism comes into play—and one possibility here is that   increasing the growth in the monetary base would have a direct effect on inflation expectations—   that’s a very different world than the one portrayed by the model  In terms of expectations—   how people would respond to rates hitting the zero bound and what they would think about   where policy is going—we have agents behaving very rationally in the model  Under some              January 29-30, 2002 Page 25 of 194  conditions, these rational expectations stabilize the system, and under some circumstances they   actually lead the system to instability because people look at the situation and say “Oh my   heavens, policymakers are getting themselves into a problem that they can’t get out of”  In   running the simulations, in order to keep the model from crashing into “great depression”   scenarios when expectations become this pessimistic, we have to have operating in the   background the assumption that under very extreme conditions the fiscal authorities come to the   rescue   Under other expectational assumptions it is possible to have a situation where the   problem would be less severe because people don’t realize the trouble they could get into  They   don’t realize the implications of the situation, and that particular form of ignorance or rule of   thumb behavior is actually stabilizing  One can envision other examples where people   extrapolate forward and don’t see the potential for getting out of this difficulty in some of the   ways we discussed, and as a result things are a lot worse    So my general remark on this is that we did the best we could, though we’re extremely   uncertain about what would actually take place at the zero bound  Our only real guide is to look   back at either the Great Depression of the United States or at the more recent experience of   Japan Taking the Japanese experience, we at least know that if we hit the zero bound it leads to   a poorer macro performance than we would like  So in that sense we think it’s a real problem    Whether it’s as severe as it becomes in some of our simulations is something I’m not so sure   about   I think I agree—I’ll speak for myself and John can chime in—   with everything you said One point we deliberately didn’t emphasize in our presentation is that   following the generally more aggressive rule produces behavior for the last year that looks   remarkably like the decline in the fed funds rate that actually occurred  Now, I’m not saying that   that’s how monetary policy was made last year  But it just so happens that if you had been using   that kind of rule and you thought that was how policy behaved, you wouldn’t have been   surprised by the speed at which the fed funds rate came down in 2001  So in that sense, your   view is broadly consistent with the model we presented     Second, the Committee probably would never want to go as low as the zero inflation   target for core CPI shown in our example because of the bias in it and for all sorts of other   reasons And if you thought that core PCE inflation of 1½ percent seemed okay, well that’s   equivalent to the 2 percent that we were talking about  So that’s the same  Finally, I don’t know   how enthusiastic we really are about the promise to run higher inflation down the road that we   show as one strategy I think our view would be that it certainly wouldn’t hurt, and at least it     January 29-30, 2002 Page 32 of 194  would be better than some of the public statements made by Bank of Japan officials when they   assured the public that they weren’t going to let inflation get out of hand  I’m not sure there was   much point in saying that I suspect it was counterproductive, although it may not have done any   great harm  In any event, it’s not wise for the central bank to say that it is in favor of staying   with a zero inflation target under those deflationary circumstances   So a ten-year bond would be pricing in a deflation rate of   5 percent five years out, but it would also be pricing in an inflation rate that would be back to   zero ten years out   That’s why that never actually occurs in a simulation  While   you could be driving down expected long-run rates on a riskless security close to zero, for   private investment these endogenous risk premiums are going up because the health of the   economy is not good in that state of the world  So I think in principle, if you could somehow get   rid of that risk, you could mitigate these slumps by quite a bit in that world  But what   exacerbates those slumps in the world that we’re simulating here is that the risk premiums on   private assets—the default premiums—are rising  And that’s not a small effect, actually   It might even have been more than one-for-one because the   expected default risks might have been dropping under those conditions  "
7846,2007-01-30,"4  Thank you, Governor Kohn  Brian Doyle, Vincent  Reinhart, and I will be speaking this morning on the material labeled “Staff Presentation  on Producing and Publishing Economic Forecasts”  As the top panel of your first  exhibit notes, the Federal Reserve regularly provides the public with information on  the outlook in the Monetary Policy Report, congressional testimony, the FOMC  minutes, and the statement  You presumably undertake this effort with an eye toward  advancing the goals of economic performance, public discourse, your own internal  discourse, and efficient operations  A key issue in your deliberations today is  whether changing your practices in this area would advance these goals further or  achieve a better tradeoff  As shown in the bottom panel, this morning Brian, Vincent,  and I will address three questions related to this issue  I will start with the production  and publication options that are open to the Committee  Brian will then discuss what  we can learn from the international experience  Finally, Vincent will consider the  governance issues that would arise under alternative arrangements     Many ways of changing your current practices are possible  Exhibit 2 focuses on   one fundamental choice that you confront in this regard—namely, how to produce the  forecast  As noted in the top panel, you have three main options  First, you could  continue to produce independent forecasts, with each of you solely responsible for  your own forecast  Second, you could choose to produce a single centralized  forecast, working together as the whole Committee or delegating responsibility to a  subcommittee  Finally, you could adopt an intermediate position and produce                                                     4 Material used by Mr Reifschneider, Mr Doyle, and Mr Reinhart is appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   January 30-31, 2007 133 of 255    coordinated forecasts, with your individual projections conditioned on common  assumptions for factors such as oil prices and fiscal policy     As highlighted in the bottom panel, your choice among these three options has   important implications for, among other things, your communications with the public  and the operational cost of forecast-related activities  To see this, consider one  important communication task, the telling of the central story of the outlook  As  noted in the first row under the independent option, distilling an informative message  from multiple forecasts is difficult, even if those forecasts provide a considerable  amount of detail about the outlook  In fact, it is an open question as to whether it  would always be possible to craft a central narrative that would command the consent  of a majority of the Committee, given the diversity of your views  Moving to the  right, the distillation task under the coordinated approach might be simplified a bit  because your individual forecasts would share some common elements   Nevertheless, telling the central story would remain difficult if, after settling on, say,  a common path for oil prices, you still disagreed markedly about its economic  implications  In contrast, as the rightmost entry notes, the telling of the central story  would be relatively easy under the centralized option because—abstracting from the  difficulties of producing such a forecast—the single projection would provide a clear  and coherent message     Your production choice has important implications for another communication   task—conveying the diversity of views on the Committee about the outlook  As  noted in the second row of the table, the independent option naturally reveals this  diversity through your individual forecasts  To a large degree, the same is true under  the coordinated option, although conditioning on common assumptions would  obscure some of the possible sources of diversity  Finally, the centralized option  would not reveal the diversity of your thinking unless the published outlook summary  included additional comments about alternative views     Your production choice also has important implications for the operational costs   of both producing and publishing the forecast  Forecast production is a relatively  low-cost task under the independent option because you incur no expense in  coordinating your forecasting efforts  Still, you could find yourselves devoting more  resources to forecasting if you chose to publish your individual projections  Moving  to the coordinated option, here preparing the forecast would be more costly because  you would need to spend time choosing a common set of assumptions, but you could  limit these costs if you settled on a standard process for this task  Finally, producing  a centralized forecast would be very costly, especially at first, because of the wide  range of economic issues on which you would need to reach consensus  Given the  practical difficulties of achieving such agreement with a group as large as the FOMC,  making this option feasible might require delegating the preparation of the unified  projection to a subcommittee     Finally, there are the operational costs of forecast publication  This task may be   burdensome under the independent option, especially if all of you wish to participate   January 30-31, 2007 134 of 255    actively in the preparation of the text as you now do with the minutes  In fact, given  the inherent difficulty of crafting an accurate and informative central message from  multiple forecasts, negotiating the language of an outlook summary as a group would  likely be even more time-consuming than preparing the minutes if the summary is to  be anything more than a bare-bones listing of numbers  Publishing the forecast under  the coordinated option also may be burdensome, for the same reasons  However,  choosing the centralized option could make forecast publication less costly, partly  because you would already have reached agreement on the economic factors  influencing the outlook  You could reduce costs further if you delegated  responsibility for both producing and summarizing the forecast to a subcommittee     The top panel of your next exhibit considers some of your many publication   choices  If you choose to continue producing individual forecasts, you could release  more information about those projections—for example, by publishing the forecasts  themselves  Such a step would reveal more about the diversity of your thinking,  although it might risk diverting attention from any consensus about the outlook   Another option available under all three production choices would be to provide more  forecast details, either numerically or in qualitative form  Such a step would facilitate  telling a more informative story about the outlook, although it would also create  additional dimensions for disagreement  A third possibility would be to lengthen the  forecast period  This step could reveal more fully how you expect any economic  shocks and imbalances to play out and thus might enhance public understanding of  the basis for your policy actions; it could also provide more information about your  policy objectives and expectations for the long run  A fourth possibility would be to  publish information about the outlook more frequently than you now do  Such a  change might help to clarify how you see the forecast and monetary policy  responding to incoming data, but it would also increase operational costs  proportionately  Finally, you have the option of publishing fan charts and confidence  intervals for your projections  This information could help to emphasize the inherent  uncertainty of the outlook and the conditionality of monetary policy  Before you  could take this step, however, you would have to settle some issues involving the  empirical basis of this material     The bottom panel of the exhibit addresses two options that you have for setting   the projected federal funds rate  The first option is to condition the outlook on what  you see as “appropriate” monetary policy  If you produce independent forecasts, each  of you would continue to make this determination on your own, but under the  centralized approach and perhaps the coordinated one, you would need to do this as a  group  As noted in the first bullet point, publishing details on what you see as the  appropriate path of the fed funds rate could facilitate telling a more informative story  about the role played by monetary policy in the outlook  Describing your policy  assumptions qualitatively might achieve this objective; alternatively, you could  release, say, the central tendency of your specific fed funds rate projections  One  possible drawback to publishing an “appropriate” policy path is that the public might  misinterpret it as a promise, especially at first; for this reason, you might wish to pair  any published fed funds rate path with information on forecast uncertainty  Releasing   January 30-31, 2007 135 of 255    information on the fed funds rate might also generate public criticism and political  pressures     A second option for setting monetary policy is to condition the outlook on a flat   fed funds rate or on the path consistent with market expectations  This approach  might mitigate some of the misinterpretation and political problems associated with  the release of an appropriate policy path  However, conditioning the outlook on such  a path would alter the nature of the forecast and so create communication challenges   In particular, your forecasts would no longer represent your best guess for the likely  evolution of the economy, to the extent that a flat fed funds rate or a market-based  path differs from what you, individually or as a group, think will be necessary  For  this reason, the forecast summary would require some statement about the desirability  of the projected outcome to avoid misunderstanding  You might even find it  necessary to provide guidance about how the policy path would have to change to  bring about a more “appropriate” outcome—a step that would likely generate its own  controversies  I will now turn the floor over to Brian     "
8132,2008-01-29,"2  Give me one second  On balance, the news we have  received since the December Greenbook has been disappointing  The top panel of  your first exhibit sorts some of the main indicators into two categories—those that  were surprisingly weak and those that came in to the upside of our expectations  As  you can see, the list to the left is long  Private payrolls fell in December, and the  unemployment rate jumped to 5 percent  Manufacturing output has declined since the  summer  Single-family housing starts, new permits, and home sales have fallen  further  New orders and shipments of capital goods were disappointing, although a  little less so after today’s release of December data  Business sentiment deteriorated,  joining already unusually low readings on consumer confidence  Finally, stock prices  have tumbled, and credit conditions have tightened  Not all the news was bad   Nonresidential construction activity has continued to be surprisingly robust, and  defense spending looks to have been higher last quarter than we anticipated   Moreover, retail sales in November came in stronger than we predicted, and the  figures for September and October were revised up  Overall, we read the incoming                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Reifschneider, Ms Liang, and Mr Sheets are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)    January 29–30, 2008 20 of 249    data as implying an increased risk of recession  The middle left panel provides some  evidence for this assessment  As was discussed at yesterday’s Board briefing, based  on the signal provided by 85 nonfinancial indicators (the black line), the estimated  probability of being in recession now or over the next six months stood at 45 percent  in December, up from 19 percent in June  A similar exercise carried out using 20  financial indicators, the red line, yields an even bigger jump in the estimated  likelihood of recession, from 14 percent at midyear to 63 percent this month       As you know, we are not forecasting a recession  While the model estimates of   the probability of recession have moved up, they are not uniform in their assessment  that a recession is at hand  Another argument against forecasting recession is that,  with the notable exception of housing, we see few signs of a significant inventory  overhang  In addition, the recent weakness in the labor market and spending  indicators is still limited; for example, initial claims have drifted down in recent  weeks rather than surging as they typically do in a major downturn  Finally, a good  deal of monetary and fiscal stimulus is now in process that should help support real  activity  That said, it was a close call for us  Even without a recession, our  assessment of the underlying strength of aggregate demand has revised down  markedly since the summer  This is illustrated in the bottom panel by the recent  decline in the Greenbook-consistent estimate of short-run r*, the value of the real  funds rate that would close the output gap in 12 quarters  By our estimate, short-run  r* has fallen more than 2 percentage points since the middle of last year and  1¼ percentage points since December  A jump in the equity premium accounts for  most of the downward revision since the last Greenbook, although a further  deterioration in the outlook for residential investment is also a factor     Your next exhibit summarizes the current forecast  So, how did we respond to all   this bad news?  As shown in the panel at the top, we boosted real GDP growth a little  from 2007 through 2009  In 2008 and 2009, however, this faster growth is not  demand driven but instead reflects upward revisions to the supply side of our forecast  that I will discuss in a moment  For 2007, the upward revision to real GDP in the  fourth quarter—noted in the panel to the right—reflects the stronger data on  nonresidential construction, defense spending, and retail sales that I just mentioned   However, because the incoming data point to a weaker trajectory for real activity in  the near term, we have trimmed our forecast of GDP growth for the first half of 2008,  and we have marked down final sales growth (not shown) quite a bit  Beyond the  middle of the year, we project real output to expand at a rate close to its potential   Under these conditions, we project greater labor market slack than in December, with  the unemployment rate—shown in the middle left panel—now expected to edge up to  5¼ percent by next year  And as shown in the bottom two panels, we continue to  expect both core and total PCE prices to decelerate noticeably by 2009, although  inflation this year is likely to run a little higher than we previously projected       Your next exhibit provides an overview of some of the key factors influencing the   outlook  As shown in the upper left panel, we conditioned our forecast on an  additional 50 basis point cut in the funds rate at this meeting and then held it flat at   January 29–30, 2008 21 of 249    3 percent  We made this revision in response to the weaker underlying level of  demand in this projection but with an eye to keeping inflation on a long-run path to  1¾ percent—the midpoint of the range of 2010 inflation projections that you  provided in October  Another key element in the outlook is our assumption that  concerns over financial stability and a possible recession will begin to abate once the  economy gets through a rough patch in the first half of this year  As Nellie will  discuss in more detail, this assumption implies that risk premiums on bonds and  corporate equity should drift down over time  As a result, we project that equity  prices, shown to the right, will stage a partial recovery over the second half of 2008  and in 2009  These and other financial market developments, coupled with an  improvement in business and consumer sentiment, should help to support  consumption and investment over time     As regards fiscal policy, odds now seem high for the passage of a fiscal stimulus   package, although the details are still up in the air  As a placeholder, we built a  $125 billion package into the baseline, with two components—$75 billion in tax  rebates that households will receive in the third quarter and a 30 percent one-year  bonus depreciation allowance that should cost the Treasury about $50 billion in 2008   Our judgment is that the rebate component will provide a significant, albeit  temporary, boost to the level of consumer spending during the second half of this year  and in early 2009, the period over which we expect most households to spend their  checks  In contrast, we think that bonus depreciation will have only a small effect on  equipment and software outlays  As indicated by the blue bars in the panel to the  right, these assumptions imply a large fiscal-driven contribution from PCE and E&S  to real GDP growth in the second half of this year, followed by a similar-sized  negative contribution in the first half of 2009  As a result, the long-run contribution  to real GDP growth from these two factors is essentially zero  We have assumed that  inventories and imports in the short run will offset a substantial fraction of the swings  in domestic demand, thereby muting the overall effect of the fiscal package on real  GDP growth (the green bars)     As I noted earlier, we also have reassessed our supply-side assumptions—shown   in the bottom left panel  Specifically, we have raised our estimate of potential output  growth from 2005 to 2009 about ¼ percentage point per year, partly in response to  the solid gains in output per hour recorded last year  These revised estimates have  two important implications  First, the upward revision to potential output translates  roughly one for one into faster growth in actual output during the projection period  because of its implications for permanent income and hence consumption and  investment  Second, the revisions to potential output in history imply that the output  gap—shown to the right—currently is lower than we previously thought, and we  expect it to remain lower     Your next exhibit provides some details on the real-side outlook  As shown in the   top left panel, we have once again revised down the projection for new home sales in  light of weak incoming data, including those received after we put the Greenbook to  bed  However, we continue to expect that sales will reach bottom in the first half of   January 29–30, 2008 22 of 249    this year and then begin to edge up as mortgage credit availability improves  This  stabilization in demand should allow single-family housing starts (shown to the right)  to level out at about 660,000 units by midyear, well below our December projection   Thereafter, we anticipate a slow pickup in starts  As shown in the middle left panel,  builders still have a long way to go to bring the backlog of unsold homes down to a  more comfortable level, and this overhang should restrain construction activity into  next year  We have also revised down the near-term outlook for real business fixed  investment—the middle right panel—in response to slowing sales, tighter credit  conditions, and some deterioration of business sentiment, but we now expect a greater  cyclical rebound starting in the second half of this year as overall conditions start to  improve  The bottom left panel shows our projection for consumption, the blue bars,  together with the profile for spending excluding the effects of fiscal stimulus, the  green bars  Absent the stimulus package, we would expect consumer spending to  increase only 1 percent this year but then to pick up around 2¼ percent in 2009 as  confidence recovers and credit conditions ease  However, the tax rebates will likely  obscure this cyclical pattern by inducing saw-tooth swings in spending, with actual  growth realigning with longer-run fundamentals only in the second half of next year   As shown to the right, some of these fundamentals are less favorable than before; we  estimate that wealth effects will hold down PCE spending growth by ½ percentage  point this year and almost ¾ percentage point in 2009       Your next exhibit reviews the inflation outlook  As indicated by the blue line in   the upper left panel, monthly readings on core PCE inflation have moved up since the  summer  We are inclined to take only a small signal from this movement, much as  we did early last year when price increases were unusually subdued  In part, this is  because a portion of the recent pickup was attributable to the erratic nonmarket  component and quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in this category tend to fade away  quickly  In addition, while market-based prices also came in higher than expected,  we are interpreting some of that surprise as a reversal of some earlier low readings in  particular categories  That said, we also think that a portion represents somewhat  more persistent inflation pressure coming into 2008  We project both core and total  PCE inflation to moderate over time because of several factors  To begin with,  futures prices for crude oil imply the sharp deceleration in energy prices shown to the  right  We also expect food prices (the middle left panel) to decelerate into 2009,  partly as result of the increased production of beef and poultry that is now under way   In addition, the impetus to inflation from core import prices (the middle right panel)  should diminish over time, although by less than projected in December because we  now anticipate a faster rate of dollar depreciation  These developments, coupled with  the additional economic slack built into this projection, should help to keep inflation  expectations anchored, allowing actual inflation to fall below 2 percent in the longer  run  Indeed, survey measures of long-run inflation expectations (the blue and red  lines of the bottom left panel) remain stable  TIPS inflation compensation (the black  line) jumped following the intermeeting fed funds rate cut, as Bill pointed out  But as  was discussed in the memo by Jonathan Wright and Jennifer Roush that was  circulated to the Committee, we are inclined to attribute most of this increase to  changes in inflation risk and liquidity premiums, not to a rise in inflation expectations   January 29–30, 2008 23 of 249    per se  Putting all this together, we project core inflation—the first column of the  panel to the right—to remain at 21 percent this year but then to drop down to 19  percent next year, the same as in December  Similarly, we continue to expect that  headline inflation will slow to 2¼ percent this year and slide to 1¾ percent in 2009 as  energy prices moderate  I will now turn the floor over to Nellie        Do you want me to take that last question, or do you want to?    Go ahead    The only thing I would add to Brian’s statement is that I think   uncertainty about inflation in the long run could be moving up noticeably without really bringing   into play disinflation or something like that  In other words, you could be more worried about going   down to 1½ or 1¼ than you were before—I don’t know—it could be more just as it was in the   forecast      On job destruction versus a slower pace of new job creation, it’s   hard to answer that one  Some of those patterns have changed over time; and in monitoring labor   market developments, we’re trying to keep track of those two elements and that sort of thing    Whether that would materially change the way we would look at, say, just what payroll employment   growth was doing, it would still be one of our main reads coming in  As to exactly how that worked   January 29–30, 2008 35 of 249    out behind it, I’m not sure it would make too much of a difference  I don’t know whether Dave   might want to add something to that    In terms of the rationale for increasing potential going back   over history, some of that, as I think I mentioned, was just that actual productivity performance   has been better than the last time we reviewed this in the summer, and we are taking that on   board  That is part of the motivation  Another part of the motivation is what we perceive is a   somewhat growing tension between the way we saw labor market slack developing and the way   we were looking at slack in terms of the product side through the output gap  We had arrived at   a point this round where those tensions had increased over time, and this revision mitigates some   of that tension, so those two things are in better alignment with each other  We also were taking   the opportunity, when we opened up, to look at some other technical factors we used that get   involved in going from, say, the nonfarm business sector to GDP, that sort of thing, and those   also pushed us in the direction of being a bit more optimistic on growth going back  So we did   view it, if you look at it in terms of product markets, as that there was more slack now than we   had previously been thinking and that there was also more slack in the labor market—but that   was from the actual data that came in  Going forward, we have more slack  We have more slack   just in the labor market because we have revised up the unemployment rate  With that, and   taking on board these assumptions of potential output, we have more slack on the output side   Now, one question would be, to address your second question, how would things have   changed if we hadn’t taken that on board?  Well, going forward, we would have written down a   lower GDP forecast because what we are really saying here is that it is not that households and   firms have changed their perceptions; this is just us, the poor econometricians, trying to infer   what is out there in the real world  So the poor econometricians have inferred that potential   January 29–30, 2008 45 of 249    output is growing stronger  We have to look at it and say, “Well, so the prospects going forward   for permanent incomes, corporate earnings, and that sort of thing, will be stronger, and that   implies basically a one-for-one ratcheting up”  If we had said, “Well, no, potential output   growth going forward won’t be stronger,” we would have revised down the GDP growth rate   with it, so there wouldn’t have been any change in the output gap from that  That would have   been shifting one for one  It wouldn’t have changed our sense of what resource utilization would   be going forward      The path of the gap would have been to a first approximation   unchanged going forward  Some of the greater resource utilization now and going forward is a   combination of the fact that we haven’t really changed our view on the labor market, aside from   once we took on board the new unemployment rate data, but that we did change on the product   market  Going forward, the way it evolves further on, we see the labor market gap opening up a   little more and the output gap opening up a little more—that is driven primarily by our sense that   the economy in an underlying sense is weaker—and we have made an adjustment for that with   the monetary policy assumption  But it is not quite enough  We haven’t lowered the funds rate   as much as we would have needed to do to totally wipe out that fact and keep resource utilization   constant going forward on the product side  This is a difficult question  It was a difficult one for   us, definitely, going through it because we had many moving parts    If you think about the forecast as resource utilization and   inflation, then it has an effect on resource utilization that is bigger now going forward in the   product market  We also see a bigger effect in the labor market, and if that were the only thing,   it would have put more downward pressure—but not a lot—on inflation  But as I mentioned, we   are coming into this forecast with somewhat worse inflation performance lately, and we think   that has some persistence  So that is helping balance it out    No, it is not separate; the equity premium is a large reason that   we had the big drop in stock values    Mostly, but not totally    I would say a couple of things  One, you can think of the cost   of raising capital through equity as having some small influence on business investment  That is   pretty small  The big effect would be primarily on consumption, as you mentioned  Wealth   January 29–30, 2008 47 of 249    effects to a smaller extent would affect housing as well  But I think of that as a wealth channel    But there is a bit of a cost-of-capital effect through raising funds through equity that you might   think of as well  Another thing I would say is that the difficulty here is distinguishing the equity   premium from general risk concerns, risk premiums in general, or increased compensation for   higher risk or default risk in a number of these credit spreads we are talking about; those are sort   of related  It is hard to keep these things separate in any kind of an accounting  Also, these   things tend to be correlated with consumer and business sentiment  Again, that is another thing   that is hard to keep separate    It might not happen  I mean, you could have a situation in   which business sentiment would not take a hit, for example, simultaneously with the stock   market tumbling, and you would not see some risk premiums on bonds going up  That would be   very unusual    That is operating here very much  It is the same mechanism,   but it works differently in the two cases, because in the case where the recession actually shows   up, whether you take the gradualist approach or you take the risk-management approach, they   see the recession, and the easing in monetary policy doesn’t surprise them very much, although   we can take our risk-management approach and respond a bit more than usual  But then, things   behave as they expect, and so not too much happens to inflation expectations  In the other case,   in which recession doesn’t emerge, they say, “Oh, this was an easing that wasn’t expected,” and   then it becomes critical how long you hold it  If you hold it and you get rid of it only gradually,   then inflation expectations start to shift up  They think the Fed’s inflation goal has changed  In   the case where you take it away quickly, they say, “Okay, you took it away quickly,” and so not   much happens to long-run inflation expectations     In both cases  But the question is whether it is viewed in the   context of what is happening to output and inflation, whether they say, “Yes, that fits with the   January 29–30, 2008 111 of 249    historical pattern of stabilization,” or whether, because the recession didn’t emerge, this looks as   though it was after the fact an ease in policy that was not warranted  Then the question is, Do   you take it away quickly, or do you take it away slowly?      No, they don’t know that you are more likely to reverse course   in that case  So when you think of a communication strategy, which is not in these simulations,   it says, “Oh, we’re going to do this, but in the event that the recession doesn’t occur, we will take   it away more quickly than we might have based on historical averages”  But it doesn’t make too   much difference in the simulation, because it is taken quickly  Just because the funds rate is   down surprisingly low for a quarter or two, that is not long enough to have much of an effect on   long-run inflation expectations in that simulation  What it would do in the real world is different    "
8274,2008-08-05,"  I’ll take that because we did have a bit of an internal debate on   that issue awhile back  In particular, Spencer Dale, who was visiting us from the Bank of England,   was basically making exactly the same point you’re making and raising that issue    No    One test is whether in previous periods of financial stress like   this, we saw what might be more upward inflation pressure than we otherwise could explain or   productivity performance that we had trouble explaining  After looking at the experience during the   early 1990s in the headwinds period and trying to think about the likely magnitude of the effects of   such a productivity shock coming out of the financial system, we decided that you could see a   negative productivity shock of that sort going on but that its effects are overwhelmed by the fallout   from its effect on demand  So although there might be some negative productivity shock, on net it   turns out to be more of a disinflationary effect  But we also had difficulty seeing it show up in   productivity data  That said, that would be extremely hard for us to find  You know, it could be   there, and we just couldn’t find it    We’ve made no explicit adjustment for that in the potential output   assumptions we have going in  Looking back, it was hard to see that there was much, if any, effect,   but that’s a risk knowing that there could be some productivity effect and it’s just hard to find   August 5, 2008 25 of 145     There’s one minor qualification to what David just said  We do   keep track of rough estimates of what we think that the rise in energy prices over the past few years   is possibly doing to trend productivity, and we’ve come up with estimates that maybe it’s 01  We   think that effect has been ongoing, and it is built into the data  In some sense it’s occurring, and so   in some sense it’s in our trend estimates  It is not as though our trends aren’t implicitly taking in the   fact that there’s an ongoing loss in productivity associated with rising energy prices    Well, basically you can just stop there  [Laughter]  It’s the   tradeoff between the two  Obviously, if you were more concerned about inflation outcomes than   real activity outcomes, you might tilt it a different way    Yes   August 5, 2008 28 of 145     Yes  "
8474,2009-03-17," The top panel of your next exhibit reviews the basic  channels through which buying agency MBS or long-term Treasury securities  potentially influences the real economy  The primary mechanism is through a broad  improvement in financial conditions  As Joe discussed, such purchases reduce yields  on the targeted securities In addition, the evidence suggests that these reductions  spill over to yields on corporate bonds and other long-term instruments; if so, these  interest rate movements should spark higher equity prices and a lower real exchange  rate In turn, household spending, business investment, and net exports should  strengthen in response to lower borrowing costs, higher wealth, and greater  international price competitiveness   As illustrated in the middle panel, the stimulus from an LSAP program hinges on  the extent of financial spillover  The table shows a sequence of predictions from the  FRB/US model for the response of real GDP to purchasing a further $500 billion in  agency MBS, assuming successively greater spillovers  As shown in line 1, even                            March 17–18, 2009 12 of 266  though the program is assumed to lower MBS yields and mortgage rates by 75 basis  points, the boost to the level of real GDP would be small in the absence of any  spillover to other financial markets  But if, as in line 2, the fall in MBS yields leads  to lower corporate bond yields and other interest rates, the boost to the level of real  GDP climbs to ½ percent by 2011  Expanding the spillovers yet further to the stock  market (line 3) and the real exchange rate (line 4) more than doubles the amount of  stimulus, to roughly 1 percent by 2011   Other simulations, not shown here, suggest that the stimulus provided by  purchases of long-term Treasury securities also is highly sensitive to the extent of  financial spillover But if such purchases were to reduce the general level of interest  rates, boost equity prices, and lower the dollar, then the resultant stimulus to real  activity would be only modestly lower than that provided by an MBS-only program,  as indicated in the memo line of the table   As noted in the bottom left panel, these FRB/US simulations do not capture all the  potential ways in which an LSAP program could stimulate real activity  For example,  lower mortgage rates could boost home prices, thereby stimulating household wealth  and spending Theoretical calculations suggest that a percentage point decline in  interest rates could boost house prices as much as 15 percent; however, empirical  estimates suggest that the increase might be closer to 2½ percent  In addition, lower  interest rates might, via mortgage refinancing, transfer income to cash-strapped  borrowers from more affluent households who are net lenders  Calculations suggest  that such income transfers could provide a modest boost to consumption  As  indicated by the red line in the figure to the right, when refi effects and 2½ percent  higher house prices are incorporated into the FRB/US simulations, the stimulus from  a $1 trillion LSAP program—evenly divided between Treasuries and MBS—rises  noticeably Effects are larger yet if house prices increase by the theoretical 15  percent (the green line)   Turning to your next exhibit, these results imply that asset purchases have the  potential to compensate for the inability of conventional monetary policy to ease  further As noted to the left, the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will remain  essentially at the zero bound for several years, as illustrated by the black line to the  right But unconstrained “optimal” monetary policy would call for the fed funds rate  to fall even lower, were that possible (the red line)  To overcome this shortfall in  conventional monetary policy would require additional fiscal and unconventional  monetary actions   The middle panels illustrate how the Greenbook outlook for unemployment and  inflation might change if the Committee opted to expand the current program of  buying agency debt and MBS by either $500 billion (the red line) or $1 trillion (the  green line) Under the smaller program, all the additional purchases are MBS; under  the larger program, purchases are evenly divided between MBS and long-term  Treasury securities Both programs are assumed to generate a full range of financial  spillovers but no boost to home prices or any increase in consumption from                                 March 17–18, 2009 13 of 266  refi-related income transfers; in addition, monetary policy in both cases is set  “optimally,” subject to the zero lower bound constraint  As shown to the left, both  programs limit the rise in the unemployment rate and cause it to fall more quickly  than in the baseline (the black line)  All told, the larger program fills roughly half of  the gap between the staff forecast and what hypothetically would occur under  unconstrained monetary policy (the blue line)  As shown to the right, both programs  would also mitigate the fall in inflation that is projected in the baseline   The bullet points at the bottom offer a few caveats to this analysis  First, these  results depend importantly on extensive financial spillover effects; unfortunately,  empirical evidence on the size of stock market and exchange rate effects is slim   Second, gauging the economic effects of further asset purchases is quite difficult  under current conditions, even if extensive financial spillovers do occur  In  particular, households and firms may be reluctant to increase spending in the face of  so much uncertainty, and credit constraints may limit their ability to respond to  improved financial conditions; alternatively, cash-strapped households may be more  responsive than normal to any boost to income provided by an LSAP program   Finally, the effectiveness of an LSAP program in stopping an unwelcome disinflation  might be greater than the simulations indicate if large-scale asset purchases directly  bolster the Fed’s credibility  I’ll now turn the presentation back to Joe   Yes   There is a funny distortion, but I think in some sense it can   almost be a distraction  One of the problems we had was—and we talked about this when we   wrote this down—whether we should stick with this bigger own-yield effect on MBS than on   Treasuries And our sense is—I hope it came out in the memos—we don’t really know what the   direct own-yield effects will be  We had sort of an experiment on the first $500 billion—what’s   the second $500 billion going to be?  So there’s this issue of scale that could change quite a bit as           March 17–18, 2009 37 of 266  you go through time  Whether there are spillover effects from MBS into Treasuries or into high-  grade corporates—there’s a huge uncertainty about that     And for that reason, I think you shouldn’t interpret the model simulation evidence—to   the extent it is evidence—as suggesting, “oh, MBS is the way to go because you get a much   bigger bang for your buck on that than you would for Treasuries”  I don’t think that’s the way to   interpret it at all I think the way to interpret the model simulation results is that buying large   amounts of these securities, whether it’s Treasuries or MBS, has at least a fighting chance of   bringing down the general level of long-term interest rates  And if you can do that, and if that   spills over into the stock market, the exchange rate, that sort of thing, then you potentially get a   major stimulus to the real economy   If the program just becomes narrow on one particular market—suppose you just drive   down MBS—then you might not get very much for that  Maybe you would get a little bit   more—maybe—in the case of MBS, because then you’re affecting mortgage rates and refi   effects and house prices—maybe—but it’s not really where the big payoff comes from, at least   as far as these particular stimulations go  The big payoff comes from general reductions in the   level of all long-term rates, and then these other things follow  So we thought that was   important  That’s really the main way to think about the program   Right Joe and I may part company here, but I don’t think   there’s a strong case that buying MBS is definitely more advantageous than Treasuries  I think              March 17–18, 2009 38 of 266  we just don’t know enough about what size the effect is  There are reasons to think that it might   be bigger in the case of MBS, but it’s very difficult to say   It’s anyone’s guess, and it’s also the case, as Joe said in his   remarks, that the more you focus on one market, the more you’re not really taking a diverse   strategy on something in which it’s not quite clear how this is going to play out  Also, the more   you focus on one market, the more the question arises at some point  Do you just decouple that   market from everything else?   I think the second question that you raised had to do with this issue of fixing market   dysfunction and whether that was a potential conflict if you were getting this better economy    Although we thought of the bigger MBS effect as maybe having potentially a somewhat bigger   bang for the buck, because it might be helping to ease certain market strains, we thought in all   cases that the reason for this policy is not to deal with the strains of financial markets per se  It   may have that effect by strengthening the economy and so on and so forth—an indirect effect—   but the main purpose was to get around the zero bound by driving down the average level of   long-term interest rates and getting other general financial conditions to improve   Yes   I agree 100 percent  When we were doing the Bluebook box,   we had this discussion We saw that this is a real limitation of the model—that in one case it   gets to learn off of what the fed funds rate is doing relative to the rest of the economy, and in the   other case it doesn’t know how to learn off of these large-scale asset purchases  So we said,   what are we going to do about it?  Do we just write something down?  Do we try to come up   with the correct fix?  And the answer was, we had ideas for how to fix it correctly, but there is no   way we’re going to figure out the right way to do this in a week  So you are exactly correct   It’s possible Unfortunately, I haven’t run it, and I’m kicking   myself because we did talk about whether we ought to run it  So I don’t know what the answer   is I do know that if you had a $2 trillion program and you went by our assumptions, you’d   replicate the hypothetical and completely unattainable and maybe completely unrealistic   unconstrained optimal policy line  One question would be  What’s the cost of buying all of   these long-term securities?  I’m not sure what that is  This is part of the reason we hesitated on   running this But if you were completely unconstrained, you’d probably buy everything you              March 17–18, 2009 50 of 266  could get your hands on in an attempt to drive long-term rates right to zero  But presumably   there’d be some balance sheet costs—I’m not sure how to calibrate or describe exactly what   those costs are Presumably, there’d be a shadow cost, so you wouldn’t buy everything you   could get your hands on But the basic proposition that “buy a lot” would be a good thing to   do—yes, that would flow from that   Right   I think the staff decided that buying a trillion was feasible and   buying $2 trillion may be feasible  But at some point, it’s more of a question for you  And what   point is it just not feasible to go beyond, between the market problems you potentially create and   the potential problems in setting up for exiting?  I don’t know what the limit is, but I think the   gist of your question is Whatever that limit is, would it make sense to go to it?  On this kind of   analysis, the answer is “yes,” whatever that feasible limit is           March 17–18, 2009 51 of 266  No   Given our ability to distinguish between them, we wouldn’t be   able to say that that made a material difference from any other one  "
8500,2009-04-28," Part of the experience from Japan is that the Bank of Japan had   a hope that that would happen—that in effect at some point you pile up enough excess reserves        April 28–29, 2009 38 of 201  that banks just don’t want them anymore and they begin to lend them  So it begins to operate the   way that you say But it didn’t in Japan The experience—at least the way we have read it—was   that it never happened So if we go back a few months, when we started thinking about how   expanding the balance sheet might work, and go back to the list of things that we sent the   Committee in December, the mechanism you just described was on the list of “Could it work this   way?” We’ve learned a lot from the experience of Japan and have taken a lesson from it—that it   seems as though you can run up excess reserves to a tremendous amount and the banks will just   accept it What came up this time was a twist that I had never thought of before—I’m definitely   not the expert in this room on this; Brian can speak to it—the sense of how it actually could   begin to work in the other direction  Because of the way leverage ratios, for example, are   calculated, the banks might actually get so uncomfortable with so many reserves that they would   actually begin to cut back on lending  I don’t know that we’ve seen that either  We haven’t, but   that was a sort of perverse effect like this that the Japanese began to worry about   But then the problem is that it doesn’t help  But that’s a   problem in the capital position   Well, they took it a long way  Now, it could be that demand   for credit was imploding enough that the Bank of Japan just never took it far enough, but the   Bank of Japan took it an awfully long way We thought that a distinction between what they did   and what we have been doing is that we are targeting liquidity support operations toward   particular sectors—markets that are having severe problems—or, alternatively, trying to do a   major twist on the yield curve to drive down long rates—so two things that they didn’t really try   at the scale that we’re trying   I think we made a change, as you’ve said, this time  We also   said in the memo that we were continuing to work on it  We are definitely leaving it open  I   hope it was clear from the memo where we are  We’re very uncertain about it, and at the   moment we have a number of people working on trying to figure out a new way  There are a   couple of things First, I suspect that you probably will be changing things over time  Where we   locked it in this time is just for the moment Second, I assume that, as we go forward, we will   continue to do the sort of thing we’ve done in the past, which is to present you with alternative   ways of thinking and alternative ways of how this might play out  Even when we’re through the   episode, we probably won’t be able to tell exactly what truth is  But certainly as we’re going   through the episode and we definitely don’t know what truth is, we’re going to provide   alternatives  "
8724,2010-04-27,"  There’s a timing issue here on these wealth effects, as well, in   the sense that banks are taking write-downs on these loans in anticipation of losses  Looking   ahead, the market is pricing that into valuations of firms, so that’s getting into net worth  But if   you think about it from the point of view of households that are in trouble, the bank may be   assuming that they’re going to be writing down the debt, but the household doesn’t know it yet    So there’s uncertainty about the timing but eventually those two things come in sync  But that   goes on in downturns regularly  It’s more pronounced in this one, but it’s not clear that this   effect isn’t picked up by the fact that it’s correlated with other things reflecting the depth of the   recession  There are other variables in our models, like the unemployment rate and so on, which   may be more or less proxying for these effects    Right    Specifically, we’re in the planning stages right now of a project   for thinking about a widening sovereign debt crisis that potentially spills over and creates a   banking panic in Europe; so we’re working on that  "
8799,2010-08-10,"  I’d say that we tend to interpret the situation in the opposite   way  As Brian discussed in his briefing, some of the movement in longer-term interest rates   could be due to a fall in the risk premium or term premium—and we could ask what’s driving   that—but some of it also seems to be related to a pronounced downward adjustment in the   expected path of short-term rates, which is probably related to a weaker economic outlook  So,   in that sense, that portion of the decline in long rates is being driven by a weaker outlook for the   real economy rather than the other way around and, possibly, by a more pessimistic view on   inflation   It’s also important to be careful when we say that we’re scoring that decline in long-rates   as a plus for the economic outlook  We have an accounting that says we look at the news   releases coming in on the real side, and we make an assessment of what they imply for real   activity going forward, holding interest rates constant  Then, that’s offset to some extent by the   fact that long rates adjusted down in response to that weaker economic outlook  On net,   however, the effect of the news could be negative or it could be positive, but it’s not as positive   as the shift in the long rates itself would say   Similarly, some of the support to the stock market is related to lower interest rates—  though, not all of it, as some of it seems to be the decline in risk premiums, as Brian said  But   we need to be careful when we decompose this, because not all of that movement in the stock   market is necessarily favorable to the outlook  Some of it is taking on board the lower interest   rates that are also part of the valuation    It’s not greatly different though  "
8866,2010-11-02,"  Right from the start, I think, a majority of the Committee has   always disagreed with the staff outlook  [Laughter]    Until recently, I think the general pattern was that most   participants expected monetary policy, the funds rate, to be lifting off noticeably earlier than   staff  That’s been shifting, and some of the disagreement this time is that a couple of you expect   policy to be easier  So now it’s on either side    This is, in part, why we raised the NAIRU  We assumed that,   during the crisis, the fairly persistent component of the NAIRU went up a full percentage point,   and we think that the extended duration of unemployment is one of the factors behind that    Implicitly, in our longer-run forecast, we’re not telling a European hysteresis-type story—one in   which these people will never be employed again  We are implicitly saying, though, that   reemployment is going to take a number of years—some of these people will have a hard time   getting back to work, but they do get back to work  So we’re assuming that they have not given   up, that they’re actively looking for jobs, so, in that sense, they will be putting downward   pressure on wages  As David said, it’s very hard to say whether it’s the same amount of   downward pressure as someone who has been out of work only for 12 weeks    One main thing, and Nathan may want to talk about this, too, is   going back not to the US experience  One key thing is looking at the Japanese experience   where they, in essence, ran the experiment you’re talking about, which was to increase greatly   the monetary base  Our assessment is that it did very little  The Japanese, I think, are a little bit   more optimistic about what they did, in that they think that did help hold up inflation   expectations  People have debated that one, but the general feeling is that just expanding   reserves did very little to bolster the Japanese stock market or that sort of thing   For the United States, we haven’t actually run the experiment you’re talking about, so   there’s no way to look at any evidence to judge whether we’d get a different result  The logic of   what we’re doing is that, yes, there would be a difference, and if we just expanded reserves, the   assumption we’re making is that we would get very little for that    Could I make one other point?  It’s related to this discussion,   and I think it’s implicit in what everyone is saying  You could say, “Wow, we’re swapping   T-bills for money,” but one could argue that, at a zero fed funds rate, there really isn’t a   distinction between T-bills and money  Actually, maybe the better way of saying it is that the   November 2–3, 2010 128 of 238             distinction between reserves and T-bills is not really existent at that point  But if you’re buying   longer-term assets instead, now you actually are changing something—you’re engaging in an   operation that is a swap that is materially different    Not to continue this, but I think implicit in this is the idea that   buying a 5-year or 10-year Treasury note is what you would substitute for a corporate bond,   rather than say, buying a T-bill  So, again, it’s the duration    The October 15 Kiley et al memo  "
8920,2011-01-25,"  Why don’t I step in here?  First, different DSGE models have   different shocks embedded in them, and EDO probably has more than your typical DSGE model    One of the things in EDO is an economywide risk premium shock—that’s how it’s labeled  That   shock explains the overwhelming percentage of the slump that we just experienced  In the   January 25–26, 2011 30 of 282              identification scheme inside of EDO, that shock doesn’t really represent a shock to potential   output, so that, in EDO’s inflation dynamics, the falloff in output that’s driven by that shock is   putting downward pressure on inflation  There are other shocks in the model that are not    Well, there are various shocks in EDO, such as preference   shocks, as there would be in any DSGE model  You might say that those are shocks to demand,   for example, and those would shift the concept of potential output such that they would tend to   minimize the gap  But the biggest thing going on in EDO, the shock that is causing the gap to   open up and to be very wide, is, again, this economywide risk premium shock  In other words,   the way EDO tells the story is that a very big increase in slack has opened up, and that is putting   downward pressure on inflation  A different DSGE model might parse the data very differently    It might say that, indeed, a lot of what we might think of as a falloff in demand in this cycle is   having an effect on a flexible-price concept of output, or something like that  I guess the point I   want to make is that the identification assumptions used in DSGE models, and one’s   interpretation of what they would imply for inflation, can yield very different results when you   do variations on those identification assumptions  This is something that a number of people   have commented on   If you ask whether a DSGE model would tell the story differently from, let’s say,   FRB/US, the answer is “maybe—it depends on the DSGE model”  So EDO’s telling of the tale   in a lot of ways is not that different from FRB/US, but another DSGE model, like, say, the   Smets–Wouters model, would tell the story very differently  This is a cautionary tale about our   ability, as far as econometrics goes, to identify exactly what is driving things   January 25–26, 2011 31 of 282               No  I think that, when Mike Kiley was doing the briefing, he   pointed out that, in some sense, there are three different concepts of “trend”—let’s call it that—  in EDO  One is a smooth statistical filter, a Beveridge–Nelson type of thing  Another is a   production type of concept, and that would be closer to what’s in FRB/US  A third is a   flexible-price type of concept, which would be more like what’s in a lot of other DSGE models   Let me come at this issue another way  We can ask  What shocks should monetary   policy try to offset, and what shocks should it not try to offset, in the sense that policy can’t do   anything about them from a social welfare viewpoint?  The answer is  It depends on the nature   of the shock  Even the economy-wide risk premium shock is an issue  For example, if you   thought in late 2008 that the shock represented households that suddenly really hated risk a lot   more than they used to, then a policymaker might say, “Well, welfare is such that, if a whole set   of household behaviors is changing, then it might be optimal to let that happen  Monetary policy   shouldn’t offset it”  But if, instead, you thought households suddenly felt that the world was a   lot riskier than it used to be, then monetary policy might want to offset that, particularly if doing   so changes the risk distribution   Where I’m going—and, incidentally, I’m being pushed in my abilities, because I’m not   the best person to talk about this—is back to the issue of the nature of these models  I’m   referring both to DSGE models and to models like FRB/US, which is more elaborate  The nature   January 25–26, 2011 32 of 282              of these DSGE models is that there’s a set of identification assumptions used in them from which   people will draw welfare implications  I think you could say that it’s really pushing the ability of   those models in their identification assumptions to say, “Oh, I can draw welfare conclusions   from that to say what shocks monetary policy should try to offset and what shocks it should not”    I think that’s taking it right to the limit  Now, there are definitely different views on that    Oh, yes    Ultimately, I think it’s hard to say when economics would ever   be at the point that it could actually make welfare judgments that you could really trust  But   there’s another way of looking at it  Suppose the Committee is focused on one side of its   mandate and asks, “What level of the unemployment rate or of GDP would be consistent with   price stability?”  Eventually the answer comes out to be something that you just learn about over   time, and, as you learn about it, you revise your views about what potential output or what the   labor market slack would have to be  That’s something you just have to observe, react to, and   then adjust policy accordingly  3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Steve Kamin, Nellie  Liang, and I will be referring to the material titled “Staff Presentations on the  Economic Outlook”  Overall, the data that have become available since the  December Tealbook closed suggest that the economy expanded somewhat more  rapidly late last year than we anticipated  As shown in the upper left panel of your  first exhibit, real consumer spending accelerated noticeably in recent months,  accounting for much of the upward surprise in aggregate demand  However, because  the fundamentals continue to look less impressive, we have carried only some of the  recent momentum into the current quarter                                                     3 The materials used by Messrs Reifschneider and Kamin and Ms Liang are appended to this transcript  (appendix 3)   January 25–26, 2011 67 of 282              As shown to the right, manufacturing output rose steadily over the second half of  last year, although at a somewhat more subdued pace than earlier in the recovery   But with light vehicle sales up and dealer inventories relatively lean, we expect IP to  be boosted this quarter by a step-up in motor vehicle assemblies; in addition, new  orders data suggest that factory output outside of the motor vehicle sector is likely to  post solid gains  Overall, we expect manufacturing IP to increase at an annual rate of  nearly 7 percent this quarter   In contrast, the housing sector remains moribund  As illustrated by the black line  in the middle left panel, single-family housing starts have remained roughly flat, in  the neighborhood of 450,000 units per year since mid 2009  And while the latest  sales data (the violet line) came in a touch stronger than we expected in December,  housing demand remains depressed  Finally, house prices (not shown) have moved  down further in recent months under the pressure of foreclosures and distress sales   The improvement in labor market conditions remains slow  As shown to the  right, monthly payroll gains averaged about 130,000 in the fourth quarter, little  different from their pace earlier in 2010  But other recent indicators, such as initial  claims and hiring plans, point to modest gains in coming months, and, with overall  output expanding at a solid rate, we anticipate that monthly payroll gains will average  about 160,000 in the current quarter   The bottom left panel summarizes the near-term GDP projection  As shown in  line 1, we now estimate that real GDP rose 3¾ percent in the fourth quarter, a little  more than a percentage point faster than we projected back in December, reflecting a  sizable increase in private domestic final purchases (line 3)  As Steve will discuss,  net exports also appear to have made a large arithmetic contribution to real GDP in  the fourth quarter, although that boost is likely to be largely offset by a marked  slowing in the rate of inventory investment   Finally, as shown to the right, underlying inflation remains subdued, with both the  core CPI (black line) and core PCE prices (red line) increasing only ¾ percent over  the 12 months ending in December  We judge that transitory factors held down  consumer prices a bit in the fourth quarter, and therefore expect core PCE inflation to  edge up in coming months   The medium-term outlook is the subject of your next exhibit  As shown in the  upper left panel, our forecast for real GDP remains largely unchanged  In particular,  our current forecast (the black bars) continues to show a sustained acceleration in  aggregate output this year and next, as the headwinds restraining the recovery  gradually diminish in an environment of persistently accommodative monetary  policy   Even with the pickup in real activity, the recovery in the labor market is likely to  be painfully slow  As shown to the right, we project that the unemployment rate will  not fall below 8 percent until late 2012  Not surprisingly, considerable uncertainty  attends this forecast  As indicated by the shaded regions, the 90 percent confidence   January 25–26, 2011 68 of 282              band for our forecast encompasses everything from rapid progress toward restoring  full employment to essentially no progress at all  [Laughter]  I didn’t figure that as a  laugh line, actually   As shown in the middle left panel, we project that core PCE inflation will average  about 1 percent this year and next  As before, we continue to expect stable long-run  inflation expectations to prevent the considerable amount of economic slack from  pushing underlying inflation lower  Reflecting recent increases in food and energy  prices, overall PCE prices are likely to increase about 1¼ percent this year but to rise  1 percent in 2012, in line with core prices  As with the unemployment rate forecast,  the inflation outlook is highly uncertain, and we cannot rule out the possibility that  core PCE inflation could fall to zero or rise to 2½ percent   Although uncertainty about the outlook for real activity and inflation is  considerable, we nevertheless are a little more confident about the durability of the  recovery than we were last summer when the economy went through a soft patch   Indeed, we now see the risks to our forecast of economic activity as roughly balanced,  as opposed to skewed to the downside  Other forecasters also appear to have become  more confident about economic recovery  As indicated by the blue bars in the middle  right panel, the dispersion of year-ahead projections of real GDP in the Survey of  Professional Forecasters—an imperfect proxy for uncertainty—has retraced its jump  during the financial crisis  In contrast, the dispersion in SPF forecasts of inflation has  been rising and late last year reached the highest level seen since the early 1990s   In assessing the prospects for continued recovery, one important factor is the  stance of monetary policy  As shown in the bottom left panel, the real funds rate is  now quite low by historical standards—albeit not to an unprecedented degree, as can  be seen by comparing the current episode to the period following the deep 1975  recession  In addition, joint research by Hess Chung, Jean-Philippe Laforte, John  Williams, and me suggests that the FOMC’s asset purchases are providing important  support to both real activity and inflation  As indicated by the red line in the panel to  the right, we estimate that the original 2009 LSAP program is substantially reducing  unemployment  And, as indicated by the blue and black lines, your subsequent  moves to reinvest principal payments on your holdings of longer-term securities and  then to expand your holdings by an additional $600 billion, are judged to have  boosted this effect further  Overall, we estimate that the program will hold down the  unemployment rate in 2012 by 1½ percentage points  Although these are our best  estimates, we readily admit that the range of uncertainty surrounding them is very  large   Your next exhibit reviews some of the other forces influencing the pace of the  recovery  As noted in the box, capital demands are among the factors working to  support a rebound in activity  Business outlays on equipment and software contracted  so sharply during the recession that the real stock of this category of capital—the  black line in the chart to the right—actually began to contract  If business capital  stocks are to resume expanding at a more normal rate, investment outlays will need to   January 25–26, 2011 69 of 282              continue increasing at a solid pace through next year  Similar considerations apply to  consumer durable goods, the red line   The economic recovery also should continue to be supported by a diminishing  drag on consumer spending from past declines in wealth, as illustrated by the bars in  the middle left panel  Finally, we anticipate that a gradual increase in credit  availability will help to boost investment and consumption over time  Indeed,  readings from the latest SLOOS suggest that conditions have already eased  somewhat   However, as indicated by the second set of bullets in the upper left box, other  factors are hindering the pace of recovery—most importantly, the ongoing troubles in  the residential and nonresidential construction sectors, and a fading impetus from  fiscal policy  The middle right panel provides some perspective on the importance of  these three factors  As shown in the first line, real GDP typically increases almost  10 percent during the first eight quarters following the trough of a recession, but, in  this recovery, we anticipate an increase of only 6½ percent  One reason for the more  subdued performance in this cycle is the lack of any contribution to output growth  from residential construction, line 2, whereas housing usually contributes  1¼ percentage points to overall growth  Similarly, nonresidential structures  investment is expected to subtract ½ percentage point from GDP growth during this  recovery, rather than playing its typical “neutral” role  Nellie will have more to say  about conditions in the real estate sector shortly   Looking forward, fiscal policy is also likely to be a restraining influence on  economic growth  As illustrated by the teal bars in the lower right panel, federal  fiscal policy provided an important boost to real GDP growth in 2008 through 2010   But this impetus to growth should fall almost to zero this year and is expected to turn  sharply negative in 2012 as the stimulus grants to state and local governments are  exhausted, extended unemployment benefits lapse, and the payroll tax holiday ends   The swing in the stance of federal fiscal policy will be partly offset by developments  at the state and local level  Excluding spending out of federal grants, fiscal impetus at  this level of government (the red bars) should turn modestly positive, as tax revenues  continue to recover  Indeed, as shown to the right, receipts rose noticeably during  2010 and are expected to increase further over the next two years   Your next exhibit considers another area of substantial uncertainty—household  saving  As indicated by the black line in the upper panel, the personal saving rate,  which hovered around 10 percent in the early 1980s, trended down markedly over the  next 25 years, but then rebounded during the recession to about 6 percent  As  indicated by the red line, which shows a dynamic simulation of a simple reduced- form model of consumer spending, most of these historical movements in the saving  rate can be explained by movements in income, wealth, interest rates, and consumer  sentiment, the key variables included in this model  That said, the model has  persistently underpredicted the saving rate since 2006  Looking forward, we expect  that the saving rate will roughly parallel the trajectory predicted by the model and   January 25–26, 2011 70 of 282              remain close to 6 percent this year but then step down to 5¼ percent next year after  the end of the payroll tax holiday   A downside risk to the saving rate forecast, and thus an upside risk to the strength  of the recovery, is the possibility that consumer spending will fully realign itself with  the predictions of the model  Such a development could occur if the gap seen in  recent years reflects the transitory effects of heightened uncertainty, tight credit  conditions, and impaired household balance sheets  But other considerations suggest  upside risks to the saving rate projection as well  As shown in the middle left panel,  we have conditioned our forecast of the saving rate on an appreciable rise in  consumer sentiment this year and next; if households remain downbeat, then the  saving rate would likely be rising over time, not edging down   We also expect credit availability to continue to improve  As shown to the right,  banks’ willingness to make consumer loans has increased in recent quarters   Similarly, credit card solicitations—shown in the bottom left panel—have recovered  somewhat from their lows in 2009  These indicators of improving credit supply to  households may reflect greater confidence on the part of lenders about the future as  well as the progress households have made in deleveraging  As shown in the bottom  right panel, both the ratio of household debt to income (the red line) and the debt  service ratio (the black line) have fallen noticeably from their pre-recession peaks,  and we expect these ratios to continue to decline through next year  I now turn the  floor over to Steve    Let me answer the second question first  For the payroll tax,   we do think there will be smoothing  We’re thinking it will bump up growth in consumer   spending starting in the first quarter  But our view is that only about 30 to 40 percent of the   reduced payroll taxes will show up in increased consumption in 2011, and some more will show   up in 2012; consumers will be spreading the spending out over time  People with much lower   incomes will probably spend it right away, but a lot of people are not super constrained in terms   of liquidity, and, in our view, they’re likely to spend it more slowly  That lessens the degree to   which spending gets pushed up in 2011 and then falls off a cliff in 2012    Yes, that’s definitely true, and even three years from now it   will be hard to read the numbers and tell what happened, although we’ll do our best  That will   be a bit of a question mark as we go through 2011 and into 2012 as well   Now let me answer your first question  In the bottom left panel of exhibit 3, that’s state   and local net of their spending out of grants; so, if you calculated their total spending and   included the federal grant effect, that would be a slight negative, not a positive  But when you   read the news accounts, and you see the trouble that Illinois and California and many states are   in, it’s natural to wonder how this could be  Part of the answer is to look back at what they did   just this last year—while local governments were cutting their payrolls, the states themselves,   January 25–26, 2011 84 of 282              interestingly enough, actually increased their payrolls a little bit, despite all of the pressures   they’ve been under    That’s true  But they’re going to be under a lot of pressure, so   they’re not going to be increasing their spending by any large amount, and, indeed, spending   growth is going to be close to zero this year  So states are by no means any significant   contributor to the nation’s growth in this forecast   I think the positive fiscal impulse comes back to the room created by higher tax   receipts—we do think tax receipts have been growing and that they’ll continue to grow at about   the rate of GDP, which, of course, is not super fast  As I understand it, in the mid-session   reviews, states’ budget situations are coming in somewhat better in a lot of cases than was   expected, and, in general, it’s not coming in worse than expected, although, to the extent that   some of them kick the can down the road, it may be as bad as they expected  Given that, we   think that will enable those states to avoid massive cutting in real spending on purchases and   things like that, but that is a risk    I don’t know if it accomplishes what you want, but it’s true  "
8999,2011-06-21,"  Let me piggyback with a comment related to forecasting with   EDO  As Mike said, the published paper on the forecasting ability of EDO only went through   2004  But, actually, J P Laforte, Rochelle Edge, and Mike Kiley looked at it through a more   recent period in a sort of pseudo real-time forecasting exercise using the actual data published at   the time  And we have also had the actual real-time forecasting experience of EDO  I think it   really shows what Mike said, in the sense that EDO does about as well as a lot of techniques  As   Mike Kiley would immediately say, “That’s not a fantastic standard to hold it to,” [laughter] but   it does as well  So these models are useful for forecasting  In terms of what has been happening   over the last year or so, I’d say the way EDO has been surprised is in many respects the same as   the way FRB/US and the staff forecast in general have been surprised—that is, this recovery has   turned out to be slower and more prolonged—and we’re having to reassess what is going on as   the weakness persists  And that relates to the point Marco made  The model errors raise the   question of what exactly is going on out here    Scale is a difficult issue because the interests of the FOMC are   very diverse, and one might think, “Oh, to handle all the sorts of questions that come up, we’d   have to build this gigantic thing”  And FRB/US is pretty big, but it does not have the scale that   covers all the questions the Committee does  So we have to supplement FRB/US with a lot of   other types of analyses  Some of that we can do in DSGE models  When we go with SIGMA,   for example, we’re doing a lot of international analysis, and we’re using a different model for   that because it’s well designed for answering those sorts of questions  EDO also does a better   job of handling certain things, such as how you’re interpreting data in real time, or doing signal   extraction about what’s really going on in the supply side, or what might be going on with risk   premiums or things like that  That’s a statement that all sorts of different models bring different   June 21–22, 2011 25 of 282              things to the table  That’s also why, in preparing the staff forecast, we use single equation   models, we use reduced form models, we use special-purpose models—we do all sorts of thing    We’ve been maintaining a tradition of trying to not pile all our eggs in one basket, which some   other central banks, particularly smaller central banks, have had to do because they have limited   staff resources  We’ve had the luxury, between both the Board and the System as a whole, of   being able to maintain a variety of models, pose a variety of questions, and get a variety of   analyses, and I think that’s a strength   At some point you face the question, if you are dealing with a workhorse model, of   what’s the minimal set of things that has to be in it to be useful for the Committee  We faced   that with FRB/US; we didn’t put in everything, but we put in a great deal  I don’t know that a   workhorse model has to be as big as FRB/US; it doesn’t have to have as many bells and whistles    It’s possible—and I think this is what we have been doing in recent years—that we can do the   job with multiple models as opposed to relying solely on one model  Along those lines, if you   think about the forecasting process underlying the Tealbook analysis that we’ve been giving the   Committee over the past couple of years or so, it is informed by FRB/US and EDO as well as a   whole bunch of other things  FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA also appear in the Alternative   Scenarios, and EDO and FRB/US are used in Book B analyses et cetera  So we’re using a range   of models, and it’s a question of what tool seems most useful for the particular question at hand    Yes  The model is respecting the zero lower bound  What   policy is doing in the optimal control exercise is promising to hold the funds rate lower further   out in the future, so that the economy is stronger further out in the future than it is in the   Tealbook baseline  Because the model is run under rational expectations, people recognize the   economy will be stronger  Marginal costs in the future will be stronger, and the labor market   will be stronger  Recognizing that future strength changes their inflation expectations  That   causes upfront inflation to be higher  "
9046,2011-08-09,"  Bank lines of credit, for example  Unused commitments    Stepping back from the recession and the slow recovery, it is   true that well before we got into the recession there was a longer-run trend of very slow capacity   growth in the United States in manufacturing  And that was presumably—and in a lot of cases,   you can track it down—growth in China and other places like that  While that’s operated in the   August 9, 2011 31 of 162              background, whether that shifting of production to other countries has really stepped up at the   moment is much more difficult for us to say  "
9072,2011-09-20,"  Thanks  Turning to your third exhibit, one of the  memos we distributed to you last week explored a variety of issues related to forward  guidance  The top panel considers one of those issues  the market’s reaction to the  additional guidance you provided in the August statement—specifically, the  indication that “the Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions    are  likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through  mid-2013”  As noted in the first bullet, this guidance reduced the perceived odds that  policy would begin tightening before mid-2013, as evidenced by a downward revision  to the expected path of the funds rate implied by futures; uncertainty about the future  path of the funds rate also fell  Together, these developments led to a moderate  decline in longer-term Treasury yields  In addition, as Brian noted earlier, market  commentary since the August meeting suggests that investors understand that the  Committee’s forward guidance is conditional, and that the timing of the onset of  tightening is not tied to a specific date but will depend on the evolution of real  activity and inflation over time  That said, investors are unclear about the specific  conditions that would warrant tightening  In this regard, the latest Desk survey  suggests market participants anticipate that the unemployment rate will be close to  8 percent and the inflation rate around 2 percent when you first begin to tighten— conditions that may or may not be consistent with your policy intentions   This market uncertainty about future policy suggests that you may wish to  consider ways to clarify your forward guidance further, such as providing quantitative  information about the conditions that would influence the decision as to when to  begin tightening  As noted in the middle panel, such clarification could better align  market expectations for monetary policy with the FOMC’s intentions and reduce  uncertainty about future policy actions  If so, that guidance could be stimulative to  the degree that the public currently underestimates your willingness to pursue  accommodative monetary policy over the medium term  Beyond that, such guidance  could make investors’ responses to incoming data on the economy, and thus the  accompanying movements in longer-term interest rates and other asset prices, more  consistent with the Committee’s actual reaction function     One way of providing more specificity about the factors influencing the  Committee’s actions might be to announce specific unemployment and inflation  “threshold” conditions for keeping monetary policy exceptionally accommodative   Under this approach, the Committee could indicate its intention to keep the federal  funds rate near zero at least as long as unemployment was above, say, a 7 percent  threshold and the medium-term outlook for headline inflation remained below a  2½ percent threshold  As the memo discusses, the use of threshold conditions raises a  number of issues, one of them being the potential for confusion about the  Committee’s long-run objectives  To avoid such confusion, as well as to help more  firmly anchor long-run inflation expectations, the Committee might also wish to  release quantitative information about both its long-run inflation goal and its  projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will converge over time   In addition to considering these communication issues, the memo also explored  the potential benefits and costs of additional forward guidance using simulations of   September 20–21, 2011 20 of 290              the FRB/US model; the bottom panel summarizes the results from this exercise  Our  analysis suggests that the Committee could potentially provide modest near-term  stimulus if it committed to keeping the funds rate near zero as long as specified  thresholds for unemployment and inflation were not breached  In the simulations, the  effectiveness of such guidance rests on two conditions  First, the announced policy  must be credible, in that the public must be confident that future FOMCs will follow  through on that guidance  Second, the guidance must indicate an appreciably later  liftoff than currently expected by the public  The simulation results suggest the  Committee probably should not expect much additional stimulus from this strategy  unless it acts fairly aggressively by, for example, announcing its intention to keep the  federal funds rate very low as long as unemployment is above, say, 6½ percent and  the medium-term outlook for inflation is below 2½ percent   In the simulations, forward guidance of this sort provides only modest stimulus  because it alters expectations only for the likely date that policy firming will begin  and not for the average stance of policy thereafter  But the announcement of  thresholds might in fact change longer-run expectations more dramatically,  particularly if supplemented with guidance about the pace at which the federal funds  rate will be normalized after liftoff  If credible, such longer-term guidance could  potentially yield more pronounced expectationally driven changes in financial  conditions and other factors, and thus appreciably more stimulus  Additional model  simulations reported in the memo suggest that if the Committee could convince the  public of its intention to pursue policies later in the decade that are only somewhat  more gradualist than the public would otherwise expect, it could bring about a  noticeably faster decline in unemployment than in the baseline forecast, accompanied  by inflation running modestly above 2 percent for a time  Such an outcome would be  similar to the optimal policy simulation results reported in the Tealbook   The memo also considered the robustness of this sort of forward guidance to  unexpected economic developments  This analysis suggested that, while  unconditional commitments to keep the federal funds rate near zero until some  specified date are highly problematic, conditional forward guidance in the form of  announced thresholds for unemployment and inflation appears to do reasonably well  in a wide range of circumstances, including ones where policymakers significantly  overestimate the amount of slack in the economy   The final page of your handout reproduces the questions that were distributed to  the Committee last week  During the go-round this morning, you may want to  address these questions in the context of your remarks  Thank you; this concludes  our presentation  We would be happy to take your questions    Right  In the scenario of a very severe European recession that   we had in the Tealbook, all those effects that Steve just laid out were there  You were seeing   Treasury yields fall appreciably, and that helped buffer things  However, the dollar was   appreciating; that made things worse  And we assumed that risk spreads on private securities   were going up, which also made things worse  Going back to Vice Chairman Dudley’s question,   the other recession scenario we had in the Tealbook featured some of the special things that   might also occur in the event that Europe crashed  The other recession scenario assumed that the   economy is extremely vulnerable at the moment to any sort of kick from anywhere  It could   come from abroad; it could be domestic  But with any sort of kick, things could play out much   worse than the models might usually suggest, because of the strains that households are under,   because of the strains that the banking system is under, because people would be looking at   monetary policy and saying, “Well, what’s the FOMC going to do to buffer this?  Or, looking at   fiscal policy—what’s the federal government going to do to buffer this?”  This isn’t to say that   all of those things will happen, but it is our view that if you did have a big kick to the economy—  say, from Europe—there’s a very strong risk that the negative effects, even aside from the   channels that Steve outlined, would really ramp up because the economy is more vulnerable    There are two answers to that  One, if you take our models   estimated over longer periods, housing is a pretty interest-sensitive sector  Second, over longer   periods, if you look at the response of house prices to interest rates, there’s not much evidence of   a response  Now, looking at the past few years, it is very difficult to tease out the interest   elasticity  It could be that the interest elasticity is extremely low at the moment, partly because   September 20–21, 2011 202 of 290              of the difficulties of people qualifying for mortgages with tighter standards and the smaller pool   of people who have decent credit scores  However, the other way of looking at it is that there’s a   powerful interest-rate effect in play at the moment, but it’s being swamped by concerns about   continuing falling house prices and that sort of thing  The housing market has certainly been   behaving very peculiarly in the last few years  Everyone agrees on that  None of the models can   explain what’s going on  Is it decreased interest sensitivity?  Could be  Is it a very powerful   dynamic on expected house price changes and things like that?  Could be  Is it tighter   underwriting standards and credit conditions that are independent of the interest sensitivity?    Could be  I think some combination of those is at work, and I can’t untangle them  "
9101,2011-11-01,"  Before this recession we thought the NAIRU was 4¾ percent    Now we think, leaving aside the effects of extended unemployment benefits, things like that, it is   6 percent  When you ratchet that up, that is a very persistent hit to labor market functioning,   relative to what we thought   We have also gone back and taken a look at what it was prior to the recession  I don’t   think it was quite as low as 4¾ percent  But we have assumed that—through very persistent   reduced attachment to the labor force, through duration of employment, through long duration of   employment hurting people’s skills, things like that—there are persistent fallout effects, supply-  side effects  As Mike said, those effects are taken into account in these analyses   November 1–2, 2011 12 of 282               Another way of saying it is in the Treasury market we expected   there to be a twisting of the yield curve; we weren’t particularly surprised that the two-year   November 1–2, 2011 115 of 282              yields went up a little bit and then the longer-term yields came down  Ceteris paribus, we would   have expected to see a similar effect in the corporate bond market for the same reasons  I don’t   know if they did, but if two-year corporates did go up, that wouldn’t be at odds with what we   expected  Whereas, we would have expected 10-year corporates that have—  "
