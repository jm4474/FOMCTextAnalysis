2166,1982-05-18,HORN," The point of view is Cleveland as of a few days ago I would choose alternative B If we're either on alternative A or [C], it seems to me we run the risk of the market--or of all of us --being surprised by another accident in the money supply when we're above target I think that's particularly damaging to market expectations I believe the market expects us to stay on the track  -40-    5/18/82  that we seem to be on for this quarter and would not be disappointed by our continuing with alternative B My staff's work would indicate that the $800 million initial borrowing assumption would shade this path toward ""B+,"" but basically alternative B as specified is where I come out "
2222,1982-07-15,HORN," Mr Chairman, this is Karen Horn Just to follow along on Bob's comments I have some concern about changing the policy that we've had for some time now of [reducing the M1 range by] 1/2 percentage point each year, or even indicating with this tentativeness our thoughts about changing that policy for fear that it might be a signal to the markets that in fact this Committee was contemplating a significant change in policy And at this time I think either very soft language with regard to not changing the target ranges or actually saying something about lowering the targets by 1/2 point might instill more confidence in the market "
2240,1982-08-24,HORN," In the Fourth District, where we have a lot of capital goods industries, the outlook for capital spending has gotten worse in the last couple of months, I would say A couple of months ago when you asked inventory questions of these people, they would say that they had really reduced inventories to bare bones and were not sure how they could continue operating with these inventory levels Now they are evaluating those same inventory levels differently, saying that they can do business for the foreseeable future with those inventories  I come out somewhere toward alternative B myself It seems to me that the basic underlying economic problems of inflation and the budget and crowding out and so forth are still with us, though some of them perhaps have moderated a bit We do face a weak economy--and those of us from the Midwest face a particularly weak one--for which lower interest rates are necessary But we have to have low interest rates for the right reason if we're going to stay in the range and stay in it for the length of time that would be helpful to our economy I am also concerned that we as an institution need to have a steady measured response to the weak economic growth, and I am concerned about leaving ourselves enough room that we don't have to take extreme actions in the future in response to a surprise or an unpredictable increase in the money supply So, I would come down on the side of those who are for alternative B or something more toward it, although at this moment the difference between ""A"" and ""B,"" as a number of people have said, is not so significant that I would have to go as far as alternative B "
2261,1982-09-24,HORN," Paul, may I just clarify what you were saying about the borrowing number? Could you just repeat the number or the range you were giving and state whether the $150 million of special borrowing is included in that amount?  Okay But generally what you're saying is that we are lowering the borrowing number from where it is and--  Your feeling is that if we were to stay with the nonborrowed path, that would perhaps drive fed funds rates up toward 11 percent or above?  Yes, I share Bob's view on that It seems to me, if it is a [unintelligible] to raise it for a number of reasons that haven't been discussed here, that unless we see it as something very negative on the side of causing more volatility in interest rates, [we should leave it] I would tend to leave it where it is myself "
2281,1982-10-05,HORN," Mr Chairman, this indicates your dissatisfaction with the way we handled it last time--that is, to have a target that was sensitive to--  It seems to me that the [appropriate] timing might be the next meeting In terms of setting quarterly targets, we might look at an M1 target and tolerate above target performance [now], with all saver certificates and so forth coming due And then at the next meeting if we are looking at an instrument that is very unpredictable in terms of what it's going to do to M1--having set the quarterly  -35-    10/5/82  targets at this meeting--we could say that for some weeks during this part of the quarter we're going to have to look more heavily at M2 "
2308,1982-11-16,HORN," I suppose if I were grasping at straws to say something optimistic from the Fourth Federal Reserve District point of view, I would say that the comments I've heard since the last meeting have [conveyed] in some sense more confidence But if one goes below the tone of the comments and into the statistics business people have been basing them on, in fact, the statistics don't seem to show any improvement in the capital goods industries We hear about continuing deterioration and backlogs, for example And the farm sector is much as several people have reported, in terms of what farmers buy and extremely weak land prices But, in fact, the comments do seem to have a little more confidence in them, perhaps really because people are now beginning to say that they are going to take market share away from somebody else and somehow be at a competitive advantage rather than that they are seeing an overall improvement in the economy I see this as heavily reflected in the consumer sector in the Fourth Federal Reserve District as in any other [sector] But I could put an optimistic face on what continues to be perhaps not a negative set of data but a stagnant to negative set of data in our District  Mr Chairman, I'd like to ask you to expand a bit on a statement you made earlier, which was that you would like to see lower interest rates if that could happen in an environment of less money growth I'd like to hear you talk about how much lower interest rates you think the market might tolerate in the context of various kinds of money growth As I look across the alternatives in the Bluebook, it seems one could construct a situation where any of the three alternatives could be consistent with lower interest rates I'd just like to hear you expand your comment a bit "
2335,1982-12-20,HORN," I think M1 has served us well and, indeed, its being linked by theory to our ultimate objectives in the income and price areas makes it very attractive So I'm distressed that for now and the foreseeable future it will not serve us as a reliable rule I agree that M2 is what we should be focusing on in the intermediate period The question, of course, then remains how to control it, which has been discussed at some length But I do think we need to have enough control over it that it really is a rule and not just a discussion point for the Committee How do we assure the world that we're still in business? I lean toward having the Chairman make a statement that, while it may be premature to commit to returning to M1 at a particular time or perhaps to commit to returning to M1 at all, as soon as possible we would look to return to M1 when experience has accumulated that would enable us to use it again I felt [some sympathy] with Bill Ford's reasoning yesterday that there are dangers on one side of collapse and on the other of monetizing the debt That that would lead us to looking at other indications of what our policy is accomplishing made some sense to me On one side we could look at nonborrowed reserves or the nonborrowed base; on the other side we could look at the price of gold and long-term bond markets and things that are linked by expectations of future inflation The exchange rate suggestion also, I thought, was a very good one The danger in this, of course, is that we gain too much flexibility and don't have the self-discipline of having a rule Nonetheless, we aren't in  -38-    12/20-21/82  normal times and looking broadly at a number of other financial numbers in addition to M2 is perhaps called for My concern remains that, once the economy does pick up, we must make some difficult decisions about what the future course of the economy should be and perhaps effect a change in monetary policy in that we will be facing a situation with a federal deficit that will not decline adequately to make up for the pickup in the economy And M2 is a difficult aggregate to control at that point But for the foreseeable future, I agree with the consensus that M2 is what we should be working with "
2360,1983-01-14,HORN," Hello Yes, this is Karen "
2391,1983-02-08,HORN," Nancy, what is the price outlook that goes with that?  Which leads to the question What is different now that is driving this forecast? Certainly, interest rates are different What other kinds of--  Starting from the premise of targeting aggregates, my preference is to target narrower aggregates both for reasons of controllability and historical relationships with GNP and so forth Because I favor targeting narrower aggregates, I favor a flexible approach That flexibility would be on the side of what I think has been referred to as technical reasons--that is, I think we'd have to be explicit that we would be flexible with Ml targets, depending on our fragmented readings of what its velocity is going to be That's the danger, certainly on the Ml side With M2, along with the velocity problem, there are also the shift problems And, of course,  -29-    2/8-9/83  the shift problems could develop with Ml as the year goes on So it's those kinds of flexibilities that I'd like to see introduced into the targeting exercise I very much agree with Nancy that if we take an approach that is flexible with regard to targets, we must be very open in our communications with the markets They must believe that we're engaging in an honest flexibility and I think that would be accomplished by frequent and fairly open communication  No, I'm going quickly onto the next subject!  I agree with Frank about the risk question; I think the risk is on the up side In particular, if we take this flexible approach, I think we will be very sensitive as a Committee to the economy needing more liquidity Hoping that that doesn't happen, then we're going to need the backbone--and the political protection that we will get from the targets will have to come into play--if we get into a situation where we need to start increasing interest rates And if we build in too much flexibility, that of course takes a bit of that protection away  The implication of that is that Ml is receiving substantially less weight than M2  You'd like me to wait until discussion of that?  Jerry's point that we're going to need M1 later on for the upside possibility is one that I agree with And it seems to me that while we have uncertainty about economic activity and the macro outlook, one of the things we could do as a Committee is say that we will react to M1 going above the target We will react less quickly than we did historically; historically we tried to get it back in [its range] over a 10- to 12-week period between discount rates and reserve movements We could say we will react less quickly as a Committee I'd like to see Ml receive more emphasis than this directive puts upon it  Mr Chairman, it seems as we sit here today that the obvious thing that would create the window to allow for more easing would be a substantial slowing in the aggregates So, for that reason, I support that wording If something unusual were to happen in the next two months, then in fact a move on the discount rate could [be taken] into consideration in this period But as we sit here today it seems to me that a slowing in the aggregates that would permit--  That's right "
2418,1983-03-28,HORN," Would it be noticed if you did it half as much in the future as you do now? Would that be commented on?  I would like eventually to get back to targeting the aggregates and to the previous operating procedures The way I'd like to do that is in some long-run sense--saying that by year-end we'd like to be at such and such a point relative to the ranges And I'd like to be able to say that with regard to M1 particularly because of its controllability and its historic relationship with GNP I'm uncomfortable with the rate of growth in M1 I am interested in pursuing your analysis further, Jerry, but with the information I had coming into the meeting I am uncomfortable with the growth rates in M1 However, two problems I see as being very severe at this meeting are (1) the velocity problems of Ml; and (2) the great uncertainties in the economic outlook I agree with the staff forecast on the economy but I see a lot of downside risks Of course, in the Fourth Federal Reserve District we continue to have pretty dreary reports So, I'm not ready to argue today for a return to the operating techniques that were previously used I come out for alternative B because of the tremendous uncertainties I come out for directive language II because I think it's one step toward returning at what I hope would be an early date to the old operating procedures or to some modification of the operating procedures That would cause, perhaps, a slower adjustment to the long-run paths, but I do see that as very definitely the direction that we need to go and hopefully will be able to go sooner rather than later I'd like to end with a question to Peter, if I might, with regard to the term structure of interest rates Could you just elaborate on the remarks you made in a couple of sentences yesterday about short rates versus long rates and so forth? Could you elaborate on how you feel the market might react to, say, a slight increase in the fed funds rate? "
2459,1983-05-24,HORN," I want to start with M2 M2 is growing quite in line with a number of our expectations and with my expectations, and if it is growing a bit slowly, I think that has to do with the precautionary components [unintelligible] So the signal that I read from M2 is a fairly good one for staying on the current course However, I do read Ml, although I can't explain why it is doing what it is, as giving a signal [It influences] the direction of my uncertainties in dealing with policy matters so, because of the signal we might be getting from Ml, I would like to see a little tightening up from the current position I suppose, although I am not willing to argue over $50 million, that takes me from $250 to $300 million [on borrowing] But the point I want to make is more that that is the direction in which I think we should be erring because of what Ml might be telling us  At least there's a focus on Ml "
2495,1983-07-12,HORN," I favor rebasing, not only because I think it indicates some additional emphasis on Ml, but also because it seems to me to indicate the Committee's recognition of what we've learned about velocity It may or may not be the start of a rehabilitation of Ml in that we say we do look at Ml; we do take it seriously, but we make corrections for velocity from time to time until we're a little more sure of our velocity forecast  We might know it ex post but at least it would only be 4 months ex post, not a half year or a year ex post So, it's shortening the period of uncertainty  We'll be fascinated by everything they have to say!  SPEAKER(?) Make it short "
2523,1983-08-23,HORN," It comes down in part to whether we trust ourselves to deal with the problem you raise when it happens, doesn't it, John? "
2551,1983-10-04,HORN," We in Cleveland agree for the most part with the staff's forecast To the extent we see risks in it, we see the risks on the down side--that is, growth not coming through in '84 as strongly as forecast for a variety of reasons One reason, of course, is the outlook for investment--capital goods and heavy industry--which is exacerbated by the budget I just have a couple of comments to make on that industry I'm really focusing now on the components of that industry that we have in the Fourth District--steel, machine tools, heavy trucks, and mining related to metal production There has been some turnaround but it has been modest And I think the continued slowness in those industries is leading the managers to come to some pretty hard decisions Some are coming to the decision that recovery won't answer their problem--that their problem is deeper than will be dealt with by economic recovery Those who haven't quite come to that point yet at least feel that the recovery might be too slow to be very helpful to them or that perhaps they are going to be crowded out in this case I think that's bringing them to some short-term solutions; I don't think we see the examples yet of the long-term solutions such as trying to get competitive in world markets and so forth I suppose the worst of the short-term solutions, which we have seen for some time, is a call for protectionism But there are other kinds of solutions as well I suppose my remarks are inspired today in part by the LTV steel situation--the merger between J&L and Republic--which does seek to deal with problems in the short run by reducing capacity and by dealing with the overhead problem Now, in the long run maybe they aren't going to deal with labor contracts and    10/4/83  maybe they aren't going to deal with capital investment and a number of the other tougher problems I'm not sure what kind of financial strength they're going to end up with after this merger, but I think it is at least one indication of an attempt that is going in the right direction toward finding short-run solutions to problems We see other less dramatic examples in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, too, of attempts to get their hands around the short-term problems--in machine tools, for example I just thought I would bring up those comments relative to capital goods and the outlook for heavy industry today  I didn't mention it, and it certainly has been happening over a period of time in the Fourth Federal Reserve District I guess it's a mixed bag There are some real concessions; some of the heavy companies, for example, have gotten escalator clauses out of their [labor] contracts But there is the problem that the union people who come to vote in the elections are the people who still have the jobs and they can have a short-run attitude We find, for example, that the Chrysler contract that recently was voted for 2 to 1 across the country was voted 1 to 2 in the Fourth District the other way So, I think it's a very mixed bag in terms of the labor concessions I don't read it as really being [in one] direction  Yes Well, [I'm not sure if] there was a public statement by the company or not They certainly have been very clear in discussions that they are going to cut heavily into the capacity, particularly at Republic Steel but at J&L as well  That's right  Mr Chairman, I am giving a speech on Monday afternoon at the ABA, but you're suggesting having an FOMC session on Monday afternoon  We did pretty well in the Eisenhower years  END OF MEETING  -46-     "
2578,1983-11-14,HORN," With regard to the economic outlook in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, I thought I would come at it from the side of some of the industrial developments in the District and what they might mean for the near-term outlook for inflation It has been said many times around this table, and I just repeat it, that the labor concessions that we've seen have been in industries that are under severe market pressure and are fighting for survival Of course, the question remains How long-lasting will those concessions be in industries that pick up? They may, of course, continue in those industries that are getting smaller over the long term  -43-    11/14-15/83  Let me make some specific industrial comments First, about autos and the nationwide Chrysler settlement that had been followed by the local settlements All the locals settled except Twinsburg, Ohio, which is the metal stamping plant for Chrysler, and Twinsburg went out on strike The settlement of that local agreement was considered a union victory to be settled regardless of cost to the company, which in lost earnings was somewhere between $50 and $100 million I think there are reasons to argue that that is overstated and that Twinsburg was unique There had been a terrible industrial accident there in which a man was crushed to death in a stamping machine The working conditions are bad in metal stamping plants and that is an old stamping plant In addition, it had a rather unique situation in having quite radical union leadership at that plant Nonetheless, I think what happened at the Twinsburg Plant is indicative of workers' attitudes and it is one of the things that makes me apprehensive about the upcoming auto negotiations It makes me think, as we look at those negotiations next year, that maybe a number like 6 percent is on the low side of what might come out of those negotiations in an industry that has been quite profitable In thinking how auto negotiations might affect inflationary expectations and inflation through the economy, one can look at other sectors of the economy where there is some strength and talk about those being the next to go One strong area that we see, of course, is trucking That might be the dynamics by which inflationary expectations build  Let me turn to another industry that's heavily represented in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, which is steel That brings questions of both capacity and productivity Capacity has been discussed, of course, and capacity growth rates have been slowing domestically in a number of our industries, and in some industries we've even had liquidations This brings forth a great question of how we measure capacity and when the cost pressures will show through into prices, as has been discussed Steel causes me to see the productivity outlook as mixed On the positive side, I agree with a number of comments that have been made to the effect that if you talk to businessmen, they think that they not only have accomplished significant increases in productivity but they see ways that they will continue to increase productivity in the future On the negative side, if you look at some of our beleaguered industries in the Fourth District and talk about labor attitudes toward productivity, it's very difficult to convince organized labor that productivity increases are important We tell them [they are] I think they believe quality increases are important--that they are not competitive because their product is shoddy compared with a foreign import But I think they see productivity increases as a way to lose jobs It's like the old story about when oil prices were going up and people were supposed to use less electricity, and they paid more for their electricity It's the short-run effect It is very hard to convince labor of the importance of productivity increases, particularly in industries facing severe international competition To go back to the Twinsburg situation, in the context of productivity, I think almost the most important thing that came out of Twinsburg was probably the re- evaluation of the way of doing business that we thought was going to happen in the auto industry It still may, but I think they are very carefully looking at something like a just-in-time concept of producing products because they found out that if they don't have the same kind of labor market conditions as they have in Japan, an inventory control method like just-in-time can shut down their  -44-    11/14-15/83  business And at least at Chrysler they are really evaluating their possibilities  Yes--not labor productivity but capital management productivity, that's for sure I think that's a very serious outcome "
2611,1983-12-19,HORN," With regard to saying something about 1985, I think that is a good context in which to talk about our views on the reduction of total spending over a period of years I'd at least start out with Frank on that, but I think nominal GNP has to be reduced over a period of some years And if we're talking in the context of 1985, then I think one can distinguish it from being an annual target And that really is our strategy a gradual reduction of total spending in the economy Then, from that I would go on and diverge from Frank and say that money is important because it gets us there and that the rate of growth of money would be gradually reduced over time in order to accomplish this total spending strategy In that respect, I think what is in the Bluebook is reasonable I would go much along the line that already has been put forth, and that is  -36-    12/19-20/83  that reducing the money supply is important over time and where we come within the target ranges depends on what happens to velocity We have some ideas about that but we don't know ahead of time In some sense that kind of communication deals with what we need to say to the markets, which is how we're going to react next year to surprises We should be very open to saying that there are these uncertainties and that when we get surprises this is the basic structure within which we will look at those surprises  I also think your proposal is a good one, perhaps coming from my view that forecasting is a very tricky business, compounded by the District I come from Although we've certainly seen improvement, we're one of those very spotty Districts And even in the firms where we have seen improvement, I would say the attitude is characterized not as any kind of euphoria but as concern about the future Perhaps coming from my view that Ml does continue to tell us something, I would not like to see snugging up occur at this time I guess I feel that the danger of inflation in the future may well be reflected in an early way in some of the collective bargaining agreements, and because we have a very difficult [collective bargaining] calendar next year we need to watch [these developments] very carefully to see if more snugging is required at that point For all those reasons--the state of recovery and the future of the recovery, what Ml is telling us, and the fact that I think we haven't yet seen the collective bargaining process start leading us into a very dangerous area--I favor the proposal you made, Mr Chairman "
2636,1984-01-30,HORN," Well, in line with the long-run plan of reducing ranges over time, I could go along with either alternative I or alternative II If alternative I had the kind of flavor that Henry talked about--or really anything that goes along with more or less a 6 percent path for M1--I would find that satisfactory I suppose that states my position in one sense on M1 I'd like to raise M1 in importance for reasons that have already been stated I'd take it seriously and I'd particularly take long-run nominal GNP seriously But on the way to taking M1 seriously, I'd stop short of any kind of automaticity That approach has been outlined by several people My reasons are very much in line with the reasons that Jerry just mentioned and that Lyle mentioned earlier This is a time when we need a great deal of flexibility in how we interpret [the aggregates] and how we interpret what is happening in the economy The economic forecast we've just listened to is based on some very strong assumptions And the economy is very sensitive to those assumptions, not the least of which are the velocity assumption and all the  -27-    1/30-31/84  international assumptions and the assumptions on the deficit as well So, I would argue for alternative I or II, with M1 moved up in importance but, at least within the Committee, for maintaining our flexibility as we might be dealing with any of a wide variety of situations that we haven't yet been able to forecast  Rebased 4 to 8  10 to [unintelligible]?  I would argue that, although some individual monthly and quarterly numbers have come in perhaps not quite as strong as we expected, Lyle's general point about the risks in the economy next year being non-symmetrical on the strong side for a variety of reasons should make us want to be at least evenhanded in this directive  Oh, that's a point  -55-    1/30-31/84 "
2665,1984-03-26,HORN," Mr [Vice] Chairman, would you speak just a minute to the security [unintelligible]?  Thursday  Mr Chairman, just a point When these loans are renegotiated and when regional banks do express reluctance on various grounds, is it sometimes appropriate when that happens for presidents to make calls and just state the Federal Reserve's position?  Yes, and so am I Sometimes we get calls from staff members from various places and it's a little hard--at least speaking for myself--to read the seriousness of the problem and whether it really does warrant a Fed president stepping in or whether to tell these staff members that they really ought to try the regular channels [through] the correspondent banks It's a little hard to read the calls we're getting from the System to the banks  From the Federal Reserve System to the banks Sometimes I get calls from staff members either in Washington or New York suggesting that I call this, that, and the other bank  No, during these negotiations  We are approaching capacity in a number of our industries In autos, given the current mix of demand, we're at capacity for the larger types of cars Those steel products related to eventual consumer products are going at capacity Aluminum is very much using its capacity Alcoa is talking now about doing a lot of ingot importing because they are so backed up They are at capacity relative to the current plants and construction Of course, all these companies have plants that they closed down during the last recession They are at this point deciding not to reopen them Heavy trucks are going full out--light trucks a little less--as are [the companies that produce] the equipment that goes into these heavy trucks The tire industry is at more than capacity, working every shift their unions will let them Of course, we have our weak points One is electrical machinery Foundries--the ones that are still open, which are very few--still haven't gotten their first order, so to speak Machine tool orders are up, though that is not yet really reflected in terms of their production strengthening a great deal The reaction to all this strength seems to be, as I mentioned earlier, not reopening the old capacity but concentrating on more efficiency within the current capacity and not bringing back workers but doing a lot of overtime or sub-contracting All of these reactions I think come from a couple of causes Number one is a skepticism about the future--fear of high interest rates and so forth Another reason for these reactions is one that I view as very healthy I think we are seeing some reaction to the intensity of foreign competition and people are now beginning to manage their businesses a little differently We really hear about inventory control, about schemes to change the way of manufacturing from having huge plants and more people than they can manage efficiently to having smaller plants They are working on set-up times and on the quality of the final product and so forth We're hearing a lot about those adjustments and the new manufacturing techniques, if you will And, of course, these techniques are used in service industries as well in order to meet competitive pressures So, while I don't believe in discontinuities and in sudden and drastic changes in productivity and quality, I do think we really are seeing some significant differences in this recovery that I think represent a beginning of a trend  What all this has to do with prices is less clear I certainly agree with a comment that was made that these people want more time in the recovery Of course, these folks that I'm talking about particularly may have waited a long time to take part in the recovery as their industries are being affected at this stage in the recovery They will talk about concern about future inflation but there is less support when you say this may be the point in the recovery when we need to do something about it They say ""But give us a little more time"" So the public opinion out there is that, yes, there is a problem of future inflation but don't do anything too soon about it Now, when we ask these people what effect this is having on their prices right now and what effect it will have in the future, I'm not sure the story is completely believable What is happening now, of course, they are honest about We see so far some little increase in prices in these industries There is a dissatisfaction with profit margins and they don't expect too much cost pressure on that side in the future And then they say they are not going to increase prices-- that they aren't going to be able to And I think that's just a  -40-    3/26-27/84  current pessimism They are dissatisfied with their margins and I think they are just waiting for the moment We've seen a little narrowing of the discounts in steel but that isn't very broad yet In autos we've seen some shifting between models and some restoration of dealer margins and so forth  I might just make a comment looking to the auto contract The one piece of information I can add to the discussion is on the industry side Of course, with the new union leader, the union is making the expected strong sounds I have from a private source in the industry--however, a source that I think wouldn't involve too much posturing by the company--that, in fact, the company is ready to stand for a very long strike and that this management is making quite derogatory comments about previous managements giving the shop away, which might lend credence to the company's willingness to stand strong  Finally, in machine tools there is no price movement but that's an industry where we don't have capacity pressures Real estate prices have firmed and maybe increased a little So, we haven't really seen the price movement yet but the dissatisfaction that is expressed by a lot of these people and the closeness to capacity makes me think that their comments--pessimism from their point of view about future price increases--may not reflect what will come to pass and that we may get those price increases sooner rather than later  We have a lot of industries in the Fourth District that I would think are on the bottom side of that average  For many of the reasons that have been stated, I would like to see the monetary aggregates closer to the middle of the ranges And I'd like to see that happen sooner than alternative B would bring it about, in part because I do have real concerns about the strength of the economy But I also think there are significant risks in the future on the down side and that moves me more toward ""B"" While the other reason moves me away from ""B"" toward ""C,"" that moves me back toward ""B"" I must say I like the Chairman's words on his second option ""help nature along"" In my view a ""B-"" path does that By a ""B-"" path I'm talking about a borrowing assumption of about $12 billion but I'd not quibble on decimal points there And then just one comment on Henry's hippopotamus When I say ""B-"" I am assuming no change in the discount rate; I'm assuming that we'd be  -65-    3/26-27/84  moving with open market operations rather than with the discount rate So, I would be for a ""B-"" path  Yes, it does  It does I feel, as someone who doesn't take part in that decision, that there are several reasons why one might want to change the discount rate It could be done to make a statement or drive home a point or because of real difficulties at the window with too much of a gap between the fed funds rate and the discount rate I would not be in favor of changing it to make a strong statement at this time The political situation is such that I'd like to see the move made on the open market side, presuming that the gap doesn't become too big between the fed funds and discount rates and that maybe we could just live with leaning on the open market side  I'll go with that  Lead off with 7-1/2 and 8 percent, not 6 percent  Somewhat  Maybe "
2696,1984-05-21,HORN," Have we labeled it extended credit yet?  Mr Chairman, I also would talk about attitudes, but attitudes mainly in financial markets Attitudes are indicating different kinds of strains in financial markets than we talked about yesterday--the international situation, the Continental situation and so on--and are what I call attitudes of excesses in financial markets They start with some of the kinds of financial contracts we see being invented and being written, such as leveraged buyouts and that whole list of things It continues in the talk about how banks are running their businesses; I keep hearing more and more that banks around the country are shoving money out the door, if you will We hear about it from real estate developers; and when you start hearing real estate developers in the Fourth District talk about these things, you know that it's much broader based in the country Real estate developers are telling us that they can't put any equity in a shopping center these days--that banks are giving 100 percent financing--and that even if they wanted to put equity in, because that's the way they would like to run their business, they can't do it because their competition isn't doing it And worse than just the leverage problem alone is that the 100 percent financing is short term They are getting 5- to 7-year terms from a bank at variable interest rates and at the end of the development they are not going to the insurance companies and are not getting the long-term money So, the specter arises If you have a lot of unoccupied office buildings that are on 5- to 7-year term    5/21-22/84  loans, what happens when those loans came due? We only have one such building in Cleveland because we haven't had the building boom that other cities have had But if this is the situation around the country, then this very short-term financing of long-term assets could build to be a real problem  Another Fourth District story about banks but about banks around the country that I found very interesting was in connection with this recent takeover bid by  the fellow who controls that, needed--I don't remember the exact number--in excess of a billion dollars to make the bid And for reasons of confidentiality, he didn't want to have a bank form a syndicate to get the loan for him So, he did what he was advised couldn't be done He went to thirty-two banks and asked them for lines of credit for a takeover for an acquisition and he wouldn't tell them the acquisition target, and out of the thirty-two very large banks he approached only one refused to give him a line of credit because they wanted to know the name of who was being taken over Then, on a Friday afternoon, within several hours he pulled down all the lines and made the offer It is, I think, an indication of how business is being done these days  The thrift stories, of course, continue and we increasingly hear concerns about the lack of matched maturities--that thrifts aren't being run in a conservative way In the Fourth District we're beginning to get anecdotal evidence about some of our thrifts that are in very poor condition suggesting that things are so bad for them that there is nothing to keep them from trying to take a big bet and trying to hit a home run in real estate development kinds of projects Because if they fail to hit the home run, have they really worsened their condition? I guess it has always been true that there is a certain number of portfolio managers who have a very short-term view on investment and manage their portfolios by saying Let's pick the next takeover prospect But it seems that one hears about these people prospering now, and I suppose that would be another thing I would add to my list of concerns Just to complete an incomplete list, one more subject would be the auto negotiations We're beginning to hear a minority view, expressed by people in the transportation equipment industry in the Fourth District who are really in a position to have very good information, that GM will not be willing to take a strike They are talking about and hope that they will be able to get a settlement that will tie wage increases to profitability But the talk that they are hearing is that GM may be unwilling to take a strike  I guess one could build a very pessimistic case from this list of attitude excesses, if you will, and we could say that the financial contracts of today might be the international debt problem of several years from now That may be overstated, but I've just been getting so much anecdotal evidence across the board that I do believe we are beginning to see in attitudes a situation that is not inconsistent with rising inflationary expectations Those are my comments  I'm for alternative B in part because it is consistent with a long-term strategy to bring the aggregates, particularly M1, to the midpoint of their ranges by the end of the year I would like to see us end up the year with M1 at the midpoint of the long-run range given how strong the economy is and how velocity is going I think it is important to end up there because inflationary expectations are heating up and are a very serious matter in future inflation as well I'm for ""B"" now I have a nagging feeling that it may take more than that in the future to end up where I would like to end up at year-end But for the moment I view it as consistent with where I'd like to be  I have a marginal preference for leaving it out "
2722,1984-07-16,HORN," Mr Chairman, on the subject of differences in forecasts, in Cleveland we have forecast a very strong underlying economy--stronger than the staff's--through the third quarter of '85 because of the assumptions We make essentially no assumption about exchange rate changes; we have a five percent [decline] But we made an assumption about fiscal policy that there would be a second down payment, if you will, enacted in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of next year And that would bite in the fourth quarter of '85 So then our pattern is a strong economy, not a slowing one--surprising us We have a strong economy in 1985, growing at about a 4 percent real rate until the fourth quarter That gives us an inflation projection very close to the staff's projection, but it does have the significant risk that the exchange rate correction, when it occurs, could bring about even more inflation And we haven't really dealt effectively with the wage rate issue in our set of assumptions, and we consider that the other major risk besides the exchange rate  We were  To speak about M1 for a moment When we revised the M1 targets because of the problems we were having with velocity and the NOW account assumptions and so forth, if my memory serves me right, we moved them up 1-1/2 percentage points on the bottom of the range and 2-1/2 percentage points on the upper end of the range Now, with the threat of future inflation and the course of fiscal policy being slow [to adjust] in the future and, of course, with our increasing confidence in velocity of M1, I'd like to see the M1 range narrowed first and lowered second I would narrow it because of the reduced uncertainty That brings me to something like alternative III I suppose between the two options [for M1] in alternative III, the 4 to 7 percent is more appealing to me because I think the upper end of the range has been particularly meaningful to us in the Committee as we've operated But I'm a little uncomfortable even with 4 to 7 percent because I, like some other people around the table, like the idea of 8 percent nominal GNP as a policy objective And I'm a little uncomfortable with assuming 2 percent velocity [growth] I  -39-    7/16-17/84  think we might get velocity coming in a bit higher than that So, as I say, the two things I'd like to see are a narrowing of the M1 range and a lowering of the M1 range And 4 to 7 percent doesn't quite make me comfortable at this stage  By year-end I'd very much like to come out at the midpoint of our M1 range That would tie into all the longer-term kinds of considerations we were discussing earlier about what should happen to those ranges And that would cause me to choose something in the area of ""B-,"" with a slight increase in the borrowing assumption, up to as high as $12 billion I do that, of course, with a considerable amount of discomfort because I think the financial strains that have been enumerated are very real and very serious But the knife's edge has been referred to a number of times, and I think the strength in the economy and that need for a long-term policy are also very present "
2750,1984-08-21,HORN," In the Fourth District, Mr Chairman, we do have reports of some lessening in steel, which is definitely in that category of housing--  Yes, but you were referring to business spending We are getting a lot of reports of a great deal of enthusiasm on the business investment side of things That sort of goes on with an attitude that good times will go on forever--forgetting underlying problems such as the exchange rate, deficits, and so forth  I feel that M1 should come in at the end of the year at the midpoint of its range for a lot of reasons that have been previously stated, and I'm pleased to see that it's near there now Either alternative B or alternative C or something in between I think would work toward achieving that goal by the end of the year I would be in favor of maintaining the $1 billion borrowing level and I think it would be a mistake to give the markets a signal through the fed funds rate of any real change For that reason, I would like to protect against our producing a reduction in the federal funds rate "
2775,1984-10-02,HORN," As for business conditions in our District, the anecdotes would support an economy that is levelling off but not declining And we would view that as basically a good development I would like to comment on inflation A couple of speakers have commented on it and, in my opinion, it is an ongoing problem There is, of course, a good side of this We hear a number of anecdotes on productivity as well in our District--that it may be increasing and there may be some significant changes On the negative side, leaving off fiscal policy from the discussion and turning to the exchange rate, I think there is a genuine concern that if the exchange rate were to be reduced significantly, that would show through to prices very quickly In the Cleveland District we have a large number of the types of firms that are finding themselves subject to import substitution And it's that pressure that has kept their margins in an area where they are just completely uncomfortable with them They are just waiting for the moment to move [prices higher] We hear many, many stories of these types of firms being poised to move the instant they can So, that adds to my concern about inflation as the longer-term problem  I support alternative B and I share very strongly the concerns that Jerry expressed and that were expressed by some other people around the table Maybe I will just state it in a slightly different way I would not like to give the market the wrong signal through borrowing and the fed funds rate Now, if I only knew what the wrong signal was--  But, since I don't, moving slowly seems to me the best approach And I would support ""B"" "
2799,1984-11-07,HORN," The situation from the vantage point of the Cleveland District isn't much different from what has been expressed by a number of people around the table The Fourth District's difficulties are probably due to a [concurrence] of circumstances First, there are the ongoing structural problems and the intense import competition, which we feel so strongly, together with the pause in economic activity Most of our capital goods industries, excluding machine tools, have noted a flattening in orders and shipments In steel we've had a few more furnace shutdowns Housing in the District has been flat at best for several months and our bankers continue to comment on the difficult income situation that farmers find themselves in and the problems they will have servicing their debts The result, as has been pointed out, is increased uncertainty about the outlook for next year In our District we still have the basic view that the consumer will lift the economy into growth next year; around the District a strong Christmas is widely expected Expectations are also for a continued thrust from business investment, although presumably at a slower pace We have a basically positive outlook but a lot of concern is expressed; I think the concerns of many people arise in part because of how discouraged they are with the very strong import competition Others focus on the long-term problems of the economy the need for fiscal policy changes, the inflation problems, and so forth Also, expectations are generally damped by the pause that we see Although expectations are for growth next year, they are very shaky, and sometimes I wonder if they are held with enough confidence to get us over a few disappointments that we might see in the coming months  In my opinion the pause in the economy and several months of flatness in the money supply argue for active support of growth in the money supply Both ""A"" and ""B"" accept a shortfall in money, which I favor, but of the two I would favor moving toward alternative A I would like to see that kind of growth rate in November and December I think we ought to move carefully toward that I wouldn't want to jump to a $400 million borrowing level And as we test borrowing levels below $700 million, I would like to see a 9 percent plus federal funds rate and something around 9 percent triggering a call I am assuming something quite far toward alternative A In that assumption I assume no change in the discount rate I am sympathetic with the people who have said that we have come a long way with regard to interest rates; they are down considerably and we ought to wait and see [the impact of] what we have already done In addition, I still believe that the long-term underlying problem in the economy, and our top priority, is inflation  -38-    11/7/84  So, if we adopt something toward alternative A, we may have to reverse our actions if the recovery comes on as strongly as I think it might or if the growth in money resumes But I prefer to take the risk of the reversal to the risk of waiting That's where I come out "
2825,1984-12-17,HORN," In principle, we [would] never base it on the midpoint unless we were willing to argue that we had reasonable targets, or what we might in retrospect judge to have been reasonable targets, in the previous year  I believe the staff forecast represents what is probably the most likely outcome I'm still uneasy about the outlook, particularly for the next couple of quarters The pause or the growth slowdown has been greater than I expected and greater than a lot of us expected In analyzing that, I came up with a couple of events that in retrospect maybe weren't so surprising to me and a couple of events that caused me to focus anew on some existing issues in the economy The ones I put in the class of maybe being more [surprises of] timing rather than real surprises would be consumer spending and the deterioration in the trade accounts Those may well smooth out over time A couple [of developments] lead me to a new focus on old issues One is that I really do find surprising the extent to which the slowing in the national growth rate is represented in a stalling out of the economic recovery in the Midwest To use the Ohio state numbers as representative of the Fourth District, employment in Ohio hasn't risen all year and unemployment is now beginning to inch upward If you look at business in our area, particularly heavy manufacturing, you see the marking down of expectations They still think the national recovery is going on but they don't think it's going to be reflected in their business, particularly in the traditional capital goods area So, they're focusing instead on expansion of cost cutting and survival now  The second set of issues, which I find particularly worrisome, are those surrounding the situation in the farming, mining, and energy sectors I really see little in recent developments to suggest the end of the income squeeze in these areas Of course, not surprisingly in that respect--because really only time will deal with those problems--I think the time [will come] to write down some of the inflated asset prices from some of the decisions that were taken under a different set of economic [conditions] But this remains a problem in many small towns and even some large ones in that we really don't see the spillover, if you will, of the national recovery even if we do expect it to continue on at about the 3 percent rate  -41-    12/17-18/84  I have two comments specifically on whether I think the 3 percent rate is adequate or not I'd like to comment on both 1985 and then a bit beyond that I think probably there is room for more than 3 percent growth in 1985; I might say 3 to 4 percent But as we look at the long-term trend of the economy and, therefore, at what productivity increases are likely to be, I'm one of those people who are very impressed by some of the productivity stories I hear Some of the remarkable cost-cutting stories and productivity changes that we have seen in our District are really very exciting But they do take time to have their effect and I think they take more investment in order to have their effect, and the time periods can be significant before we really reap the full benefit of this So, as I look beyond 1985, I wouldn't like to place too heavy a bet on a really significant change in the productivity numbers For that reason, if we're talking publicly about something bigger than 3 percent next year, I'd like to be sure we don't put ourselves in the position where that sounds like more than 3 percent forevermore, because the forevermore numbers I tend to be more comfortable with are in the 2 to 3 percent range I think if we get involved in more than the 2 to 3 percent range long term, we're counting on a faster quickening of some of the productivity improvements or we're counting on continued enormous numbers of imports to mop up the large demand, and I wouldn't like to be betting on those too far into the future As far as the longer- term ranges, particularly the M1 range, as I look at them now they are not unreasonable in line with what I just discussed  I support your proposal, Mr Chairman  [Unintelligible] the first two sentences, that  I could vote for either "
2866,1985-02-12,HORN," I think the staff forecast is a reasonable one I am impressed with the year-end business statistics, and for that reason I agree with those around the table who are optimists and who feel the odds favor a stronger recovery than the one that's built into the forecast  Well, we could start with the 4th quarter GNP numbers and the auto numbers coming in strong One of the things I was worried about at year-end was the buildup in inventories; I think that is not so severe, based on the variety of numbers that I see  The whole personal consumption expenditures, or the consumer side, [looked good] and I tend to I focus on that In any case, looking at some of the assumptions that underlie my forecast--and I think a lot of the others around the table--one could build a case for consumer and business outlays becoming stronger If you assume an expansive fiscal policy, no sharp changes in the exchange rates, no abrupt rise in interest rates, low farm prices, even lower oil prices, and so forth, I think you can build a case for a stronger recovery than the one that the staff is forecasting, and I think that's pretty close to my forecast If the recovery is stronger, then the question about inflation comes up I would see it not spilling into the '85 numbers but be a danger in '86 And that, of course, requires either fiscal or monetary policy, or both, to deal with it  In the Fourth District, the pattern of business activity is sluggish with no particularly clear direction But I can even put an optimistic light on the Fourth District outlook in that there is really a distinct change in mood, though it's probably short of Bob's term ""euphoria"" The impressionistic evidence we're getting has really quite a different tone to it Of course, a lot of what we hear comes from the strong auto numbers in both December and January, but we're getting a lot of other stories We've had no disappointment in retail sales in January, for example We've had unexpected strength in chemical orders and, to a lesser degree, in both heavy trucks and steel orders as well This is all recent and impressionistic rather than in the numbers To keep from having a wholly optimistic report to the Committee, though, I will say that the talk about protectionism    2/12-13/85 -24-  has increased--if that's possible--in the Midwest You can't get two business people in the Midwest together without that being the subject, and I think that's a terribly serious danger as we go forward  It's eight-tenths--52 percent  The top of the midpoint of the fourth quarter  Have you heard anything about transportation to the Embassy tonight?  Mr Chairman, I also support alternative II and the 4 to 7 percent range for M1 There may be reasons--Chuck and Pres have talked about some of them--why M1 indeed probably would come in toward the top part of the range Nonetheless, with the uncertainties that we face--[the age of] the recovery, velocity, exchange rates, and so forth--I'd like to see discussion in the presentation of these ranges that is a little more symmetrical While it certainly would refer to the top half of the range, I'd favor some discussion about the uncertainties and what kinds of things might have us choose to come in at the midpoint or even lower as the year progresses The other reason that I favor the 4 to 7 percent range is that I think the statements about our long-term disinflationary goal sometimes get buried as we talk about some of the more immediate kinds of problems we have And I think it would be a good place and a good way to restate the long-term goal that we have  I favor alternative B I do share concerns with some of the people around the table that we have had 3 months of strong M1 growth and that by the end of March it could be more like 5 months And at that point my concerns would be greater about the direction of M1 growth But for the time being I favor ""B""  We rebased and we respecified "
2893,1985-03-26,HORN," Mr Chairman, I agree in general with the staff forecast I also agree with several people who have said that the investment outlook is very crucial to the forecast A lot of numbers for sectors and for various orders and so forth have been quoted The only comment I'd add--and in adding this I will say that I really haven't yet revised down substantially my outlook for investment this year--is that the longer-term incentives for investment remain favorable And I think that, added to the list of the rather mixed or flat [indicators], causes me to think there is still hope in the investment area  Well, they really go back to some of the law changes in 1980, if my date is right--the sorts of things that I think probably caused the real return on investment to increase over a period of years and gradually put an underlying floor on investment that way  Turning to uncertainties, so far I think the Ohio situation has had a minimal effect on economic activity Of course, it has had a larger effect on banking structure, but I certainly agree with Jerry's statement that the jury is still out there Of the 71 institutions plus Home State that were closed, only about 20 are fully open today As the week passes we expect several more, and perhaps several large ones, to be added to that list But eventually, as this situation unfolds, there are some that will not qualify for federal insurance or otherwise qualify to open without recapitalization or, in some cases, that will not be enough and they will have to be merged or acquired successfully in order to keep the depositors whole Public confidence has been running well ever since the Ohio legislature passed the act that requires federal insurance, essentially, plus some other ways to reopen And that is being supported by these [recent] openings But there will come a time when openings will not be so easy--if easy is the word, which it isn't--as it has been this week Then the realization that either it will be or may be difficult to sell some of these institutions could once again come into the public eye Having said all that, the financial fragility issue that I really worry about is not so much the Ohio one--though there could still be surprises down the road on that--but the overall one that we've been discussing for months, or maybe even years, around this table And the fact that we had a very close look at that in the last several weeks and some groups who don't normally take such a close look--that is, individuals and consumers--also had a close look suggests that that group may be particularly sensitive if [they are] hit again Overall, I do judge the financial fragility issue to continue to be very worrisome  -22-    3/26/85  As for monetary policy, taking all these things together, I would very much like not to find myself in a position three months from now of wanting to make a significant move in monetary policy; and I'd like to end up three months from now in a position where we have a good chance of being in the [monetary growth] ranges by year-end  Of the ones that opened up fully there has been to our knowledge no extraordinary activity whatsoever Virtually all of them are open on this partial payout basis--that is $100 [per withdrawal] and $750 a month per depositor In those cases there are four of them that have had heavy lobby traffic But of course the withdrawals are severely limited so the [total] withdrawals are in the realm of reason And three of those four are ones that had experienced runs before the closing All in all, I'd say so far the operation has been successful  I'd add that since they are open for the partial payouts and such borrowing is permitted to support that activity we would expect borrowing to increase each day for some time now  Each account  I would favor a borrowing level of about $500 million; that would put me in the ""B minus"" range And I think the adjustment from 6-1/2 to 6 percent on M1 would be appropriate "
2917,1985-05-21,HORN," Mr Chairman, I'd like to show some progress in moving the monetary aggregates--M1 in particular--toward where we want to be at year-end Because of the uncertainties in the economy and the uncertainties with respect to velocity, where I personally would like to come out at year-end is in the top part of the ranges, particularly for M1 I'm not in favor of bringing it back too fast for a number of reasons, including the uncertainties But I'm also not sure it's the appropriate time to be active on the other side either So, I would favor alternative C, but I would favor changing the borrowing number upward slowly as things develop  -30-    5/21/85 "
2940,1985-07-09,HORN," I would support the point of view also that we put M1 on a monitoring basis That may come as a surprise to some of you who know that I believe in targeting M1 and in its relation to prices and in its usefulness in the past I also think it will be very useful to us in the future in the long run in the fight against inflation But I do think that rebasing or revising the current targets is an indication that we are serious about pursuing those targets Or at least I believe that when we do set targets for M1, we ought to be serious about them because I think it's that important And at this point, at least speaking for myself, I don't know where I would like M1 to be in the fourth quarter of this year It is too early, I think We don't have the kind of information I would like to have to set the serious M1 target that I would like to set So, it seems to me that it is most appropriate to say M1 is a monitoring variable right now The rest of what I would like said is that we are serious about the long-term battle against inflation and about coming back to M1 as soon as practicable Our experience the last time we did this was that it was after something like a year that we found we could indeed reemphasize M1 We could indicate that we would hope that at least by the fourth quarter of this year we might have enough information to then reemphasize M1 and conclude on that For that reason, I would not do anything with the 1985 targets but for 1986 I would reduce the target for M1 to a range of 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, slightly below the 1985 range, to indicate our seriousness in coming back to this kind of strategy as soon as we have some more information  Isn't the answer ""All of the above,"" John?  Mr Chairman, coming back to both the integrity point and to Bob's point about what it is that we want to do with M1 Although I have a technical preference that I have already expressed for not doing anything on the M1 target and declaring it a monitoring  -47-    7/9-10/85  range, it seems to me the real issue here is not so much technically what we do, but the words you use to surround it The real issue is that you in fact very carefully describe to people what it is about M1 and the uncertainty, what the circumstances are that we find ourselves in, and what kinds of circumstances we might find ourselves in the future that might cause us to do this, that, or the other thing Those words in the end will be what preserves our integrity, whatever technical mechanism we use at this point  If you want [to be] certain "
2966,1985-08-20,HORN," Well, Mr Chairman, as seems to be the consensus of this Committee, I don't find any reason to argue for much change today in the way we are conducting policy So I would come out wanting more of the same, which would be alternative B in my mind However, I would associate myself with some previous speakers who said, with a background of a pretty reasonable forecast in the Greenbook and a background of quite a bit of liquidity in the economy, that we can't go on at this rate forever So I would like to suggest that some more insubstantial tightening, as the period progresses and as we see events unfold, might be appropriate And it might be appropriate--more than accomplishing something substantive in terms of the growth rate of money--just as a small signal to markets that in fact we think it can't go on forever and that we are waiting for the right time to take further action I suppose that would be reflected in the directive, based on the same kind of language we used the last time--that is, the ""would"" and ""might""--that we would react in the event of higher-than-expected growth and might on the lower side "
2994,1985-10-01,HORN," Mr Chairman, in the Fourth Federal Reserve District business conditions remain sluggish We have price weakness across a wide range of activities; wheat, aluminum, coal, and steel come to mind on that front Conditions are not noticeably improving and they are not really getting worse either A bright note in our District would come from the retail side; retailers are happy with the pace of sales and they are happy with the mood of consumers I will be very interested in assessing the reactions to the G-5 announcement in our District, since I think we are a hotbed of protectionist sentiment I think that the G-5 announcement will be successful in blunting protectionist sentiment and that the efforts will bear fruit in a reasonable period of time But there is an interesting twist there in that just from the very people who have the most to gain from  -15-    10/1/85  a falling dollar we hear the concern that if it's not accompanied by either the spurring of growth abroad or the reigning in of our deficits that, in fact, it won't do them the good that they so desperately need from it  Yes, indeed But I do think there is a real understanding in the more sophisticated business public of the dangerous game [the G-5] are playing; and we see that time and time again in our District Having said all that, I think that if we do manage to play this dangerous game successfully and don't have a precipitous drop in the exchange rate, there is room in the short run for optimism We have really good news on the inflation front I don't see inflation starting from any other cause except an exchange rate decline or a real spurt in economic growth, and we may be seeing a little pickup in economic growth So, in the short run I think there is room for optimism I add all of that together and say that we should stay about where we are on monetary policy That would be $500 million of borrowing and the federal funds rate where it is-- up nudging the 8 percent level "
3020,1985-11-04,HORN," Looking around the District I find, much as is the case for the national outlook, that the incoming data are not conclusive I see no evidence of accumulating weakness nor signs of stronger growth in the months ahead The business investment picture has come in consistently weaker than I had expected, both in the District and of course nationally as well But I wouldn't see a change in that outlook Housing, which Jerry just spoke of, has responded to the lowering of interest rates with less strength than I and many of us had expected, and that is in the District as well as nationally The real question is with the consumer, and in our District retailers are encouraged about the Christmas season Also, in talking to people in the business community I have noticed what I think is a change in attitude toward their formerly optimistic feeling that the fiscal impasse might be resolved I have long thought that it probably would not but in that I differed with the business community that I talked to; they had been optimistic up until the last couple of months but I think now their view is that the fiscal impasse will remain an impasse I am not sure that I can take the next step and say how that will change their planning for the future, but I think there has been a distinct change in attitude there I would say    11/4-5/85  that the business people I talk to continue to be guardedly hopeful about efforts to reduce exchange rates While they realize the dangers connected with an overly fast reduction of the exchange rate, I think they view what has happened perhaps as being maintainable And if exchange rates were to back up, I think their reaction would be disappointment and that might affect their future plans  My view of the economic outlook is about the same as the staff's forecast--I don't know whether to describe that as moderate expansion--in the next couple of quarters As I look at the 2 to 3 percent number, which may [turn out to] be closer to 2 percent, and ask myself if that is a good or bad number to be looking at in the forecast, I am not sure I come to a conclusion If I talk to my directors and others and look at the gaps in the economy, I see a lot of room to say it is not a good number On the other hand, when I remember the difficulty of reducing inflation and the high price we paid, it looks better in that context  It doesn't seem to me that time is of the essence here Two weeks from now is fine; it wasn't as if we decided something at this meeting relative to M1  If it's two weeks from now, it's fine just to say it a little more clearly than you did in Toronto "
3046,1985-12-16,HORN," Sam, when you get [foreign currency] proceeds from intervention, in what form are they held?  Basically, you don't get so much of a currency relative to the size of the market that you have to go away from publicly issued debt or government debt?  Mr Chairman, I think that Pres' suggestion about a limited range for M1 has considerable merit I think M1 is a very important number, as you know, and because of its transactions component may become very important to us again in the future, either in its current form or perhaps in a new form But the transactions component makes it, I think, very special And in one sense it seems to me that we discredit it by setting a range for it that we not only do not intend to bring it within but that we don't even think it will come in within So I think we should consider the idea of not setting a range for M1 since the jury is really out on a lot of these matters  Jim, if one is looking at the net export sector for a kick upward in the economy next year and is worried that that might not happen until the second half, let's say, what more specifically are the outlooks for some of the economies abroad--the developed countries We're beginning to hear some good news on that  We had some events in our District recently that might have some implications for the investment outlook We have had an unusual number of write-offs of properties in some of our industries Olgivie Norton wrote off a major part of its iron ore assets Sohio wrote off major amounts in both copper and Carborundum There are some big write-offs from US Steel as well If one were to generalize from these few situations, I suppose one could say that in basic industries and in basic materials within those industries we have a situation that would not be consistent with investment strength next year That also goes along with my view of the investment outlook for next year  Mr Chairman, as a number of people have pointed out, a lot of things have happened since the last meeting and maybe in one sense that does give us a bit of a window on monetary policy Among the many things that have happened since the last meeting, one that I focus on particularly is the euphoria in financial markets combined with something that hasn't changed since the last meeting-- the financial strains in the economy Yesterday, there were a few brief comments exchanged about 1929 that I thought were quite interesting and it brings up the whole subject If the Federal Reserve were in the business of trying to deal with the speculative mood in the economy, what would we do? I guess one could argue the financial strains issue either way on monetary policy One could say that the strains are so great that we have to be careful and ease--we have to be careful always, of course--or that the way to take the speculation out would be to tighten Altogether it comes down to the fact that monetary policy is a very big and heavy tool to use in this respect; I'd say our hands are kind of tied I find myself, in addition to thinking a lot about discount rates at this meeting where they are not  -53-    12/16-17/85  on the agenda, also thinking a lot about supervision and regulation, which is not on the agenda, because in order to deal with financial strains I suppose we're reduced to other tools besides monetary policy In any case, with all of those considerations, on monetary policy I come down on the side of saying that I wouldn't change much from where we are today I'd favor something like alternative B, and I think we do have room to go in the ""B plus"" direction  Yes  I guess after all of these two hands--[on the one hand and on the other hand]--it's hard to know Toward ""A"" "
3071,1986-02-11,HORN," Jim, for the past couple of years, we have had a lot of financial structure problems Now today, if not before, we'll certainly add to that list the potential problems that the oil price could cause Looking back over the shape of the US recovery, where is it that we see these problems reflected in the recovery? Do we see them in housing, business investment, balance sheets and so forth? Do the sectoral problems just all wash out by the time it all gets to the national average process? What has been the effect?  It's a good start  Mr Chairman, my forecast is for 3 percent real growth and 4 percent prices, so I wouldn't characterize myself as being unduly worried about the strength of the economy or future inflation right now Nonetheless, in terms of my feelings of discomfort with the forecast, they tend to be on the side of looking at that list of things that mean the economy is stronger than we have seen it and might get even stronger than we are forecasting The list has been given by several people around the table and it includes the fact that whatever the margin of excess capacity in the US was, it's lower today The sharp decline in oil prices will mean stronger economic activity in countries such as ours The resource shift implied by the exchange rate decline also will strengthen business economic activity So, that list of changes that have brought about a stronger economy is very much on my mind  Turning to the inflation outlook, again there has been a list given; I would add one more item to the list of areas of potential concern about the inflation outlook and that is the labor calendar for this year There is quite an active labor calendar this year and from the point of view of size, maybe it's a chance to make more gains I really don't want to analyze it except to say that  No, steel  In the Fourth District, there hasn't been much change in activity, but I think there has been a perceptible change in mood The mood is one of growing confidence and growing optimism though, as I say, without any changes in order books or production schedules to back it up That may be what is characterized as a shallow attitude of confidence, but we do have that in the Fourth District  Mr Chairman, because of the uncertainties I favor wide ranges, and for M1 a 3 to 8 percent range would be appropriate I think the words that you use in your testimony perhaps will be more important than the ranges we choose And I think where we come in with respect to Ml, and for that matter with regard to the other aggregates, will have a lot to do with the conditions in the economy and perhaps some financial conditions as well Some words on the type of reaction we might have if the economy comes in stronger than expected I think would be very helpful  I support alternative B with the funds rate in the 7-3/4+ percent range "
3097,1986-04-01,HORN," I agree both with Ed and Tom I am puzzled as to why we haven't seen more strength in the economic numbers If someone had told me four months ago where oil prices would be and where    4/1/86  interest rates would be today, I certainly would have predicted a different overall level of economic activity than we find today I continue to expect strength as I look around me in the District I see a reasonable amount of confidence in the District; nobody is complaining, really Both the fall in the exchange rate and the lower interest rates are expected to have some spillover into the heavy capital goods industry by the people in those industries in my District In the steel industry we have seen an improvement in margins and orders, which may be related to labor negotiations even though they are done company by company this year There are old habits of purchasing agents that still may be in effect, so we don't know how real that is in the steel industry at this time Our bankers are reporting, as are Tom's, this extremely high level of activity In the Fourth District it is more in the refinancing area than the new building area We see that heavy refinancing on the commercial side as well Again, the new activity in that area is not so strong where our builders are expressing more and more concern about the overhang All in all, I guess I agree with this general attitude of confidence that I see around my District I continue to expect strength in the economy, so I don't know whether to characterize my stance as watchful patience or watchful concern On the concern side, I think that we will have some time to react if the economic numbers come in weaker in the future than I expect Maybe [unintelligible] is all but the municipal sector; those folks aren't very happy with the prospect of the federal budget deficit reduction  We have Standard Oil in Ohio and of course they have a big North Slope investment; they are not talking yet about decreasing production there They have some major capital expenditures--they are halfway through a four-year program that they are considering stopping in its tracks--that they are meeting on that these days They haven't made that decision yet But they haven't yet talked about production cutbacks They have certainly talked about how the state of Alaska is going; it is just like dealing with a foreign government, they say  I favor a ""wait and see"" posture and I think ""B"" is that posture I think that we really do have the time to watch events unfold As for the borrowing number, I suppose I am for $300 million, although we always seem to interpret that in the light of what happens It has recently been running below $250 million and I'm for $300 million but would go at it carefully, which I guess is the way we do it anyway  Going up from $250 million to $300 million "
3122,1986-05-20,HORN," Like the previous three speakers and like the staff, our forecast is for a pickup in the economy in the second half But in fact we find the present situation disquieting There is, of course, no evidence today of this pickup and in fact it may be postponed I still believe that the past favorable developments will show through in the economy, but sometimes I worry that maybe they have already shown through in part in the numbers we are seeing right now and that we will see less of a pickup than we all are forecasting I certainly would feel better if we were seeing movement in something besides the housing numbers  Like other parts of the country, we are seeing good housing numbers in our District I remind myself that under normal conditions, if I saw these kinds of economic statistics after such a long economic expansion, I normally would not be hopeful about the future But the incoming employment numbers keep me somewhat more hopeful, perhaps If I have special concerns today, I think they center around the trade numbers and the inventory numbers On the trade side we expect a turnaround, and I would say that the business community expects a turnaround In the Fourth District the business community, in spite of flat performance, is quite optimistic on the trade turnaround side and on the overall economic outlook I do find, however, that there is beginning to be a difference between the expectations of the business community and of some of the economists I talk to who are beginning to be discouraged, particularly on the trade number, and who are talking about the need for the foreign exchange    5/20/86  rate to go down further On the inventory side, of course, good inventory numbers depend very much on what business expectations are And I am concerned that, if this positive business mood I see begins to slip, we may then be in for an inventory correction While I think our patience will be tested over the next several months, I remain optimistic about the second half; but with each passing month I grow more uncertain about it  I favor alternative B and the number II statement of the directive, although I could take number III with both the suggestions that Jerry has made with regard to saying something about the aggregates That is why I mildly favor II because I don't want to indicate at this point that we are turning our back on the aggregates or that we are not being watchful of them I also agree about the change in the sentence on somewhat lesser restraint, because    5/20/86  I do think the one thing that could happen that might make me want somewhat lesser restraint would be a remarkably sluggish economy "
3148,1986-07-08,HORN," I am in favor of dropping the range for Ml--in particular for 1987 We don't intend to meet it and we don't really know--  Yes, I favor not announcing a range for M1 for 1987 As to how we handle 1986, I also favor not having a range Whether we do that by actually eliminating the range we have already set or by saying that it was set and we are not going to come within it, I don't feel too strongly one way or another as long as we don't announce a range for 1987 I think it communicates that for the moment we have to step away from this As you can imagine, I also have great hopes that we will come back to it one day  My forecast is similar to the staff's forecast, but I have found myself in the last three or four months relatively concerned about the downside risks of the forecast I focus these concerns on two particular areas First of all, like many others, my forecast depends on a significant improvement in exports and I wonder whether that is really going to come to pass The other area that I focus my concerns on is the long list of imbalances in the economy I'm not quite sure how that works through the forecast as would the failure of net exports to improve; but the list is long and this seems to me to be a very difficult economic environment for a recovery to continue  Turning to the District, our recent numbers show no significant strengthening but no significant deterioration in economic activity From businessmen in our District--our directors among them --I sense a growing caution but not yet disappointment in the economy Perhaps they are not disappointed on the trade side because they were always skeptical about the trade rebound; they didn't expect it and it hasn't happened They continue to report intense import competition and we, like Si Keehn, also have industries that simply have been unable to lift their prices Again, as in Si's District, our businessmen and directors seem fairly happy with the labor arrangements they have I know it's fashionable to talk about changes in work rules when you have labor settlements, but I hear that talk often enough and from enough people that I think they are not posturing--that maybe this is really happening I hear a lot of good feelings about the whole labor arrangement that businessmen are facing A lot of the them seem to attribute the present sluggishness to the up-front problems with the oil industry We have a reasonable amount of that in Ohio; Marathon just announced layoffs yesterday, as a matter of fact In conclusion, I think the economic outlook is good, but the risks are increasingly on the down side  Paul, would you comment on a strategy that would involve our easing policy or lowering the discount rate or whatever? What kind of pressure would that put on foreign countries to, say, stimulate their economies?  Yes  And one of those four would be happy either way    7/8-9/86  I am for a $300 million borrowing level I am assuming a 50 basis point drop in the discount rate, essentially for  -62-    7/8-9/86  the international reasons--the effort to get into that business a little and see how things develop "
3174,1986-08-19,HORN," An argument we hear in our area that would put us on the side of not being very optimistic is that a lot of our manufacturers are conducting trade with countries with an exchange rate that hasn't moved very much We hear that time and time again  Mr Chairman, I favor a borrowing level of approximately $300 million and a half percentage point cut in the discount rate My view is conditioned by my outlook for prices I suppose four years of a rather steady number of around 4 percent followed by this remarkable year, even when you make adjustments for energy and food, draw me to conclude reluctantly that the outlook for inflation may be reasonably good I say I view that reluctantly because I have great concerns that, with the kind of money growth we have been seeing, we do have a long-term problem with inflation But now I view the current environment as a moment where we do have room for ease because of the inflation picture So, my recommendation for easing is not based so much on my view of the outlook for the real economy as it is on my outlook for inflation "
3200,1986-09-23,HORN," So much of the public discussion about the exchange rate seems to center on the mark and the yen and yet we focus from time to time on how little the dollar has moved with respect to other important currencies--those of Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and so forth Is there any effort, nonpublic effort, being made with these governments?  I guess my view on this is that the folks in the Treasury Department ought to be in the debt management business and that some sort of neutral stand by the Federal Reserve is an appropriate one Having said that, I think you could define policy as neutral if either we pursued a bills only approach or if we routinely went in for preannounced, preagreed, purchases in the long-term area    9/23/86  And since both long-term and short-term [securities] count as collateral that doesn't help make the decision either But those are the two policies that I can define as neutral, if you will  Staying on the trade number for just a moment If for some reason that projected trade number didn't come to pass, there might be implications for the inflation number If you get more stimulus from the deficit than you're projecting and less from the trade accounts, then that might cause you to revise your inflation number Inflation would be worse then  Well, taking off on that lead, the numbers in the Cleveland forecast look quite a bit like the Greenbook forecast But perhaps, whereas I sense from the Greenbook that the Board staff tends to look at those numbers and see the glass as half full, I see the glass as half empty I suppose that is a result number one, of the situation in the Fourth Federal Reserve District, and number two, of my growing disappointment that the expectations I had earlier in the year for lower interest rates, a higher stock market, and low oil prices coming through haven't yet materialized Or, if they have materialized, they haven't been in the quantity that I expected  From the Fourth District vantage point I am unable to report developments that suggest a step-up in the pace of expansion over the balance of the year The flat economy has meant a flat capital goods market and that is key for the Fourth District Given that, together with strong competition from imports, many District producers--notably of steel--are tempering their optimism and are starting another wave of restructuring and serious consideration of cost cutting I see this attitude not only in steel, but in autos, auto-related industries, machine tools--what is left of them--and machinery-making in general Although we are not talking about declining production-- things aren't that bad--we are talking about decreasing market shares in intense competition All of that is making people think about survival about shutting down less efficient facilities and basically consolidating and down-scaling operations generally I don't think the mood is bleak, but I think there is much less optimism on futures markets and the future ability to gain market share than there was, say, a year ago when there was more hope for what the exchange rate would do for our world in the Fourth Federal Reserve District So, I would say that in this next year in the industrial Midwest--or what is left of it--we would have a turbulent time, with the next steps being toward restructuring  Businessmen and the directors in our District talk more and more about their disappointment with the budget process I am not sure how to evaluate that because there are the two sides--one is the deficit reduction and the other is the tax increase they are about to be hit with, or may be about to be hit with That is something that I hear talked about more and more as time passes I think the overall    9/23/86  effect of these factors is working in the direction of weakening the foundation for the expansion next year With the additional drag on capital goods that we will see from the tax package, I see little likelihood of a strengthening in the traditional capital goods market I don't yet detect nervousness about inflation; people seem prepared to watch prices go up and attribute that to the end of the oil price contribution to the indices Cost control efforts really are already intense and they will intensify One could argue on the good side from that, but even among businessmen I find skepticism from pushing too hard or relying on that on the inflation front Of course, on the inflation front, if the deficit is not going to be brought down then the load will fall once again on monetary policy  I am for alternative B As we have been easing policy over time, with each subsequent move we have increasingly asked ourselves the question Can monetary policy really help the situation of the imbalances and so forth? For the last couple of moves, which I have been in favor of, I have found it harder to answer the question that monetary policy will help I think we probably have gone about as far we can with monetary policy and now it is time to stop and watch the developments  No nuances "
3226,1986-11-05,HORN," I would like to piggy-back on that and ask How do they come through in the CPI? Do you have an estimate or rule of thumb that you use about what proportion of the CPI is import prices and so on?  In the Fourth District we don't really see evidence of a resurgence in the economy nor do we see anything that would indicate that we're going into a recession As I look around the District I have the opinion that Ed Boehne expressed that it's sort of more of the same I think my directors in general and the businessmen I talk to have that opinion I think we're more concerned in our area about the restructuring that's going on in some specific industries--steel and autos come particularly to mind, although I suppose machine tools could be put on that list as well But this idea of an unchanged outlook, I think, is embodied in most forecasts and I would have no quarrel with it  On the District level, one of the interesting stories we're looking at is the steel story My view is that there is more and more recognition by the management in those companies, and maybe by labor    11/5/86  as well, that the problem is not imports and it's not exchange rates but that the problem is more basic than that--whether you call it overcapacity or whether you call it inadequate demand to support capacity They are beginning to look at that and simultaneously, I think, are trying to deal with it constructively Now, whether it can be dealt with or not is another issue, because as they close plants they have pension costs and the fringe benefit liabilities, and I certainly don't see how they're going to deal with that But at least I see a recognition of what the problem is and an attempt to deal with it Of course, the USX strike has bought the industry time; it has closed down something like the proportion of capacity the industry would like to see closed down So a little time has been bought by that We don't see in our District what Frank Morris sees on the exports side What we see in the foreign sector is that people are beginning to feel better about import prices and that they are poised and ready to take advantage of that by moving their own prices up as soon as they see the window to do it I see a shift of attitude in the foreign sector, but that's the one that I see "
3250,1986-12-15,HORN," Well, I agree with many people who think that this is not the time to set an M1 target  Oh, sorry That's not what I am talking about  Mr Chairman, I am with those who think we should not set a target range for Ml but I suppose, in the end, a monitoring range is a possibility The words that we associate with what we do with M1--and for that matter with monetary targeting in general--I    12/15-16/86  think are very important And I would like to see some words that maybe go back a bit to Bob Black's point about the targeting of inflation, or just some words that say monetary targeting is not an objective of the Federal Reserve System--that whether it's Ml, M2 or M3, we are not expecting to control the aggregates, but we are setting ranges that we think are consistent with such and such a pattern of prices, employment, and total spending I would indicate that, basically, we began setting target ranges publicly and in Congressional testimony as a way of assuring the Congress and the public that we were in fact intent on getting to a certain point with inflation, and that at the moment the connection between monetary targets and inflation is not what it used to be, and that we are talking here about what monetary targets we think are consistent with our ultimate objective  Mr Chairman, our view hasn't changed much since the last meeting We are substantially in agreement with the staff forecast, and for the Fourth District that staff forecast, if it came true, would not be a bad outcome It would give us some more time to carry through the further restructuring process that is under way in our heavy manufacturing sector We continue to experience plant closings and structural changes and, of course, the size and speed of the adjustments is closely related to the impact of the exchange rates A period of slow growth would be basically a good outcome for us on that front There is a hopeful note on the export side in our District In talking to our directors and to other businessmen, we don't have a profusion of new export orders to report but we do have a significant increase in the number of inquiries from foreign customers, and their attitudes seem to be much more receptive than we have noted in the past Beyond that, there is also a feeling that the thrust of imports into specific markets has not been as strong as it    12/15-16/86  was We have hope on another front as well--on the employment growth in our District To take the Ohio numbers alone, in the last year Ohio employment has grown faster than the nation as a whole, significantly fueled by employment in the services sector, and within that, in the business services sector On the negative side, not only in our bank but in our District many feel that the risks connected with the 1987 forecast are on the down side That feeling stems from the straightforward reasoning that the trade accounts may not turn around as much as anticipated in the forecast and that the business investment sector may not be particularly strong So it's easy to picture an economy that won't, in fact, be growing in the 2 to 3 percent range It would be nice to be able to identify some truly bright spots to counter the skepticism but so far I haven't been able to do that On the retail sales side, we see in our District much of what was reported yesterday as the national trend; we see soft retail sales with a slightly stronger durables component Our retailers say they have plenty of traffic in their stores but that just isn't resulting in the kind of sales they expect They are, of course, reacting with discounting and waiting to see what the last few days [of the Christmas shopping season] will bring  I will end with a note on the agricultural situation in our District We have a fairly small agricultural sector and it's fairly diverse But I report this just because it seems rather interesting Up until just a few months ago, three months ago maybe, the attitude in our District was that somehow the agricultural situation--land prices and income pressures on farm banks and on good farmers--had reached a plateau This view has shifted significantly in the last couple of months under the weight of good crops and the low prices associated with them and the huge federal outlays We now have a view among quite a wide range of people--from bankers to other observers in our District--that there is going to be another significant adjustment in land prices and in farm programs as well  ""B"" and symmetric "
