9249,2011-06-21,"  Since the last FOMC meeting, we have had to continually expand  the vertical scale of the upper-left chart in exhibit 5, as spreads on Greek sovereign  debt over German bunds soared ever higher  As indicated in the upper-right chart, a  year into the IMF–EU program, Greece’s debt-to-GDP ratio remains on an  unsustainable trajectory  The official sector has been struggling with how to finance  Greece, given that a return to the markets early next year, as originally envisioned,  seems doubtful  After much Sturm und Drang, EU leaders appear prepared to  provide additional funding to help get Greece through the next 12 months, conditional  on greater fiscal and privatization measures from Greece  But with the Greek  political situation worsening, there is some uncertainty about whether these measures  will be approved in time  Without the next official-sector disbursement, the Greek  government runs out of cash in mid-July   Our working assumption is that Greece manages to secure the funding needed to  avert a disorderly default next month  We also expect that some combination of  additional official financing, private-creditor contributions, and Greek government  actions will be cobbled together to cover Greece for some time to come  Eventually,  however, more ambitious steps will be needed to make Greece’s debt sustainable— either through significant restructuring of Greek sovereign debt, extended transfers  from the euro area, or both  That process will likely be messy  But should  restructuring occur, we assume sufficient financial backstops will be put in place to  prevent contagion from spilling over to Spain, the rest of Europe, and beyond  We  cannot discount the very real possibility, however, of far more disruptive outcomes  than in our baseline   In the event that the debt of Greece, or even Ireland, or Portugal—the three most  vulnerable economies—is restructured, the direct channels of contagion to the US   June 21–22, 2011 76 of 282              banking system are likely to be relatively limited  As seen in the table, US data  provided to the BIS show that in December, the direct credit exposure of US banks  to Greece was $7 billion, or 1 percent of Tier 1 capital, and to Greece, Ireland, and  Portugal combined was 7 percent of Tier 1 capital  Moreover, exposure to Greece  and the other vulnerable countries, including Spain, has fallen notably since March  2010, as seen in the middle-right chart  Information gleaned from individual US  banks provides corroborating evidence that their direct exposure to the three weakest  peripheral countries is limited   In contrast, according to the BIS, many “core” European banks, including those in  Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, are significantly exposed to peripheral  Europe  And the US financial system, in turn, had credit exposure to banks in core  Europe topping $½ trillion in December  As Dan will discuss shortly, the exposure to  Europe of prime US money market mutual funds is especially worrisome   Therefore, although we believe core Europe has sufficient resources to make up  capital losses suffered by its banks as a result of a peripheral crisis, uncertainties  about which banks are most affected and how their problems will be resolved could  lead to sharp reductions in confidence and disruptions to markets globally, including  in the United States   So far, broader indicators of financial stress emanating from the Greek fiscal  crisis are more subdued than when tensions flared a year ago, but the sharp swings in  the euro–dollar exchange rate (lower-left panel) and the decline in European stock  prices (shown to the right) are recent evidence of the ability of the Greek crisis to  rattle markets   Heightened fears about Greece and weaker incoming data have created a sense of  uncertainty in markets about global growth, discussed in your next exhibit  As can be  seen in the top line of the table, we are forecasting a step-down in foreign growth to  2¾ percent in the second quarter  Much of this step-down reflects a moderation from  the very rapid 4 percent expansion last quarter  We had already anticipated some of  this slowing in the April Tealbook, and our view has been reinforced by first-quarter  output data (shown to the right) that generally came in higher than we’d expected   Thus, we haven’t been too surprised by the weakening in foreign manufacturing PMI  data through May (shown in the middle panel), nor by Chinese consumption and  lending data (charted to the right) indicating that recent policies are contributing to a  moderation in Chinese GDP growth to around 8 percent this quarter   An exception has been Japan, where the economic impact of the March  earthquake was felt more quickly and more severely than we had anticipated  We  have built in a larger decline in Japanese activity in the second quarter (line 4 in the  table) then we had in April, and this contributes to our estimated step-down in  aggregate foreign growth  However, a normalization in Japanese suppliers’ delivery  times and a recovery in real consumption (shown in the middle-left panel) give us  confidence that Japan’s economy will snap back in the third quarter, supporting a  corresponding revival in foreign growth as a whole  Nevertheless, in light of  developments in the United States, the recent signs of slowing abroad have given us   June 21–22, 2011 77 of 282              pause, and we will be watching closely for signs of slowing in foreign growth that is  more deep seated   Evidence of moderating foreign output growth and the recent turndown in  commodity prices, which Trevor will discuss, undergird our forecast of stable or  falling inflation abroad, shown in the lower-left panel  These factors, as well as  increased risks surrounding Europe, have contributed to a notable downshift in  market expectations of policy rates (as seen in the bottom-right chart)  And we, too,  have marked down our policy-rate path for the major economies    Can I step in?  When we’ve looked at the similar charts to what you’ve   looked at for the United States, and we’ve included a broader range of recessions, we found that   the results that were shown here hold in terms of the components  So aggregate GDP, you’re   right, shows up more in the middle—this current recovery indexed to the trough looks fairly in   the middle of the range  But Larry’s point about the weakness of consumption—as well as the   unemployment rate—still holds true  The components are where you see differences  You can   tell by looking at Larry’s charts that if you index the trough, investment is actually going to look   pretty strong now, but what you’re going to see is incredible weakness in consumption as well as   on the labor market side, and of course in housing  And those results still hold regardless of   where you index   June 21–22, 2011 92 of 282               What we’ve done is that we’ve taken a series of about 150 episodes and   broken them down the way the IMF has broken them down, by various types, so we know   something about financial crises and banking crises  However, there are not a huge number of   observations of housing crises, and while it’s very difficult to say, I’m sure that for the housing   component itself, you could find a difference  Comparing banking and financial crises and   normal recessions, when you index to the trough, it’s extremely difficult to identify a difference   in the pace of recovery  You do see differences, to some extent, in how deep or how long the   recession is  But on the way up, you don’t see huge differences, in the aggregate, although you   see various differences in the components    In terms of the fiscal situation, per se, France was running about a   7 percent headline deficit with about a 53 percent primary deficit last year and is expected to   reduce that to 56 on the headline this year and 47 next year  So they are certainly above   Germany, which is the star player here, but it doesn’t look particularly disturbing  We have seen   a run-up, just like many other countries, in their government debt, which went from an average   of about 60 percent of GDP in the 2000 to 2006 period, and we anticipate will be about   June 21–22, 2011 94 of 282              86 percent of GDP—so, obviously rising, but not at a level that would disturb us  You may have   gotten different information than what we have here, but I think what is somewhat disturbing is   that France is exposed to the periphery countries, and it has a number of institutions with some   high concentration in Greek debt and other peripheral debt  You’re starting to see spillovers, not   necessarily coming from the French fiscal situation itself, but from its exposure to the   peripheries  But I wouldn’t discount the political difficulties they are all facing in terms of   bringing deficits down over time  At this point, we haven’t heard anything, but we will certainly   keep our eyes and ears open  "
