  Thank you, Mr Chairman  A reader of this  meeting’s Greenbook could be forgiven, I think, for contracting at least  a mild case of sticker shock  After all, we revised down our estimate of  growth for the current year--already half completed--by 04 percentage  point, and for next year by twice that much, to cut 1-1/4 percentage  points from the level of GDP by the end of next year  But rather than  casting this forecast as a big change from its predecessor, I would like  to begin today by making the case that this can largely be seen as a  status quo forecast         Without a doubt, there has been considerable buzz in the last few  weeks about the revisions to the national income accounts and how  dramatically those revisions have changed perceptions of  macroeconomic reality  In a way, of course, that is correct  The  revised figures suggest that firms invested much less than previously  estimated during the past three years  Accordingly, capital deepening  occurred at a slower pace, and that has important implications, of  course, for growth prospects As my colleagues Fleischman, Sichel,  and Struckmeyer outlined in their memo to you last week, we have  trimmed our estimate of potential GDP growth by four tenths this year  and six tenths next year  Obviously, a revision of this magnitude is of  enormous consequence for some issues, including assessments of the     8/21/01 5   trend rate of growth in the standard of living, the long-term outlook for  the federal budget, and the solvency of the Social Security system         But the implications of the NIPA revisions for the conduct of  monetary policy could easily be overdone  To a first approximation,  the recent history of inflation remains essentially as previously  estimated  From that, we infer to a first approximation that the  pressures on productive resources probably were about as we had  estimated based on the previous numbers  In particular, the gap  between actual and potential GDP probably was about as we had it,  albeit with lower levels of both actual and potential output         Previously, we had been attributing a goodly portion of the  outstanding inflation performance of the late 1990s to the acceleration  in structural productivity Now, with the productivity boom  downgraded a notch, it can obviously do less of the work for us in  terms of explaining why inflation has stayed so low during the last five  or six years So what explains the extraordinarily good inflation  performance of the late 1990s?  The short answer is that we don’t know  for sure, but something else must have been causing inflation to behave  so well despite the low unemployment rate  Often cited candidates  include the rise of temporary help supply firms, better job matching  facilitated by the Internet, welfare reform, and reduced pricing power  due to more intense foreign competition  Before, we were in the  slightly awkward position of having no room for any of these entirely  plausible explanations to play a role  Now, there is scope for these  possible changes in the behavior of labor and product markets to be part  of the story While we are uncertain about the precise magnitudes of  the various individual effects, we are assuming they will persist, with  the consequence being essentially equivalent to a reduction in the long- run NAIRU from 5-1/2 percent to 5-1/4 percent         Thus, when all the dust has settled, our assessment is that you are  operating in an environment that in some ways looks very similar to the  one we saw in June Inflation is about the same and the pressures on  resource utilization look similar  As a result, the stance of monetary  policy, as gauged by the gap between r and r*, also looks about the  same         That said, let me now turn up the microscope and point out some of  the adjustments that we have made to our outlook in the context of that  broadly similar framework  By far the most important of these  adjustments is a further marking down of our outlook for business  investment  As you know, the data on orders for June were  extraordinarily weak, headlined by a 13 percent decline in orders for  communications equipment, not at an annual rate  As we could find     8/21/01 6   little solace either in the Beige Book or in our own informal contacts  with members of the business community, we are now assuming that  this quarter’s decline in real spending for equipment and software will  be essentially as steep as last quarter’s  We’re also assuming that the  fourth quarter will show no great improvement either  In addition, we  have turned much more bearish on the outlook for nonresidential  structures While the commercial real estate sector seems to have  avoided repeating the excesses of the late 1980s, vacancy rates have  been rising sharply of late and we foresee several more quarters of  declining spending on nonresidential structures  This, too, seems to be  supported by the reports summarized in the Beige Book and elsewhere         In contrast, we continue to be surprised to the upside by the strength  of consumer spending  The advance estimate of retail sales for July  was noticeably stronger than we had been expecting, and with the tax  rebate arriving in most households’ mailboxes this month and next, we  still anticipate that household spending will provide important support  to activity in the months ahead         The only other notable modification to our near-term outlook is  mostly just a matter of timing  By our assessment, automakers have  been in the process of building more vehicles--especially trucks--this  quarter than we think they can reasonably expect to sell As a  consequence, we think they will need to cut production significantly in  the fourth quarter The resulting swings in production, on our  assumptions, add about 1/2 percentage point to GDP growth this  quarter and take away about 1-1/4 percentage point next quarter  We  may be off on our timing one way or the other but unless sales pick up  substantially, a sharp cutback in production from current plans  sometime in the next few months seems highly likely  And Ford’s  announcement last week--which is already built into our numbers--is  probably only the beginning         So from a larger perspective, how should you, as the principals in  this process, audit the reasonableness of our projection?  As a starting  point, I suggest that you consider three basic questions  First, do you  find our revisions to potential GDP growth plausible?  We now have  the growth of potential GDP slowing from 3-3/4 percent last year to 3  percent this year and to 2-3/4 percent next year, reflecting a slower pace  of capital deepening I should note, for those who are trying to gauge  the long-term growth potential of the economy, that on our current  outlook for business investment we would have the growth of potential  edging back up perhaps to about 3 percent after 2002         Second, do you find it plausible that we have adjusted our forecast  for actual GDP roughly in line with the revision to potential, leaving     8/21/01 7   aside some issues of lags?  Our theory in making this adjustment is that  households and firms should not be completely oblivious to the change  in the outlook Indeed, households and firms were likely on to this  even before we were In particular, we know that for the most part  households tie their spending to the trend in their income  And if the  trend in their income slows, then we should have a good deal of  confidence that their spending will slow as well, even if with a short  lag We also know that businesses gauge their need for productive  plant and equipment to the pace of their current and expected activity   And if they sense that activity is not living up to prior billing, they can  be counted on to trim their investment spending accordingly         I should hasten to say that not everyone is as glum as we are about  the near-term prospects for real activity; for example, the most recent  Blue Chip consensus is at 2-1/4 percent for growth in the second half   But in the face of a noticeably weaker foreign outlook, unremitting  gloom from the industrial sector, continued bad news from the tech  sector, and a steady drumbeat of negative earnings and layoff  announcements, I am a bit hard pressed to share their optimism         Third, do you find our cautious optimism about the outlook for  inflation plausible? To be sure, as we highlighted in the “alternative  simulations” section of the Greenbook, the substantial downward  revision to the markup in the NIPA accounts appears to take away a  cushion we thought firms had to absorb future cost pressures If firms  move to restore that cushion, the consequence could be several more  tenths of inflation as early as next year  However, the environment we  see is one of low capacity utilization, increasing slack in labor markets,  and earlier retrenchment in energy prices than we had previously been  expecting Moreover, we believe the revised data on compensation per  hour for the year 2000 may be importantly distorted by the treatment of  options granted by employers, so we have been inclined to discount  these data While margins clearly cannot be suppressed without limit,  we are inclined to believe that the plausible limit has not been reached  yet, and so we anticipate continued relatively good inflation  performance over the forecast period        Let me conclude by focusing on one of the risks to the outlook that  we highlighted in the “alternative simulations” section of the  Greenbook--namely, the risk of a major stock market correction   Contrary to my general story line that the NIPA revisions did not affect  much of interest, I don’t think that’s the case here  As you know, there  were downward revisions over the last several years to NIPA dividends  and earnings Moreover, our analysis leads us to be considerably more  guarded in our assessment of the outlook for the trends in these series  based on the downward revised growth in potential output  That        Wall Street Journal  implies that today’s level of equity prices is being carried on a shakier  foundation of fundamentals  I should add parenthetically that I think  this morning’s story in the  reinforces this view,  although it doesn’t alter the validity of the NIPA accounts because, for  all their shortcomings, the NIPA accounts happen to get this aspect of  earnings reporting correct On the whole, this leads us to conclude that  whatever our level of apprehension about the market before the release  of the NIPA data, it probably ought to be moved up a notch in light of  the new information   8/21/01 8     Let me make two comments on that  First of all, I made an oblique   reference to the issue of lags  We translate a downward shift in the trend in incomes to consumer   spending with a lagged response of a couple of quarters  We think it takes households a little   while to catch on to this change We brought down potential GDP growth by 04 percentage   point this year We think about half of that lower potential growth this year translates into a   reduction in actual GDP growth For next year we took potential down by 06 percentage point    And by that time we believe the adjustment process is far enough along so that households will   begin to recognize a softening in their income prospects, and indeed in their permanent income,   and that will be incorporated into their spending  So we feel that over that kind of time horizon   it’s realistic to build changes in the fundamental tenor of income into the growth of consumer   spending     Yes     There’s not a lot to go on  We don’t have clean, historical experiments    We have some elegant theory and some consensus parameters  We attempted to calibrate simulation   models to values that we think are sensible and that in other circumstances produce reasonable   results But history is not replete with temporary investment tax incentives of the kind that we’re   simulating here  And Congress is not notorious for following through in every respect with the   specifics of its original announcement  So one possible risk that could attenuate the effect of the   investment incentive is that, contrary to our assumption in the Greenbook, businesses may doubt that   in fact the incentive will be allowed to expire at the end of the three-year period  In that case the   provision wouldn’t spur as much investment as we had assumed will take place  That said, there is   econometric evidence that at least helps us to narrow the range of uncertainty a bit  We have a view   about the long-run elasticity of the capital stock with respect to the cost of capital  We have some   evidence on speeds of adjustment  We tried to piece together those bits of evidence using a   simulation model to get a handle on how big an effect the proposed legislation might have     I’d like to underscore two points that Dave made earlier  First, what we   have built into the Greenbook projection is not a straight read of our model simulation  We did very   substantially push back the investment response to the tax incentive precisely on the theory that   businesses might plausibly respond to the heightened climate of uncertainty over the next couple of   quarters by opting to wait They might well decide in the context of a three-year incentive--if it does   last that long--that there’s very little penalty to waiting until some of that uncertainty is resolved    Secondly, we observed from the experience with auto sales in October that at least in a different   context economic actors do respond quite vigorously and quickly to something that is seen as a   temporary sale on a large capital item, namely motor vehicles in this case It’s conceivable that   businesses may respond in a similar way       I will grant that the duration makes a big difference          Thank you, Mr Chairman  I suspect that the typical reader of  the recent business press would find the outlook described in the August Greenbook  surprisingly bright After all, the drumbeat of negative news during the last few  weeks has been nearly unrelenting, with news of corporate accounting scandals,  somber warnings about future earnings, stock prices that have been headed more  south than north, negative results on hiring and especially hours in July, sour reports  from various associations of purchasing managers around the country, a disheartening  reading on consumer sentiment, and the spectacle of the nation’s top CEOs and CFOs  having to swear that they are telling the truth in the documents they submit to the  Securities and Exchange Commission  One of the few upbeat counterpoints has been  the persistent strength of consumer spending, most strikingly for new motor vehicles  but also, according to this morning’s advance report, for other goods as well  But the  brisk pace of traffic in auto showrooms hasn’t dissuaded many observers from  focusing on the possibility of a second bout of contraction  In that context, how do  we explain a projection featuring 2½ percent growth in real GDP on average this  quarter and next, with the unemployment rate edging up only a little and private- sector payrolls starting to show some life?   Unfortunately, of course, it is all too possible that the pundits have it right  But I  want to begin by outlining a few of the reasons why, based on the information  currently in hand, we think the more likely path forward involves continued recovery,  even if at a sluggish pace by historical standards  First, by far the bulk of the earlier                    August 13, 2002 12 of 92  inventory problem now seems to have been worked off  There are still a few entries  on the “watch” list—most notably communications equipment—but for most goods,  inventory holdings are in much better alignment with sales, and if anything, even a bit  lean While the timing of the lift from inventory investment is highly uncertain, we  are reasonably confident that the lift will come and probably not too long from now   Second, monetary policy remains accommodative  Measured in real terms, the funds  rate is in the neighborhood of zero, a very low level by historical standards  If you  prefer to measure the stance of policy in terms of the deviation of r from r*, you could  take comfort in the fact that the actual real funds rate still appears to be well below  the equilibrium rate, even if by a somewhat smaller margin according to our latest  estimates  And one important lesson of the recent experience is that the policy  channels are working fine Low prevailing market rates allowed the automakers to  offer the cut-rate financing deals that attracted so many customers, and historically  low mortgage rates have helped sustain residential investment in the face of steeply  declining wealth and uncertain prospects for the labor market   On the fiscal policy side, the marginal-rate cut implemented at the beginning of  this year still should be feeding through into household spending  And we continue  to believe that businesses will be encouraged by the temporary partial-expensing  provision to boost their spending on new equipment and software  Part of the  impetus from the federal level will be offset on the state and local side, but the  government sector as a whole should be a net plus for the growth of GDP  At the  margin, the downturn in the dollar during the last few months will also be a plus,  especially in comparison with the run-up during the preceding two years   Taken together, these factors are enough to support sustained growth in GDP in  our baseline projection  We had projected that consumers would not flag in their  actual spending—even if they continue to share their apprehensions with the  University of Michigan and the Conference Board—and this morning’s retail sales  report provides reassuring evidence on that point  And in the business sector, while  we have become much gloomier about the outlook for nonresidential structures, we  still see spending on equipment and software as being on a slow but steady path to  recovery   We also updated our views about a number of important parameters on the supply  side of the economy  First, the annual revisions to the national income and product  accounts told us that the average pace of growth during the last few years was several  tenths lower than previously estimated  From this information, we inferred that the  pace of structural productivity growth probably had been slower—and likely would  remain slower—than we had previously estimated, so we revised down our estimate  of the rate of growth of potential GDP But with the slower rate of growth of  structural productivity, we were left with an incipient puzzle  The favorable inflation  performance of the last few years stood essentially as before, but now it appeared that  structural productivity growth was a less powerful explanation  To fill the gap, we  marked down our assumption for the NAIRU, from 5¼ percent to 5 percent, thereby                            August 13, 2002 13 of 92  generating enough additional labor market slack to make the inflation picture fit  together   Over the intermeeting period, the volatility in the stock market left major indexes  down substantially on net Two items in this regard are worth noting  First, if the  long-term earnings growth projections of the equity analysts are to be given any  credence—and that is a mighty big “if”—then a real possibility has emerged that  stocks are currently undervalued This points to one of the upside risks that we  highlighted in the Alternative Simulations section of the Greenbook  Second, perhaps  on cue from our Alternative Simulations section, stock prices have rebounded some  since we put the Greenbook to bed last week If we had had the foresight to  anticipate that mini-recovery, we wouldn’t have altered our projection for the  remainder of this year materially but would have shown another tenth or two of  growth next year   All in all, we see the incoming information as telling us that the economy is  moving along a growth track that is slower than previously projected but moving  forward nonetheless and with a slightly wider gap in resource utilization  In that  context, the prospects for future inflation remain extremely favorable  In the near  term, the greater margin of slack and its implication of even less inflationary pressure  are essentially offset by the reduced contribution from structural productivity growth  and by the acceleration we anticipate in import prices  Although the net effect of  these factors is essentially nil in 2003, if we had shown you a projection this time  around for 2004, as we will in the next Greenbook, you would have seen core PCE  inflation edging down another tenth or two from its already very low level   Having highlighted the upside risk from the possible undervaluation of the stock  market, let me close by underscoring the possibility of a shortfall in aggregate  demand  As you know from reading the Greenbook, one of the downside risks we  featured was a further disappointment in business spending for equipment and  software In particular, we simulated the effects for the rest of the economy of  assuming that outlays for E&S are flat for the remainder of this year and increase  only half as fast next year as in our baseline projection  According to our model, the  probability of an investment surprise of this magnitude is in the neighborhood of  10 to 15 percent In the simulation we reported in the Greenbook, the funds rate was  assumed to be held fixed in nominal terms, and in that case, the output gap was  estimated to widen by nearly 1 percentage point relative to the baseline  However, a  policymaker following an aggressive version of the Taylor rule could limit the  increase in the GDP gap to a little more than ½ percentage point by moving the funds  rate down by about ¾ percentage point by the fourth quarter of next year   A second downside possibility we examined is that households adopt the same  type of caution that seems to have characterized recent business behavior and so push  up the personal saving rate 1 percentage point higher than in our baseline  The model  suggests that the probability of such a large ongoing shift in the personal saving rate,  quarter after quarter, is very remote  But one can alternatively view this shock as a                                                              August 13, 2002 14 of 92  stand-in for the full range of shocks on the demand side of the model; and under that  interpretation, a shortfall of this magnitude has about a 10 percent probability of  occurring, according to our model  In the results that we showed in the Greenbook,  the GDP gap finishes 2003 about1½ percentage points wider than in the baseline   However, a policymaker whose behavior is described by an aggressive Taylor rule  once again can limit the damage, in this case holding the increase in the GDP gap to  about ¾ percentage point by dropping the funds rate about 1 percentage point by the  first half of next year Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation     It’s a risk We brought the workweek back from 340 to 342 hours in   our assumptions for August and September partly on the judgment that this year July 4 fell on a   Thursday so it was particularly easy for employers to grant a four-day weekend  That’s relevant               August 13, 2002 18 of 92  for those employers who are on a biweekly reporting basis because that period would be   included in the time frame of the reports that they submitted to the BLS  In addition, we saw the   weekly claims data coming down over the month So our guess was, partly on the basis of   statistical considerations and what we read as the trajectory of the labor market over the month,   that the survey results were not representative of the month as a whole       I think they concur in the judgment regarding July 4, and I don’t believe   they offered an opinion on the remainder of our logic     I have a different take on it  We took potential GDP growth down   03 this year and 04 next year, and our model simulations suggest that that should feed through   essentially one for one into the growth of aggregate demand  So the way I’d parse it out is that   I’d say about 03 of the roughly 1 percentage point revision for the second half reflects the   adjustment to our trend rate of growth of potential GDP  For next year, I’d attribute a larger            August 13, 2002 19 of 92  fraction of our revision, perhaps 04 of our total revision of 06, to the adjustment to the growth   of potential GDP In growth rate terms, the negative news from the stock market is very   important for this year as are the adverse signals that we think we’re getting about production in   the near term from the labor market report and from the negative purchasing managers’ surveys    We also gave a nod to the adverse results from consumer sentiment surveys, as modulated by   strong auto sales So the larger fraction of the revision this year is due to other indicators that we   think tell us that the gap is going to be widening     I have a couple of additional comments  First, it is incredibly difficult to   interpret some of the announcements that are coming out in the state and local area  For   example, Governor Davis as you know—excuse me, I’m not quite as emotional about the topic   as my faltering voice suggests  [Laughter]     Over the weekend or late last week, Governor Davis announced a   package of $10 billion of budget cuts My understanding, based on public sources, is that only   about $3½ billion of those cuts are to be applied in the current fiscal year; the remaining   $6 billion and change will be applied in the following year  That goes to the more general point   that while there is a lot of distress in the state and local sector—and we’ve reflected a good deal   of that in our projection—there’s quite a bit of latitude for the states to meet these so-called         December 10, 2002 26 of 87  balanced budget requirements They can do that in a number of different ways  I think what   we’ll see in coming months is recourse for things like accessing capital funds—     There’s a whole constellation of financial devices available including, as   Dave mentioned, the state financing of capital projects through bond issuance rather than on a   current basis     Yes, Governor Davis indicated that there are further announcements to   come     Actually, they started out north of CBO on the advice of the Defense   Department  I’m not sure what they factored into their thinking that led them to bring their   number down to below where the Defense Department said it was going to be  It may be   because their figure is $5 billion or so weaker than ours for the fiscal year as a whole, which   translates to $10 billion at an annual rate for the remaining two quarters     I think it’s fair to say that there is a lot of uncertainty about the likely   spendout pattern  We think we’ve begun to see some entrails of that spending in the daily   Treasury statements for April  But getting from the daily Treasury statements to the monthly   Treasury statements, which form the basis for BEA’s estimates, and getting from April to the   quarter as whole involve a lot of estimating  There is a lot of uncertainty in all of those steps       Yes     I think it’s also muted because many of the elements that are   contemplated in the $350 billion package are merely accelerations and so by their nature are   essentially temporary measures  Accordingly, they don’t cause bond markets to anticipate a   substantial worsening of the long-term deficit picture   May 6, 2003 25 of 115      Right        Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know from the August  Greenbook, we received quite a few encouraging indicators during the intermeeting  period  Let me mention just a few  Sales of light vehicles in July ran at a  172 million unit annual clip, up 1 million units from the average selling pace in the  second quarter  Chain store sales have been on a noticeable uptrend the last several  weeks  The data on orders and shipments of capital goods improved in May and  June  Moreover, the national ISM index as well as a number of the regional  purchasing managers’ reports either moved up in July or held steady at a high level   And earnings reports for the second quarter generally came in to the high side of  analysts’ expectations     By comparison, the list on the other side of the ledger is short  The two   employment reports we received during the intermeeting period both were  disappointing  At the time of the June meeting, we had expected that the change in  payroll employment would have been in positive territory in June and July; instead, it  dropped 70,000 in June and another 30,000 in July  The decline in initial claims  during the past several weeks has been reassuring but, for what it’s worth, our  preferred near-term filtering model sees the available recent labor market indicators,  including claims, as pointing to only little change—up or down—in payroll  employment over the next month or two  In line with this view, we assumed in the  current Greenbook that labor demand will just stabilize in August and September  before beginning to move up at a pretty hefty clip by the end of the year     In economic forecasting, the majority doesn’t necessarily rule, and in this case we   saw the encouraging news on the spending side as fighting the discouraging news  with respect to the labor market pretty much to a draw—leaving us still expecting a  marked pickup in the growth of real GDP, from well below the growth of potential— 31 percent—during the first half of the year to somewhat above potential in the  second half  The list of factors supporting this acceleration is familiar from our  repeated incantation of it  Fiscal policy still should add significantly to the growth of  aggregate demand over the third and fourth quarters even as the severe distress at the  state and local level offsets a part of the federal stimulus  Monetary policy remains  supportive of a pickup in growth, and structural productivity appears to be on a  relatively steep upward trajectory     The key question we had to confront in adjusting the longer-term outlook was   how to react to the run-up in interest rates that has taken place, as Dino discussed,  since the last meeting  There were two dimensions to this question  First, for  purposes of putting together the forecast, should we downweight some of the increase  in rates as merely reflecting an increase in inflation expectations, and to that extent  not an increase in real rates?  If one were to judge from the relative behavior of  nominal and indexed Treasury securities, a goodly portion of the run-up in nominal   August 12, 2003 13 of 110    rates—maybe as much as half—could have reflected an increase in inflation  expectations, at least in the eyes of bond investors  On the other hand, we had to  wonder why, just as inflation compensation in the Treasury market seemed to be  taking off, near-term inflation expectations as reported in the Michigan survey of  consumers were dropping like a rock and longer-term expectations were holding  steady  We certainly weren’t hearing any stories from the business sector about the  rebirth of pricing power  In the end, we treated the whole of the increase in nominal  rates as reflecting an increase in real rates  While inflation expectations might have  gone up on Wall Street, the same does not seem to have been true on Main Street,  where the spending and investment decisions are made  Moreover, it is worth noting  that at least in some precincts of Main Street, particularly those having to do with  housing, even the purely inflation-related component of nominal interest rates seems  to be relevant for the determination of demand     A second important question related to the change in the interest rate environment   was whether we should downweight the negative implications of the run-up in rates  on a second theory—namely, that it might have reflected an improvement in business  sentiment, and thus should be interpreted as a symptom of faster growth rather than a  cause of slower growth  While business sentiment might well have improved, we  nonetheless concluded that we needed to apply our standard multipliers to the whole  of the increase in rates, for two main reasons  First, in a line of thought much like the  one we applied to the issue of the real-versus-nominal split, while sentiment might  have improved on Wall Street, it was less apparent that it had done so on Main Street   Hiring through early July seemed to be in the doldrums, and as I mentioned earlier,  the subsequent drop in claims has encouraged us to think only that the decline in  payrolls has come to a halt  While investment demand has been improving, we have  no evidence of a dramatic breakout  Moreover, the indications available to us were  that outside forecasters were not marking up their projections, and this impression  was corroborated in yesterday’s Blue Chip release, which reported essentially no  change in the consensus growth projection for this year and next  Second, and  perhaps more important, we felt that we had to maintain some fidelity to our previous  forecasting methodology  For better or for worse, we had taken on board the full  implications of rates as they stood at the time of the June Greenbook, not applying  any discount for the possibility that bond investors might have been having their own  bout of irrational exuberance  Given that earlier decision, it would have been  logically inconsistent in the current forecast round for us only to have taken on board  a portion of the rebound in rates  Altogether, the change in financial-market  assumptions over the intermeeting period—the increase in interest rates, the stronger  dollar, and the lower level of stock prices—were a small negative for our projection  of GDP growth over the second half of this year and sliced a little more than ½  percentage point from our projection of growth next year  In this regard, two other  quick points are worth noting First, for all our angst in the current forecast round  over the proper interpretation of the run-up in rates, our latest forecast of real GDP  growth—both for the second half of this year and for next year—is virtually  unchanged from our forecast two rounds ago, before the bond market dip and rebound  had gotten under way  Second, I should caution that, from the perspective of our   August 12, 2003 14 of 110    forecast, the bond market adjustment is not over  As you know, market participants  currently seem to expect that the funds rate will be on a substantially steeper  trajectory over the next few years than we have assumed in the Greenbook, and long  rates have been set accordingly  If events unfold as we have projected, financial  markets will have some learning to do  In particular, we have assumed that over the  course of next year, as inflation continues to edge down even in the context of a  vigorous economic expansion, the market’s funds rate expectations will converge  substantially toward ours  As a result, bond rates will tail off and finish next year  about 60 basis points lower than would otherwise have been the case  I mention this  not to claim any great clarity in our foresight but rather to underscore that bond  market misperceptions continue to play a role even in the current projection     Before leaving the real side of the projection, I should mention one piece of news   that came in after the close of the Greenbook but would not have greatly affected our  thinking had we known about it—namely the historical revision to the BLS data on  productivity and costs  As you know from the Greenbook supplement, productivity  growth over the last three years was marked up considerably, based on new data  showing a sharper drop in hours worked than previously estimated  We are inclined  to see those revised data for previous years as having little or no implication for a  number of the variables of greatest concern to you  In particular, they have no  implication for the growth of potential output because any adjustment we might make  to the trend growth of output per hour would be offset by an equal-sized adjustment  to the trend growth of hours  Second, they have no implication for inflationary  pressures because any revision to the trend in output per hour would be offset by an  equal-sized revision to the trend in compensation per hour, leaving unit labor costs  unaffected  All that said, the growth of productivity in the second quarter was  nothing short of stunning, and we certainly will have to contemplate once again  whether our assumption for the growth of potential GDP—already apparently far  above the market consensus—needs to be marked up further     Inflation continues to look very subdued  We were a little surprised by the extent   of the increase in core PCE prices in the second quarter, but this turned out to reflect  an unexpected bulge in so-called non-market-based prices  This makes us a little  uneasy because we believe that measurement issues in this component of the index  are especially acute  The market-based component of the core PCE price index came  in right on our projection as of the last Greenbook  In the second half of this year, we  expect core PCE price inflation to run a little higher than in the first half, reflecting  the removal of some factors that we think held inflation down temporarily earlier this  year  Owners’ equivalent rent was held down relative to tenants’ rent by an  adjustment for utilities costs, and we expect utilities costs to be a neutral factor during  the second half of the year  Motor vehicle incentives rose sharply during the first half  of the year, and we are assuming that they will taper off as we move to the new model  year  States and localities are in the process of implementing some hefty increases in  tuition, other fees, and excise taxes as part of their drive to restore their fiscal health,  and we’ve factored these changes into our thinking for the second half as well  That  said, we see the underlying trend in inflation as still pointing downward  With a   August 12, 2003 15 of 110    noticeable margin of slack in resource utilization persisting through the whole of next  year, we continue to project that core PCE price inflation will finish next year below  1 percent  Karen Johnson will continue our presentation       We would interpret that as a further tightening of financial market   conditions  It would certainly come as a surprise to us if that were to occur  Let me step back a   August 12, 2003 18 of 110    bit and put as clearly as I can the contour of rates we see for next year  We have rates easing   back, as you noted, despite the fact that ordinarily—absent any bond market level adjustment—   we’d have a gradual trending up in the ten-year rate  The reason that would occur is that the ten-  year rate is an average of expected future short rates and the bond market would be folding in   higher rates at the end of the ten-year period  So, holding everything else constant, the ten-year   rate would be trending up  Despite that, our projection is that, as financial market participants   gradually adopt our view of the outlook for real activity and the inflation process, that rate will   come down a little  If the bond market were to go in the other direction, as I said, that would   constitute a tightening in financial market conditions  If the increase were on the order of   magnitude that you suggested, with the ten-year rate moving up to 5 percent, I don’t think that   would in and of itself constitute a dramatic restraint on aggregate demand  It might mean a   couple of tenths or something like that over the subsequent four quarters  But that would not be   a helpful development in terms of producing our expected outcome for aggregate demand     Indeed  I was interpreting President Moskow’s question as involving a   sort of disembodied upward drift in interest rates  If it were to emanate from a different view   about productivity growth, then the implications might be different  But even in that case, it   might still signal a wider gap than we had been projecting between actual and potential GDP     The intuition is that, as best as we can figure out, a large amount of   restraint on the part of employers is an important factor at the moment  We think that shows up   in the sluggish payroll employment gains of recent quarters; and it is mirrored by the fact that we   have actual productivity now well above structural productivity  In our projection for next year,   employers are gaining confidence in the durability of the expansion  Our view is that, as their   confidence rises, they will bring their employment levels back into a more normal alignment   with their output, which would generate the kinds of employment increases that you have noted    That, in turn, would bring productivity very gradually back toward trend, though we don’t have   the gap between actual and structural productivity closing completely; that gap persists   throughout 2004 in our projection       As to why there’s a gap between our projection and outside forecasts, I   think part of the explanation is that we have a substantially more optimistic view about the rate   August 12, 2003 20 of 110    of growth of the economy’s productive capacity  If one compares our forecast with the Blue   Chip forecasts, implicitly we have potential growing more rapidly than they do  But that’s not   the whole story  We have the unemployment rate coming down as well  We generate less   inflation pressure out of that in part precisely because we are more optimistic about productivity   growth  And that greater optimism about productivity growth helps alleviate any buildup of   inflation pressures in our view  I would note, too, that the data over the last few months have   come in to the low side of our projection        So we’ve seen nothing of late to cause us to call into question either our   assumptions about the rate of growth of structural productivity or potential GDP or the inflation   outlook  As I mentioned in my briefing, the only surprise we’ve had lately was in the somewhat   irritating so-called non-market-based component of the core PCE price index  But the market-  based component has been quite consistent with our expectations     That’s not an element of our projection  It would be a factor putting   downward pressure on nominal bond rates  That’s in part the mechanism by which we see the   market and the outside world learning about or coming into line with, if you will, our view of the   world  On our forecast, they should see a combination of strong growth in aggregate demand   coupled with much lower rates of inflation than they expected  As that happens, the market   should bring interest rates down, as I was discussing with President Moskow        We certainly have assigned a big role to the very sizable increases in   cash flow that are occurring  We have disposable income growing over the second half of this   year at nearly a 5 percent rate of increase  Importantly, that reflects the $35 billion in additional   cash flow—not at an annual rate—that’s accruing to households in the third quarter from the   combination of lower withholding, the advance refund of the child credit, and reduced estimated   tax payments  So the fuel price increases are a restraint, but they are overwhelmed by the   stimulus that we think the federal government is delivering       It is an important driver of the contour of our forecast  But I’d come   back exactly to your statement that firms will ramp up investment only when they feel they need   August 12, 2003 22 of 110    it  It’s that kind of logic that has led us to be rather restrained in our assessment of the prospects   for the second half of this year  A lot of the anecdotal information that we have suggests that   firms at the moment are delivering those nice surprises to earnings importantly through cost-  cutting measures and not through capacity expansion     By next year, with a very strong acceleration in business output, we   think firms are going to be feeling the need to engage in a substantial expansion in their E&S   spending  The importance of that factor is illustrated in one of the alternative simulations in the   Greenbook  That simulation indicates that if a surge in investment does not come through—we   did the experiment with respect not only to E&S spending but expenditures on structures and   inventories as well—the pickup in overall activity next year will be substantially attenuated      Thank you, Mr Chairman  A lot has changed since the June  Greenbook forecast was put to bed  Unfortunately, a lot has changed since the  August Greenbook was put to bed, too  [Laughter]  In particular, in the June  Greenbook, we forecasted that payroll employment gains would average about  300,000 per month in the second and third quarters of this year against a backdrop of  GDP growth averaging about 5 percent at an annual rate  By the end of this year, we  expected that the GDP gap would have narrowed to just ½ percent  By the time we  published the August Greenbook last week, we had tempered our growth assessment  substantially and had marked up our expectation for the GDP gap at the end of this  year to a full 1 percent  But we were still interpreting the June employment report  essentially as a one-time hiccup and were looking for employment gains going  forward only slightly smaller than we had projected in the June Greenbook  Then  came last Friday’s employment report, with its news of only a 32,000 advance in  private nonfarm payrolls, a downward revision to June employment of 51,000, and  only a 01 hour increase in the average workweek  Our misery over coming up short  nearly 300,000 jobs was only slightly alleviated by having so much company      So, as I said, a lot has changed  On the other hand, I should also underscore that a   lot has stayed the same  Even in the wake of Friday’s report, we still see overall  macroeconomic conditions as likely to support a return to above-trend growth—in  other words, growth that is sufficiently rapid to narrow the gap in resource utilization  over the next six quarters, even if only slowly and incompletely  While we have  taken quite a bit out of our forecasts for payroll employment increases in August and  September, we still have those increases tracking into the neighborhood of 300,000 in  the fourth quarter of this year  And in response to the employment report, we  trimmed our forecast for third-quarter GDP growth only 06 percentage point, from  39 percent in the Greenbook to 33 percent currently, on the theory that the deficit in  hours relative to our expectation informed us mainly about productivity in the current  quarter rather than output       In this connection, I should note there was one bright spot in Friday’s report,   namely that employment in the manufacturing sector looked, if anything, a little  better than we had expected  This is particularly encouraging in light of the fact that  manufacturing over the decades has been a fairly sensitive and reliable bellwether of  cyclical conditions  If a pronounced cyclical softening truly were under way, we  would have expected to see it in manufacturing employment, but it simply was not  evident in the numbers for July      Our outlook for inflation also falls in the category of “not much changed since the   June Greenbook”  The most recent CPI report was quite reassuring that the type of  moderation we were looking for seems to be in train  Indeed, the news was good  enough to cause us to shave our projection for core CPI inflation by a tenth both this  year and next  Because the BEA penciled in a faster pace of inflation in the so-called  non-market-based prices, we did not revise down our forecast for core PCE inflation  in line with the core CPI  Even so, however, we have core PCE inflation slowing  from 1¾ percent this year to 1½ percent next year, reflecting smaller contributions   August 10, 2004 10 of 103          from import, energy, and other commodity prices and now a slightly greater amount  of restraint from slack in resource utilization      But while a lot is still the same, enough has changed to make it more than fair to   ask, What on earth is going on?  Lest I spark any hope on your part that I’m about to  produce a fully satisfying explanation, let me assure you to the contrary  In point of  fact, we do not claim to suddenly understand everything that has happened in the last  few months; if we were that smart now, we probably would have been a little smarter  last week; and if we had been that smart last week, we certainly wouldn’t have hid it  so well from the Committee  [Laughter]  Unfortunately, the large-scale econometric  model that we often consult for insight on such issues shares our incomplete  understanding of the current situation  Indeed, that model, left to its own devices,  would have wanted to see an additional 2 percentage points of real GDP growth in the  second quarter, with much of it in PCE  Evidently, in order to provide a full  accounting of the recent weakness in aggregate demand, we will have to appeal to  some factor not captured by our conventional models  In light of the weakness of  consumer spending, factors bearing on the household sector will have special  standing  Let me list some of the possibilities     Hypothesis #1  Maybe it’s just noise  This hypothesis actually comes in two   variants  The first variant takes the view that the data may simply be sending the  wrong signal, not truly representative of macroeconomic reality  I certainly cannot  rule out this variant, and indeed, we had discounted the first disappointing report on  payroll employment, given the relatively encouraging recent readings on initial  claims for unemployment insurance and improving household perceptions of labor  market conditions  On the other hand, this variant seems less plausible in light of a  second consecutive disappointing labor market report as well as the June readings on  retail sales, motor vehicle sales, and industrial production, all suggesting that  something real happened toward the end of the second quarter  A second variant of  the noise hypothesis accepts the accuracy of the incoming data but questions the  persistence of the softness  Maybe we are just on a temporary detour away from  above-trend growth and shrinking margins of resource slack  We put some stock in  this variant as well, in part because we have been impressed by a number of the other  relatively encouraging indicators of demand in the third quarter, including the  rebound in motor vehicle sales, the strength in orders and shipments of capital goods,  and the relatively upbeat anecdotal information that we continue to receive from the  ISM and other business surveys, from the Beige Book, and from our own business  contacts  In addition, we continue to view the fundamental determinants of growth,  especially the stance of monetary policy—and, in the near term, the stance of fiscal  policy—as consistent with above-trend growth  On the other hand, we are operating  in an environment of considerable uncertainty, and a key possibility that we must  entertain is that something more fundamental is going on than just a temporary blip— something we don’t understand and that may persist     Hypothesis #2  Maybe it’s energy prices  Since June, the spot price of West   Texas intermediate has increased about $6 per barrel  Moreover, prices on long-dated   August 10, 2004 11 of 103          futures have undergone a stunning nearly vertical takeoff in the last few weeks   Certainly the hypothesis that higher energy prices are having a much more  pronounced restraining effect on activity than we had anticipated has to figure  prominently on our list of possibilities  Maybe the second surge in gasoline prices in  May and June caused households to reassess the outlook for energy prices and  suddenly to take on board a much larger hit to their purchasing power      To be sure, the timing of the most recent energy price spike is incriminating  But   how much of the recent shortfall in aggregate activity can we really lay at its  doorstep?  In a memo that we delivered to the Committee just before the June  meeting, we estimated that, all else being equal, the run-up in oil prices between  December and June might lop ½ percentage point off the growth of GDP this year  and a further tenth off growth next year  At that time, the spot price had risen about  $10 per barrel from its late-December level  Since June the spot price has increased  another $6 or so, suggesting that the total oil-related deduction from the growth of  GDP this year might amount to about ¾ percentage point—or roughly two-thirds of  the total downward revision to our GDP projection over that time     But while the price of oil is crucial for understanding the revision since the   December Greenbook to our projection for GDP growth this year, can it account for  the steep downward revision to GDP growth since the June Greenbook?  Here the  answer is murkier  By June, roughly two-thirds of the increase in oil prices had  already occurred and so should have been taken on board in the forecast we delivered  to the FOMC just before your two-day meeting  That suggests that the increase in oil  prices since then might account for a downward revision to our estimate of growth  this year of only about ¼ percentage point—only a fraction of the nearly 1 percentage  point revision that we have put through since the June Greenbook  On the other hand,  a number of factors counsel against drawing sharp conclusions  For one, our ability  to pinpoint the timing of an adjustment to higher oil prices probably is very limited   For another, we may not have sufficiently adjusted the June Greenbook projection to  the oil prices then already in view  And for a third, there is little doubt that our  formal econometric models omit potential channels of influence from oil to real  activity, and whether we have adequately compensated for those omissions in our  judgmental projection is not clear      All that said, the coincidence between the spike in oil prices and the air pocket in   spending seems too striking to write off to mere chance  So at this point, we are  thinking that energy prices almost surely are part of the explanation; we’re just not  sure how big a part      Hypothesis #3  Faltering fiscal stimulus  In the baseline projection, we have   been assuming that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are still supporting the growth of  consumer spending this year but by a gradually diminishing amount  On our  assumptions, these tax cuts boosted the growth of real PCE ¾ percentage point in the  first half of this year but will lift the growth of PCE in the second half by less than  ½ percentage point and will be essentially neutral for PCE growth in 2005  But here,   August 10, 2004 12 of 103          too, we have only limited ability to pinpoint the timing of adjustment, and this  hypothesis suggests the possibility that we should have attributed a larger fraction of  the strength in consumer spending earlier this year to short-lived tax-induced stimulus  and a smaller fraction to an underlying fundamentals-based thrust      In sum, we think these hypotheses contain some of the seeds of an explanation    Whether they constitute a full or only a partial explanation, whether we need to add to  our list, or whether we need to subtract from it, all remain to be seen  But as usual,  we will have to remain alert in coming months for clues that may shed further light on  the nature of the recent step-down in the growth of real activity  Karen will now  continue our presentation        Mr Chairman, another uncertainty that I’d highlight with respect to the   timing of how this plays out is that the sources of the increase in the price of oil may have a   different profile recently than was the case over the first half of the year  My sense qualitatively is   that strong world demand was perhaps more a front-loaded story in the first part of the year and that   supply concerns maybe have emerged as an issue later     May I just finish the thought?  The consequences for US activity could be   quite different, depending on the mix of supply and demand factors  If that mix changed over the   first and second halves of the year, it could add to the uncertainty about the timing that you were   highlighting in your comment, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman A corollary to Murphy’s law is  that the biggest forecast errors on an employment report always occur when the  report comes between Greenbook publication day and the FOMC meeting   [Laughter] Last year, in an event that undoubtedly is seared more into my  memory than yours, the corollary held true  This year, in the biggest surprise of  all, there was no surprise, and I am in the unexpected position of being able to  report that the August Greenbook forecast has survived the incoming data a  grand total of five days and counting In that regard, I should note that this  morning’s release on productivity and costs came in very much in line with our  expectations   A colleague correctly observed that there are a lot of moving pieces in this   forecast, so I thought you might find it helpful for me to review what some of   those pieces are    The first has to do with the implications of the annual revision to the   national income and product account [NIPA] data  As you know, the BEA   [Bureau of Economic Analysis] took down its estimate of the level of real GDP   in the fourth quarter of 2004 by 09 percent  In response, we moved down our   estimate of potential GDP by an identical amount  Thus, all else equal, we   would have shown the same GDP gap at the end of 2004 in this Greenbook as   we did in the June Greenbook                                   August 9, 2005 14 of 110  But not quite all else was equal In work unrelated to the NIPA revisions,  we refined our model of the labor force participation rate so that we could  extend our estimate of the trend in that variable backward in time on a  methodologically consistent basis  As it happened, those refinements to the  model steepened the downward tilt in the trend by enough to subtract a couple  of additional tenths from the level of potential GDP by the end of last year,  leaving the GDP gap at 09 percent rather than the 11 percent that we had  shown in the June Greenbook   The second moving piece has to do with the growth of potential GDP going  forward One implication of the revision to the national income accounts is that  the capital stock is likely to grow more slowly over the forecast period than we  had earlier believed Accordingly, capital deepening should make a smaller  contribution to the growth of potential GDP; indeed, we have cut that  contribution by a quarter of a percentage point this year and next  So on the  supply side, the basic summary is this a slightly smaller gap as of the end of  2004, and somewhat slower growth of potential GDP going forward   The third moving piece has to do with the demand side  We read the data  that were released during the intermeeting period as suggesting that the  economy has somewhat more forward momentum in the near term than we had  anticipated in the June Greenbook  You might not know it from top-line real  GDP growth in the second quarter, which was only about a quarter of a  percentage point stronger than we had anticipated, but the composition of  growth pointed to greater strength In particular, inventory investment stepped  down much more sharply in the second quarter than we had expected  As best  we can tell, most firms outside the motor vehicle industry are satisfied with their  current inventory positions, and so will see no need to pare the pace of  inventory investment to anywhere near the same degree as they did during the  first half of the year If they manage to maintain their inventory investment at  the second-quarter pace—as is anticipated in our forecast—they will, at one and  the same time, keep the inventory-sales ratio moving down in line with its long- term trend and add more than a percentage point to the acceleration of real GDP  between the second and third quarters   The underlying pace of final sales also looks a little stronger to us now than  at the time of the June Greenbook, but not by much  A good deal of the second- quarter surprise was in net exports, and we do not expect that unanticipated  strength to be carried forward As for domestic final demand, the second- quarter surprise was very modest  To be sure, the recent pace of motor vehicle  sales is eye-popping, but the bulk of that demand is being met out of  inventories And, in any event, we have assumed that the piper will have to be  paid as far as those sales are concerned  Despite the extension of the employee  discount programs, we have sales dropping back in August and September from  the 20 million rate reached in July—on the theory that many consumers                                  August 9, 2005 15 of 110  probably believed the automakers the first time around when they said the  discount offers would expire—and we have the payback continuing into the  fourth quarter Aside from net exports and motor vehicle sales, our outlook for  private domestic final demand is hardly revised, on net, over the last three  quarters of this year   A fourth moving piece has to do with inflation  The information we  received during the intermeeting period presented a mixed picture relative to our  expectation in the June Greenbook On the one hand, the most recent readings  on core market-based PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation  have been encouraging, and they have caused us to mark down our estimate of  inflation in this category ½ percentage point in the second quarter and nearly  that much in the third quarter  On the other hand, we have a good deal more  energy price inflation in this projection, which contributes directly and in full  force to the overall PCE inflation rate, and seeps through as well—to the tune of  01 percentage point—into core inflation next year  And we also have less  restraint in this projection from any gaps in resource utilization  On balance,  though, we see these factors as fighting each other to a draw, leaving our  projection for core market-based inflation unrevised from the last Greenbook   However, that was not the end of the inflation story  A consequence of the  annual revision was that nonmarket prices now are on a steeper upward  trajectory than before In our projection, we have assumed that inflation in this  component will average roughly 3 percent going forward, rather than 2 percent  as we had assumed in the June Greenbook  Because this component has a  weight of 20 percent in the core PCE price index, the increment of 1 percentage  point to the rate of growth of this component in our projection adds  02 percentage point to our projection for core PCE inflation   The last moving piece has to do with monetary policy  Against the  backdrop of somewhat slower growth of aggregate supply, greater near-term  thrust in aggregate demand, and a somewhat higher rate of inflation in core PCE  prices, we shifted up the assumed trajectory for the funds rate 50 basis points  essentially throughout the forecast period  On our current assumptions, we have  the funds rate leveling out at 4¼ percent in the middle of next year  Evidently,  private-market participants share at least some of the same reactions to the  incoming data, as they have marked up funds rate futures prices by almost  exactly the same amount   The adjustment to the policy assumption was important for presenting you  with a forecast broadly consistent with your policy objectives Had we left the  funds rate assumption unchanged at its June trajectory, output would have been  above its potential in 2006 and 2007, and core inflation would have been  running at 22 percent in those two years, and edging up rather than down                               August 9, 2005 16 of 110  One of the many questions confronting you is how you should react to this  change in the inflation outlook Are inflation pressures unchanged, on net, from  last time, as indicated by our outlook for the core market-based component?  Or  are they more intense than before, as indicated by our outlook for the official  core PCE price index including the nonmarket component, and the overall PCE  index?  It seems to me that the answers to these questions depend on what you  are trying to control, and the time frame over which you seek to impose that  control   If you see yourselves as controlling the overall PCE price index, and you  aim to bring that measure back into line with your policy objective within a  small number of years, then you would probably regard inflation pressures as  having worsened since the June Greenbook, mostly because of the greater direct  contribution of energy prices to top-line inflation, but also because of the faster  pace of increase of nonmarket prices     At the other extreme, if you see yourselves as controlling the core market- based index, then you would probably judge no material change to have taken  place in inflation pressures since the June Greenbook, based on the simple  observation that our outlook for this measure of inflation has not been revised   Perhaps the toughest case is the intermediate one, in which you see  yourselves as controlling core PCE inflation, including its nonmarket  component  In this case, if you regard the nonmarket component as bearing no  relationship to reality, then you might insulate your policy from the change in  BEA methodology by marking up your target inflation rate by 02 percentage  point—equivalent, in effect, to controlling the market-based component  On the  other hand, if you think the nonmarket price index might convey some useful  information—perhaps not from quarter to quarter or even from year to year, but  at least over the intermediate term—then you would probably be inclined to  adopt a tighter monetary policy in response to the change in measurement  methodology  This is the assumption implicit in the Greenbook   One last point on which I should be clear On our estimates, the monetary  policy assumption we adopted for purposes of this Greenbook is sufficiently  restrictive to keep actual and potential output in approximate balance and to put  core PCE inflation, even including the upward-revised nonmarket component,  on a slightly downward-sloping trajectory Indeed, as best we can tell, 4¼  percent on the funds rate is slightly more than enough, in the long run, to keep  inflation heading downward, and after a few years at that level, the funds rate  could be brought back down to 4 percent  This is not a monetary policy that  acquiesces, in the long term, to inflation continuing to run at 2 percent, but  rather aims to nudge it down, little by little, into the neighborhood of 1½  percent In this respect, the monetary policy in the current Greenbook is very  similar to the one in the June Greenbook  In both cases, policy nudged the                                            August 9, 2005 17 of 110  inflation rate down to 1½ percent; but also in both cases, many years were  required before that lower level was attained     Karen Johnson will continue our presentation      It’s about 20 percent     It is a very big number  These nonmarket elements are, I think, by   definition not included in the CPI     Well, owners’ equivalent rent for this purpose is defined as a market   component even though it, too, was imputed by the BEA  In general, our clear preference is for   the weighting scheme embodied in the PCE price index as opposed to the consumer price index    We think that gives a more realistic portrayal of the market basket     They are  For better or for worse, the fact is that they mostly have the   character of correcting something that involved either an error or a miscommunication  In one   case, it was clearly just a coding error in the computer code for medical services  In the other   case—which the BEA doesn’t quite portray as an error—it was an errant trend apparently   introduced by some miscommunication between a supervisor and an employee   So now that has been brought into line A certain price for noncommercial banks, I think,   had been dropping at 10 percent per year and now it is rising slightly  So that alone contributes   about ¼ percentage point to the upward revision in the core measure for 2004  So these are very   big, very quantitatively important revisions       I’m absolutely certain that their hope is that any revisions will be for   reasons other than error detection  They will bring on board new source data and new                                  August 9, 2005 21 of 110  information of all sorts  We’re not expecting anything again that would involve revisions of this   magnitude     I don’t think we are seeing any slippage or deterioration in price   pressures Maybe the most direct piece of evidence on that is just that the last couple of readings   on the CPI have come in to the good side of our expectation  I think that’s the best summary   statistic I can cite From the orders contacts that we have in the business community, for   example, I don’t think we’re noticing a marked intensification of price pressures either   It is true that in the national income accounts the markup of price over unit labor cost was   revised down just a bit, but we don’t lean on that very heavily in our inflation analysis  So, I’d   say the fact that the market-based inflation news has been to the good side of our expectation is   probably the best summary statistic that I can give you     I can’t think of any reason off the top of my head for the confidence   band to have changed We certainly perceived no asymmetry in the risks  We’ve gone to   enormous effort this time, as always, to present to you a forecast with balanced risks  I don’t see   any reason why the width of our confidence band should have narrowed or widened  I suppose   I’m going to fall into a common conceptual error here, but I guess I would say that the   uncertainty around the oil price projection might be even greater now than average  But I hear                                  August 9, 2005 23 of 110  echoes in my brain saying, “You know, now is a particularly uncertain time,” and I never hear   anybody ever saying, “Now is a particularly certain time”  [Laughter] Nevertheless, if I were   going to point to something that would widen the confidence intervals, it may be the oil situation,   but I don’t find that a very compelling piece of evidence     No, it doesn’t because in our inflation models, the output gap enters   linearly So it has the same effect at the margin, whether it’s 07, as it was at the end of the   projection last time around, or 01 as it is this time  We are very uncertain about what the actual   magnitude of that output gap is, but the fact that our point estimate is at 01 percent rather than   07 percent doesn’t materially change our uncertainty about the inflation outlook  It would if we   perceived some kind of a threshold effect—if, when output moved above potential, we saw that   as igniting inflation pressures in a nonlinear way  But we’ve looked over the years and haven’t   found any compelling evidence of a nonlinear effect of that kind     Well, I think the best metaphor for the way we take this measure of the   output gap into account is that we view it as a barometer  It’s an indicator of pressure  At any   given moment in the economy there are going to be sectors and regions that have more pressure   than others So if the output gap is well constructed, what it should be showing is that as actual   output gets into the neighborhood of and perhaps even exceeds potential, in general average   pressures will be rising So the average upward impetus on inflation will be increasing, but—                                               August 9, 2005 24 of 110    There used to be a view—I’m thinking back to the Brookings 1960s   view—of an L-shaped supply curve     I’ll give you J  [Laughter] You know, our ability to detect these kinds   of things in the aggregate data is not very good, especially against—     Just to be clear, we don’t see potential as a sort of physical maximum     It’s a measure of the sustainable rate of output which can be maintained   with all other factors either contributing to inflation or deducting from inflation so that   productive capacity isn’t itself lending any impetus up or down to inflation  That’s not to say   that output can’t transitorily go above potential  It’s not to suggest that producers have met their   physical capacity—their limit on production     That’s a very deep question, and I think the answer—     If we could engage in a little Orwellian history, I think what we would   prefer to do is to go back and revise our old estimate of the bias in inflation  We might maintain   our estimate  Or we might say, “Oh, there was something in the data that I didn’t understand   before so if I thought the upward bias was 09 percent, maybe I should have thought it was only   07 percent”     Having made this correction, if you thought the bias was X before, not   knowing about the mistakes in the—     Yes, you should still think it’s X     While I agree with every aspect of what you said, where one is left at the   end of the day is with a difficult question as to how to judge truth  In the case of gasoline, we   can go out and conduct an independent sample of the price of gasoline at filling stations around   the country, and we can assess whether the measurement methodology leads to a bias in the CPI   relative to what individuals are actually experiencing in their day-to-day purchases  But the very   essence of these components we’re talking about is that it’s vastly more difficult, maybe even   impossible, to do any kind of benchmark study to know whether we have the measurement right                           August 9, 2005 28 of 110  I’m very confident that in the revised version of the national income accounts the measurement   is better But whether it’s right or not now is impossible to say     That’s exactly correct Yes     I can point to two main factors  One is simply the aging of the   population The baby boom cohorts are moving into an age of lower participation rates     No     People my age and older are moving into lower participation rate   categories That alone, on our estimates, has been taking about a tenth of a percentage point off                       August 9, 2005 29 of 110  the trend participation rate per year since 2002 So that’s the predominant factor  The other   factor that we think we see is a leveling off in the participation rate of women  Whereas earlier   in the postwar period the participation rate of women had been rising strongly, we believe that   has ended So those two factors are the major driving forces     Well, we think that participation rate was above the trend  Let me set   the facts first The actual participation rate was about trendless from 1990 through 2000  We   have the trend in our new model running at about 666 or so through that period, including   through the late 1990s We have the participation rates in the years from 1996 through 2000   running above trend     Correct—at its peak Then, as the economy softened and came into the   recession in 2001, the participation rate first came back to its trend  Subsequently, through the   period from 2002 through 2004, it softened and went below trend  In our projection, going   forward we anticipate the actual participation rate to hold about flat; and the participation rate   gap in our projection is closed because we have the trend coming down to meet the actual     So, it’s true that this decline in the trend is an important feature of our   outlook for the labor market     As with all econometric estimates, we do have a range of uncertainty    On our estimates, the trend participation rate now is 663 percent, which is just a couple of tenths   above its current level Our reading of the article that was published in your Bank’s Review is   that Katharine Bradbury’s estimates run from 668 at the low end and up to 68  By the way, for   reference you could look at page 3 in Part 2 of the Greenbook, if you have a copy of that     Our confidence interval, if we were to state it, perhaps would run up to   67 If we were really stretching, maybe we could see a trend participation rate in the   neighborhood of 67 I, frankly, find that a little hard to believe, given the strength of the   demographic forces that we think we see pushing down the trend participation rate by about 01   percent per year Our point estimate, as I say, is 663  Our labor economists say, on their   confidence intervals, it may be somewhere in the mid-66 area  We’d all agree that there are                      August 9, 2005 31 of 110  uncertainties about the methodology  So, if we stepped outside the formal econometrics, we   might think we could see a number as high as 67 or something like that       But that 67 would really be pushing it  That would be taking into   account that there probably are considerations outside of the model and that models never quite   work out as well as econometricians or empirical investigators hope  But at the end of the day   we believe that the case is fairly strong for some downward tilt in the trend participation rate     Yes Our price projection has moved up  The best measure of that may   be what has happened to the core PCE price index  Let’s see, now that I’m looking at the   numbers I’m about to eat my words  In 2002, on the revised figures, core PCE inflation was at   22 percent and we now have it at 20  So if one takes as the trend last year and the first half of   this year, I guess I’m going to have to reverse myself and say that the core PCE price index has   been about flat  It has been running in the neighborhood of 2 percent or a little above  It has   been higher than we thought because of the oil price     But not getting higher, yes                    August 9, 2005 32 of 110    The Greenbook baseline does
