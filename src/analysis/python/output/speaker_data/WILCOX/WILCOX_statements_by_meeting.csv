6766,2001-04-11,"  Since the March Greenbook, the incoming news about real   activity has been a little softer than we had been expecting  New orders and shipments   for February came in substantially weaker than anticipated and there were downward   revisions to those series for January  Moreover, the general tenor of the employment   report was a bit more negative for the near-term outlook than we had assumed    That said, as the Chairman noted, consumer spending--especially for motor   vehicles and for housing--has held up reasonably well and the indexes of consumer   sentiment seemed to have stabilized in March  Incidentally, we understand that the   Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan will release its preliminary results   for April tomorrow rather than Friday as previously scheduled   Putting all this together, we would trim about 1/4 percentage point off our   estimate of growth for the first quarter, putting it at 1/2 percent at an annual rate as   compared to the 3/4 percent forecast in the March Greenbook  And we’ve nudged down   our assumption for the second quarter by a similar amount, based partly on the suggestion   from the employment report that the economy entered the second quarter on a somewhat   softer note than we had been assuming and partly on the weaker orders data  That would   put our estimate for second-quarter growth at 1 percent rather than the 13 percent rate in     4/11/01 7   the March Greenbook  Beyond the current quarter, we still expect activity to pick up   over the course of the second half of this year and throughout next year    I would say that there has not been sufficient action on fiscal   policy yet to move us off our previous Greenbook assumptions  "
6839,2001-06-26,"  As Dave noted, the tax cut has been a key influence on our  thinking about the near-term projection  Almost all of the rebate checks should be  mailed out over a ten-week period beginning the week of July 23rd As shown in the  upper left panel of Chart 6, we are assuming that spending out of the rebates--the     6/26-27/01 56   gray portion of the bars--will provide an important lift to PCE during the next three  quarters, with the largest effect in the fourth quarter of this year  As shown by the  red portion, the permanent cuts likely will have only a barely perceptible influence  this year, but next year they should come into their own as a second and more  substantial round of rate reduction comes on line   The upper right panel shows the influence of the tax cuts on the growth of real  PCE Absent the tax stimulus, as shown by the red line, we would have PCE growth  slowing further in the third quarter to less than 1 percent at an annual rate, before  picking up somewhat through the rest of the forecast period  But if the tax-related  stimulus plays out as we expect, the quarter just ending will mark the trough in  terms of PCE growth, and spending should accelerate in the third and especially  fourth quarters of this year   Over the longer term, the personal saving rate helps to anchor our PCE  projection The middle left panel outlines a few recent and prospective influences  on the saving rate First, with some crack detective work, our Flow of Funds  Section discovered that BEA has been underestimating employer contributions to  private pension plans since 1995 By last year, the miss had ramped up to roughly  $50 billion BEA has indicated to us that the problem won’t be fully addressed until  2003, when they next publish a comprehensive revision of the NIPAs  Second,  BEA announced earlier this year that data from the Unemployment Insurance  system show about $75 billion more in wage and salary income in 2000 than is  currently reflected in the NIPAs  This one will get fixed next month, with the  publication of the regular annual revision As shown in the middle right panel, all  else equal--a very important caveat when thinking about possible revisions to the  saving rate--these two factors suggest that the actual saving rate is higher than the  measured saving rate, and by enough to put it back into positive territory  More  important, these adjustments remove a little bit of downside risk from the outlook   Over the projection period, the various provisions of the tax cut will cause the  saving rate to bounce around, as households smooth their spending in the face of  choppy income  And, we expect the reverse wealth effect to be putting some  upward pressure on the saving rate By the end of next year, once the tax cut effects  have largely played out, the saving rate--shown as the black line in the bottom  panel--should have settled at the somewhat higher level implied by our projected  ratio of wealth to income, which we have shown here as a three-year moving  average, on an inverted scale   Your next chart turns to the subject of whether there is a capital overhang  You  have received a staff report on this issue, which, I should say, benefited from the  help that several Reserve Banks provided in facilitating conversations with business  contacts The top panels summarize the key econometric results  For each of two  types of equipment--high-tech and other--we estimated a target level of the capital  stock, shown in each panel with a red line, which we assumed to be a function of  variables such as the level of output and the cost of capital  Then we compared the     6/26-27/01 57   target to the actual capital stocks, which we show with black lines  If the actual  capital stock exceeds the target, we say there is a capital overhang, and indicate it  with gray shading By this method, which obviously is imprecise and subject to a  slew of caveats, we estimate that firms are holding roughly 20 percent more high- tech equipment than they would prefer, the left panel, and about 10 percent more  other equipment than they would like, the right panel  One thing to say in favor of  these estimates is that they do seem to line up reasonably well with the views of our  business contacts   An interesting related issue is the role that network-type markets might play in  generating capital overhangs The middle left panel traces through why this might  be so As you know, markets that involve network effects tend to tip toward one  provider, because everyone wants to belong to the network that has the largest  number of users  Each competitor in such a market will therefore have a strong  incentive to invest aggressively in the early going, to improve its chances of  becoming the dominant player  If several firms each invest on a sufficient scale to  serve most of the potential market, a capital overhang is almost sure to result   This kind of dynamic may help explain recent developments in the market for  long-haul optical fiber As is shown in the middle right panel, capacity in this  industry has exploded in the last five years--by so much as to challenge our graphics  software, even with a ratio scale! [Laughter] Moreover, the volume of fiber in the  ground--the black line--only begins to tell the story; the devices attached to either  end of the fiber are also very important for determining the capacity of the network   As shown by the red line, we estimate that if cutting-edge devices were installed on  all the fiber in the ground today, the effective capacity of the network would be  multiplied by roughly six  This evidence, along with a raft of conversations that  we’ve had over the past few weeks, convinces us that there is indeed a glut in long- haul fiber that could take quite some time to absorb   The bottom panel summarizes the main conclusions of our study  First, we  believe there is a capital overhang today  Second, we believe that the overhang  disproportionately involves high-tech equipment  Given the faster depreciation of  high-tech equipment, this conclusion suggests that today’s overhang may have a  shorter half-life than would otherwise be the case  Third, for most firms, financial  factors seem not to be a major drag on capital expenditures  To be sure, some firms  are having more trouble raising money today than a few years ago, but in many  cases that seems mainly to reflect the absence of a viable business plan  Finally,  with regard to the implications of the overhang for monetary policy, we think there  are two main points to be made  First, we think the overhang is only a moderately  negative influence on the outlook Put simply, even if we could somehow take the  overhang away immediately, we would still have a weak projection for real activity   Second, we believe that the overhang is not likely to noticeably impair the  effectiveness of monetary policy  If monetary policy worked primarily by  influencing the demand for equipment, we might think otherwise  But monetary  policy works on a wide variety of spending, including housing, PCE, and net     6/26-27/01 58   exports, through a number of channels in financial markets  Moreover, we never  have been able to demonstrate a vigorous channel operating through cost-of-capital  effects on investment spending, especially in the short run  Therefore, despite the  capital overhang, we believe that monetary policy will be about as effective in the  current easing cycle as it has been in previous easing cycles   Your next chart turns to the broader topic of the outlook for investment  A  good deal of concern has focused on the volume of debt that was issued to finance  the investment boom of the late 1990s  But, as shown by the black line in the upper  left panel, interest expense remained only a moderate source of pressure on cash  flow through the first quarter of this year for the nonfinancial corporate sector as a  whole To be sure, as shown by the red line, the telecom service firms, which  collectively have seen a doubling of their interest burden in just five years, are a  notable exception Similarly, as shown in the upper right panel, the expected default  frequency has increased much more sharply for the telecom service firms than for  the nonfinancial corporate sector as a whole  We interpret these data as suggesting  that, for most firms, financial considerations will not sharply curtail capital  spending   That said, a sobering reassessment of prospects for the telecom sector may have  helped put the spark to the tinder last year, but once the fire was going a traditional  accelerator dynamic appears to have taken over, as is illustrated in the middle panel   As the growth of business output slowed in the second half of last year and into the  first half of this year, firms cut the growth of their real spending for non-high-tech  equipment and software sharply  And while we believe that some of the  extraordinary weakness in this sector will abate later this year, a revival in E&S  spending may not be on solid footing until sometime next year when it becomes  more evident to firms that business output is reaccelerating   Turning to nonresidential investment, some crosscurrents are influencing the  outlook Activity in drilling and mining has been boosted by the high prices of oil  and natural gas, and spending by utilities has been supported by the need for new  electricity generating capacity But as shown in the lower left panel, these two  sectors account for only about a fifth of overall nonresidential investment   Moreover, as shown at the lower right, prospects for the sector overall are much  dimmer than in the past year or two, reflecting among other factors a widespread  notching up in the vacancy rate for office and industrial space   Your next chart turns to the outlook for inflation  As you know, the growth of  structural productivity--shown in the upper left panel--is one of the key building  blocks in our thinking about the prospects for inflation You may be relieved to  learn that I plan no further dissertation on that topic today, other than to note that  fluctuations in structural productivity growth shape our estimate of the “short-run”  or “effective” NAIRU, shown in the upper right panel  Indeed, given our  anticipated path for structural productivity, we expect the effective NAIRU to rise to  about 5-1/4 percent by the middle of next year  This implies that the projected rise     6/26-27/01 59   in the unemployment rate puts a bit less downward pressure on inflation than one  might otherwise have thought   In addition to lower resource utilization, a number of other factors influence the  contour of the price forecast over the next year and a half  One factor helping to  reduce core inflation is a moderation in energy prices, which--as shown in the  middle left panel--now seems to be well in train  If it continues as we expect,  energy prices should take about 02 percentage point off the change in core inflation  from this year to next  In addition, as shown in the middle right panel, near-term  inflation expectations seem to have held about steady over the last six months,  despite the upward pressure on headline inflation  Putting these pieces together, all  three measures of core inflation shown in the bottom panel are more or less flat from  their current levels   Your next chart examines the situation in the labor market  The top panel  relates the unemployment gap to the GDP gap  By either measure, the pressure on  productive resources will be diminishing fairly rapidly over the next few quarters   The middle left panel shows that the more rapid top-line price inflation of the last  two years--the gray bars--is likely to contribute to a more rapid rate of growth of  compensation this year--the red line  And, as shown in the middle right panel, we  believe something similar will occur with respect to productivity growth   Compensation demands appear to reflect productivity developments only with a  very long lag As a result, the rapid growth of productivity during the last few years  is likely to still be feeding through into compensation growth at least for the  remainder of the forecast period  All told, as shown in the bottom panel, we expect  compensation growth as measured by the employment cost index to be about the  same this year as last, as the effect of easing resource utilization is about offset by  the larger contribution from lagged inflation  Next year, however, we expect the  ECI to decelerate as the downturn in energy prices damps the contribution from  lagged inflation by 04 percentage point   Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation    If I’m recalling correctly, I think that was from a conversation we had   with one of our business contacts I believe it was in the context of one of the CEOs remarking   that previously he or she had thought that demand would double every three months and now   catastrophe had befallen them and it only doubles once a year    Maybe somebody can help me by finding the reference     6/26-27/01 65    I won’t make any comments on our standard errors!    I think it's hard to know  It certainly is the case that the telecom   sector has been punished incredibly Stock prices of the telecom service firms and the equipment   makers have been beaten down by just astonishing proportions  Whether they've taken on board   the full extent of the outlook as we see it, I can't say, though by and large the raw materials of the   analysis we've done are in the public sector  In this particular regard I don't think we have any   information that is not available to a careful market analyst  That doesn't insure that it’s reflected   in the current level of prices by any means    What I was trying to do was to lay out some theory on the timing, or   the sequence in which these events might have unfolded    I would hate to go to the mat on that issue without having a chance to   look at the data first My sense is that the gist of this channel, as shown in the middle chart, is     6/26-27/01 70   that by and large a sort of traditional accelerator mechanism seems to have operated here  One   element that is unusual, though, is that many people perceive the originating shock to have been   one to business investment  And at least a component of that shock seems to have come from the   telecom service sector  Those firms themselves account for what is, at least to me, an astonishing   fraction of overall investment  I don't have the figure nailed down but it’s somewhere between   10 and 15 percent of overall equipment investment  So clearly, the reassessment of the prospects   for the telecom service sector was important, but that's not to suggest that developments in the   industrial sector were not also an important contributing factor    Well, there are a couple of elements that I can throw out  One is, as   we tried to emphasize in the report, that these gaps that open up between the estimated target and   the actual capital exert some drag on aggregate demand  And at least if you believe the model   estimates--though I could give you a long list of reasons why you shouldn’t--these gaps are rather   slow to work off So, for example, in the high-tech graph on that chart we can see that through     6/26-27/01 72   most of the 1980s there was an alleged gap that didn't get corrected  That's just to say that the   overhang in high-tech equipment and in other equipment is a moderate negative on the outlook    But that in and of itself doesn't have a large incremental effect  In his remarks I believe Dave   Stockton highlighted the two key factors that we think are going to turn the economy around    One is monetary policy and the other is fiscal policy  All this sort of rolls together; if it becomes   apparent that the momentum of the economy is shifting, then through normal accelerator effects   other things start to come along with it  But the two key prime movers would be fiscal policy and   monetary policy    Fitted to the actual data and estimated in a system of four equations   involving these two elements of equipment plus nonresidential structures as a third and   inventories as a fourth    I could never plead guilty to feeling comfortable with something as   far removed from what ordinary business decision makers see as their reality  If I were to try to   defend this as best I could, I’d say that one piece of corroborating evidence is that if we look at   average periods over which there has been an overhang--defined by the shaded gray areas--they   correspond to periods of slower than average growth  And by contrast, the periods when the   actual stock was short of the target stock are ones with faster growth  Now all kinds of things   were going on during those periods; the overhang wasn't the only factor by any means  But that's     6/26-27/01 74   one piece of corroborating evidence  And then, consistent with President Moskow's comment, it   does make me feel a little better that when we went out and talked with some real people--      I guess I managed to take some comfort in that, maybe more frankly   than from these model estimates    I don't think I can answer that on the spot, but I'll certainly think about   that It's an interesting question  "
6862,2001-08-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  A reader of this  meeting’s Greenbook could be forgiven, I think, for contracting at least  a mild case of sticker shock  After all, we revised down our estimate of  growth for the current year--already half completed--by 04 percentage  point, and for next year by twice that much, to cut 1-1/4 percentage  points from the level of GDP by the end of next year  But rather than  casting this forecast as a big change from its predecessor, I would like  to begin today by making the case that this can largely be seen as a  status quo forecast         Without a doubt, there has been considerable buzz in the last few  weeks about the revisions to the national income accounts and how  dramatically those revisions have changed perceptions of  macroeconomic reality  In a way, of course, that is correct  The  revised figures suggest that firms invested much less than previously  estimated during the past three years  Accordingly, capital deepening  occurred at a slower pace, and that has important implications, of  course, for growth prospects As my colleagues Fleischman, Sichel,  and Struckmeyer outlined in their memo to you last week, we have  trimmed our estimate of potential GDP growth by four tenths this year  and six tenths next year  Obviously, a revision of this magnitude is of  enormous consequence for some issues, including assessments of the     8/21/01 5   trend rate of growth in the standard of living, the long-term outlook for  the federal budget, and the solvency of the Social Security system         But the implications of the NIPA revisions for the conduct of  monetary policy could easily be overdone  To a first approximation,  the recent history of inflation remains essentially as previously  estimated  From that, we infer to a first approximation that the  pressures on productive resources probably were about as we had  estimated based on the previous numbers  In particular, the gap  between actual and potential GDP probably was about as we had it,  albeit with lower levels of both actual and potential output         Previously, we had been attributing a goodly portion of the  outstanding inflation performance of the late 1990s to the acceleration  in structural productivity Now, with the productivity boom  downgraded a notch, it can obviously do less of the work for us in  terms of explaining why inflation has stayed so low during the last five  or six years So what explains the extraordinarily good inflation  performance of the late 1990s?  The short answer is that we don’t know  for sure, but something else must have been causing inflation to behave  so well despite the low unemployment rate  Often cited candidates  include the rise of temporary help supply firms, better job matching  facilitated by the Internet, welfare reform, and reduced pricing power  due to more intense foreign competition  Before, we were in the  slightly awkward position of having no room for any of these entirely  plausible explanations to play a role  Now, there is scope for these  possible changes in the behavior of labor and product markets to be part  of the story While we are uncertain about the precise magnitudes of  the various individual effects, we are assuming they will persist, with  the consequence being essentially equivalent to a reduction in the long- run NAIRU from 5-1/2 percent to 5-1/4 percent         Thus, when all the dust has settled, our assessment is that you are  operating in an environment that in some ways looks very similar to the  one we saw in June Inflation is about the same and the pressures on  resource utilization look similar  As a result, the stance of monetary  policy, as gauged by the gap between r and r*, also looks about the  same         That said, let me now turn up the microscope and point out some of  the adjustments that we have made to our outlook in the context of that  broadly similar framework  By far the most important of these  adjustments is a further marking down of our outlook for business  investment  As you know, the data on orders for June were  extraordinarily weak, headlined by a 13 percent decline in orders for  communications equipment, not at an annual rate  As we could find     8/21/01 6   little solace either in the Beige Book or in our own informal contacts  with members of the business community, we are now assuming that  this quarter’s decline in real spending for equipment and software will  be essentially as steep as last quarter’s  We’re also assuming that the  fourth quarter will show no great improvement either  In addition, we  have turned much more bearish on the outlook for nonresidential  structures While the commercial real estate sector seems to have  avoided repeating the excesses of the late 1980s, vacancy rates have  been rising sharply of late and we foresee several more quarters of  declining spending on nonresidential structures  This, too, seems to be  supported by the reports summarized in the Beige Book and elsewhere         In contrast, we continue to be surprised to the upside by the strength  of consumer spending  The advance estimate of retail sales for July  was noticeably stronger than we had been expecting, and with the tax  rebate arriving in most households’ mailboxes this month and next, we  still anticipate that household spending will provide important support  to activity in the months ahead         The only other notable modification to our near-term outlook is  mostly just a matter of timing  By our assessment, automakers have  been in the process of building more vehicles--especially trucks--this  quarter than we think they can reasonably expect to sell As a  consequence, we think they will need to cut production significantly in  the fourth quarter The resulting swings in production, on our  assumptions, add about 1/2 percentage point to GDP growth this  quarter and take away about 1-1/4 percentage point next quarter  We  may be off on our timing one way or the other but unless sales pick up  substantially, a sharp cutback in production from current plans  sometime in the next few months seems highly likely  And Ford’s  announcement last week--which is already built into our numbers--is  probably only the beginning         So from a larger perspective, how should you, as the principals in  this process, audit the reasonableness of our projection?  As a starting  point, I suggest that you consider three basic questions  First, do you  find our revisions to potential GDP growth plausible?  We now have  the growth of potential GDP slowing from 3-3/4 percent last year to 3  percent this year and to 2-3/4 percent next year, reflecting a slower pace  of capital deepening I should note, for those who are trying to gauge  the long-term growth potential of the economy, that on our current  outlook for business investment we would have the growth of potential  edging back up perhaps to about 3 percent after 2002         Second, do you find it plausible that we have adjusted our forecast  for actual GDP roughly in line with the revision to potential, leaving     8/21/01 7   aside some issues of lags?  Our theory in making this adjustment is that  households and firms should not be completely oblivious to the change  in the outlook Indeed, households and firms were likely on to this  even before we were In particular, we know that for the most part  households tie their spending to the trend in their income  And if the  trend in their income slows, then we should have a good deal of  confidence that their spending will slow as well, even if with a short  lag We also know that businesses gauge their need for productive  plant and equipment to the pace of their current and expected activity   And if they sense that activity is not living up to prior billing, they can  be counted on to trim their investment spending accordingly         I should hasten to say that not everyone is as glum as we are about  the near-term prospects for real activity; for example, the most recent  Blue Chip consensus is at 2-1/4 percent for growth in the second half   But in the face of a noticeably weaker foreign outlook, unremitting  gloom from the industrial sector, continued bad news from the tech  sector, and a steady drumbeat of negative earnings and layoff  announcements, I am a bit hard pressed to share their optimism         Third, do you find our cautious optimism about the outlook for  inflation plausible? To be sure, as we highlighted in the “alternative  simulations” section of the Greenbook, the substantial downward  revision to the markup in the NIPA accounts appears to take away a  cushion we thought firms had to absorb future cost pressures If firms  move to restore that cushion, the consequence could be several more  tenths of inflation as early as next year  However, the environment we  see is one of low capacity utilization, increasing slack in labor markets,  and earlier retrenchment in energy prices than we had previously been  expecting Moreover, we believe the revised data on compensation per  hour for the year 2000 may be importantly distorted by the treatment of  options granted by employers, so we have been inclined to discount  these data While margins clearly cannot be suppressed without limit,  we are inclined to believe that the plausible limit has not been reached  yet, and so we anticipate continued relatively good inflation  performance over the forecast period        Let me conclude by focusing on one of the risks to the outlook that  we highlighted in the “alternative simulations” section of the  Greenbook--namely, the risk of a major stock market correction   Contrary to my general story line that the NIPA revisions did not affect  much of interest, I don’t think that’s the case here  As you know, there  were downward revisions over the last several years to NIPA dividends  and earnings Moreover, our analysis leads us to be considerably more  guarded in our assessment of the outlook for the trends in these series  based on the downward revised growth in potential output  That        Wall Street Journal  implies that today’s level of equity prices is being carried on a shakier  foundation of fundamentals  I should add parenthetically that I think  this morning’s story in the  reinforces this view,  although it doesn’t alter the validity of the NIPA accounts because, for  all their shortcomings, the NIPA accounts happen to get this aspect of  earnings reporting correct On the whole, this leads us to conclude that  whatever our level of apprehension about the market before the release  of the NIPA data, it probably ought to be moved up a notch in light of  the new information   8/21/01 8    Let me make two comments on that  First of all, I made an oblique   reference to the issue of lags  We translate a downward shift in the trend in incomes to consumer   spending with a lagged response of a couple of quarters  We think it takes households a little   while to catch on to this change We brought down potential GDP growth by 04 percentage   point this year We think about half of that lower potential growth this year translates into a   reduction in actual GDP growth For next year we took potential down by 06 percentage point    And by that time we believe the adjustment process is far enough along so that households will   begin to recognize a softening in their income prospects, and indeed in their permanent income,   and that will be incorporated into their spending  So we feel that over that kind of time horizon   it’s realistic to build changes in the fundamental tenor of income into the growth of consumer   spending    Yes  "
6878,2001-09-13,"  I don’t think they’ve announced further shutdowns    They shut down their plants on Tuesday and Wednesday    There were additional curtailments of production after that and those are expected to   persist perhaps until Monday  I don’t know the extent to which those further shutdowns   have been made public The initial closings were related simply to the shock of the event   itself Their persistence I think  inability to supply its plants sufficiently   with parts and so forth    On the first day there was some trading in German markets   and we were able to get quotes for all 30 stocks represented in the Dow  I would   emphasize that the calculation was pretty rough, but we took prices that were quoted in   euro terms and adjusted them for the decline in the dollar against the euro  We calculated   that the drop in the synthetic Dow was about 300 points  I must say that that struck me as   a rather small figure compared to what else had gone on around the world  And the same   thought apparently crossed the mind of a market analyst in London whose name I don’t   recall He calculated, according to the wire that I saw, a decline in the Dow of about 800   points I’m not quite sure that I wouldn’t trust his calculation more than mine, but we   double-checked our figures and that 300 number was what we got    I haven’t done it for today and there wasn’t any trading in   US securities yesterday    The currency effect, if I have the sign correct, actually   alleviated the decline in the Dow on a dollar basis because the dollar weakened against     9/13/01 12   the euro by 18 percent So what that means is that the euro-based decline in the Dow   was something on the order of roughly 5 percent, offset by a 18--or call it 2--percent   weakening in the dollar, leaving something like a 3 percent decline in the synthetic Dow   in dollar price terms  "
6946,2001-11-06,"  There’s not a lot to go on  We don’t have clean, historical experiments    We have some elegant theory and some consensus parameters  We attempted to calibrate simulation   models to values that we think are sensible and that in other circumstances produce reasonable   results But history is not replete with temporary investment tax incentives of the kind that we’re   simulating here  And Congress is not notorious for following through in every respect with the   specifics of its original announcement  So one possible risk that could attenuate the effect of the   investment incentive is that, contrary to our assumption in the Greenbook, businesses may doubt that   in fact the incentive will be allowed to expire at the end of the three-year period  In that case the   provision wouldn’t spur as much investment as we had assumed will take place  That said, there is   econometric evidence that at least helps us to narrow the range of uncertainty a bit  We have a view   about the long-run elasticity of the capital stock with respect to the cost of capital  We have some   evidence on speeds of adjustment  We tried to piece together those bits of evidence using a   simulation model to get a handle on how big an effect the proposed legislation might have    I’d like to underscore two points that Dave made earlier  First, what we   have built into the Greenbook projection is not a straight read of our model simulation  We did very   substantially push back the investment response to the tax incentive precisely on the theory that   businesses might plausibly respond to the heightened climate of uncertainty over the next couple of   quarters by opting to wait They might well decide in the context of a three-year incentive--if it does   last that long--that there’s very little penalty to waiting until some of that uncertainty is resolved    Secondly, we observed from the experience with auto sales in October that at least in a different   context economic actors do respond quite vigorously and quickly to something that is seen as a   temporary sale on a large capital item, namely motor vehicles in this case It’s conceivable that   businesses may respond in a similar way      I will grant that the duration makes a big difference       "
6999,2002-01-29,"4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We will be referring to the material  labeled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook” Your first chart sketches the  broad outlines of the staff projection  As you know from the Greenbook, we believe   4 Materials used by Mr Wilcox, Mr Slifman, and Ms Johnson are appended to this document (appendix 4)                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 44 of 194  that economic activity is close to or at a trough  If this indeed turns out to be the case,  we will have experienced a very mild contraction in some dimensions  For example,  as shown in the upper left panel, we now expect that four-quarter growth in real GDP  may just touch zero rather than dipping well below, as has been more typical of  postwar recessions As shown in the panel to the right, our Greenbook projection had  output edging only slightly lower last quarter—a considerably better outcome than we  had been expecting just six weeks ago  Moreover, as Larry will be discussing in a  few minutes, the data on manufacturers’ orders, shipments, and inventories that we  received this morning were a shade stronger than we had been expecting and, all else  equal, would cause us to nudge up a shade further our estimates of growth last quarter  and this quarter I should note, of course, that BEA’s adding up of the fourth quarter  will be released tomorrow morning  We see real GDP growth gathering steam over  the first half of this year, moving modestly above the growth of potential by the third  quarter and remaining above potential through the end of next year  As shown in the  middle left panel, we expect the unemployment rate to peak soon at only a little above  its current level and then to drift down over the remainder of the forecast period   Slack in resource utilization, together with the indirect effect of lower energy prices,  should be sufficient to put core PCE price inflation—shown by the red line in the  middle right panel—on a downward trajectory  And with structural productivity  growth expected to rebound a bit next year, we see core PCE inflation moving down  into the neighborhood of 1 percent by the end of 2003  The bottom panel outlines  some of the major forces shaping the outlook as we see it  First, on our assumptions,  monetary and fiscal stimulus will be substantial enough to offset considerable  restraint from the stock market and the dollar  Second, the inventory correction  should be coming to an end  Third, excess capacity in many industries is likely to  weigh on the strength of the recovery in equipment spending  Finally, inflationary  pressures remain in check   Your next chart provides some historical perspective on the recession that we  believe is just concluding  As you may know, the Business Cycle Dating Committee  of the National Bureau of Economic Research applies three criteria in determining  whether a given historical episode qualifies as a recession; these criteria are often  referred to as “the three Ds” of recessions—duration, depth, and dispersion  To  qualify as a bona fide recession, a slowdown in activity must last long enough,  involve a large enough contraction of activity, and affect a broad enough swath of the  economy   The top panel of this chart measures recessions in terms of the first “D,” duration   If the staff forecast were to come true in every respect, we are guessing that the  Business Cycle Dating Committee would eventually declare the trough in activity as  having occurred either this month or next, putting this recession right at the postwar  average in terms of its duration      The middle panel turns to the second “D” and presents various measures of the  depth of postwar recessions As shown on line 1, if measured by the absolute decline  in real GDP from its own peak to its own trough, this has been a very mild                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 45 of 194  recession—involving a reduction of only 04 percent, roughly a fifth of the postwar  average and the mildest of the bunch  An important feature of this episode, though,  was that the official period of recession—as defined by the NBER—was preceded by  a period of subpar growth So if one defines depth on the basis of the change in the  GDP gap from its own peak to its own trough, then—as shown on line 2—the current  recession bulks a bit larger relative to the postwar average  Similarly, if one measures  severity according to the increase in the unemployment rate, line 3, the recession just  ending was again about two-thirds as severe as the average  Finally, as shown on line  4, if industrial production is the metric of choice, then the current episode clocks in at  a three-quarters rating relative to the postwar average  These comparisons highlight  that every recession is different In this episode, the decline in real GDP was quite  mild compared with the historical average, whereas the decline in IP was only a bit  less than the average   Turning to the final “D,” the bottom panel presents one measure of dispersion—  that is, how broadly the slowdown has been felt  This panel shows the BLS’s three- month diffusion index for private nonfarm payroll employment  For this series,  which is based on employment changes in 353 different industries, readings below 50  signify that more industries reported a decline in payroll employment over the  preceding three months than an increase  The latest few readings on this series  suggest that the recent slowdown has been about as broadly felt as the prior three  recessions for which this series is available   The next two charts review our assumptions about four key conditioning variables  in the staff projection Chart 3 focuses first on the real federal funds rate, defined  here as the nominal rate less the four-quarter rate of change in the core PCE price  index As shown in the top panel, the Committee’s actions over the past year have  brought this measure of the real funds rate down almost to zero, a low level by  historical standards but not unprecedented   The middle left panel takes a different approach to comparing the current cyclical  experience to previous episodes In this panel, the black line shows the trajectory of  the real funds rate for the eight quarters preceding the peak (to the left of the vertical  line) and the eight quarters following the peak (to the right of the vertical line)  For  this purpose, we treated the first quarter of 2001 as the peak quarter, in line with the  NBER pegging March as the peak month  The red line shows the average path of the  funds rate in the nine earlier postwar recessions  Finally, the blue region shows the  entire extent of the range of values taken on by the real funds rate during each of the  nine earlier episodes Several features of this panel are notable  First, relative to  earlier episodes, the real funds rate coming into the peak this time around was on a  shallower upward trajectory—presumably reflecting that inflation was under far  better control toward the end of the most recent business cycle expansion than in the  average previous episode Second, and perhaps more important for determining the  contour of the recovery, the real funds rate turned down earlier and more decisively  and is projected to remain lower throughout the projection period than was the case in                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 46 of 194  the average previous experience  Indeed, a central driving force in the staff outlook is  the stimulus provided by monetary policy   The remaining two panels on this chart turn to another major source of stimulus,  namely fiscal policy  As you know from the Greenbook, we abandoned the partial- expensing provision and the second round of personal income tax rebates that we had  built into the December projection  However, as indicated in the middle right panel,  we still anticipate that the federal budget will provide a considerable boost to activity  this year, even without those provisions  A good chunk of the anticipated impetus  reflects the next installment on the phased-in tax cuts that were enacted last year  But  the greater amount of the overall impetus will come, we expect, on the spending side  of the budget—most of it already enacted, but we also have a small placeholder in the  projection for some additional appropriations this year  As shown in the bottom  panel, the impetus that we are expecting this year—a bit more than 1 percent of  GDP—is on a par with the levels of 1982 and 1983 and a considerable turnaround  from the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s,when fiscal policy was restrictive   Your next chart turns first to the behavior of the dollar  As shown in the top  panel, we have the real exchange value of the dollar hanging up near its current level  throughout the remainder of the forecast period A glance at the history of this series  suggests that there really is no “typical” behavior of the exchange rate around a  business cycle turning point  In two of the NBER recessions since the breakdown of  the Bretton Woods agreement in the early 1970s, the dollar tended toward  appreciation, while in the other two it trended down  As shown in the middle left  panel, compared with the average of these very different experiences, the dollar in the  current episode was on a steeper upward trajectory before the peak and has remained  relatively strong despite the Committee’s aggressive move toward an easier stance of  monetary policy   In a similar vein, the middle right panel suggests that the stock market, which had  importantly fueled demand until 2000, has been a restraining force around the most  recent business cycle peak relative to the average historical experience and on our  assumptions will remain so through next year  As shown by the black line in this  panel, the market—represented here by the S&P500 price index—declined sharply  coming into the peak and lost another 10 percent in the two quarters after the peak,  ending the third quarter of last year down a total of about 30 percent from its high   Part of that loss was recovered in the rebound during the fourth quarter, but even so,  we believe that some additional restraint on consumer and business spending is  probably still in the pipeline As you can see from the dashed portion of the black  line in the middle right panel, we have assumed only a mild uptrend in equity prices  over the forecast period We view our assumption about the stock market as a  relatively neutral one, but we are aware that traditional measures—such as the price- earnings ratio shown in the bottom panel—continue to suggest that equity valuations  are rich by historical standards             January 29-30, 2002 Page 47 of 194  On balance, as is illustrated in your next chart, our assumptions for these  conditioning variables and other considerations lead us to expect a milder-than­ average recovery As shown on line 1 in the top panel, we expect real GDP to grow a  bit more than 3 percent over the four quarters beginning in the current quarter—  roughly half the average rate of increase over comparable periods in postwar  recoveries With potential GDP expected to grow about 2½ percent over the next  four quarters, the projected recovery would close about ½ percentage point of the gap  (line 2) that we believe currently exists between actual and potential GDP  Reflecting  the relatively tepid pace of the recovery, we expect the unemployment rate (line 3) to  be about unchanged over this period rather than declining a little more than 1  percentage point, as has been the historical average  Moreover, we expect the  industrial sector to be very slow in rebounding, with growth over the next four  quarters of only 3¾ percent—far slower than the double-digit postwar average  At  least in one respect, the milder-than-average projected recovery is not to be lamented   As shown in the middle panel, we believe there is considerably less slack in the  economy currently than has typically been the case at troughs since 1960 and thus, in  one sense, not enough room for a cyclically “normal” rebound   The bottom panels attempt to shed some light on the question of where the  slower-than-average recovery shows up  These panels show contributions to GDP  growth over the next four quarters from key components of aggregate demand, with  some interest-sensitive elements of household spending on the left and the business  sector represented on the right  Turning first to the household sector, we have  residential investment and durable goods spending contributing less than 1 percentage  point to the growth of GDP over the next four quarters, whereas in previous  recessions they have generally contributed considerably more than that  The  seemingly lackluster performance of these components of spending this time around  is the flip side of their having held up remarkably well through the contraction phase  of the cycle and thus should not be expected to move up by the average amount from  their current levels On the business side, the ongoing tribulations of the  communications and aircraft sectors have helped shape our judgment—reflected in  the lower right panel—that business fixed investment will add less than ¼ percentage  point to overall GDP growth over the next four quarters, whereas in many previous  expansions BFI has made a positive contribution of more than ½ point  Larry  Slifman will now continue our presentation   Your last chart displays the projections that you submitted for this  year The central tendency of your projections for the growth of real GDP is revised  down from the June meeting  Likewise, the central tendency of PCE inflation  projections is revised down a notch from last year  We would now be pleased to  address your questions    I think what the Dating Committee was reacting to primarily was that   until September 11 the depth criterion hadn’t been met  It was that event, with the rapid falloff   in activity after September 11, which in their minds pushed the preponderance of evidence over   the line     January 29-30, 2002 Page 57 of 194   It’s conceivable  Certainly Doug Elmendorf’s and Karen Dynan’s work   with GDP data suggests that those data are susceptible to great revision  That’s not the main   focus of the Dating Committee’s examination  They tend to rely on monthly indicators  But, as   you know, the contours of those indicators can be revised on the basis of new information    Indeed, it was only a matter of a few days after the NBER Committee made their announcement,   as I recall, that our industrial production folks issued a comprehensive revision of the IP index,   which pushed back the peak in IP to several months earlier  So, these determinations of a   particular month for the peak are always difficult to make, as the NBER emphasized in their   announcement  As the revisions sort out, it will be interesting to see whether the clarity of the   peak determination improves and whether the date is shifted      That’s correct    It peaked earlier—and several months earlier after the revision    The BLS puts out an array of these series  One set in the series has to do   with the total private nonfarm sector; the other has to do with the manufacturing sector  This is   from the former constellation  Within that there are one-month, three-month, and six-month   diffusion indexes This is the three-month version of that  There are 353 so-called three-digit   industries in the nonfarm private sector This is a diffusion index of the change in payroll   employment in each of those industries over a three-month period  A reading above 50 indicates   that more industries reported a payroll employment increase than a decrease    It’s a truism that every business cycle is different, and no doubt that   applies here as well There is another factor going on in the background at the same time  While   it may be that previously the recession itself was more concentrated in certain sectors, as you   suggest, most of these earlier episodes were deeper as well  All that is required for an industry to   contribute to a reading below 50 is for it to have a decline in employment  So if the absolute   depth of a recession is greater, one would expect the dispersion magnitude to go lower even if   the recession is more concentrated by industry  "
7101,2002-08-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I suspect that the typical reader of  the recent business press would find the outlook described in the August Greenbook  surprisingly bright After all, the drumbeat of negative news during the last few  weeks has been nearly unrelenting, with news of corporate accounting scandals,  somber warnings about future earnings, stock prices that have been headed more  south than north, negative results on hiring and especially hours in July, sour reports  from various associations of purchasing managers around the country, a disheartening  reading on consumer sentiment, and the spectacle of the nation’s top CEOs and CFOs  having to swear that they are telling the truth in the documents they submit to the  Securities and Exchange Commission  One of the few upbeat counterpoints has been  the persistent strength of consumer spending, most strikingly for new motor vehicles  but also, according to this morning’s advance report, for other goods as well  But the  brisk pace of traffic in auto showrooms hasn’t dissuaded many observers from  focusing on the possibility of a second bout of contraction  In that context, how do  we explain a projection featuring 2½ percent growth in real GDP on average this  quarter and next, with the unemployment rate edging up only a little and private- sector payrolls starting to show some life?   Unfortunately, of course, it is all too possible that the pundits have it right  But I  want to begin by outlining a few of the reasons why, based on the information  currently in hand, we think the more likely path forward involves continued recovery,  even if at a sluggish pace by historical standards  First, by far the bulk of the earlier                    August 13, 2002 12 of 92  inventory problem now seems to have been worked off  There are still a few entries  on the “watch” list—most notably communications equipment—but for most goods,  inventory holdings are in much better alignment with sales, and if anything, even a bit  lean While the timing of the lift from inventory investment is highly uncertain, we  are reasonably confident that the lift will come and probably not too long from now   Second, monetary policy remains accommodative  Measured in real terms, the funds  rate is in the neighborhood of zero, a very low level by historical standards  If you  prefer to measure the stance of policy in terms of the deviation of r from r*, you could  take comfort in the fact that the actual real funds rate still appears to be well below  the equilibrium rate, even if by a somewhat smaller margin according to our latest  estimates  And one important lesson of the recent experience is that the policy  channels are working fine Low prevailing market rates allowed the automakers to  offer the cut-rate financing deals that attracted so many customers, and historically  low mortgage rates have helped sustain residential investment in the face of steeply  declining wealth and uncertain prospects for the labor market   On the fiscal policy side, the marginal-rate cut implemented at the beginning of  this year still should be feeding through into household spending  And we continue  to believe that businesses will be encouraged by the temporary partial-expensing  provision to boost their spending on new equipment and software  Part of the  impetus from the federal level will be offset on the state and local side, but the  government sector as a whole should be a net plus for the growth of GDP  At the  margin, the downturn in the dollar during the last few months will also be a plus,  especially in comparison with the run-up during the preceding two years   Taken together, these factors are enough to support sustained growth in GDP in  our baseline projection  We had projected that consumers would not flag in their  actual spending—even if they continue to share their apprehensions with the  University of Michigan and the Conference Board—and this morning’s retail sales  report provides reassuring evidence on that point  And in the business sector, while  we have become much gloomier about the outlook for nonresidential structures, we  still see spending on equipment and software as being on a slow but steady path to  recovery   We also updated our views about a number of important parameters on the supply  side of the economy  First, the annual revisions to the national income and product  accounts told us that the average pace of growth during the last few years was several  tenths lower than previously estimated  From this information, we inferred that the  pace of structural productivity growth probably had been slower—and likely would  remain slower—than we had previously estimated, so we revised down our estimate  of the rate of growth of potential GDP But with the slower rate of growth of  structural productivity, we were left with an incipient puzzle  The favorable inflation  performance of the last few years stood essentially as before, but now it appeared that  structural productivity growth was a less powerful explanation  To fill the gap, we  marked down our assumption for the NAIRU, from 5¼ percent to 5 percent, thereby                            August 13, 2002 13 of 92  generating enough additional labor market slack to make the inflation picture fit  together   Over the intermeeting period, the volatility in the stock market left major indexes  down substantially on net Two items in this regard are worth noting  First, if the  long-term earnings growth projections of the equity analysts are to be given any  credence—and that is a mighty big “if”—then a real possibility has emerged that  stocks are currently undervalued This points to one of the upside risks that we  highlighted in the Alternative Simulations section of the Greenbook  Second, perhaps  on cue from our Alternative Simulations section, stock prices have rebounded some  since we put the Greenbook to bed last week If we had had the foresight to  anticipate that mini-recovery, we wouldn’t have altered our projection for the  remainder of this year materially but would have shown another tenth or two of  growth next year   All in all, we see the incoming information as telling us that the economy is  moving along a growth track that is slower than previously projected but moving  forward nonetheless and with a slightly wider gap in resource utilization  In that  context, the prospects for future inflation remain extremely favorable  In the near  term, the greater margin of slack and its implication of even less inflationary pressure  are essentially offset by the reduced contribution from structural productivity growth  and by the acceleration we anticipate in import prices  Although the net effect of  these factors is essentially nil in 2003, if we had shown you a projection this time  around for 2004, as we will in the next Greenbook, you would have seen core PCE  inflation edging down another tenth or two from its already very low level   Having highlighted the upside risk from the possible undervaluation of the stock  market, let me close by underscoring the possibility of a shortfall in aggregate  demand  As you know from reading the Greenbook, one of the downside risks we  featured was a further disappointment in business spending for equipment and  software In particular, we simulated the effects for the rest of the economy of  assuming that outlays for E&S are flat for the remainder of this year and increase  only half as fast next year as in our baseline projection  According to our model, the  probability of an investment surprise of this magnitude is in the neighborhood of  10 to 15 percent In the simulation we reported in the Greenbook, the funds rate was  assumed to be held fixed in nominal terms, and in that case, the output gap was  estimated to widen by nearly 1 percentage point relative to the baseline  However, a  policymaker following an aggressive version of the Taylor rule could limit the  increase in the GDP gap to a little more than ½ percentage point by moving the funds  rate down by about ¾ percentage point by the fourth quarter of next year   A second downside possibility we examined is that households adopt the same  type of caution that seems to have characterized recent business behavior and so push  up the personal saving rate 1 percentage point higher than in our baseline  The model  suggests that the probability of such a large ongoing shift in the personal saving rate,  quarter after quarter, is very remote  But one can alternatively view this shock as a                                                              August 13, 2002 14 of 92  stand-in for the full range of shocks on the demand side of the model; and under that  interpretation, a shortfall of this magnitude has about a 10 percent probability of  occurring, according to our model  In the results that we showed in the Greenbook,  the GDP gap finishes 2003 about1½ percentage points wider than in the baseline   However, a policymaker whose behavior is described by an aggressive Taylor rule  once again can limit the damage, in this case holding the increase in the GDP gap to  about ¾ percentage point by dropping the funds rate about 1 percentage point by the  first half of next year Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation    It’s a risk We brought the workweek back from 340 to 342 hours in   our assumptions for August and September partly on the judgment that this year July 4 fell on a   Thursday so it was particularly easy for employers to grant a four-day weekend  That’s relevant               August 13, 2002 18 of 92  for those employers who are on a biweekly reporting basis because that period would be   included in the time frame of the reports that they submitted to the BLS  In addition, we saw the   weekly claims data coming down over the month So our guess was, partly on the basis of   statistical considerations and what we read as the trajectory of the labor market over the month,   that the survey results were not representative of the month as a whole      I think they concur in the judgment regarding July 4, and I don’t believe   they offered an opinion on the remainder of our logic    I have a different take on it  We took potential GDP growth down   03 this year and 04 next year, and our model simulations suggest that that should feed through   essentially one for one into the growth of aggregate demand  So the way I’d parse it out is that   I’d say about 03 of the roughly 1 percentage point revision for the second half reflects the   adjustment to our trend rate of growth of potential GDP  For next year, I’d attribute a larger            August 13, 2002 19 of 92  fraction of our revision, perhaps 04 of our total revision of 06, to the adjustment to the growth   of potential GDP In growth rate terms, the negative news from the stock market is very   important for this year as are the adverse signals that we think we’re getting about production in   the near term from the labor market report and from the negative purchasing managers’ surveys    We also gave a nod to the adverse results from consumer sentiment surveys, as modulated by   strong auto sales So the larger fraction of the revision this year is due to other indicators that we   think tell us that the gap is going to be widening  "
7178,2002-12-10,"  I have a couple of additional comments  First, it is incredibly difficult to   interpret some of the announcements that are coming out in the state and local area  For   example, Governor Davis as you know—excuse me, I’m not quite as emotional about the topic   as my faltering voice suggests  [Laughter]    Over the weekend or late last week, Governor Davis announced a   package of $10 billion of budget cuts My understanding, based on public sources, is that only   about $3½ billion of those cuts are to be applied in the current fiscal year; the remaining   $6 billion and change will be applied in the following year  That goes to the more general point   that while there is a lot of distress in the state and local sector—and we’ve reflected a good deal   of that in our projection—there’s quite a bit of latitude for the states to meet these so-called         December 10, 2002 26 of 87  balanced budget requirements They can do that in a number of different ways  I think what   we’ll see in coming months is recourse for things like accessing capital funds—    There’s a whole constellation of financial devices available including, as   Dave mentioned, the state financing of capital projects through bond issuance rather than on a   current basis    Yes, Governor Davis indicated that there are further announcements to   come  "
7284,2003-04-16,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the package of  charts labeled “Nonfinancial Developments”  Since last week, when Dave Stockton  summarized the nonfinancial outlook for you, three major releases have been  published—industrial production, the consumer price index, and housing starts  As  shown on line 1 of our first chart, total IP currently is estimated to have declined  ½ percent in March  In part this reflected a sharp decline in the output of utilities  (line 8) owing to warmer-than-normal weather  But even leaving that aside,  manufacturing output (line 3) declined 02 percent  Moreover, previous estimates for  December and February were revised down noticeably, as newly available and  revised source data were brought on board  As shown on line 5, high-tech output  moved up in March, but elsewhere in manufacturing the situation remains  discouraging  As shown in the middle right panel, manufacturing output excluding  the motor vehicle and high-tech industries has been flat over the last three months   Unfortunately, none of the available indicators—including the orders data from the  Census Bureau and the various purchasing manager series—gives us reason to think  that the next three months will be any better  Overall, the picture in the industrial  sector looks somewhat softer in the recent past than we had previously estimated and  somewhat softer in the next few months as well       As indicated in line 1 of your next chart, the consumer price index increased   03 percent in March, pushed up by another sizable increase in energy prices (line 2)   As shown on line 4, the CPI excluding food and energy was unchanged in March,  reflecting another small decline in core commodity prices and a second consecutive  low reading on inflation in non-energy services prices  The middle panel depicts two  workhorse measures of core consumer inflation, which continued to edge down   Over the past twelve months, the core CPI has decelerated 07 percentage point  Core  PCE price inflation, shown as the red line, appears to have decelerated only  01 percentage point through March, based on our translation of the CPI data released  this morning  But the market-based subset of this index has decelerated an estimated  05 percentage point, more in line with the contour of the core CPI  The bottom left  panel displays this morning’s data on housing starts and permits  As shown in line 2,  single-family starts rebounded in March, and preliminary inspection of the data  suggests that the bounceback was of about the magnitude we had been expecting on  the basis of the adverse weather conditions in February  However, the permits  number came in softer than we had been anticipating, and mortgage rates have edged                                                    3 The materials used by Mr Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)      April 16, 2003 9 of 47    up since the time of the March Greenbook  So we will likely be trimming our  forecast a bit for housing construction in the upcoming Greenbook projection     As shown in the top left panel of your next chart, the four-week moving average   of initial claims for unemployment insurance has remained in the neighborhood of  420,000, consistent with a further decline in payroll employment in the labor market  report for April  In the motor vehicle sector, the subject of your middle two panels,  the key factor is that inventories have remained on the high side  In response,  General Motors is now offering zero percent financing on sixty-month loans, and the  PIN data show a sizable step-up in incentives at the beginning of April on an industry  average basis  As can be seen in the middle left panel, our contacts on the whole  seem extraordinarily uncertain about how much of an effect the higher incentives will  have, but they are reasonably optimistic overall  As shown in the middle right panel,  the motor vehicle manufacturers also have responded by scheduling production at a  distinctly lower level in the second quarter than in the first  We currently are  guessing that motor vehicle production will take about ¾ percentage point off the  growth of real GDP in the second quarter  The bottom left panel shows that sales at  chain stores improved in the most recent week, but sales are still essentially trendless  since the beginning of the year  As shown to the right, consumer sentiment, as  measured in the University of Michigan’s index, inched up a bit further in early April  from its late March reading       On balance, the information we’ve received since the March Greenbook points to   slightly weaker activity in the second quarter than we had expected  Our current  estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter is down only a hair but the composition  is now noticeably different, with defense spending providing a good deal more thrust  than we had earlier anticipated and private domestic final sales looking a bit more  anemic  Our projection for the growth of manufacturing IP in the second quarter has  been revised down about 2½ percentage points at an annual rate  And the labor  market looks a little more sluggish than was implicit in our March outlook, with  claims hanging up higher and longer than we had been anticipating and with surveys  of both business and household sentiment remaining very soft       Looking to the second half, as Dave Stockton indicated last week, we will be   inclined to tamp down our projection for growth, partly reflecting our somewhat more  subdued assessment of the labor markets and also the absence thus far of any  reassuring harbingers of increased vigor on the investment front  Another factor  reflects simply the arithmetic of defense spending having built a higher base in the  second quarter and, therefore, given what we know about appropriations, having less  room to contribute to growth in the second half  That said, the stock market is up, as  others have noted, in the neighborhood of 10 percent relative to our expectation in the  March Greenbook, and oil prices have fallen faster than we had assumed  So we  wouldn’t want to mark down our projection very far  In the end, I suspect that we’ll  be left with an economy displaying roughly the same gap in resource utilization by  the end of 2004 as in the previous forecast and an inflation rate that may be just a  shade lower than in the March Greenbook  That concludes my remarks   April 16, 2003 10 of 47     My guess would be, Bob, that our forecast for the second half of this   year might be in the neighborhood of ¼ percentage point softer and that perhaps the bulk of that   will be made up next year on the strength of equity market

7337,2003-06-24," Chart 10, your next chart, shifts the focus back to domestic   considerations and outlines the major factors conditioning our outlook for inflation   As shown in the top left panel, we expect that a significant, though narrowing, margin  of slack will persist over the forecast period—enough to take a couple of tenths off  core inflation both this year and next  Although consumer energy prices (the top right  panel) have begun to soften, for the year as a whole we still expect them to contribute  about a tenth to core PCE inflation  Next year, we expect them to be a neutral  influence  Likewise, we expect core non-oil import prices (the middle left panel) to  add about a tenth to core inflation this year and to have no net influence next year   All in all, as shown by the red line in the middle right panel and on line 5 in the table  at the bottom of the page, we believe that core PCE price inflation is in the process of  stepping down fairly noticeably this year, and we expect it to edge down further next  year  As can be seen by comparing lines 5 and 6 in the table, we have revised down  our forecast for core PCE price inflation both this year and next by about 03  percentage point since the January Greenbook      The deceleration in core consumer prices over the past year, together with the   likelihood that an appreciable amount of economic slack will persist for several more  quarters, has—as you know—generated intense interest in and speculation about the  possibility that the US economy will begin to experience deflation  The next two  charts touch on some aspects of the report on this topic that I wrote with Doug  Elmendorf and Dave Reifschneider and that was distributed to you earlier this month     The first of these charts summarizes and updates our efforts to assess the   probability of deflation and related events  As noted in the top panel, we computed  these probabilities using stochastic simulations of FRB/US, the Board staff’s large- scale econometric model of the US economy  For the purpose of these simulations,  and consistent with the analysis in the rest of the paper, we defined “deflation” as  occurring whenever the Q4/Q4 change in the core PCE price index is less than the  estimated measurement bias in that index, ½ percent  Importantly, our definition is   June 24-25, 2003 74 of 211    meant to encompass a much broader range of circumstances than many observers  have in mind when they describe deflation as inevitably generating a downward spiral  in economic activity  Also in the realm of definition, we treated the zero bound as  having been hit whenever the annual average of the funds rate is less than 25 basis  points  We assumed that monetary policy follows a version of the Taylor rule, but  with the zero bound enforced  We drew the shocks for the simulations from the  model’s residuals over the period 1970-2002  In the paper we circulated to you  earlier, we took the April Greenbook forecast as defining the baseline, but the results  we show here take the June Greenbook as defining the baseline  However, you will  note if you refer back to the original paper that the differences attributable to this  change are small     The middle panel uses FRB/US to calculate confidence intervals around the   staff’s baseline inflation forecast  In particular, the darkest region gives the  50 percent confidence region; the intermediate shading shows the extent of the  75 percent confidence region, and the lightest shading shows the 90 percent  confidence region  Thus, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2004, roughly half of  the probability mass is estimated to fall between zero and 2 percent  Put slightly  differently, about 25 percent of the outcomes show the measured rate of change in  core PCE prices over the four quarters of 2004 falling below zero, thus corresponding  to true deflation of ½ percent or more; and another 25 percent show the measured rate  of change coming in above 2 percent     The bottom left panel reports the probabilities of some specific events  As shown   on the first row of the table, taking the June Greenbook projection as the baseline, we  put the probability of deflation at about 15 percent for this year, just short of  40 percent for 2004, and about 40 percent for 2005  As shown on the second row, we  estimate that the risk of hitting the zero bound is lower because, in many of the  stochastic simulations, deflation is induced by favorable productivity shocks  As  shown on the third row, the probability of both experiencing deflation and hitting the  zero bound is smaller still, but nonetheless represents about a 1-in-6 event for 2004  and a 1-in-7 outcome for 2005       The bottom right panel provides a model-based perspective on one element of the   potential cost of deflation  According to FRB/US, a number of aspects of  macroeconomic performance deteriorate when a central bank pursues a very low  average rate of inflation; the one we have highlighted here is that the central bank’s  ability to stabilize real activity is somewhat impaired  As shown on the first row, at  an average CPI inflation rate of 2 percent (the right-hand column), the central bank is  able to limit the standard deviation of the unemployment rate to 15 percentage  points  But at an average CPI inflation rate of zero—corresponding to bias-adjusted  deflation of nearly 1 percent per year—the estimated standard deviation of the  unemployment rate is 18 percentage points  Similarly, as shown in the second row,  deep recessions are somewhat more frequent when the average inflation rate is very  low, according to the model  While these effects are modest, they nonetheless   June 24-25, 2003 75 of 211    suggest that your choice of an average inflation objective is a matter of some  consequence for the performance of the macroeconomy     Your next chart poses a series of questions about the conduct of monetary policy   raised by this analysis  First, there is the question as to whether you should aim to put  an additional cushion between zero and the long-run average inflation rate beyond  any allowance you might make to take account of measurement bias  The  asymmetric nature of the zero lower bound and the downward rigidity of nominal  wages might incline you toward the view that you should but would leave open the  question of how large the additional cushion should be  As noted in the left-hand  column, you might lean toward a larger cushion the more concerned you are about the  adverse effects of the zero bound and nominal wage rigidity; you might also build in  a larger cushion the greater you see the underlying volatility of the economy as being   On the other hand, as shown in the right-hand column, you might be inclined toward  a smaller cushion the greater your confidence in the efficacy of the alternative  approaches to the conduct of monetary policy that were discussed yesterday  afternoon  You might be so inclined as well if you are concerned about the efficiency  loss even from low positive inflation—for example, from the impairment of the  effectiveness of the price system, the greater scope for losses from nominal illusion,  and so forth     A second question has to do with how aggressive you should be in moving to   head off any incipient deflationary pressures  As shown on the left, a first motivation  for aggressive and preemptive cuts in the federal funds rate might arise from concerns  that nontraditional policy actions will not be effective  A second motivation could  center on second-moment considerations; thus, while you might think that  nontraditional approaches would be effective, you might be concerned about the  uncertainty surrounding any estimate of the effectiveness of nontraditional monetary  policy  Under a conventional analysis of policymaking under uncertainty, that lack of  assurance would justify moving aggressively to reduce the odds of your being put in  that unfamiliar circumstance  On the other hand, as noted on the right, a less  aggressive approach would be warranted the more you are concerned that markets  would interpret an easing in that circumstance as signaling a downbeat assessment of  the state of the economy or if you believe that the public would become unnerved if  and when they see that you have no more scope for traditional actions      Finally, a third question has to do with whether your best course would be to   counteract a deflation already in process even if real activity is currently at a  satisfactory level  You could be justified in combating deflation in these  circumstances if you were concerned about the efficiency cost of deflation, just as  you have been concerned about the efficiency cost of inflation  The costs imposed by  nominal illusion, partial indexation of the tax system, impairment of the price system,  and heightened uncertainty about the future course of the macroeconomy would be  reasons for moving to counteract deflation  In addition, you might be concerned that  deflation—even in this relatively gentle form—could limit your ability to move  policy aggressively to counteract a deterioration in real activity should one emerge   June 24-25, 2003 76 of 211    down the road  On the other hand, as indicated to the right, you might take a very  cautious approach in addressing the deflation if you believed that the factors giving  rise to it would prove only temporary  A cautious approach might also be warranted  if you believed that the deflation would ultimately prove self-correcting, as it might,  for example, if it was induced by a favorable shock to productivity growth that so  stimulated aggregate demand as to lay the groundwork for an eventual acceleration of  prices     Your final chart displays your projections for 2003 and 2004  As shown in the   top panel, the central tendency for the growth of real GDP is ¾ percentage point  lower than at the time of the January meeting, and the central tendency projection for  the unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher  The projection for PCE price  inflation is unrevised  As shown in the bottom panel, you anticipate a pickup in the  growth of real GDP next year, little change in the inflation rate, and a somewhat  lower unemployment rate by the end of the year  We would now be pleased to take  any questions you may have      Let me address first the question of what we did to our forecast for the   second half of the year  We marked it up by less than one might have done simply on the basis   of taking on board the changes in conditioning factors such as fiscal policy and financial   conditions  We did that, I think, on the basis of two main considerations  First, in the current   climate of business caution that we see, it seemed plausible to us that there would be a smaller   reaction—especially by businesses but also perhaps by consumers—than one might expect in   ordinary macroeconomic times to the additional fiscal stimulus that has been put in the pipeline    Second, we think that part of the additional demand in the second half will be met out of   inventories as businesses will be reluctant to step up production until they become more assured   of the solidity of the economic expansion    I’m not quite sure how to answer the question about what would have happened if we had   just let the model run, given that our model is thirty or forty judgmental analysts  [Laughter]  If   we had tossed the question to FRB/US, I think we might have gotten something on the order of   another ½ percentage point or so of growth in the second half of the year  In part, I think that is   spoken to in one of the alternative simulations where we show a weaker-yet response to the fiscal   stimulus, which results in ½ percentage point or so less real growth than in the baseline  As to   how reasonable it is to show a set of alternative simulations almost all of which have growth   rates with a leading digit of 4—     I agree with you that it’s impressive  Another impressive feature of the   current situation is the amount of stimulus that is in the pipeline from various sources  They   were enumerated by Steve  an unprecedented amount of federal fiscal stimulus, a significant   depreciation in the dollar, a 20 percent rebound in the stock market from its low, and a very   marked reduction in long-term interest rates  With all that, it certainly looks to us as if the odds   are very heavily tilted toward a significant acceleration in economic growth  I do think there are   risks to the downside, but there are even risks to the upside of our quite robust baseline   projection      I may not have understood your question, but in general on this chart   one could take everything in column A and say its opposite would apply in column B  So   indeed, the greater one’s certainty about the effectiveness of nontraditional approaches, the more   complacent one could be in taking preemptive action against a forecast of deflation    I’d have to say that we have no track record to assess the accuracy of   this survey as a predictive tool    No, it was directional    I think the major instance that we had in mind was a favorable   productivity growth shock, which in our analysis—as we outlined in the paper—shifts aggregate   demand up faster than it does aggregate supply  "
7363,2003-08-12,"   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know from the August  Greenbook, we received quite a few encouraging indicators during the intermeeting  period  Let me mention just a few  Sales of light vehicles in July ran at a  172 million unit annual clip, up 1 million units from the average selling pace in the  second quarter  Chain store sales have been on a noticeable uptrend the last several  weeks  The data on orders and shipments of capital goods improved in May and  June  Moreover, the national ISM index as well as a number of the regional  purchasing managers’ reports either moved up in July or held steady at a high level   And earnings reports for the second quarter generally came in to the high side of  analysts’ expectations     By comparison, the list on the other side of the ledger is short  The two   employment reports we received during the intermeeting period both were  disappointing  At the time of the June meeting, we had expected that the change in  payroll employment would have been in positive territory in June and July; instead, it  dropped 70,000 in June and another 30,000 in July  The decline in initial claims  during the past several weeks has been reassuring but, for what it’s worth, our  preferred near-term filtering model sees the available recent labor market indicators,  including claims, as pointing to only little change—up or down—in payroll  employment over the next month or two  In line with this view, we assumed in the  current Greenbook that labor demand will just stabilize in August and September  before beginning to move up at a pretty hefty clip by the end of the year     In economic forecasting, the majority doesn’t necessarily rule, and in this case we   saw the encouraging news on the spending side as fighting the discouraging news  with respect to the labor market pretty much to a draw—leaving us still expecting a  marked pickup in the growth of real GDP, from well below the growth of potential— 31 percent—during the first half of the year to somewhat above potential in the  second half  The list of factors supporting this acceleration is familiar from our  repeated incantation of it  Fiscal policy still should add significantly to the growth of  aggregate demand over the third and fourth quarters even as the severe distress at the  state and local level offsets a part of the federal stimulus  Monetary policy remains  supportive of a pickup in growth, and structural productivity appears to be on a  relatively steep upward trajectory     The key question we had to confront in adjusting the longer-term outlook was   how to react to the run-up in interest rates that has taken place, as Dino discussed,  since the last meeting  There were two dimensions to this question  First, for  purposes of putting together the forecast, should we downweight some of the increase  in rates as merely reflecting an increase in inflation expectations, and to that extent  not an increase in real rates?  If one were to judge from the relative behavior of  nominal and indexed Treasury securities, a goodly portion of the run-up in nominal   August 12, 2003 13 of 110    rates—maybe as much as half—could have reflected an increase in inflation  expectations, at least in the eyes of bond investors  On the other hand, we had to  wonder why, just as inflation compensation in the Treasury market seemed to be  taking off, near-term inflation expectations as reported in the Michigan survey of  consumers were dropping like a rock and longer-term expectations were holding  steady  We certainly weren’t hearing any stories from the business sector about the  rebirth of pricing power  In the end, we treated the whole of the increase in nominal  rates as reflecting an increase in real rates  While inflation expectations might have  gone up on Wall Street, the same does not seem to have been true on Main Street,  where the spending and investment decisions are made  Moreover, it is worth noting  that at least in some precincts of Main Street, particularly those having to do with  housing, even the purely inflation-related component of nominal interest rates seems  to be relevant for the determination of demand     A second important question related to the change in the interest rate environment   was whether we should downweight the negative implications of the run-up in rates  on a second theory—namely, that it might have reflected an improvement in business  sentiment, and thus should be interpreted as a symptom of faster growth rather than a  cause of slower growth  While business sentiment might well have improved, we  nonetheless concluded that we needed to apply our standard multipliers to the whole  of the increase in rates, for two main reasons  First, in a line of thought much like the  one we applied to the issue of the real-versus-nominal split, while sentiment might  have improved on Wall Street, it was less apparent that it had done so on Main Street   Hiring through early July seemed to be in the doldrums, and as I mentioned earlier,  the subsequent drop in claims has encouraged us to think only that the decline in  payrolls has come to a halt  While investment demand has been improving, we have  no evidence of a dramatic breakout  Moreover, the indications available to us were  that outside forecasters were not marking up their projections, and this impression  was corroborated in yesterday’s Blue Chip release, which reported essentially no  change in the consensus growth projection for this year and next  Second, and  perhaps more important, we felt that we had to maintain some fidelity to our previous  forecasting methodology  For better or for worse, we had taken on board the full  implications of rates as they stood at the time of the June Greenbook, not applying  any discount for the possibility that bond investors might have been having their own  bout of irrational exuberance  Given that earlier decision, it would have been  logically inconsistent in the current forecast round for us only to have taken on board  a portion of the rebound in rates  Altogether, the change in financial-market  assumptions over the intermeeting period—the increase in interest rates, the stronger  dollar, and the lower level of stock prices—were a small negative for our projection  of GDP growth over the second half of this year and sliced a little more than ½  percentage point from our projection of growth next year  In this regard, two other  quick points are worth noting First, for all our angst in the current forecast round  over the proper interpretation of the run-up in rates, our latest forecast of real GDP  growth—both for the second half of this year and for next year—is virtually  unchanged from our forecast two rounds ago, before the bond market dip and rebound  had gotten under way  Second, I should caution that, from the perspective of our   August 12, 2003 14 of 110    forecast, the bond market adjustment is not over  As you know, market participants  currently seem to expect that the funds rate will be on a substantially steeper  trajectory over the next few years than we have assumed in the Greenbook, and long  rates have been set accordingly  If events unfold as we have projected, financial  markets will have some learning to do  In particular, we have assumed that over the  course of next year, as inflation continues to edge down even in the context of a  vigorous economic expansion, the market’s funds rate expectations will converge  substantially toward ours  As a result, bond rates will tail off and finish next year  about 60 basis points lower than would otherwise have been the case  I mention this  not to claim any great clarity in our foresight but rather to underscore that bond  market misperceptions continue to play a role even in the current projection     Before leaving the real side of the projection, I should mention one piece of news   that came in after the close of the Greenbook but would not have greatly affected our  thinking had we known about it—namely the historical revision to the BLS data on  productivity and costs  As you know from the Greenbook supplement, productivity  growth over the last three years was marked up considerably, based on new data  showing a sharper drop in hours worked than previously estimated  We are inclined  to see those revised data for previous years as having little or no implication for a  number of the variables of greatest concern to you  In particular, they have no  implication for the growth of potential output because any adjustment we might make  to the trend growth of output per hour would be offset by an equal-sized adjustment  to the trend growth of hours  Second, they have no implication for inflationary  pressures because any revision to the trend in output per hour would be offset by an  equal-sized revision to the trend in compensation per hour, leaving unit labor costs  unaffected  All that said, the growth of productivity in the second quarter was  nothing short of stunning, and we certainly will have to contemplate once again  whether our assumption for the growth of potential GDP—already apparently far  above the market consensus—needs to be marked up further     Inflation continues to look very subdued  We were a little surprised by the extent   of the increase in core PCE prices in the second quarter, but this turned out to reflect  an unexpected bulge in so-called non-market-based prices  This makes us a little  uneasy because we believe that measurement issues in this component of the index  are especially acute  The market-based component of the core PCE price index came  in right on our projection as of the last Greenbook  In the second half of this year, we  expect core PCE price inflation to run a little higher than in the first half, reflecting  the removal of some factors that we think held inflation down temporarily earlier this  year  Owners’ equivalent rent was held down relative to tenants’ rent by an  adjustment for utilities costs, and we expect utilities costs to be a neutral factor during  the second half of the year  Motor vehicle incentives rose sharply during the first half  of the year, and we are assuming that they will taper off as we move to the new model  year  States and localities are in the process of implementing some hefty increases in  tuition, other fees, and excise taxes as part of their drive to restore their fiscal health,  and we’ve factored these changes into our thinking for the second half as well  That  said, we see the underlying trend in inflation as still pointing downward  With a   August 12, 2003 15 of 110    noticeable margin of slack in resource utilization persisting through the whole of next  year, we continue to project that core PCE price inflation will finish next year below  1 percent  Karen Johnson will continue our presentation      We would interpret that as a further tightening of financial market   conditions  It would certainly come as a surprise to us if that were to occur  Let me step back a   August 12, 2003 18 of 110    bit and put as clearly as I can the contour of rates we see for next year  We have rates easing   back, as you noted, despite the fact that ordinarily—absent any bond market level adjustment—   we’d have a gradual trending up in the ten-year rate  The reason that would occur is that the ten-  year rate is an average of expected future short rates and the bond market would be folding in   higher rates at the end of the ten-year period  So, holding everything else constant, the ten-year   rate would be trending up  Despite that, our projection is that, as financial market participants   gradually adopt our view of the outlook for real activity and the inflation process, that rate will   come down a little  If the bond market were to go in the other direction, as I said, that would   constitute a tightening in financial market conditions  If the increase were on the order of   magnitude that you suggested, with the ten-year rate moving up to 5 percent, I don’t think that   would in and of itself constitute a dramatic restraint on aggregate demand  It might mean a   couple of tenths or something like that over the subsequent four quarters  But that would not be   a helpful development in terms of producing our expected outcome for aggregate demand    Indeed  I was interpreting President Moskow’s question as involving a   sort of disembodied upward drift in interest rates  If it were to emanate from a different view   about productivity growth, then the implications might be different  But even in that case, it   might still signal a wider gap than we had been projecting between actual and potential GDP    The intuition is that, as best as we can figure out, a large amount of   restraint on the part of employers is an important factor at the moment  We think that shows up   in the sluggish payroll employment gains of recent quarters; and it is mirrored by the fact that we   have actual productivity now well above structural productivity  In our projection for next year,   employers are gaining confidence in the durability of the expansion  Our view is that, as their   confidence rises, they will bring their employment levels back into a more normal alignment   with their output, which would generate the kinds of employment increases that you have noted    That, in turn, would bring productivity very gradually back toward trend, though we don’t have   the gap between actual and structural productivity closing completely; that gap persists   throughout 2004 in our projection      As to why there’s a gap between our projection and outside forecasts, I   think part of the explanation is that we have a substantially more optimistic view about the rate   August 12, 2003 20 of 110    of growth of the economy’s productive capacity  If one compares our forecast with the Blue   Chip forecasts, implicitly we have potential growing more rapidly than they do  But that’s not   the whole story  We have the unemployment rate coming down as well  We generate less   inflation pressure out of that in part precisely because we are more optimistic about productivity   growth  And that greater optimism about productivity growth helps alleviate any buildup of   inflation pressures in our view  I would note, too, that the data over the last few months have   come in to the low side of our projection       So we’ve seen nothing of late to cause us to call into question either our   assumptions about the rate of growth of structural productivity or potential GDP or the inflation   outlook  As I mentioned in my briefing, the only surprise we’ve had lately was in the somewhat   irritating so-called non-market-based component of the core PCE price index  But the market-  based component has been quite consistent with our expectations    That’s not an element of our projection  It would be a factor putting   downward pressure on nominal bond rates  That’s in part the mechanism by which we see the   market and the outside world learning about or coming into line with, if you will, our view of the   world  On our forecast, they should see a combination of strong growth in aggregate demand   coupled with much lower rates of inflation than they expected  As that happens, the market   should bring interest rates down, as I was discussing with President Moskow       We certainly have assigned a big role to the very sizable increases in   cash flow that are occurring  We have disposable income growing over the second half of this   year at nearly a 5 percent rate of increase  Importantly, that reflects the $35 billion in additional   cash flow—not at an annual rate—that’s accruing to households in the third quarter from the   combination of lower withholding, the advance refund of the child credit, and reduced estimated   tax payments  So the fuel price increases are a restraint, but they are overwhelmed by the   stimulus that we think the federal government is delivering      It is an important driver of the contour of our forecast  But I’d come   back exactly to your statement that firms will ramp up investment only when they feel they need   August 12, 2003 22 of 110    it  It’s that kind of logic that has led us to be rather restrained in our assessment of the prospects   for the second half of this year  A lot of the anecdotal information that we have suggests that   firms at the moment are delivering those nice surprises to earnings importantly through cost-  cutting measures and not through capacity expansion    By next year, with a very strong acceleration in business output, we   think firms are going to be feeling the need to engage in a substantial expansion in their E&S   spending  The importance of that factor is illustrated in one of the alternative simulations in the   Greenbook  That simulation indicates that if a surge in investment does not come through—we   did the experiment with respect not only to E&S spending but expenditures on structures and   inventories as well—the pickup in overall activity next year will be substantially attenuated   "
7564,2004-06-29,"  Chart 6 presents the broad contours of our outlook for the labor   market  As shown in the top left panel, we expect that, as firms shed the last vestiges of  the unusual caution of the past few years, they will continue to add significantly to their  payrolls, partly to relieve some of the pressures on workforces that currently appear to  be a bit overstretched  On our estimates, monthly increases in nonfarm payrolls will  average a little more than 300,000 jobs through the end of this year before tapering off  next year  As shown in the top right panel, one implication of relieving pressure on the  workforce is that productivity is likely to come back into closer alignment with its  structural trend  A consequence of the last few months’ worth of data is that the  discrepancy between the level of private employment reported in the establishment and  household surveys, as shown in the middle left panel, has largely closed  For reasons  that are not fully understood, the establishment survey tends to rise more on the upswing  of the business cycle and to soften more in the down phase  Nonetheless, having come  full cycle, so to speak, since 1994, the two measures are in close alignment, at least  momentarily  Even with a robust pace of hiring, we have the unemployment rate (the  middle right panel) remaining slightly above our estimate of the NAIRU throughout the  projection period, for two key reasons  First, as shown in the bottom left panel, we  expect that, as job opportunities continue to open up, the labor force participation rate  will move most of the way back toward its long-term average  Second, we expect that  the workweek (the bottom right panel) will continue its cyclical rebound  If either of  these developments were to fail to materialize, pressures on labor resources could be  more intense than we have assumed in the baseline  I will come back to this risk shortly     Your next chart turns to the issue of inflation  As illustrated in the top left panel, and   as you are all well aware, PCE price inflation has stepped up this year from the very low  rates registered last year, both for the overall index (the black line) and for the core (the  red line)  In recent months, the overall index—shown in the first column of the table to  the right—has been rising more quickly, on average, than the core, reflecting the direct  contributions from food and especially energy  The middle left panel decomposes core  PCE inflation, and highlights that the largest part of the pickup in core PCE inflation  during the first half of this year relative to the comparable period last year reflects the  development on line 3, namely faster inflation in the prices of goods other than motor  vehicles  As shown on line 2, firmer prices of motor vehicles also have contributed to  the acceleration this year, as have the prices of nonmarket-based services (line 6), most  notably the imputed price of banking services     The panel to the right takes a step away from pure arithmetic and attempts to   attribute the acceleration in the core index to some underlying causes  According to our   June 29-30, 2004 66 of 203          models, some of the pickup in core inflation this year can be attributed to the indirect  effects of higher energy prices  Another chunk, according to the models, can be  attributed to the acceleration of import prices, an attribution that seems consistent with  sizable contribution of goods prices shown in the left-hand panel  The remainder of the  pickup, shown on line 3, likely reflects the influence of a slowly narrowing margin of  slack and perhaps a diminishing productivity dividend, as well as the aforementioned  larger contribution from nonmarket-based services and a variety of other factors not well  captured by our models  As shown in the bottom left panel, commodity prices escalated  sharply through the early months of this year but have retreated somewhat in recent  weeks  We expect the pass-through of higher production costs already in train to  continue to boost core consumer price inflation through much of this year, before  beginning to reverse course around year-end  As shown to the right, near-term inflation  expectations, which tend to react to recent trends in overall consumer prices, have  stepped up noticeably in the last few months  Even so, longer-term expectations, shown  by the red line, thus far seem to have remained reasonably well anchored      Despite the recent upside surprises on the inflation front, our forecast continues to   anticipate that inflationary pressures will remain fairly well contained; chart 8 lays out  some of our thinking as to why this is so  As shown on line 1 of the table, we expect  overall PCE inflation over the next six quarters to run at a pace of about 1¼ percent  In  part, this reflects, as shown on line 3 and in the middle left panel, a partial unwinding of  the substantial run-up in energy prices last year and this  And as shown on line 5 and in  the middle right panel, we expect food price inflation to moderate, as farmers step up  their production in response to recent high prices  Moreover, we expect core PCE  inflation to edge back from its upswing in the first half of this year  A number of factors  combine to keep a lid on core inflation in our projection  a persistent, albeit narrowing,  margin of slack in labor and product markets; the good behavior of long-term inflation  expectations; and the pass-through of the more moderate turn of energy and import  prices into core inflation  That said, as Yogi Berra once remarked, “it’s tough to make  predictions, especially about the future”  With that in mind, the bottom right panel  shows 70 percent and 90 percent confidence intervals around our baseline forecast  As  you can see, the 70 percent interval around our forecast for inflation in 2005 extends  from ¾ percent on the low side to nearly 2½ percent on the high side, and the 90 percent  interval is correspondingly wider     One source of uncertainty in the outlook that has garnered a great deal of   commentary lately is the gap in resource utilization  Chart 9 turns to this topic  The  basic idea of this chart is to compare our benchmark measure of the gap—the difference  between our estimate of the NAIRU and the actual unemployment rate—with a number  of alternative indicators of the pressures on productive resources  In every panel, the  unemployment gap is plotted as the red line  For ease of plotting, all series in the chart  are standardized to have zero mean and standard deviation equal to 1, and all are  normalized so that high values indicate relatively intense pressures on productive  resources  The top two panels compare the unemployment gap with two alternative  measures from the labor market  In the panel on the left, the black line shows the  employment-to-population ratio  In the panel on the right, the black line shows the   June 29-30, 2004 67 of 203          Conference Board’s measure of whether survey respondents think that jobs are easy or  hard to get  These alternative measures from the labor market track the contour of the  unemployment gap very closely  Moreover, the latest readings on all three series are  right in line with the values that they registered in 1994—a time when labor still seemed  underutilized     The middle panels compare the unemployment gap with two alternative measures of   capacity utilization—the one on the left being the index produced here at the Board, and  the one on the right being the measure published by the Institute for Supply  Management  As we have noted on a number of occasions, the FRB series has, for  some time, been signaling considerable remaining slack in utilization rates in the  manufacturing sector  By contrast, the most recent reading on the ISM’s index of  capacity utilization seems to indicate much tighter conditions  We believe, however,  that this apparent tension reflects the fact that the ISM is measuring a different concept  than we are  In particular, in responding to the ISM survey, firms appear to take account  of the current availability—or lack thereof—of labor and materials  Accordingly, the  ISM series reflects short-term production bottlenecks  In contrast, we ask respondents to  focus on their maximum sustainable production given the capital in place and to assume  the availability of sufficient labor and materials      The bottom left panel compares the unemployment gap with the output gap, and   demonstrates that we continue to rely on the regularity of this relationship to inform our  assumption for the growth of potential GDP  Indeed, the recent—albeit small—errors in  Okun’s law were one factor in our reassessment of the current level of the output gap in  this forecast  The panel on the bottom right of the page steps outside the realm of gaps  and presents the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank’s National Activity Index  Despite the  fact that this series is an indicator of growth rather than the gap in resource utilization, I  present it here because Stock and Watson and some others have reported that it  outperforms the unemployment gap as a forecaster of inflation, though we have not met  with as much success  Clearly, though, the recent signals from the NAI have been much  hotter than the ones from the unemployment gap  The messages that I take away from  this chart are, first, that the bulk of the evidence suggests that some slack—even if only  a relatively slim amount—remains in the utilization of productive resources  Second,  not all plausible indicators sing in unison on this question, and we have to be open to the  possibility that actual pressures are quite different from those that we have assumed in  the baseline forecast  In other words, we are uncertain about our estimate of the gap in  resource utilization     Chart 10 examines the implications of that uncertainty for the inflation outlook, and   places “gap” uncertainty in perspective by comparing it with two other important  sources of uncertainty  Before delving into the specifics of this chart, let me sketch the  general approach  The idea of this chart is to decompose the Greenbook confidence  intervals that I showed earlier to give you a rough idea of where that uncertainty might  be coming from  For a variety of technical reasons, the decomposition here is partial,  not exhaustive, and most assuredly is less precise than it appears on this chart    June 29-30, 2004 68 of 203          Nonetheless, at least in broad strokes, we think it represents a reasonable first  approximation      The top pair of panels considers the implications of uncertainty pertaining to the gap   in resource utilization  Specifically, as outlined in the bullets in the top left panel, we  consider a confidence interval of plus or minus ½ percentage point around our baseline  NAIRU assumption, which we believe should encompass about two-thirds of the  probability mass  Then, as noted in the second bullet, we layer on top of that the  assumption of some coefficient uncertainty, equivalent to a plus or minus one standard  error band around the slope coefficient translating a given unemployment gap into its  implications for future inflation  As noted in the third bullet, we refer to the  combination of NAIRU uncertainty and coefficient uncertainty as “resource utilization  uncertainty”  The last step, then, is to have FRB/US tell us how important resource  utilization uncertainty might be in generating uncertainty in the outlook for inflation   The result of that exercise is plotted in the top right panel as the innermost cone, which  is shaded red  To put that uncertainty in perspective, I’ve plotted it against the same  Greenbook confidence intervals that I showed you earlier      The middle panels consider the implications of our uncertainty about energy prices    Again, two forms of uncertainty are considered—uncertainty about the prices  themselves and uncertainty about the pass-through into core price inflation  The striking  result here is that energy price uncertainty is an even greater source of uncertainty about  the outlook for inflation than is resource utilization uncertainty, according to FRB/US   Similarly, the bottom pair of panels considers the implications of our uncertainty about  import prices  And once again, the results from the model indicate that we should be at  least as concerned about this source of uncertainty as we are about uncertainty generated  by the gap in resource utilization      In sum, uncertainty about resource utilization is certainly not the only important   source of uncertainty about inflation over the next year or two, and it may not even be  the most important one  In part, this conclusion stems from the fact that we believe the  pass-through coefficient from changes in the unemployment gap to inflation is pretty  small  As well, it reflects the fact that the model thinks it knows that coefficient to  within plus or minus 30 percent or so  That combination of circumstances implies that  resource utilization uncertainty will have only limited implications for inflation  uncertainty  On the other hand, energy prices move a great deal, and so can leave a big  imprint on core inflation even with only a small pass-through coefficient      Your next chart takes a different approach to exploring uncertainty and summarizes   two scenarios from the Greenbook illustrating upside and downside risks to the inflation  outlook  These are the same two scenarios discussed in the Board briefing on Monday   In the first scenario, as you will recall from the Greenbook, we consider the possibility  that we are too optimistic about the supply side of the economy  Specifically, we  suppose that the NAIRU is 5¾ percent rather than 5 percent as in the baseline  projection, and we assume that the bounceback in the participation rate that I showed  you a few charts earlier will be only half as large  In addition, we allow long-term   June 29-30, 2004 69 of 203          inflation expectations to gradually rise 1 percentage point relative to baseline over the  forecast period  As shown by the dashed red line in the panel to the right, these  assumptions generate a markedly worse inflation outcome, assuming a fixed nominal  funds rate, with four-quarter core PCE inflation rising to about 2½ percent by the end of  next year      That said, we believe the inflation projection that we put forward in the Greenbook   has the risks well balanced on both sides  One of the downside risks that we see is  illustrated in the middle panel, which shows the markup of price over unit labor costs   The most recent readings on this variable have been the highest since at least the end of  the Second World War  And while our projection calls for the deviation of the markup  from its long-run average to narrow, it certainly could narrow by more and at a faster  pace  In particular, in the course of ramping up production, firms may bid up wages  faster than in the baseline  At the same time, competitive pressures may be so strong  that they more than offset the price effects of higher unit labor costs  In the alternative  scenario, we assumed that the markup moves halfway back to its long-term average   And as shown by the dashed red line in the bottom right panel, the downward pressure  on inflation of even a partial return along those lines over the next six quarters could be  quite powerful  Nathan Sheets will now continue our presentation      Your final chart displays your economic projections for 2004 and   2005  As shown in the top panel, the central tendency of your projections for the growth  of real GDP this year is only slightly different than it was at the February meeting, and  the central tendency for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter is unrevised  For  inflation, no February comparison is available because this is the first time that you have  been asked to forecast core rather than overall inflation  For next year, your central   June 29-30, 2004 74 of 203          tendencies indicate a moderation in the pace of growth, a slight decline in the  unemployment rate, and little change in core PCE price inflation      As we have already noted, some important information became available after the   close of the Greenbook  In response to that information, the staff trimmed our  projection for real growth this year and lifted our forecast for core PCE price inflation   For reference, the figures in the final column—labeled “Staff”—pertain to this updated  projection rather than the Greenbook forecast  Over the next several days, you may  wish to consider whether to update your projection; if you decide to do so, we request  that you submit your revised forecasts to Dave Stockton and me by the close of business  on Friday of this week  We would now be pleased to take any questions you may have      We have a new specification of FRB/US that incorporates explicitly   forward-looking behavior in the setting of prices by firms  In a manner that’s often referred to as a   neoclassical synthesis, we have some sort of momentum-based or backward-looking influence on   price setting as well as some explicitly forward-looking behavior  That forward-looking behavior in   the wage–price block in FRB/US is rational in the sense that it’s model consistent within that three-  equation block  And roughly speaking, both are about equally influential  So if you thought about a   coefficient of 1 in the context of accelerating inflation, you’d have about half on the backward-  looking portion and about half on the forward-looking portion   With respect to constructing error bands, we wrestled with that issue fairly hard in putting   together the exhibit that explored uncertainty, and we decided not to do it because the markup itself   June 29-30, 2004 75 of 203          isn’t a fundamental variable in the model  It derives from and reflects a lot of other more   fundamental influences  The conclusion we arrived at was that, if we had shown you confidence   intervals that might be generated by markup uncertainty, we would have ended up sort of double-  counting sources of uncertainty  So in that framework it’s difficult to put a confidence interval   around uncertainty  More impressionistically, just eyeballing this chart suggests to me that there is a   lot of uncertainty about the future behavior of the markup  We’ve wrestled as well with whether   that variable is best thought of as a stationary variable that returns to a well-defined mean  You can   see from the chart in the middle panel in chart 11 that, depending on what sample period you chose   to draw the blue line, you would get a different number for the average to which it should be   returning  So I think in general there is a good deal of uncertainty surrounding the future behavior   of the markup even though we have a hard time actually quantifying it for you    No reasons come immediately to mind on why the main qualitative   findings of chart 10 wouldn’t hold true with respect to the CPI as well  Energy prices have an   important influence on core CPI    There are differences in weights, so I’m sure that there would be small   changes, but I can’t think of why qualitatively it wouldn’t be quite similar    That could be, through an expectations channel  As I noted with respect to   the channel in the bottom right corner of chart 7, that’s one of the reasons we think the Michigan   June 29-30, 2004 79 of 203          survey results for the short-term expectations have moved up as sharply as they have  It reflects the   inflation that individuals are experiencing   Right, but that was true even when we think prices really were increasing at   1½ percent!          Again, with reference to that panel in the bottom corner of chart 7, we   would expect to see short-term inflation expectations come back down as commodity prices and   energy prices moderate  When we run a very simple regression of this short-term inflation   June 29-30, 2004 80 of 203          expectation on some lagged values of actual top-line consumer price inflation, we can explain most   of the recent run-up in the Michigan survey on inflation expectations  So it looks about roughly in   line with what one would have expected, given historical experience and the influence of those   prices on the expectations that people report to the survey takers  If the energy-price moderation   that we anticipate comes to pass, we think those inflation expectations will come back down  We   view inflation expectations as a pretty important part of the dynamics and the challenge that you   confront as monetary policy makers  And we think one thing that’s making your job a little easier   than it would otherwise be is that longer-term inflation expectations haven’t moved up as yet  But   as everyone around this table is aware, the credibility associated with that is not something that can   be taken for granted    As will we    Let me try to give you some defensive content without the defensive   overlay    First of all, I think one way to phrase your question would be to say, How   sure are you that inflation is going to come back down?  I’d say that is about a 60–40 bet, which is   pretty close to even money  But given the range of those confidence intervals, I’m trying to point   out to the Committee that there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding that question, in terms of how the   baseline will evolve  A second piece of evidence I would throw out comes down to essentially the   same observation  With regard to how well our models can account for the evolution of inflation,   we think an r2 for an equation for the change in inflation is something like 05  This means that half   of the variation is not explained by the econometric equation, imperfect as it is, even though we’ve   had a lot of time in the workshop to tinker with the models   Third, recognizing that there’s a wide error band around the baseline forecast, I still think   that, on balance, the considerations that went into the construction of the forecast make it a   somewhat better bet that inflation is going to moderate from here forward than pick up or stay the   same  Again, those considerations include the reversal of a number of factors that we believe to be   June 29-30, 2004 82 of 203          transitory, which were pushing inflation up in the first half of this year  We anticipate, as you note,   some continued modest downward pressure from resource utilization  We think we may see a little   benefit from a continuing solid productivity performance and the reversal of the trajectories for food   prices and import prices  So those are some of the factors that we think line up to make moderating   inflation a better bet, though not by a wide margin, than intensifying inflation    First, with respect to the two types of channels, I would like to underscore   that the decomposition that is presented here in this chart is partial  It is not an exhaustive   decomposition of all sources of uncertainty  In particular, one thing that we didn’t display was a   confidence interval associated with the error term  The reason is that the error term embeds so   June 29-30, 2004 83 of 203          many different influences, including inflation expectations, which President Moskow referred to,   commodity price pass-throughs that may occur through channels other than just energy prices,   competitive pressures, and regulatory influences  It’s the bucket into which everything in the “all   else” category goes  So I would not want to characterize our view as just two channels—gaps and   these other variables   On the absence of a speed effect, we looked pretty hard for a speed effect and disposed of a   lot of degrees of freedom in the statistical world in that search  We think there is a discernible speed   effect in the prices of items that are in relatively inelastic short-term supply  But for final core PCE   prices, we can’t find it  And we’re reassured in that by reference to some particular historical   episodes like the recovery from the very deep recession of 1980-82, when the unemployment rate   was rising very rapidly and yet inflation continued to decline  Now, if there were a strong speed   effect, it should have shown up during that period, and it didn’t  So we’ve looked hard on the   econometrics, and we’ve done some case studies, and neither approach leads us to think that there’s   much there   With respect to direct monetary influence—whether money itself shows up in inflation—we   think it’s important, but we think it’s important in setting the background factors that we believe   influence the inflation dynamics more fundamentally  We think that what monetary policy is doing   is altering the balance of factors like the gap and resource utilization, for example  When we have   moved to test a direct influence of money in our price equation, it’s a little like a mirage on the   highway  Sometimes it’s there a little bit, and sometimes it disappears  We can’t find a reliably   strong statistical relationship  So we think this is a good, albeit imperfect, framework to use for the   entire analysis   June 29-30, 2004 84 of 203           We think wages are being supported by the rapid productivity growth that   we’ve had over the last few years  We think that is adding a tenth this year, for example, compared   with last year and another couple of tenths next year  On the other hand, overall we don’t see ECI   compensation accelerating greatly  One of the influences on the ECI that we believe will hold it   down is health insurance costs, which we expect to contribute less to the rise in ECI this year  Also,   we actually think that in 2003 the growth of ECI was a little stronger than we could account for in   our models, and we project that that puzzle will go away So the balance of all those factors leaves   our projection just slightly flat this year compared with last year and up only a little next year    There are risks  One of the risks to that compensation projection, which we’ve highlighted, is the   decline in the markup  If workers bid more aggressively for their share of the pie than we built into   the baseline or if firms are more eager to ramp up their production than we’ve assumed, that   compensation trajectory could turn out to be too optimistic      In our alternative simulation for that market-based funds rate, we have the   ten-year Treasury bond rate coming up 20 basis points by the end of the forecast period    In the Greenbook we had nonfarm business productivity at 24 percent  A   quick update of that based on the information that we received on Friday and Monday would put it   at 19 percent    Unit labor costs are up 04, right  "
7589,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  A lot has changed since the June  Greenbook forecast was put to bed  Unfortunately, a lot has changed since the  August Greenbook was put to bed, too  [Laughter]  In particular, in the June  Greenbook, we forecasted that payroll employment gains would average about  300,000 per month in the second and third quarters of this year against a backdrop of  GDP growth averaging about 5 percent at an annual rate  By the end of this year, we  expected that the GDP gap would have narrowed to just ½ percent  By the time we  published the August Greenbook last week, we had tempered our growth assessment  substantially and had marked up our expectation for the GDP gap at the end of this  year to a full 1 percent  But we were still interpreting the June employment report  essentially as a one-time hiccup and were looking for employment gains going  forward only slightly smaller than we had projected in the June Greenbook  Then  came last Friday’s employment report, with its news of only a 32,000 advance in  private nonfarm payrolls, a downward revision to June employment of 51,000, and  only a 01 hour increase in the average workweek  Our misery over coming up short  nearly 300,000 jobs was only slightly alleviated by having so much company      So, as I said, a lot has changed  On the other hand, I should also underscore that a   lot has stayed the same  Even in the wake of Friday’s report, we still see overall  macroeconomic conditions as likely to support a return to above-trend growth—in  other words, growth that is sufficiently rapid to narrow the gap in resource utilization  over the next six quarters, even if only slowly and incompletely  While we have  taken quite a bit out of our forecasts for payroll employment increases in August and  September, we still have those increases tracking into the neighborhood of 300,000 in  the fourth quarter of this year  And in response to the employment report, we  trimmed our forecast for third-quarter GDP growth only 06 percentage point, from  39 percent in the Greenbook to 33 percent currently, on the theory that the deficit in  hours relative to our expectation informed us mainly about productivity in the current  quarter rather than output       In this connection, I should note there was one bright spot in Friday’s report,   namely that employment in the manufacturing sector looked, if anything, a little  better than we had expected  This is particularly encouraging in light of the fact that  manufacturing over the decades has been a fairly sensitive and reliable bellwether of  cyclical conditions  If a pronounced cyclical softening truly were under way, we  would have expected to see it in manufacturing employment, but it simply was not  evident in the numbers for July      Our outlook for inflation also falls in the category of “not much changed since the   June Greenbook”  The most recent CPI report was quite reassuring that the type of  moderation we were looking for seems to be in train  Indeed, the news was good  enough to cause us to shave our projection for core CPI inflation by a tenth both this  year and next  Because the BEA penciled in a faster pace of inflation in the so-called  non-market-based prices, we did not revise down our forecast for core PCE inflation  in line with the core CPI  Even so, however, we have core PCE inflation slowing  from 1¾ percent this year to 1½ percent next year, reflecting smaller contributions   August 10, 2004 10 of 103          from import, energy, and other commodity prices and now a slightly greater amount  of restraint from slack in resource utilization      But while a lot is still the same, enough has changed to make it more than fair to   ask, What on earth is going on?  Lest I spark any hope on your part that I’m about to  produce a fully satisfying explanation, let me assure you to the contrary  In point of  fact, we do not claim to suddenly understand everything that has happened in the last  few months; if we were that smart now, we probably would have been a little smarter  last week; and if we had been that smart last week, we certainly wouldn’t have hid it  so well from the Committee  [Laughter]  Unfortunately, the large-scale econometric  model that we often consult for insight on such issues shares our incomplete  understanding of the current situation  Indeed, that model, left to its own devices,  would have wanted to see an additional 2 percentage points of real GDP growth in the  second quarter, with much of it in PCE  Evidently, in order to provide a full  accounting of the recent weakness in aggregate demand, we will have to appeal to  some factor not captured by our conventional models  In light of the weakness of  consumer spending, factors bearing on the household sector will have special  standing  Let me list some of the possibilities     Hypothesis #1  Maybe it’s just noise  This hypothesis actually comes in two   variants  The first variant takes the view that the data may simply be sending the  wrong signal, not truly representative of macroeconomic reality  I certainly cannot  rule out this variant, and indeed, we had discounted the first disappointing report on  payroll employment, given the relatively encouraging recent readings on initial  claims for unemployment insurance and improving household perceptions of labor  market conditions  On the other hand, this variant seems less plausible in light of a  second consecutive disappointing labor market report as well as the June readings on  retail sales, motor vehicle sales, and industrial production, all suggesting that  something real happened toward the end of the second quarter  A second variant of  the noise hypothesis accepts the accuracy of the incoming data but questions the  persistence of the softness  Maybe we are just on a temporary detour away from  above-trend growth and shrinking margins of resource slack  We put some stock in  this variant as well, in part because we have been impressed by a number of the other  relatively encouraging indicators of demand in the third quarter, including the  rebound in motor vehicle sales, the strength in orders and shipments of capital goods,  and the relatively upbeat anecdotal information that we continue to receive from the  ISM and other business surveys, from the Beige Book, and from our own business  contacts  In addition, we continue to view the fundamental determinants of growth,  especially the stance of monetary policy—and, in the near term, the stance of fiscal  policy—as consistent with above-trend growth  On the other hand, we are operating  in an environment of considerable uncertainty, and a key possibility that we must  entertain is that something more fundamental is going on than just a temporary blip— something we don’t understand and that may persist     Hypothesis #2  Maybe it’s energy prices  Since June, the spot price of West   Texas intermediate has increased about $6 per barrel  Moreover, prices on long-dated   August 10, 2004 11 of 103          futures have undergone a stunning nearly vertical takeoff in the last few weeks   Certainly the hypothesis that higher energy prices are having a much more  pronounced restraining effect on activity than we had anticipated has to figure  prominently on our list of possibilities  Maybe the second surge in gasoline prices in  May and June caused households to reassess the outlook for energy prices and  suddenly to take on board a much larger hit to their purchasing power      To be sure, the timing of the most recent energy price spike is incriminating  But   how much of the recent shortfall in aggregate activity can we really lay at its  doorstep?  In a memo that we delivered to the Committee just before the June  meeting, we estimated that, all else being equal, the run-up in oil prices between  December and June might lop ½ percentage point off the growth of GDP this year  and a further tenth off growth next year  At that time, the spot price had risen about  $10 per barrel from its late-December level  Since June the spot price has increased  another $6 or so, suggesting that the total oil-related deduction from the growth of  GDP this year might amount to about ¾ percentage point—or roughly two-thirds of  the total downward revision to our GDP projection over that time     But while the price of oil is crucial for understanding the revision since the   December Greenbook to our projection for GDP growth this year, can it account for  the steep downward revision to GDP growth since the June Greenbook?  Here the  answer is murkier  By June, roughly two-thirds of the increase in oil prices had  already occurred and so should have been taken on board in the forecast we delivered  to the FOMC just before your two-day meeting  That suggests that the increase in oil  prices since then might account for a downward revision to our estimate of growth  this year of only about ¼ percentage point—only a fraction of the nearly 1 percentage  point revision that we have put through since the June Greenbook  On the other hand,  a number of factors counsel against drawing sharp conclusions  For one, our ability  to pinpoint the timing of an adjustment to higher oil prices probably is very limited   For another, we may not have sufficiently adjusted the June Greenbook projection to  the oil prices then already in view  And for a third, there is little doubt that our  formal econometric models omit potential channels of influence from oil to real  activity, and whether we have adequately compensated for those omissions in our  judgmental projection is not clear      All that said, the coincidence between the spike in oil prices and the air pocket in   spending seems too striking to write off to mere chance  So at this point, we are  thinking that energy prices almost surely are part of the explanation; we’re just not  sure how big a part      Hypothesis #3  Faltering fiscal stimulus  In the baseline projection, we have   been assuming that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are still supporting the growth of  consumer spending this year but by a gradually diminishing amount  On our  assumptions, these tax cuts boosted the growth of real PCE ¾ percentage point in the  first half of this year but will lift the growth of PCE in the second half by less than  ½ percentage point and will be essentially neutral for PCE growth in 2005  But here,   August 10, 2004 12 of 103          too, we have only limited ability to pinpoint the timing of adjustment, and this  hypothesis suggests the possibility that we should have attributed a larger fraction of  the strength in consumer spending earlier this year to short-lived tax-induced stimulus  and a smaller fraction to an underlying fundamentals-based thrust      In sum, we think these hypotheses contain some of the seeds of an explanation    Whether they constitute a full or only a partial explanation, whether we need to add to  our list, or whether we need to subtract from it, all remain to be seen  But as usual,  we will have to remain alert in coming months for clues that may shed further light on  the nature of the recent step-down in the growth of real activity  Karen will now  continue our presentation       Mr Chairman, another uncertainty that I’d highlight with respect to the   timing of how this plays out is that the sources of the increase in the price of oil may have a   different profile recently than was the case over the first half of the year  My sense qualitatively is   that strong world demand was perhaps more a front-loaded story in the first part of the year and that   supply concerns maybe have emerged as an issue later    May I just finish the thought?  The consequences for US activity could be   quite different, depending on the mix of supply and demand factors  If that mix changed over the   first and second halves of the year, it could add to the uncertainty about the timing that you were   highlighting in your comment, Mr Chairman   "
7692,2005-02-01,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ll be referring to the package of       material entitled “Considerations Pertaining to the Establishment of a Specific,  Numerical, Price-Related Objective for Monetary Policy”   As a prelude to your discussion this afternoon, Doug Elmendorf and I will  briefly summarize some of the main points made in the R&S [Research and  Statistics] staff paper that was distributed to the Committee  Then Vincent will  address the issues related to communications and governance that would arise were  you to define a numerical objective   As can be seen in the top panel of your first exhibit, inflation as measured by  any of the major indexes has been both low and stable by historical standards for the  last several years With the economy now operating in the neighborhood of price  stability, some analysts have pressed for more clarity and precision about your  ultimate objectives with respect to the price-related piece of your dual mandate   Others, however, have expressed serious reservations about moving away from what  they perceive to be a successful status quo The background paper discusses the  major issues the Committee would need to consider in determining whether to adopt  a specific, numerical, price-related objective     We view the key characteristics of such an objective, listed in the middle  panel, as the following First, it would be numerical rather than qualitative  Second,   1 The materials used by Messrs Wilcox, Elmendorf, and Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                             February 1-2, 2005 7 of 177  it would be stated in terms of a particular published index  And third, it would  involve a commitment to either inflation control or price-level control  To give  meaning to such an objective, the Committee would presumably aim to achieve it on  average over some extended period of time   As noted in the lower panel, a premise of the paper is that a price objective  should be chosen to minimize the costs of deviations from price stability  If you  share that premise, then you might conclude, as we did, that the objective should be  defined with respect to the price index most closely related to such costs  Such an  index need not be the best short-run indicator of underlying price trends  For  example, an overall price index might be a better gauge of the costs incurred as a  result of deviations from price stability—and therefore a better point of reference for  a medium-term price objective—even though a core index might be a better real- time indicator of underlying inflation  One counterargument to this view is that a  smoother measure of inflation would breach a band of any given width less  frequently and so would present the Committee with fewer communications  challenges This is true enough; we would simply note that the width of any band  would be a choice available to the Committee   In the paper, we underscored that we see the question of whether the  Committee should adopt a specific, numerical, price-related objective as distinct  from the question of whether it should adopt an inflation targeting regime  However,  even the more limited step of establishing an explicit price objective presumably  would involve important changes in the Federal Reserve’s relationships with the  public and the Congress—issues that will be addressed by Vincent in his remarks   Your second exhibit summarizes some of the potential benefits and costs of  adopting a specific, numerical price objective  On the benefits side, advocates  believe that publicly announcing such an explicit price goal could help preserve the  present commitment to price stability by raising an impediment to backsliding on the  part of some future FOMC   Second, announcing an explicit price objective could better anchor long-run  inflation expectations In turn, better-anchored expectations about future inflation  might reduce the volatility of current inflation through its effect on price-setting and  might reduce the volatility of real activity by giving the Federal Reserve greater  scope to offset shocks   Third, a specific objective could improve public understanding of monetary  policy, as the Committee took yet another step to increase the transparency of the  policy process And lastly, agreeing on an explicit price objective could help focus  policy debates within the FOMC by ensuring that everyone is aiming to accomplish a  common objective                          February 1-2, 2005 8 of 177  All that said, skeptics of a specific, numerical price objective argue that the  burden of proof should be on those who would disturb the status quo, and they see  several sources of potential harm  For one thing, if the Committee meant to preserve  the current balance of emphasis between price stabilization and activity stabilization,  then adopting an explicit objective for prices—but not for unemployment or  output—might mislead the public into believing that your emphasis had shifted  toward the price objective Second, pursuing such a course could, in fact, cause the  Committee inadvertently to place more emphasis on the price objective   A third potential cost could arise if your credibility were seen to be  diminished when inflation differed from the stated objective  Finally, a commitment  to an explicit price objective could constrain future actions of the FOMC in an  unhelpful manner  For example, the Committee might feel inhibited in responding as  aggressively as it would like to a financial crisis if inflation were already to the high  side of the Committee's objective   Unfortunately, empirical evidence on these potential costs and benefits is  quite limited, as summarized in the bottom panel  Little to no evidence exists  regarding the likely influence of a specific price objective on FOMC decisionmaking  or the quality of communications with the public   Evidence is also limited on whether an explicit price objective would  improve macroeconomic performance  As documented in the background paper  from the Division of International Finance and noted in the second bullet, there are  some hints from the foreign experience that specific price objectives have helped  anchor long-term inflation expectations  However, survey-based expectations  measures have been quite stable in the United States of late, so expectational gains  from adopting a specific price objective are not guaranteed and probably would be  modest if they did occur  Moreover, the foreign experience does not speak clearly as  to whether better-anchored expectations have yielded better macroeconomic  performance   A key question on the empirical front is whether an explicit price objective  would change the way that private agents form their expectations  Insight into this  question might be gained by investigating whether the profound change in the  conduct of monetary policy over time in the United States has induced changes in the  formation of inflation expectations  Unfortunately, the evidence on this point is  disputed, as noted in the third bullet Some analysts attribute the reduced volatility  of inflation and real output in recent decades to the changes in monetary policy, but  other analysts point to different factors   Faced with such limited empirical evidence, some researchers have turned to  model simulations for help in gauging the possible consequences of changes in  monetary policy  Simulations of the FRB/US model, among others, indicate that  better-anchored inflation expectations would reduce the volatility of inflation and                           February 1-2, 2005 9 of 177  real output However, this result is admittedly sensitive to the assumptions  underlying the specification of these models   In summary, then, we concur with our colleagues in the International Finance  Division in reading the evidence as suggesting that adoption of a numerical price  objective probably would not yield either large benefits or large costs, relative to the  conduct of monetary policy in recent years  Unfortunately, we also see that evidence  as incapable of resolving the question of whether such a step would generate net  benefits or costs on a more modest scale  That leaves us believing that the most  relevant and important issues for the Committee to discuss may be ones that only you  can adequately assess On the plus side, the extent to which an explicit objective  may aid your internal dynamics by ensuring that everyone is pulling toward a  common objective and may facilitate your communication with financial markets,  and, on the minus side, the extent to which such an objective may skew the priorities  you assign to the two legs of your mandate  "
7773,2005-06-29,"  As you know from the Greenbook and as is shown in the upper  left panel of exhibit 4, the unemployment rate is currently just a tenth of a percentage  point above our estimate of the NAIRU  To put the matter delicately, however, the  most impressive aspect of our estimate of the NAIRU may be the imprecision of it   According to one representative econometric equation, a 70 percent confidence  interval around the point estimate of the NAIRU extends 2 full percentage points  from top to bottom  Accordingly, one might reasonably ask whether any evidence  can be marshaled to corroborate our view that a smidgeon of slack still remains in the  labor market   The upper right panel presents one such bit of evidence  As shown by the black  line, the participation rate has declined a percentage point over the past five years  To  be sure, the model that we use to analyze movements in the participation rate writes  off part of that decline as reflecting trend demographic developments, summarized by                         June 29-30, 2005 81 of 234  the red line But the larger part of the overall decline, according to the model, reflects  a swing from a participation rate that was above its trend level through the late 1990s  to one that has been below its trend level the last few years  On our interpretation,  conditions in the labor market were sufficiently uninviting to cause some workers to  take themselves out of the workforce  But as job opportunities continue to improve,  these workers will be available to rejoin the labor force—and will do so in great  enough numbers to hold the participation rate steady despite a declining trend   The middle left panel shows a broad measure of conditions in the labor market—  total hours worked relative to trend This measure combines the effects of the  unemployment gap, the participation rate gap, and the gap in the workweek relative to  its trend, not shown but currently about zero  As you can see from the chart, total  hours worked remain a little below the estimated trend despite the recent gradual  improvement in labor market conditions   The idea that some labor market slack remains is corroborated by a few other  indicators For example, as shown in the middle right panel, individuals still perceive  jobs as somewhat harder to get than they were in the first half of 1997, when labor  markets seemed roughly to be in equilibrium  Similarly, as shown in the lower left  panel, the NFIB [National Federation of Independent Business] reports that small  businesses still are not encountering quite as much difficulty filling positions as they  did in the first half of 1997 I should also note that a few other indicators suggest that  the labor market is at least as tight as it was in early 1997  For example, as shown in  the lower right panel, the percent of employed people working part-time for economic  reasons has fallen below its average over the first half of 1997   That said, we still see the balance of evidence as suggesting that a little slack  remains in the labor market, but that the margin is narrow, and narrower today than it  was six months or a year ago  Moreover, such slack as may still exist will, on our  projection, essentially be taken up over the course of the next year and a half   Other things equal, in the past, labor market slack has restrained the growth of  nominal compensation and thus has helped to keep price pressures in check as well   And yet, as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 5, compensation per hour as  measured in the BLS’s [Bureau of Labor Statistics] Productivity and Cost [P&C]  system soared more than 10 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and posted  another hefty increase in the first quarter of this year  As shown by the black line to  the right, even on a four-quarter basis, the growth of compensation per hour has  picked up sharply in the last two quarters, raising the question as to whether  underlying compensation pressures are building and whether they may be feeding  price inflation   We think not, for two main reasons First, as shown by the blue line in the upper  right panel, the other main indicator of compensation trends, the ECI [Employment  Cost Index], has actually been decelerating slightly since mid-2003, suggesting that  the compensation situation may be a good deal less alarming than one might conclude                                 June 29-30, 2005 82 of 234  based on the P&C measure alone  Second, we diagnose the recent bulge in  compensation per hour as having been influenced by a spike in stock option exercises,  which we think have little bearing on firms’ pricing decisions  Indeed, the last time a  bulge of this sort occurred in comp per hour, in 2000, core PCE price inflation—the  red line in the upper right panel—responded little if at all     The middle left panel reviews some of the considerations that lead us to implicate  option exercises in this matter  For now, in the interest of time, I will only touch on  the first and most obvious factor, namely, that option exercises are included in P&C  compensation per hour but not in the ECI  The attribution of a sizable portion of the  spike in comp per hour to option exercises is important, because growth in that form  of compensation is not likely to persist at its fourth-quarter pace   Indeed, to that point, the middle right panel summarizes our outlook for the  growth of compensation per hour As shown on line 1 of the table, we have the four- quarter change in P&C comp per hour coming back down sharply this year, as about  half of last year’s fourth-quarter spike is unwound  As shown on line 2, we have ECI  compensation per hour moving up along a smoother trajectory, pushed up by the  gradual tightening of labor markets, the continued pass-through of increases in  structural productivity to real wages, and the lagged effects of higher consumer price  inflation last year and this year Overall, on our numbers, the growth of  compensation will be moderate enough to allow a gradual deceleration in core  consumer prices from here forward while still permitting firms to maintain the  markup of prices over unit labor costs (not shown) noticeably above its average over  the past 35 years   But we could be wrong about all of that, and the bottom two panels illustrate the  potential consequences of a misjudgment on our part  As outlined in the lower left  panel, we sketched an alternative scenario in the Greenbook in which hourly  compensation increases 1 percentage point faster than in the baseline over the  remainder of this year and next  In addition, we assumed that firms have sufficient  pricing power to protect their profit margins, and are able—by the end of the scenario  —to return the markup to its baseline value  As shown by the dashed red line to the  right, the resulting boost to core PCE price inflation is substantial  By the end of  2006, core inflation is running at a 3 percent annual rate and headed further north  from there   While we view a compensation-led spiral as a risk to the outlook, we do not see  compensation as having been a major source of the recent upward creep in core  inflation But if not compensation, then what?   The top left panel of exhibit 6 steps back and reviews the scope of the recent run- up in core PCE price inflation  The red line in this panel shows the evolution over the  past 18 months of our forecast for core PCE inflation during 2004  As shown by the  leftmost point on that line, back in December 2003 we forecasted that core PCE  prices would increase about 11 percent over the course of 2004  As shown by the                                June 29-30, 2005 83 of 234  peak in the red line, by August of last year, we had marked our forecast up, on net,  about ¾ percentage point, to 18 percent  Thus far, in any event, that August forecast  has proved to be a little too pessimistic; as shown by the rightmost point on the red  line, our latest estimate—which now simply tracks the published figure for 2004 from  the BEA—is 16 percent   The blue line similarly tracks the evolution of the forecast for 2005  There, as  you can see, the upward revision in our forecast has been more pronounced  As  shown by the rightmost point on the blue line, the current Greenbook calls for core  PCE inflation to come in this year at 21 percent  As shown by the green line, we did  not begin providing a forecast of inflation in 2006 until last September’s Greenbook,  but since then, that forecast has followed a similar upward trajectory  So what has  been going on?   The panel to the right provides half of the answer  As you are well aware, oil  prices have surprised both us and the rest of the world greatly to the upside  As you  can gauge from the vertical distance between the dotted blue line at the bottom and  the dashed black line at the top, the forecast implicit in oil futures contracts back in  December 2003 for oil today was too low by about $30 per barrel   But other developments have worked in the same adverse direction  As shown in  the panel to the middle left, the PPI for core intermediate materials prices also has  risen considerably faster than we expected as of a year and a half ago, and is expected  to continue along its current higher trajectory  Similarly, import prices (shown to the  right) have risen faster, on net, than we expected in December 2003, even though  events have unfolded a little more favorably than we had expected as of December  2004   The table in the lower left panel traces through the implications of these  developments for our inflation outlook  As shown on line 1, between December 2003  and last week’s Greenbook, we’ve revised up our estimate of core PCE inflation in  2004 by 05 percentage point, on net, and have marked up our forecast for inflation  this year 1 percentage point  Lines 2 and 3 show that the deterioration in the oil  outlook can account for about half of the upward revision in both years, while  import  and materials prices can account for nearly all of the rest, leaving only a small  amount, line 4, to be explained by other factors  We take some comfort from this  result because we expect the upward impetus from the sources represented on lines 2  and 3 to prove transitory   As shown in the table to the lower right, as those transitory influences wane, we  expect the inflation picture to improve  For this year, as you know, we have topline  inflation (line 1) coming in at 2½ percent again, little different from last year, before  dropping back to 1¾ percent next year, under the influence of the swing in energy  prices And, as shown on line 4, we have core PCE inflation stepping up ½  percentage point this year before moderating slightly next year                              June 29-30, 2005 84 of 234  Given that oil prices have surprised so much to the upside, one might have  expected our projections for the growth of real GDP to have been marked down  substantially of late But, as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 7, that has been  only partly true   This panel does for the growth of real GDP what the one from the preceding  exhibit did for core PCE inflation Thus, the red line shows the evolution of our  projection for real GDP growth over the four quarters of 2004  As shown by the  steadily sinking portion of that line, which paralleled the feeling we had in our  stomachs at the time, we marked down our projection for the growth of real activity  substantially as the bad news came in during the first two-thirds of 2004  By contrast,  our projections for 2005 and 2006 have been remarkably stable  How could this have  been so?   The panel to the upper right shows that the increases in oil prices relative to what  we had assumed in the December 2003 Greenbook in fact were, on our estimates, a  major negative for the growth of real GDP both last year and this  As shown by the  red line, we estimate that oil price increases trimmed half a percentage point from the  growth of real GDP in 2004 And, as shown by the blue line, they will cut nearly a  percentage point from the growth of real GDP in 2005   Clearly, oil price effects can be only part of the explanation, because they fail to  explain the full extent of the disappointment in 2004 and they explain too much in  2005 The middle left panel fills part of the gap  As you will recall all too clearly,  our estimates as to the influence of the partial expensing provision proved rather wide  of the mark  As shown by the declining height of the bars marked “2004,” over the  course of the past year and a half, we have progressively trimmed our estimate of  fiscal impetus in 2004, explaining another 02 percentage point of our overall  downward revision By the same token, the bars marked “2005” show that the  patching of the pothole plus some unanticipated defense spending have added to the  projected growth of real GDP this year   The table to the middle right summarizes the net effect of these two influences   As shown on lines 2 and 3, the increase in oil prices and the reduction in fiscal  stimulus can explain about half of the shortfall in 2004 growth relative to our  projection on the eve of the year The remaining 07 percentage point was a puzzle in  real time, and largely remains so today   For 2005, the parsing-out exercise yields a tidier result  By our lights, oil prices  were indeed a big negative, but that negative was almost completely offset by our  miss on the partial expensing provision  Without doubt, other influences have been  bearing on the growth of real GDP but, conveniently, they happen to net to zero in the  arithmetic for 2005   One implication of this exercise is that the underlying growth of demand—  supported, to be sure, by low interest rates and appreciable gains in housing and stock                        June 29-30, 2005 85 of 234  market wealth—has been pretty robust  Looking ahead, we expect oil to remain a  negative for the level of real GDP, but not to any great degree for its rate of growth  going forward Thus, if oil prices flatten out, as we assume, we would expect the  relatively robust pace of underlying demand to show through to topline growth   The table at the bottom of the page summarizes our outlook for the growth of real  GDP As shown on line 1, for this year and next, we expect real GDP growth to  average about 3½ percent per year This growth rate is close to our estimate of the  rate of growth of potential, so (as shown on line 7) the output gap closes only a little  from its current level of about 1 percent  Throughout the projection period, domestic  final sales are the key driver of aggregate demand, supported by interest rates that  remain quite low  Net exports (line 5) subtract a little less from the growth of  aggregate demand this year, but resume their more substantial pace of erosion next  year Inventory investment (line 6) is expected to be about neutral for real growth  this year and next    I think there would be something to be said for that  As I look at these   indicators, I see profiles that look very similar across the six panels, and so—    Well, our interpretation has been that the labor force participation rate,   shown in the upper right panel, has been sending a little different signal from the unemployment   rate over the last year or so  That the participation rate—whose sources we understand   imperfectly— declined suggests that there is a little more productive capacity remaining or more of                          June 29-30, 2005 92 of 234  an underutilization of labor resources than one would infer from the upper left panel on the   unemployment rate    As I look at the upper right panel, I see two indicators that seem to be   swinging around each other  P&C comp per hour had been a little to the soft side of the ECI for a   time and then it moved a little to the high side of that  I don’t have a particular story for the change   in the profile from earlier    No    I think that’s correct     Well, in a sense, we’re carrying two sets of books  And this mystery isn’t   going to get unwound for quite some time because it won’t be until August that the UI   [unemployment insurance] data are incorporated for the first quarter, and that will give us the   beginnings of a read on whether we were right or not      Our understanding is that they’ve taken down a wedge—to run off some of   that—but we think it’s going to come down a lot more in the final statistics    That’s exactly right  I have here the quarterly pattern that we have written   down for comp per hour, and I’d be happy to give it to you  It’s a little misleading because what   we’ve done is assumed that that runoff is going to happen over the course of 2005    That’s correct That’s when the UI data will be incorporated for the first   quarter                                June 29-30, 2005 94 of 234   You’re correct  In our analysis, these are the key drivers, in terms of the   factors that are shaping the contour of—    No, that’s correct  In terms of the factors contributing to the deceleration in   core PCE price inflation between 2005 and 2006, what I’ve shown here—energy prices, import   prices, and these other relative prices that I’ve chosen to proxy by the intermediate materials   prices—are taking off somewhere between ¼ and ½ percentage point from core PCE inflation, in   our estimation  At the same time, we think that some of the past increases that have occurred have                                June 29-30, 2005 95 of 234  gotten built into the structure of inflation a bit  Whether one labels that “inflation expectations” or   “inflation momentum,” it is awfully hard to disentangle  As for productivity, we think that it’s   mainly structural productivity that matters for firms’ pricing decisions, not fluctuations in actual   quarter-by-quarter productivity  So we have that as essentially a neutral influence on inflation over   the projection period  The fact that we tie pricing decisions to structural productivity developments   rather than actual productivity may be what is colliding with your intuition    This chart is trying to get at exactly that sort of iterative process of a futures   market that, meeting by meeting, ratcheted up its expectation of oil prices, as illustrated in the upper   right-hand panel And yet, meeting by meeting, the futures market—and we along with it—figured   that oil prices would level out from that point forward  Sometimes, for our inflation outlook, the   absence of a negative is a positive—in the sense that with oil prices not moving up further in our   projection, we don’t have that upward impetus    I agree with that, but the profile of oil prices is markedly different now,   with an extraordinary skyrocketing of the far-dated futures  One of the most amazing developments   over the last—    It’s illustrated in Mike Leahy’s exhibit 15, on the chart in the middle left   panel There has been a marked change in the relationship between near-dated and far-dated   futures    But the risk that you are pointing to, President Santomero, is illustrated in   the middle right panel  That shows the step-up from the trajectory in the December 2003   Greenbook (the dotted blue line) to the December 2004 Greenbook (the dotted red line)  Now, as it   happens, the revision to the outlook since December 2004 is a little to the favorable side in terms of   US inflation performance, as shown by the downshift from the dotted red line to the dashed black   line So there is risk I think Mike’s point is that we think we have the risks reasonably balanced    The risks are two-sided  So we could be coming back to you with an exhibit 6 that would have a   figure in the lower left that was revised down or revised up from the 04 of a percentage point  It’s   not a one-way risk; that’s the point   "
7798,2005-08-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman A corollary to Murphy’s law is  that the biggest forecast errors on an employment report always occur when the  report comes between Greenbook publication day and the FOMC meeting   [Laughter] Last year, in an event that undoubtedly is seared more into my  memory than yours, the corollary held true  This year, in the biggest surprise of  all, there was no surprise, and I am in the unexpected position of being able to  report that the August Greenbook forecast has survived the incoming data a  grand total of five days and counting In that regard, I should note that this  morning’s release on productivity and costs came in very much in line with our  expectations   A colleague correctly observed that there are a lot of moving pieces in this   forecast, so I thought you might find it helpful for me to review what some of   those pieces are    The first has to do with the implications of the annual revision to the   national income and product account [NIPA] data  As you know, the BEA   [Bureau of Economic Analysis] took down its estimate of the level of real GDP   in the fourth quarter of 2004 by 09 percent  In response, we moved down our   estimate of potential GDP by an identical amount  Thus, all else equal, we   would have shown the same GDP gap at the end of 2004 in this Greenbook as   we did in the June Greenbook                                   August 9, 2005 14 of 110  But not quite all else was equal In work unrelated to the NIPA revisions,  we refined our model of the labor force participation rate so that we could  extend our estimate of the trend in that variable backward in time on a  methodologically consistent basis  As it happened, those refinements to the  model steepened the downward tilt in the trend by enough to subtract a couple  of additional tenths from the level of potential GDP by the end of last year,  leaving the GDP gap at 09 percent rather than the 11 percent that we had  shown in the June Greenbook   The second moving piece has to do with the growth of potential GDP going  forward One implication of the revision to the national income accounts is that  the capital stock is likely to grow more slowly over the forecast period than we  had earlier believed Accordingly, capital deepening should make a smaller  contribution to the growth of potential GDP; indeed, we have cut that  contribution by a quarter of a percentage point this year and next  So on the  supply side, the basic summary is this a slightly smaller gap as of the end of  2004, and somewhat slower growth of potential GDP going forward   The third moving piece has to do with the demand side  We read the data  that were released during the intermeeting period as suggesting that the  economy has somewhat more forward momentum in the near term than we had  anticipated in the June Greenbook  You might not know it from top-line real  GDP growth in the second quarter, which was only about a quarter of a  percentage point stronger than we had anticipated, but the composition of  growth pointed to greater strength In particular, inventory investment stepped  down much more sharply in the second quarter than we had expected  As best  we can tell, most firms outside the motor vehicle industry are satisfied with their  current inventory positions, and so will see no need to pare the pace of  inventory investment to anywhere near the same degree as they did during the  first half of the year If they manage to maintain their inventory investment at  the second-quarter pace—as is anticipated in our forecast—they will, at one and  the same time, keep the inventory-sales ratio moving down in line with its long- term trend and add more than a percentage point to the acceleration of real GDP  between the second and third quarters   The underlying pace of final sales also looks a little stronger to us now than  at the time of the June Greenbook, but not by much  A good deal of the second- quarter surprise was in net exports, and we do not expect that unanticipated  strength to be carried forward As for domestic final demand, the second- quarter surprise was very modest  To be sure, the recent pace of motor vehicle  sales is eye-popping, but the bulk of that demand is being met out of  inventories And, in any event, we have assumed that the piper will have to be  paid as far as those sales are concerned  Despite the extension of the employee  discount programs, we have sales dropping back in August and September from  the 20 million rate reached in July—on the theory that many consumers                                  August 9, 2005 15 of 110  probably believed the automakers the first time around when they said the  discount offers would expire—and we have the payback continuing into the  fourth quarter Aside from net exports and motor vehicle sales, our outlook for  private domestic final demand is hardly revised, on net, over the last three  quarters of this year   A fourth moving piece has to do with inflation  The information we  received during the intermeeting period presented a mixed picture relative to our  expectation in the June Greenbook On the one hand, the most recent readings  on core market-based PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation  have been encouraging, and they have caused us to mark down our estimate of  inflation in this category ½ percentage point in the second quarter and nearly  that much in the third quarter  On the other hand, we have a good deal more  energy price inflation in this projection, which contributes directly and in full  force to the overall PCE inflation rate, and seeps through as well—to the tune of  01 percentage point—into core inflation next year  And we also have less  restraint in this projection from any gaps in resource utilization  On balance,  though, we see these factors as fighting each other to a draw, leaving our  projection for core market-based inflation unrevised from the last Greenbook   However, that was not the end of the inflation story  A consequence of the  annual revision was that nonmarket prices now are on a steeper upward  trajectory than before In our projection, we have assumed that inflation in this  component will average roughly 3 percent going forward, rather than 2 percent  as we had assumed in the June Greenbook  Because this component has a  weight of 20 percent in the core PCE price index, the increment of 1 percentage  point to the rate of growth of this component in our projection adds  02 percentage point to our projection for core PCE inflation   The last moving piece has to do with monetary policy  Against the  backdrop of somewhat slower growth of aggregate supply, greater near-term  thrust in aggregate demand, and a somewhat higher rate of inflation in core PCE  prices, we shifted up the assumed trajectory for the funds rate 50 basis points  essentially throughout the forecast period  On our current assumptions, we have  the funds rate leveling out at 4¼ percent in the middle of next year  Evidently,  private-market participants share at least some of the same reactions to the  incoming data, as they have marked up funds rate futures prices by almost  exactly the same amount   The adjustment to the policy assumption was important for presenting you  with a forecast broadly consistent with your policy objectives Had we left the  funds rate assumption unchanged at its June trajectory, output would have been  above its potential in 2006 and 2007, and core inflation would have been  running at 22 percent in those two years, and edging up rather than down                               August 9, 2005 16 of 110  One of the many questions confronting you is how you should react to this  change in the inflation outlook Are inflation pressures unchanged, on net, from  last time, as indicated by our outlook for the core market-based component?  Or  are they more intense than before, as indicated by our outlook for the official  core PCE price index including the nonmarket component, and the overall PCE  index?  It seems to me that the answers to these questions depend on what you  are trying to control, and the time frame over which you seek to impose that  control   If you see yourselves as controlling the overall PCE price index, and you  aim to bring that measure back into line with your policy objective within a  small number of years, then you would probably regard inflation pressures as  having worsened since the June Greenbook, mostly because of the greater direct  contribution of energy prices to top-line inflation, but also because of the faster  pace of increase of nonmarket prices     At the other extreme, if you see yourselves as controlling the core market- based index, then you would probably judge no material change to have taken  place in inflation pressures since the June Greenbook, based on the simple  observation that our outlook for this measure of inflation has not been revised   Perhaps the toughest case is the intermediate one, in which you see  yourselves as controlling core PCE inflation, including its nonmarket  component  In this case, if you regard the nonmarket component as bearing no  relationship to reality, then you might insulate your policy from the change in  BEA methodology by marking up your target inflation rate by 02 percentage  point—equivalent, in effect, to controlling the market-based component  On the  other hand, if you think the nonmarket price index might convey some useful  information—perhaps not from quarter to quarter or even from year to year, but  at least over the intermediate term—then you would probably be inclined to  adopt a tighter monetary policy in response to the change in measurement  methodology  This is the assumption implicit in the Greenbook   One last point on which I should be clear On our estimates, the monetary  policy assumption we adopted for purposes of this Greenbook is sufficiently  restrictive to keep actual and potential output in approximate balance and to put  core PCE inflation, even including the upward-revised nonmarket component,  on a slightly downward-sloping trajectory Indeed, as best we can tell, 4¼  percent on the funds rate is slightly more than enough, in the long run, to keep  inflation heading downward, and after a few years at that level, the funds rate  could be brought back down to 4 percent  This is not a monetary policy that  acquiesces, in the long term, to inflation continuing to run at 2 percent, but  rather aims to nudge it down, little by little, into the neighborhood of 1½  percent In this respect, the monetary policy in the current Greenbook is very  similar to the one in the June Greenbook  In both cases, policy nudged the                                            August 9, 2005 17 of 110  inflation rate down to 1½ percent; but also in both cases, many years were  required before that lower level was attained     Karen Johnson will continue our presentation     It’s about 20 percent    It is a very big number  These nonmarket elements are, I think, by   definition not included in the CPI    Well, owners’ equivalent rent for this purpose is defined as a market   component even though it, too, was imputed by the BEA  In general, our clear preference is for   the weighting scheme embodied in the PCE price index as opposed to the consumer price index    We think that gives a more realistic portrayal of the market basket    They are  For better or for worse, the fact is that they mostly have the   character of correcting something that involved either an error or a miscommunication  In one   case, it was clearly just a coding error in the computer code for medical services  In the other   case—which the BEA doesn’t quite portray as an error—it was an errant trend apparently   introduced by some miscommunication between a supervisor and an employee   So now that has been brought into line A certain price for noncommercial banks, I think,   had been dropping at 10 percent per year and now it is rising slightly  So that alone contributes   about ¼ percentage point to the upward revision in the core measure for 2004  So these are very   big, very quantitatively important revisions      I’m absolutely certain that their hope is that any revisions will be for   reasons other than error detection  They will bring on board new source data and new                                  August 9, 2005 21 of 110  information of all sorts  We’re not expecting anything again that would involve revisions of this   magnitude    I don’t think we are seeing any slippage or deterioration in price   pressures Maybe the most direct piece of evidence on that is just that the last couple of readings   on the CPI have come in to the good side of our expectation  I think that’s the best summary   statistic I can cite From the orders contacts that we have in the business community, for   example, I don’t think we’re noticing a marked intensification of price pressures either   It is true that in the national income accounts the markup of price over unit labor cost was   revised down just a bit, but we don’t lean on that very heavily in our inflation analysis  So, I’d   say the fact that the market-based inflation news has been to the good side of our expectation is   probably the best summary statistic that I can give you    I can’t think of any reason off the top of my head for the confidence   band to have changed We certainly perceived no asymmetry in the risks  We’ve gone to   enormous effort this time, as always, to present to you a forecast with balanced risks  I don’t see   any reason why the width of our confidence band should have narrowed or widened  I suppose   I’m going to fall into a common conceptual error here, but I guess I would say that the   uncertainty around the oil price projection might be even greater now than average  But I hear                                  August 9, 2005 23 of 110  echoes in my brain saying, “You know, now is a particularly uncertain time,” and I never hear   anybody ever saying, “Now is a particularly certain time”  [Laughter] Nevertheless, if I were   going to point to something that would widen the confidence intervals, it may be the oil situation,   but I don’t find that a very compelling piece of evidence    No, it doesn’t because in our inflation models, the output gap enters   linearly So it has the same effect at the margin, whether it’s 07, as it was at the end of the   projection last time around, or 01 as it is this time  We are very uncertain about what the actual   magnitude of that output gap is, but the fact that our point estimate is at 01 percent rather than   07 percent doesn’t materially change our uncertainty about the inflation outlook  It would if we   perceived some kind of a threshold effect—if, when output moved above potential, we saw that   as igniting inflation pressures in a nonlinear way  But we’ve looked over the years and haven’t   found any compelling evidence of a nonlinear effect of that kind    Well, I think the best metaphor for the way we take this measure of the   output gap into account is that we view it as a barometer  It’s an indicator of pressure  At any   given moment in the economy there are going to be sectors and regions that have more pressure   than others So if the output gap is well constructed, what it should be showing is that as actual   output gets into the neighborhood of and perhaps even exceeds potential, in general average   pressures will be rising So the average upward impetus on inflation will be increasing, but—                                               August 9, 2005 24 of 110   There used to be a view—I’m thinking back to the Brookings 1960s   view—of an L-shaped supply curve    I’ll give you J  [Laughter] You know, our ability to detect these kinds   of things in the aggregate data is not very good, especially against—    Just to be clear, we don’t see potential as a sort of physical maximum    It’s a measure of the sustainable rate of output which can be maintained   with all other factors either contributing to inflation or deducting from inflation so that   productive capacity isn’t itself lending any impetus up or down to inflation  That’s not to say   that output can’t transitorily go above potential  It’s not to suggest that producers have met their   physical capacity—their limit on production    That’s a very deep question, and I think the answer—    If we could engage in a little Orwellian history, I think what we would   prefer to do is to go back and revise our old estimate of the bias in inflation  We might maintain   our estimate  Or we might say, “Oh, there was something in the data that I didn’t understand   before so if I thought the upward bias was 09 percent, maybe I should have thought it was only   07 percent”    Having made this correction, if you thought the bias was X before, not   knowing about the mistakes in the—    Yes, you should still think it’s X    While I agree with every aspect of what you said, where one is left at the   end of the day is with a difficult question as to how to judge truth  In the case of gasoline, we   can go out and conduct an independent sample of the price of gasoline at filling stations around   the country, and we can assess whether the measurement methodology leads to a bias in the CPI   relative to what individuals are actually experiencing in their day-to-day purchases  But the very   essence of these components we’re talking about is that it’s vastly more difficult, maybe even   impossible, to do any kind of benchmark study to know whether we have the measurement right                           August 9, 2005 28 of 110  I’m very confident that in the revised version of the national income accounts the measurement   is better But whether it’s right or not now is impossible to say    That’s exactly correct Yes    I can point to two main factors  One is simply the aging of the   population The baby boom cohorts are moving into an age of lower participation rates    No    People my age and older are moving into lower participation rate   categories That alone, on our estimates, has been taking about a tenth of a percentage point off                       August 9, 2005 29 of 110  the trend participation rate per year since 2002 So that’s the predominant factor  The other   factor that we think we see is a leveling off in the participation rate of women  Whereas earlier   in the postwar period the participation rate of women had been rising strongly, we believe that   has ended So those two factors are the major driving forces    Well, we think that participation rate was above the trend  Let me set   the facts first The actual participation rate was about trendless from 1990 through 2000  We   have the trend in our new model running at about 666 or so through that period, including   through the late 1990s We have the participation rates in the years from 1996 through 2000   running above trend    Correct—at its peak Then, as the economy softened and came into the   recession in 2001, the participation rate first came back to its trend  Subsequently, through the   period from 2002 through 2004, it softened and went below trend  In our projection, going   forward we anticipate the actual participation rate to hold about flat; and the participation rate   gap in our projection is closed because we have the trend coming down to meet the actual    So, it’s true that this decline in the trend is an important feature of our   outlook for the labor market    As with all econometric estimates, we do have a range of uncertainty    On our estimates, the trend participation rate now is 663 percent, which is just a couple of tenths   above its current level Our reading of the article that was published in your Bank’s Review is   that Katharine Bradbury’s estimates run from 668 at the low end and up to 68  By the way, for   reference you could look at page 3 in Part 2 of the Greenbook, if you have a copy of that    Our confidence interval, if we were to state it, perhaps would run up to   67 If we were really stretching, maybe we could see a trend participation rate in the   neighborhood of 67 I, frankly, find that a little hard to believe, given the strength of the   demographic forces that we think we see pushing down the trend participation rate by about 01   percent per year Our point estimate, as I say, is 663  Our labor economists say, on their   confidence intervals, it may be somewhere in the mid-66 area  We’d all agree that there are                      August 9, 2005 31 of 110  uncertainties about the methodology  So, if we stepped outside the formal econometrics, we   might think we could see a number as high as 67 or something like that      But that 67 would really be pushing it  That would be taking into   account that there probably are considerations outside of the model and that models never quite   work out as well as econometricians or empirical investigators hope  But at the end of the day   we believe that the case is fairly strong for some downward tilt in the trend participation rate    Yes Our price projection has moved up  The best measure of that may   be what has happened to the core PCE price index  Let’s see, now that I’m looking at the   numbers I’m about to eat my words  In 2002, on the revised figures, core PCE inflation was at   22 percent and we now have it at 20  So if one takes as the trend last year and the first half of   this year, I guess I’m going to have to reverse myself and say that the core PCE price index has   been about flat  It has been running in the neighborhood of 2 percent or a little above  It has   been higher than we thought because of the oil price    But not getting higher, yes                    August 9, 2005 32 of 110   The Greenbook baseline does    "
7935,2006-05-10,"  For us, anyway, most of the surprise has been on the nonwithheld side, on the   final payments, and that implicates maybe something like capital gains rather than the sort of more   directly payroll-tied sources of income  "
7962,2006-06-28,"  Exhibit 6 turns to the outlook for compensation  The first  column of the top left panel shows that recent readings on the productivity and cost  measure of compensation have been quite choppy  Increases in the employment cost  index, shown in the right-hand column, have been smoother but have been puzzling  in their own right, in that they have been running so low  The two gauges differ  methodologically in many respects, some of which are itemized in the panel to the  right  Despite their differences, both measures suggest that compensation pressures  have remained subdued even as the labor market has tightened     We expect that, over the projection period, resource utilization—represented in   the middle left panel by the difference between the unemployment rate and our  estimate of the NAIRU—will be only a small influence on compensation growth,  boosting it a bit this year and restraining it slightly next year as the economy cools  A  larger influence on the outlook is represented in the right-hand panel  As shown by  the third pair of bars, real compensation has not kept pace with productivity during  the past several years  Between now and the end of next year, as shown by the  rightmost pair of bars, we expect this situation to reverse and real compensation to  increase a little more rapidly than productivity, as competition for scarcer workers  causes past productivity gains and higher overall price inflation to feed into  compensation  As shown in the bottom left panel, the resulting increase in real  compensation causes the markup of price over unit labor cost to decline slightly from  its current historically high level and, as shown in the bottom right panel, causes both  the ECI and compensation per hour to accelerate somewhat in nominal terms from   June 28-29, 2006 13 of 177    their recent subdued rates of growth  Nonetheless, with the price markup remaining  well above its historical average, we think such increases in labor costs would not  prompt new upward pressure on prices     Exhibit 7 turns to the outlook for price inflation  As shown in the middle column   of the table in the top left, core PCE prices increased more quickly in March, April,  and May than in the preceding two months, boosting our forecast for the increase in  core prices in the second quarter as a whole to 31 percent at an annual rate  As  shown to the right, core inflation and its market-based component have tracked each  other quite closely of late on a four-quarter basis and are projected to do so over the  forecast period, suggesting no unusual mischief on the part of nonmarket prices  We  continue to expect core PCE inflation to ease back next year  The major reason for  this moderation is shown in the middle left panel; after bulging again this quarter,  energy prices are expected to be roughly flat over the remainder of the projection  period  On our assumptions, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes, that  flattening takes about ¼ percentage point off core PCE price inflation next year     Several measures of inflation expectations are shown in the middle right panel    As you know, consumers’ expectations backed off in early June, according to the  University of Michigan survey, and TIPS-based inflation compensation has come  down a bit as well in the past few weeks  Nonetheless, as shown in line 5 of the table  at the bottom of the page, the two CPI reports we have received since the May  meeting boosted our estimate of core PCE inflation over the first half of this year  02 percentage point  And as shown in the third and fourth columns, we have  essentially carried that bad news forward despite the slightly greater amount of slack  in the economy and the slightly lower profile of energy prices from here forward     Exhibit 8 investigates whether the staff inflation models have been moving off   track recently  As you know, we consult a broad range of models, but to keep the  discussion manageable, I will report on just two of those specifications  As noted in  the top panel, the first is a backward-looking model that uses lagged inflation to  proxy for underlying or expected inflation  The second specification is a partly  forward-looking model that uses a weighted average of both lagged inflation and  expected inflation as measured in the Survey of Professional Forecasters  The bottom  line from this exercise is that, although both models have certainly made sizable  quarterly forecasting errors of late, neither has been substantially and consistently  surprised by the performance of inflation over the past several years in a way that  would signal an important structural shift     The middle panels report on the performance of the backward-looking model    The left-hand panel shows model simulations jumping off from several different  points in the recent past  As you can see, the simulation trajectories are at least  broadly reminiscent of the actual data  Nonetheless, it is difficult to determine with  the naked eye whether the model errors have been predominantly to one side or the  other  As an aid in that diagnosis, the right-hand panel uses a technique known as the  Kalman filter—a statistical method for allowing a parameter estimate to evolve over   June 28-29, 2006 14 of 177    time in response to new information  Here, I’ve applied the Kalman filter to the  NAIRU  Here’s the guide to interpreting the right-hand panel  If this particular  model agreed with the staff estimate of the NAIRU and if every other aspect of the  model were correctly specified, the Kalman filter estimate would follow the same  trajectory as the staff NAIRU  And, in fact, that is pretty much what you see  Like  the staff estimate of the NAIRU, the Kalman-filter estimate declines noticeably from  the early 1990s through the late 1990s and then flattens out  Turning up the power on  the microscope, you can see that even since the late 1990s the Kalman-filter estimate  has been declining ever so slightly, signifying that inflation has been running just a  little lower during the last eight years or so than the model would have expected  The  source of this surprise is not identified by the technique  It could, in fact, be a  declining NAIRU, but it could equally well reflect a host of other subtle changes in  the economic structure     The bottom panels repeat the experiment for the partly forward-looking model    Again, as you can see on the left, the model misses many of the finer points in the  actual data but seems to capture at least the general drift, with errors roughly balanced  to the high side and the low side  Indeed, as shown to the right, the Kalman filter  estimates in this case have moved essentially sideways since the late 1990s,  indicating that the model has not been disproportionately surprised to one side or the  other     Exhibit 9 turns to the question of whether the recent increases in energy prices   have been seeping into the structure of inflation more broadly and, if so, to what  extent  The top panel focuses on inflation at the producer level  The panel compares  the PPI for finished energy, the red line, with a staff-constructed aggregate of output  price indexes for industries in which energy costs represent a relatively high share of  total costs  If energy-price pass-through were going to show up anywhere, it would  be here  And, as you can see, it does in fact show up  Indeed, this may be the  statistical counterpart of at least some of the anecdotes that you have been hearing  about energy-price increases being passed on to customers     On the other hand, you have also heard us report that pass-through at the   consumer level has become much more muted  The middle panel documents that  claim  For purposes of this exercise, we estimated the models for core PCE price  inflation over rolling fifteen-year sample periods and then asked the models to tell us,  based on those estimates, the predicted effect of a 10 percent increase in the relative  price of energy on core PCE inflation after eight quarters  As you can see, the point  estimates have been lower in recent years     The bullets in the bottom panel summarize our assessment of this evidence    Currently in the judgmental forecast we assume that a permanent 10 percent increase  in the relative price of energy would boost core inflation about 02 percentage point  after eight quarters  This assumption balances estimates derived from shorter sample  periods—like the ones shown in the middle panel—against estimates derived from  longer sample periods that include data from the 1970s and 1980s  Our approach is   June 28-29, 2006 15 of 177    validated by the observation that models that are forced to assume zero energy-price  pass-through have been a little surprised by how high inflation has been in the last  few quarters  On the other hand, models that assume a larger pass-through than the  one we use judgmentally, consistent with the average experience over the past four  decades, have been a little surprised by how low inflation has been  Our judgmental  assumption tucks us neatly in between     Exhibit 10 focuses on the price of owner-occupied housing and its role in the   formulation of monetary policy  As noted in the top box, two main approaches to  measuring the price of owner-occupied housing services have been outlined in the  economics literature  The first approach aims to measure the user cost of owner- occupied housing  As shown in equation 1, the user cost depends on imputed interest  expense, depreciation, and the expected capital gain  For many years, this was  essentially the approach that the BLS took to measuring the price of owner-occupied  housing in the CPI, except that they ignored the expected capital gain component   Increasingly, however, they and others became dissatisfied with the user-cost  approach, partly because it ignored the capital gains component and partly because it  guaranteed that an increase in interest rates would cause an increase in measured  inflation  Finally, in 1983, they shifted to the rental-equivalence approach which, as  summarized in equation 2, aims to measure the rents that owner-occupants would  charge themselves in an assumed arms-length transaction     In a world in which all the relevant variables could be measured perfectly and   house prices were always perfectly aligned with fundamentals, the two approaches  would give the same answer, and equation 3 would hold  That equation shows that  rents can increase even if house prices—denoted as Pt—are decreasing  Indeed, this  would be expected to happen if interest rates—denoted as it—were increasing, all else  being equal  In the real world, rents could also diverge from house prices if the latter  were coming down after a period of overvaluation  Thus, the constellation of facts  that we see today—a decelerating OFHEO price index together with an accelerating  rent index in the CPI—may not be as anomalous as intuition might at first have  suggested     The last two bullets in the box address the role of housing prices in the conduct of   monetary policy  First, a broad range of analysts agree that something like owners’  equivalent rent (OER) is a theoretically appropriate element of a cost-of-living index   But second, and of more direct to concern to you, whether the FOMC should define  its objectives relative to a cost-of-living index that includes OER depends on what  costs you are seeking to minimize in your conduct of monetary policy  For example,  to name just two possibilities, you may believe that the costs of deviations from price  stability derive mainly from the inability of individuals to accurately take account of  inflation in their long-term financial planning, in which case you might want to aim to  stabilize an index of the overall cost of living, including OER  On the other hand,  you may believe that the costs of deviations from price stability have more to do with  the misallocation of productive resources stemming from confusions between real and   June 28-29, 2006 16 of 177    nominal price changes, in which case you might want to focus on something quite  different from a cost-of-living index     The bottom two panels turn to the operational question of more-immediate   consequence—namely, what we expect to happen to rents in the near term  As shown  in the bottom left panel, housing affordability has deteriorated sharply during the past  two years, suggesting that rents may come under considerable further upward  pressure  On the other hand, the rental vacancy rate, shown as the red line, remains  quite high by historical standards, suggesting that any acceleration should be of  moderate proportions  On balance, as shown in the bottom right, we have carried  forward some of the recent higher readings in these categories but have taken the  moderate view, at least for now      You’re entirely right  Both of these models are very partial equilibrium   in their extent  That’s especially true of the backward-looking model, which is strictly a   reduced-form specification that takes no explicit account of inflation expectations  But even the   partly forward-looking model doesn’t have a sort of satellite equation that describes either the   way expectations are formed or the conduct of monetary policy  So, yes, I’m absolutely certain   June 28-29, 2006 24 of 177    that there is an important interaction in these estimated coefficients with the credibility of   monetary policy, among other factors      It’s partly for that reason, as I mentioned in the text, that in our judgmental assumption   we haven’t taken on board these point estimates literally  Our judgmental assumption is that,   with this metric, a 10 percentage point increase in the relative price of energy would boost core   PCE inflation 02 percentage point  So, as you can see, that’s just a little to the high side of the   range   Now, I could produce other models at yet more expense in terms of staff time that   probably would encompass even that  Certainly, the standard errors would well encompass that   02 of the assumption  But that’s just a way of illustrating that we discounted a bit the point   estimates from these models because we don’t think the right message for you to take away is   that, somehow, something has changed in the structure of the economy so that, in your conduct   of monetary policy, you don’t need to respond to changes in energy prices  Part of the reason   that these numbers may be as low as they are is precisely because the Committee, over the past   couple of decades, has responded forcefully to energy-price shocks and kept inflation in check     I suppose that would be a policy choice available to you  In thinking   about how to do that, you’d want to think about the horizon at which you would want to do this    I sliced into probability space at a horizon of eight quarters  I have no idea whether you’d want   to aim to cause these shocks to have zero effect after four quarters or sixteen quarters or when    But I haven’t thought seriously about whether precisely zero is the right effect or not  The effect   June 28-29, 2006 25 of 177    is a lot smaller now than it was three decades ago, and in many of these model specifications it’s   not statistically significantly different from zero     There are many ways to do this accounting  But on one accounting, the   falloff that we have in core inflation in 2007 relative to 2006 is due entirely to the cessation of   the indirect effect of energy prices passing through into the core  If you look at the top right   panel of exhibit 7, you can see that core prices in 2003 got down to a very low rate of increase      A substantial part of the pickup since then by our calculation is due to   the energy-price pass-through  My recollection is that it’s on the order of 06 or 07 percentage   point     Yes   June 28-29, 2006 26 of 177      We’ve had an error in Okun’s law in the levels relationship between the   output gap and the unemployment rate gap  The predominant explanation for what you’re talking   about is that we have the relationship between the output gap and the difference between the   unemployment rate and the NAIRU coming back into normal alignment  Let me try to put that into   English  At the moment we have an output gap that we think is just closed, but we have an   June 28-29, 2006 37 of 177    unemployment rate that is below the NAIRU  That alignment is not normal  Even if the output gap   just stayed where it is right now, we would expect the unemployment rate–NAIRU combination on   average to come back into normal alignment  So we would get some lift in the unemployment rate   just out of that, as that abnormal alignment works out of the system    As I mentioned earlier, the predominant thing that’s causing core PCE to   decelerate next year compared with this year is the flattening out of energy prices  Resource   utilization is a tiny influence at this point    I’m not sure I’d use the word “agnostic”  We think that both the output   gap and the unemployment rate gap are pretty small  Given how flat the Phillips curve is, we think   they’re very slight influences on the performance of inflation over the remainder of this year and   next, and we think other factors are going to loom larger in pushing inflation either up or down from   where it is now  "
7985,2006-08-08,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman Jack Brickhouse, the voice of the   Chicago Cubs for more than thirty years, was more widely known for his knowledge   of baseball than for his command of probability  When a Cub would step into the   batter’s box after an especially long string of hitless trips to the plate, Brickhouse   would invariably declare, “He’s due” Even we kids knew in our minds that Jack   didn’t have it quite right on the probability front, but in our hearts it was enough to   keep us going Some of you may remember that an employment report was released   on the Friday after the June meeting, and that time, we pretty much nailed it  So I   have to admit to having had a “Brickhouse moment” last Friday and wondering   whether we were “due” this time for a real trainwreck  But for a second time in a   row, fate smiled, as it so rarely seems to do on macro forecasters  So at the end of   today’s meeting, I’ll be happy to pass the baton back to Dave Stockton but with a   certain sense of guilt  He’s really due [Laughter]    In fact, as we reported to the Board yesterday, Friday’s labor market report came   in very much as expected  Private nonfarm payrolls increased an estimated 113,000   in July, virtually the same as the 100,000 we had been expecting, and the gains in    August 8, 2006 5 of 158                      each of the previous two months were revised up by a modest 20,000  The  unemployment rate rounded up to 48 percent, but unless we receive additional  evidence of a more-rapid slackening of conditions in the labor market, we’re inclined  to stick with our Greenbook trajectory for the unemployment rate as well  Overall,  we made no material adjustments to our macro forecast in light of this news on the  labor market  Indeed, I would argue that there was less news in the August  Greenbook than met the eye  The quick summary of the August projection is that the  pressures on resource utilization look roughly the same to us as they did at the time of  the June Greenbook, whereas the outlook for inflation looks just a shade worse     Turning first to the issue of resource utilization, the clearest indication of our  thinking in this regard is that the unemployment rate in the August Greenbook never  deviates more than 01 percentage point from our forecast in the June Greenbook  To  put a very fine line on the matter, we nudged the path down ever so slightly over most  of the forecast period, and that call still looks about right to us, even in the wake of  Friday’s report Given an unrevised estimate of the NAIRU, the slightly lower level  of the unemployment rate implies that the pressures on resource utilization are just a  little greater in this Greenbook than they were in the last one   At the same time, we have become a bit more pessimistic about the outlook for  the growth of aggregate demand relative to potential over the next six quarters  This  slightly greater pessimism derives from several considerations  Most notably, starts  and especially permits for the construction of single-family homes came in below our  expectations in June, and we responded by taking our projection for residential  construction down over the entire projection period  In the June Greenbook, our  projection ran above the simulated trajectory from our preferred model for starts, in  recognition of the persistent upside errors that model had been making  Now, for  what it’s worth, our judgmental forecast happens to be in line with the simulation  from that model that jumps off from the last quarter of data  Parenthetically, I might  note that the simulations from that model did not revise greatly over the past six  weeks We still see the contraction in residential construction as moderate by  historical standards but likely to be a little steeper than we anticipated in June  This  time, we forecast that single-family starts will bottom out at an annual rate of  143 million units, bringing the overall decline from last summer’s peak to 18 percent,  still well shy of the declines that were registered in the early 1980s and early 1990s  but starting to be in the same ballpark  We also took on board the growth  implications of the further run-up in oil prices since the June meeting, the somewhat  lower level of household wealth implied by the downward-revised trajectory for  house prices, and the likelihood that greater inventory investment in the second  quarter robbed a smidgen of growth from the future   All that said, the adjustments to our forecast of resource utilization are pretty  marginal  More eye-catching were our revisions to top-line GDP growth, which  averaged 05 percentage point over the second half of this year and 04 percentage  point next year But here, of course, the changes were driven by the adjustments we  made to the supply side of our projection  In its annual revision of the national   August 8, 2006 6 of 158                         income and product accounts, the BEA trimmed the average pace of growth of real  GDP from 2003 through 2005 about 03 percentage point  Because our fundamental  views of the pressures on resource utilization and the rate of inflation were unchanged  by the NIPA revision, the simplest thing for us to do would have been to take  potential GDP down by a like-sized amount, thereby keeping the GDP gap the same  as before As we often do, however, we made a further adjustment to potential in  order to bring the output gap into line with the unemployment rate gap at the end of  last year thereby eliminating a tension between those two “gap” variables that had  become more distracting than informative  As for the forecast, in line with our usual  practice, we overlaid the other factors that I discussed earlier with a 03 percentage  point adjustment for the reduction in the growth of potential, on the theory that  households and businesses anchor their spending plans around their longer-term  prospects for income     A central issue that we wrestled with in this forecast round was whether the  slowdown in growth that we anticipate will materialize to the degree that we expect   The dimensions of that slowdown are significant  Looking ahead six quarters and  behind by the same amount helps smooth through some of the quarter-to-quarter  wiggles We estimate that, over the past six quarters, real GDP growth exceeded  potential growth, on average, about ¾ percentage point at an annual rate; we expect  real GDP growth over the next six quarters to fall short of potential by roughly the  same amount  One key factor driving this swing in our forecast is the combination of  a waning boost to consumption from household net worth and the higher level of  interest rates  The result is reflected in our forecast for the personal saving rate   Again using the same six-quarter window, fore and aft, over the past six quarters, the  saving rate declined more than 2 percentage points; we expect that between now and  the end of 2007 the smaller gains in wealth and higher interest rates will bring the  saving rate back up to 2 percent  Another key factor, especially in the near term, is  the slowdown in residential investment After chipping only about ¼ percentage  point from the growth of real GDP during the first half of this year, residential  investment is expected to slice about ¾ percentage point from the growth of real GDP  over the second half of this year Next year, the drag from this sector should have  diminished but not halted altogether  Finally, we think that the sum of public and  private spending related to last year’s hurricanes will top out sometime this year and  will begin to drift down, accentuating the downdraft from the other factors weighing  on demand  We have assumed that, within the aggregate of total hurricane spending,  government spending and the replacement of destroyed equipment have been  relatively front-loaded, whereas construction activity, we presume, is still ramping up   Turning to inflation, the news is relatively slight but not of the welcome variety   As you know from the Greenbook, we marked up our projection for core PCE  inflation over the second half of this year about ¼ percentage point and nudged the  forecast for next year up a tenth  The largest single factor accounting for these  upward revisions was the further deterioration during the intermeeting period in the  outlook for energy prices; the pass-through of these prices adds about a tenth to our  projection of core inflation during the second half of this year and about half a tenth   August 8, 2006 7 of 158                              next year Owners’ equivalent rent surprised us once again to the upside in the most  recent CPI release, and we extended forward some of that unfavorable news  Other  sources of upward revision, each small but together big enough to generate just a little  upward nudge to our projection, included slightly higher near-term core import prices  and slightly weaker structural productivity growth   As before, we continue to see core inflation stepping down next year compared  with this year, almost entirely because of the flattening out we have projected for  energy and other commodity prices We have the increases in those prices adding  about 04 percentage point to our forecast of core PCE inflation this year, and we  have them adding just 01 percentage point next year  Provided that this year’s  shocks do not get built into inflation expectations going forward, this removal of  upward impetus should be enough to give core inflation a downward tilt  In closing, I  might briefly mention that “speed effects” do not play an important role in shaping  our outlook for inflation The slowdown in growth operates first by bringing output  down from above potential to right in line with potential by sometime during the first  half of next year and then by moving output below potential over the remainder of  2007 For 2007 as a whole, output is so close to potential as to be roughly a neutral  factor for inflation If growth were to proceed at a subpar pace into 2008, the  resulting gap in resource utilization could begin to place some downward pressure on  inflation Karen will now continue our presentation    Broadly, I don’t disagree that the acceleration in consumer prices is   broadly based It is sensitive to sample period  Michael Kiley’s briefing yesterday to the Board   touched on some of the same issues and presented an exhibit that displayed the median CPI as   constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the trimmed mean constructed by the   August 8, 2006 11 of 158                            Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Both of those measures, which are alternative attempts to   capture the central tendency of inflation rates, have also moved up notably, most of all from   2003 I guess I would remind you that we were a little puzzled as to why inflation was as low as   it was in 2003 It fell below our model simulations  We have never been able to come up with a   fully satisfactory explanation for why it got as low as it did  So if you use 2003 as your base for   comparison with the present, the trend looks very worrisome  If you smooth through that—I   don’t know that “anomaly” is the right word—unexplained dip in 2003, you are left with a trend   that by any of these measures has moved up  The particular comparison that we chose to   highlight yesterday in the briefing to the Board emphasized the acceleration in housing services,   but other components have played a role as well  We also think that the energy-price pass-  through into core has played a broadly diffuse role in giving some upward impetus to core   inflation    Now that I’ve had a chance to take a breath—another factor that   obviously is critical is the behavior of inflation expectations  As you know, the Survey of   Professional Forecasters long-term measure has been flat, immovable, at 2½ percent  The   University of Michigan survey—which we show in the Greenbook table back to 2004—was at   28 percent, on the median measure, in the second half of 2004, and it is at 29 percent in June   and July of this year So long-term inflation expectations have really been remarkably well   contained Shorter-term inflation expectations have fluctuated more with changes in overall   consumer prices, and they are up a couple of tenths from the end of 2004  But there hasn’t been   a lot of upward drift in measures of inflation expectations    So, they revised down The implication of the NIPA revision is that,   according to the latest estimates, those markups are a little lower than they were before  They   are still noticeably above their historical averages  In the judgmental forecast, we have never   placed an enormous amount of weight on those markup measures, and perhaps the chain of   events during this intermeeting period illustrates why  Our FRB/US model does put a lot of   weight on those markups, and it revised up its inflation projection 06 percentage point,   something like that  Now it’s within spitting distance of the judgmental forecast   First of all, we have had a hard time getting those markups to enter reliably or robustly   into an econometric equation  Second, we’ve been leery of the kind of revisions that took place   in this year’s NIPA revision We’ve certainly regarded them with some nervousness and refer to   them as presenting a downside risk to inflation, if those profit margins should compress  But I’m   not entirely sure how to respond to your question as to whether we should put less weight on   them since we haven’t put an enormous amount of weight on them in our judgmental projection   to date They are a secondary determinant of our inflation outlook in the judgmental projection    As I say, to the extent that you were prepared to put some weight on them before and to see them   as high before, you would still see them as high now, though less so    Again, the statistical analysis is very frustrating  It’s hard to get that   variable to enter reliably, particularly with real-time data that are susceptible to the kind of   revisions that we have seen  We do put a nod in our inflation forecast to the acceleration in   August 8, 2006 14 of 158                         structural productivity, which is related to unit labor costs, but unit labor costs themselves have   likewise not played a prominent role in our judgmental forecast    The predominant factor in generating those strikingly low employment   gains is our projection for trend labor force participation over the projection period  With the   aging of the workforce, we think that the trend is now turning decidedly downward, not for   cyclical reasons, not because the labor market presents atypically unappealing job opportunities,   but because an increasing share of the population is shifting into age groups that have historically   exhibited lower labor force participation rates  My recollection is that the difference between a   flat participation rate and a declining participation rate—and I’ll look it up here if I can find it   fast enough for you—is on the order of about 40,000 jobs per month  We have a neutral private   payroll gain for the remainder of this year in the neighborhood of about 90,000 jobs  If the   participation rate were to remain flat, 20,000 to 25,000 jobs would be added to our trend   estimate  We think that the decline in labor force participation is taking about 03 percentage   point off the growth of hours over the projection period  Now, if that were to flatten out, if we   simply have the trend wrong, then that would play through the macro forecast—I’m going to do   something dangerous here and think out loud—a lot like the adjustment to potential GDP that we   just made following the NIPA revision  In essence, a flat participation rate would mean that   trend hours growth is that much faster and that trend aggregate demand 03 percentage point   faster could be sustained without generating additional inflation pressures    Let me take those concerns in turn  First, with regard to the speed of   adjustment of consumption to potential GDP—perhaps it is ironic, but our assumption is that we are   the most ignorant ones in this little morality play; that households and businesses have been aware   of the slower growth of potential GDP; and that, as far as households and businesses are concerned,   what goes on in the basement of the BEA is utterly without consequence  You can see that as well,   for example, in our leaving the stock market projection unrevised  Implicit in the way we have   reacted to the news from the BEA is that households and businesses knew of the slower trajectory    August 8, 2006 18 of 158                                                          Investors knew of the slower trajectory for potential GDP  It was we who were off in previously   assuming an erroneously steep upward trend for potential GDP  It does change the error pattern   The pattern of errors over history is changed a bit, and at the margin, that sends us into the   projection period with slightly different dynamics; but those are very small effects  (Sandy is   alerting me that an important piece of news that we received was the weakness of disposable   income growth in the second quarter)    Yes; indeed, faster than spending, and that’s how we generate the upward   motion of the personal saving rate    Now, let’s see  I can’t read my own notes  The second question is?    Oh, have we seen anything like this outside of a recession?  I don’t know   the answer to that  I would mention, however, how strong residential investment was through the   recession and how well sustained it was and how we all remarked on the strength with which that   sector persisted through that period of very low interest rates  Every business cycle is different from   every other one, but this one certainly has its unique feature, which is the uncharacteristic strength   of residential investment through the recession period, and we have that coming off now   Third, you asked about growth in real compensation or real wages  We have some   acceleration in our projection  We expect it to occur  We expect it to be consistent with a   moderating profile of price inflation  We do see labor’s share of income as lower now than it will   August 8, 2006 19 of 158                                               be in some equilibrium point in the future, so we expect that aspect of national income to shift in its   composition    Slowly     May I just briefly mention the staff view?  Our research on structural labor   force participation is laid out in a Brookings paper that is just about due for release by folks who are   our labor specialists  That paper sets out in considerable detail our work in this area    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just very briefly, these data came in, in most   respects, pretty close to our expectation  I would note that the productivity figures for the second   quarter are built on the output data that were incorporated in last week’s advance GDP number  We   expect nonfarm business productivity in the second quarter to be revised up  Based on information   available today, it would be revised up 08 percentage point, to 19 percent  Probably because of   some fluctuations in hours, the productivity number in Q1 is 03 percentage point stronger than we   had expected  In Q2, it’s 03 percentage point weaker  On balance, the profile there looks much as   we had expected  Compensation per hour is 05 percentage point stronger in Q1 than we had   projected and right on our Greenbook projection in Q2  "
8010,2006-09-20,"  The behavior of construction that we are projecting is unusual, but the   predicate is also unusual in that we did go through a mild recession but with substantially no   attenuation in the pace of construction  So it is an unusual path that we followed to get here, and in   our baseline forecast, it is an unusual path that we follow going forward  "
8057,2006-12-12,  The spending side of the national income and product accounts is really   the unspoken implication     
8156,2007-06-27,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My colleagues and I will be  referring to the packet entitled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook”   Your first exhibit summarizes our economic forecast  As shown in the top  panels, we have edged up our forecast for the growth of real GDP this year  and next  Taken by itself, the increase in interest rates that Bill Dudley  mentioned was a negative for our growth outlook, but it was outweighed by a  variety of other factors, including the higher stock market, the upward  revision to wages and salaries, and the more favorable composition of real  growth during the first half of this year  As shown in the middle pair of                                                     2 Material used by Mr Wilcox, Ms Liang, and Mr Leahy is appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   June 27-28, 2007 13 of 261    panels, we have trimmed our forecast of the unemployment rate—partly in  response to the latest readings on this series and partly in light of the slightly  stronger outlook for real output—and we now have it ending 2008 just below  5 percent, our estimate of the natural rate  As shown in the bottom right  panel, core PCE inflation in the current quarter appears to be running at an  annual rate of 14 percent, considerably less than the 22 percent we expected  as of the May Greenbook  However, as I will discuss later in more detail, we  have interpreted most of that good news as likely to prove transitory and so  have taken down our forecast for core inflation over the projection period only  01 percentage point       Exhibit 2 turns to the market for single-family housing  The yellow   stripes in the top left panel mark major downturns in single-family housing  starts since 1970  As can be seen in the box to the right, the current  contraction now ranks among these major episodes in terms of magnitude  It  differs importantly from previous ones, however, in terms of its origins  because this one did not result from a round of monetary tightening aimed at  taking economic activity down to bring inflation under control  That  difference has important implications for the likely contour of the recovery   In earlier episodes, once the desired reduction in inflation appeared to be in  train, the policy rate was brought back down and longer-term interest rates  often came down as well  But this time, as shown in the middle left panel,  with policy assumed to hold at its current position, we are not banking on any  reduction in mortgage interest rates from here forward, suggesting that the  housing recovery may be more subdued than it often has been in the past   One factor that poses some downside risk is the overhang of unsold homes,  shown in the middle right panel  Months’ supply remains at a very high level   As we illustrated in one of the alternative simulations in the Greenbook, the  contraction in the housing sector could be a good deal deeper than the one in  our baseline if builders decide to bring inventories down more quickly   Another factor that will be important in shaping the recovery is the pace of  sales, shown in the bottom left panel  In light of the tighter conditions in the  subprime loan market and the recent backup in rates, we have sales moving a  little lower over the next few months but then stabilizing and beginning to  edge up around the turn of the year  The data on both new and existing home  sales that were released earlier this week were consistent with our Greenbook  forecast  I should also note the situation with regard to the price of single- family housing  As you know, home prices have decelerated greatly, and over  the projection period, we have them remaining close to their current levels on  a national-average basis  But our ability to judge the alignment of prices with  fundamentals is limited, to say the least, and a substantial move downward is  certainly possible  The bottom right panel illustrates that risk by presenting  the estimated valuation error according to the very simple model that we  showed you two years ago in our special presentation on housing  To be sure,  other models deliver different answers, but this one judges the misalignment  of the price-rent ratio to be historically large  If prices break more sharply   June 27-28, 2007 14 of 261    because builders decide to clear out inventories more quickly, construction  activity might well recover faster, even as other consumer spending is crimped  by the damage to household balance sheets  Which effect would predominate  in terms of overall aggregate demand is not entirely clear     Exhibit 3 focuses on business fixed investment  As shown in the top left   panel, sales of medium and heavy trucks have more or less fallen off a cliff  thus far this year, reflecting the influence of new EPA regulations that took  effect on January 1, and this has been an important factor holding down  overall equipment spending  We think that this dynamic should be coming to  a close over the next few months and are looking for truck purchases to begin  trending up sometime during the second half of this year  As shown in the top  right panel, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods hit an air pocket  around the turn of the year, apparently driven down in part by the trials of the  motor vehicle and construction industries  However, the orders and shipments  data for March and April—the latest that were available to us when we were  putting together the Greenbook, encouraged us to think that a rebound of at  least modest proportions is in train, and this morning’s release came in close  to our Greenbook expectations  Moreover, surveys of business conditions,  including the two orders-based indexes shown in the middle left panel,  suggest that businesses concur that the situation has brightened somewhat in  the past few months  As shown in the first line of the middle right panel, we  are projecting that, over the next six quarters, equipment investment will post  respectable—if unspectacular—increases  Two of the variables conditioning  that view appear at the bottom of the page  As shown on the left, we expect  real business output to grow a little more slowly over the forecast period than  in the preceding few years, suggesting—all else being equal—somewhat more  modest growth in investment than in earlier years  Similarly, as shown on the  right, we expect the user cost of capital for high-tech equipment, the red line,  to continue to decline at about the average pace of the past few years, and we  expect the user cost for non-high-tech equipment, the black line, to be about  unchanged, much as it has been over the past year and a half  All in all, these  factors point to a steady outlook for business investment     Exhibit 4 takes a slightly longer term perspective on the inflation outlook   by comparing our current projection to the one that we had in the January  Greenbook—the last time you submitted projections for a Monetary Policy  Report  As shown in the top left panel, since January we have revised up our  near-term forecast for overall PCE price inflation but not our longer-term  outlook  Part of the near-term revision is due to faster food price inflation— the top right panel—which in turn reflects, among other things, the greater  pressure that ethanol production has placed not only on the price of corn but  also the prices of other foods that are produced using corn as an input, such as  beef, dairy, and poultry  By the end of this year, though, we assume that the  livestock and poultry sectors have adjusted to the higher level of corn prices,  so we have food prices coming back in line with core inflation  Another part   June 27-28, 2007 15 of 261    of the upward surprise in overall PCE inflation is due to a steeper climb in  consumer energy prices—the middle left panel—reflecting crude oil prices  that have been running about $10 per barrel above our January assumption  and refinery outages that have kept utilization below typical levels  But as  with food, we have energy price increases moderating greatly over the  projection period       Excluding food and energy—the middle right panel—core PCE price   inflation has looked a little tamer thus far this year than we expected in  January  Nonetheless, our projection for core inflation next year is unrevised,  on net, relative to the January Greenbook  The absence of any net revision  since January reflects a mix of considerations  For one thing, not all the news  related to inflation has been good; both import and—as I just noted—energy  prices have been running higher than we expected and thus have been  generating more upward pressure on inflation than we had foreseen  For  another, some of the recent good news seems likely to prove relatively short- lived  For example, as shown in the bottom left panel, nonmarket-based  prices, which account for about 20 percent of the core index, have been rising  less quickly thus far this year than we expected in January  Historically,  however, fluctuations in nonmarket prices have not conveyed much  information about the future behavior of this series, so we have trimmed our  projection for the increase in this component of prices over the second half of  this year by only a tenth  As shown to the right, both tenants’ rent—the black  line—and owners’ equivalent rent, or OER—the red line—have decelerated  lately but, as shown by the bars at the bottom of the panel, OER has slowed by  noticeably more  Historically, differences of this magnitude have not  persisted long—see, for example, the bulge that emerged and then disappeared  in 2003; moreover, these divergences have tended to be resolved in favor of  tenants’ rent  Accordingly, we expect the increases in OER over the  projection period to look more like the recent increases in tenants’ rent rather  than the other way around  In the end, these influences happen to roughly  offset one another, leaving our core inflation projection for next year  unchanged from January     Exhibit 5 focuses on the recent behavior of inflation expectations and, as   noted in the top left panel, asks whether those expectations have moved above  levels that were typical from mid-1996 through mid-2004—a period when  actual core PCE inflation was mostly between 1 percent and 2 percent  As  noted in the last bullet in the box, the answer varies by series  In the next  three panels, I use shaded bands to indicate levels of each series that were  typical during the eight-year reference period—the darker bands marking the  middle 50 percent of the series’ observations and the lighter bands marking  the middle 80 percent of the observations  As shown in the top right panel,  the short-term expectations measure from the Michigan survey of households  has indeed been tending to run above the levels that were typical of the earlier  period  Roughly, those higher readings seem to reflect the steep climb in   June 27-28, 2007 16 of 261    energy prices over the past few years  In contrast, as shown in the middle left  panel, longer-term inflation expectations from that survey have remained  remarkably stable  They have drifted slightly higher relative to the levels that  were typical during the reference period, but even so the latest reading sits just  at the edge of its 50 percent band  The middle right panel shows a measure of  short-term inflation expectations from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of  Professional Forecasters; the most recent reading on this series is near the  center of its 50 percent band  As you know, the measure of ten-year  expectations from the SPF, not shown, has mostly been stuck at 25 percent  since 1998 and was slightly below that in both the first and the second  quarters of this year  Unfortunately, the TIPS market is too young to allow an  apples-to-apples comparison on the basis used here  On the whole, however,  we interpret the evidence as suggesting that inflation expectations have been  quite stable recently  We assume that they will remain so over the projection  period and thus will not be an important influence on the inflation contour this  year and next  The bottom left panel plots our projection of the  unemployment rate and our estimate of the NAIRU  We expect the small  amount of upward pressure currently being generated from this source to be  relieved over the projection period as the unemployment rate drifts up and  resource utilization eases  The bottom right panel summarizes our inflation  outlook  Relative to the May Greenbook, our forecast for core PCE inflation  in 2007 as a whole is down 03 percentage point; as I noted earlier, our  forecast for the second half of this year and for next year is down only a tenth   Nellie will continue our presentation      I would say that the answer differs by series, so that if you tend   to favor the short-term Michigan series shown in the top right, you might get a more   alarming picture  But, for example, the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ ten-year-  June 27-28, 2007 25 of 261    ahead series is all the way at the other end of the spectrum, having been essentially rock   solid at 25 percent, and these other series fall somewhere in between  Obviously, this   analysis is extraordinarily simple and doesn’t take into account other factors that may   have been at work over that eight-year reference period that are not operating now  But   the hope was that, on a very rough and ready basis, this might be broadly indicative and   that an eight-year period might capture some variation in other factors that were   influencing inflation    I think we view the current constellation of expectations   measures as not providing much impetus either upward or downward on inflation—it is   just not going to be an important factor shaping the contour of inflation in our view    Well, there is a picture in the lower right panel of chart 1 in the   Bluebook    Yes, that is right    In my conversations with some of the TIPS analysts on our staff,   they suggested, as consistent with your statement, that 2003 was, roughly speaking, the   period in their view in which the TIPS market emerged into the modern era with some   tighter pricing    Yes      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The BEA published this morning   their so-called final estimate of GDP for the first quarter  Top line came in slightly lower   than we had been expecting in the Greenbook—07 percent compared with the 1 percent   that we had been expecting  There were small misses in a smattering of categories,   including equipment and software investment, net exports, and inventories  Our snap   reading, though, is that this release will have little, if any, implication for our outlook    What we lost in the first quarter in inventories, for example, we might be inclined to   regain in the second quarter in our projection  So we think that our projection for real   activity will not change as a consequence of this release  We did get the upward revision   to core PCE prices that we had been expecting on the basis of the revision to the PPI for   medical services  Core PPI was revised up from 22 to 24 percent    Excuse me  The core PCE price index for the first quarter was   revised up, exactly as we had been expecting on the basis of the PPI revision  Thank you  "
8180,2007-08-07,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In putting together the Greenbook  forecast for this meeting, we adjusted our outlook in five ways in response to the  developments that Bill Dudley has just described  First and foremost in terms of its  implications for real activity, we took on board the implications of the decline in the  value of equities since the June Greenbook  Second, we adjusted our home-price  forecast down a notch, both in response to slightly disappointing indicators of home- price appreciation during the second quarter and in recognition of the bleaker  conditions in housing markets more generally, including the developments in the  subprime mortgage market  In all, we took the level of home prices down 1½ percent  by the end of 2008, with about one-third of that amount representing our response to  the incoming indicators and two-thirds reflecting the other considerations  In  combination and allowing for some relatively minor offsets, the reduction in equity  values and home prices took about $1 trillion off the balance sheet of the household  sector and weakened our outlook for consumer spending through the usual wealth- effect channels      Third, we further adjusted our forecast of real PCE to allow for a direct effect of   interest-rate resets  We estimate that 47 million variable-rate subprime loans are  scheduled to undergo interest-rate resets over the next year and a half  If all these  resets were to take full effect, they would result in extra interest payments cumulating   August 7, 2007 18 of 136    to about $12 billion between now and the end of 2008  For several reasons, however,  we think that $12 billion figure represents a loose upper bound on the likely effect of  resets on consumption spending  For example, even in today’s relatively more hostile  financial environment, some households will succeed in refinancing into a prime  mortgage with a lower rate; others will sell their property and become renters rather  than bear the additional debt service payments; and some who remain in their homes  with no refinancing will have the financial wherewithal to shield their spending from  a dollar-for-dollar reduction in response to the increase in debt service payments  In  light of these considerations, we took consumer spending down by half the amount of  the reset-induced payments      Fourth, we adjusted down our forecast for new-home sales to allow for the   unusual restraint that the tightening in mortgage-borrowing conditions since the last  Greenbook will likely impose on the demand for new homes  The adjustment we  made this time followed similar downward revisions in March and June; together,  these three revisions were calibrated to unwind the boost to mortgage originations  that we think was provided by nonprime lending in 2005 and 2006  Overall, we took  the trajectory of new-home sales down 6 percent this round—half in response to the  mortgage developments and half in response to the disappointing pace of sales data  for June  Having cut the pace of sales, we then also took down the rate of new  construction in the forecast to keep inventories of unsold new homes from bulging  too much further     Finally, we trimmed our forecast for investment in equipment and software a bit   on the theory that the increase in spreads that investment-grade and especially non- investment-grade firms now are facing might reflect greater uncertainty in the  business climate and that they might respond to that uncertainty by being a little more  reluctant to invest  To be sure, the econometric evidence supporting this hypothesis  is not rock solid, but it did strike us as suggestive enough to warrant a modest  adjustment      All told, these responses to the more hostile financial climate took about   ¼ percentage point off our forecast for the growth of real GDP over the second half  of this year and next, with about half of that amount reflecting the changes working  through the traditional wealth channel and the remainder representing the combined  influence of the three less traditional adjustments     Could the implications of the financial situation for the real economy be even   worse than we have built into the baseline?  You bet  I almost invariably resist the  temptation to declare that uncertainty about the real economy is greater than usual,  but the current situation strikes me as the exception that proves the rule  In the  “Alternative Scenarios” section of the Greenbook, we sketched three situations in  which economic activity would be markedly weaker than in the baseline  In the first,  residential investment drops 10 percent relative to baseline by the middle of next  year, and home prices drop a total of 20 percent in nominal terms over the next year  and a half—unprecedented in modern times but not outside the realm of possibility,   August 7, 2007 19 of 136    as it would merely return the valuation of the housing stock to the level predicted by  one of the house-price models that we track  The second scenario adds a  deterioration in consumer sentiment, giving the meltdown in the housing sector an  additional vehicle for spilling over into consumer spending more generally  In both  of these scenarios, financial conditions deteriorate relative to baseline but only to the  extent judged “normal” by the model in light of the weaker overall economy  The  third scenario adds a further and more virulent deterioration in financial conditions,  with a 10 percent decline in equity values and a 100 basis point widening in the  spread on investment-grade securities  In the third scenario, we nearly—though not  quite—succeed in generating a recession despite a substantial easing of monetary  policy     On the other hand, could it be better?  A key objective in putting together this   forecast has been to ensure that risk lies on both sides of the baseline forecast  For  example, yesterday’s market rebound is a reminder that stranger things have  happened than for calm to break out in financial markets  One cannot rule out that,  six months or a year from now, we will look back on this episode much as we look  back on the flare-up in February of this year or as we look back on the stock-market  break in 1987, with a sense of surprise that the financial event did not leave a greater  imprint on the real economy  Even if the financial markets do not heal themselves  quickly, consumers may prove more willing to postpone the increase in the saving  rate that we have assumed in the baseline; businesses may aim to build the investment  share of GDP back much closer to the levels that it attained in the late 1990s; and  home sales may recover more quickly than we have assumed     A second challenge that we faced in putting the forecast together—more routine   than the task of factoring in the implications of financial-market developments—was  to take account of the annual revision to the national income and product accounts   As you know, the BEA revised down the growth of real GDP ⅓ percentage point, on  average, in 2004, 2005, and 2006  Conveniently, this time around, the BEA made  only very small adjustments to their estimates of PCE inflation  Because the NIPA  revision gave us no new reason to revise our previous assessment of the pressures in  product markets, we took our estimate of potential output down in line with actual  GDP, thereby maintaining the gap between the two at its previous level as of the end  of 2006  In line with our custom in years past, we carried the revision to the growth  of potential through into the forecast period  As a result, we now have potential  output increasing 2¼ percent in both 2007 and 2008      A virtue of the approach that we have taken in revising the supply side of the   projection is that it leaves most of the variables you care about undisturbed  Thanks  to the BEA, inflation is essentially unrevised  Because we moved potential down in  line with actual, the GDP gap and the unemployment rate trajectories are also  essentially unrevised  And with real interest rates and the GDP gap about the same as  before, r* is also roughly unrevised  In short, if you make your policy decisions  based on expected inflation and expected resource utilization, your policy choices  after the revision should be about the same now as they were before the revision,   August 7, 2007 20 of 136    provided that you see the prospects for resource utilization as roughly the same now  as they were before the revision  The one variable that is different, of course, in the  projection as well as in history, is the growth rate of real GDP  But a conventional  analysis would view the revision to that variable as something you simply have to  accept—not something you can do anything about     In a statement that will strike you as reminiscent of “other than that, Mrs   Lincoln…,” I would summarize the nonfinancial news that we received during the  intermeeting period as having been remarkably consistent with our June projection   On the downside, the most notable development, to be sure, was in home sales, both  new and existing, confirming the recent step-down in housing demand  Pending  home sales—our most reliable near-term indicator of existing-home sales— rebounded in June, but to a level that is still well below its average in the first quarter   Even so, were it not for the substantial disruption on the lending side, the portrait of  the housing sector that we would be reporting to you today would be substantially the  same as the one we presented in June  Elsewhere, the data on orders and shipments  of nondefense capital goods in June were a little softer than we had expected  The  slowdown in light-vehicle sales in July to 152 million units at an annual rate raises a  warning flag, but we are inclined at this point to interpret that result as a temporary  pause rather than a harbinger of much weaker spending ahead  All that said, last  Friday’s employment report once again showed a little more momentum in hiring  than we had expected, and initial claims for unemployment insurance in the two  weeks since the July survey week have remained low, giving no sign of any material  deterioration in labor-market conditions  The increase in the unemployment rate to  46 percent in July was not a surprise given the moderate pace of growth, on average,  thus far this year  Moreover, the indicators that we have in hand put manufacturing  IP on track to post a solid increase in July  All told, the real economy seems to have  entered the period of intense financial-market turbulence with, if anything, a little  more momentum than we would have projected at the time of the June meeting     On the inflation front, the picture looks very much the same as it did at the time of   the June Greenbook  We still see the bulk of the improvement in core PCE inflation  during the second quarter as likely to prove transitory  In a nod to the relatively  favorable recent monthly readings, we trimmed our forecast for the second half of this  year by 01 percentage point despite a number of factors that could put slightly  greater upward pressure on inflation, including the slower pace of structural  productivity growth, the higher level of commodity prices, and the uptick of a tenth in  the Michigan measure of long-term inflation expectations  Next year, as energy  prices turn down slightly, inflation expectations remain well contained, and pressures  on resource utilization ease slightly, we continue to have core inflation edging down  to a rate of 2 percent; and we have top-line inflation dipping slightly below the core  rate to 18 percent for the year as a whole, before coming back up in line with the core  over the next two years  Karen will now continue our presentation      It relies on a variety of considerations, but ultimately I would say it relies   on inflation performance  One way that we have of assessing whether our gauges of resource   utilization are moving off track is to look back and see whether our inflation models that incorporate   those measures of resource utilization are overpredicting or underpredicting  It’s an imperfect   mechanism, to be sure, because the impulse from resource utilization to inflation is very weak;   therefore, an error in estimation on our part of the pressures on resource utilization would show up   in a discrepancy in the inflation projection that could easily be lost in the noise  But that’s probably   the main approach that we take to attempting to gauge ultimately whether or not we’re off base  In   putting together our assessment of the output gap, we also attempt to maintain some alignment of   that measure with the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate or the NAIRU  Our   analysis of the NAIRU factors in as well a more fundamental inspection of things like demographic   influences, including disability rates and the age composition of the population  So there is an effort   August 7, 2007 26 of 136    to bring to bear an independent analysis of some of the economic determinants that might be   moving the NAIRU up or down    I would make two remarks regarding that  First, quantitatively, in fact, the   output gap doesn’t play a very large role in shifting our projection of inflation  If one does a sort of   retrospective decomposition of the factors that were generating inflation over the past ten, fifteen, or   twenty years, during the period of the great moderation, gaps in resource utilization are at most a   modest contributor to the variance in inflation  Econometrically speaking, a very important   determinant of inflation variability is just shocks that push inflation and that our model has no ready   attribution for  So they are not directly attributable to relative energy price movements, relative   import prices, resource utilization, or inflation expectations, but just stuff happening that moves   inflation around  So your point is correct in principle, but quantitatively, I think it has a very modest   influence on our current projection  Second, we enforce a good deal of smoothness so that we are   not, by any means, soaking up the residual in the inflation equation that emerges in one period by   saying, “Oh, that must have reflected a variation in potential output growth” in order to drive the   residual to zero  We are allowing that residual to persist and to inform our assessment of potential   output growth only over time and with an accumulation of evidence  "
8514,2008-08-05,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In putting together the economic  outlook for the current Greenbook, we confronted three main changes in  circumstances relative to the situation as it stood in June  First, the labor market  looked distinctly weaker than we had anticipated  In the employment report that was  released in early July, payroll employment declined by more in June than we had  been expecting, and the unemployment rate held at 5½ percent rather than dropping  back as we had anticipated, following the increase of 05 percentage point in the  previous month  The fraction of the labor force working part time for economic  reasons had moved up sharply, and claims for unemployment insurance were trending  up  The second major change in circumstance that we confronted was a second- quarter increase in real GDP that apparently continued to outpace our expectations   In last Wednesday’s Greenbook, we projected growth at an annual rate of 27 percent  in the second quarter, 1 percentage point stronger than in the June Greenbook  At  that pace, GDP growth would have slightly exceeded our estimate of the rate of  growth of potential output  The third major change was a financial sector that looked  more hostile to economic activity, on balance, than at the time of the last meeting  despite the improvement during the second half of the intermeeting period that Bill  Dudley has just described  When we put the Greenbook to bed, the stock market was  about 7 percent lower than we had expected as of June, a variety of spreads remained  wide or had widened further since the previous Greenbook, and concerns had been  heightened about some key institutions  In addition, the latest reading from the  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey pointed to a remarkably widespread continued  tightening of terms and standards for both households and businesses     These three factors—a weaker labor market, apparently stronger aggregate   demand, and a more hostile financial environment—did not easily fit together  To   August 5, 2008 15 of 145    resolve the situation, we began by ruling in favor of the profile presented by the labor  market and heavily discounting the greater vigor being signaled by the spending  indicators  In our judgment, the story being told by the labor market seemed by far  the more credible one, what with housing prices continuing to decline at a rapid pace,  consumer sentiment dropping into sub-basement levels, energy prices remaining high  even after their recent partial reversal, loan officers reporting a pervasive tightening  of credit terms and standards, and other measures of financial stress flashing at least  amber  Moreover, while quarter-to-quarter discrepancies between GDP and IP are  commonplace, the nearly 4 percent drop in manufacturing IP during the second  quarter fueled our skepticism that the economy was on a fundamentally sound  footing       As you know, for several Greenbooks our GDP projection has been substantially   weaker than it would have been if we had kept in line with the advice from our  forecasting models  We were motivated to impose this judgmental weakness partly in  recognition of the possibility that we might be entering a recession, and recessions are  times when spending tends to fall short of the level that would be indicated by the  fundamentals  We also were motivated by the restraint that we think financial  markets are imposing on real activity and which our models are ill-equipped to  capture  In the current projection, we had to modify these assumptions in light of the  changed circumstances  In effect, we interpreted the greater-than-expected strength  of real GDP during the second quarter as reflecting an error of timing with respect to  the judgmental weakness that we had built into the forecast but not a misjudgment  about the overall magnitude of that weakness       Implementing that interpretation involved three steps  First, we responded to the   unexpected strength in first-half GDP growth by shifting some judgmental weakness  into the second half  Second, we deepened the overall amount of restraint that we  imposed in light of the less favorable financial climate  Third, we stretched out the  period of financial recuperation  Whereas previously we had financial market  conditions essentially returning to normal by the middle of next year, in this  projection we have the period of recuperation extending into 2010  These  adjustments left our projection for real GDP growth 01 percentage point lower over  the second half of this year and 02 lower next year, despite the offsets from lower oil  prices and a slightly greater dose of fiscal stimulus, reflecting the introduction of  extended unemployment insurance benefits     For the most part, the avalanche of information that we received since putting out   the Greenbook last Wednesday has corroborated our projection  This year’s revision  of the national income and product accounts threw us no real curve balls  (Sorry for  the baseball analogy)  [Laughter]  The growth of real GDP was revised down by an  average of 02 percentage point per year  The revisions to the PCE price indexes,  both core and total, were very slight  While the BEA has given us some homework to  do between now and the September meeting in folding these data into our thinking,  any adjustments that we might be prompted to make, including to the supply side of  our forecast, are likely to be slight   August 5, 2008 16 of 145      On the face of it, the advance estimate of real GDP growth in the second quarter   of this year seemed to hold a bigger surprise  The BEA’s estimate, at 19 percent,  came in ¾ percentage point below our estimate in the Greenbook  However, as best  as we can tell—based on still-incomplete information—the miss was attributable to  lower estimates by the BEA of farm inventory investment and of value added in the  trading of used motor vehicles  Our preliminary reading is that neither of these errors  carries any signal for the forward momentum of the economy moving into the second  half of the year  Friday’s employment report was likewise mercifully well behaved— at least in the narrow sense of conforming to our expectation  Private payroll  employment declined an estimated 76,000 in July; together with small downward  revisions to May and June, that left the level of employment in July very close to our  forecast  In addition, the unemployment rate came in only a few basis points higher  than we had expected     The only real news since Greenbook publication came from the motor vehicle   manufacturers  On Friday, they reported that sales of light vehicles in July were at an  annual pace of 125 million units, much weaker than our already weak forecast of  133 million units  Moreover, they knocked their assembly schedules for the third  quarter down from 94 million units to 89 million units  Taking their schedules on  board would slice another ½ percentage point from our estimate of GDP growth in  the third quarter  The manufacturers have already announced increases in incentives,  but it remains to be seen how vigorously consumers will respond in the current  environment and how great the financial wherewithal of the manufacturers will prove  to be to sustain such moves  In any event, the drop in sales and production is  certainly large enough to give renewed urgency to the question as to whether a  broader retrenchment in spending might be in train       Turning to the inflation side of the projection, our forecast for core PCE prices   over the remainder of this year is nearly unchanged from the June Greenbook  We  still have core inflation stepping up from a little more than 2 percent during the first  half of this year to a little more than 2½ percent in the second half, as the surge in  prices for imports, energy, and other commodities passes through to retail prices and  as some components that saw unusually low readings earlier in the year accelerate to  a more normal rate of increase  Next year, with the pressures from import, energy,  and commodity prices diminishing and with slack in resource utilization becoming a  little greater, we have core inflation dropping back to 2¼ percent  The projection for  next year is also the same as in the June Greenbook, as the influences from lower  energy prices and slightly greater economic slack are roughly offset by the pass- through of higher import prices     The more dramatic changes in our inflation outlook came in the noncore pieces    Not surprisingly, the plunge in oil prices since the June meeting caused us to whack  our forecast for retail energy price inflation over the second half of this year  For  next year, however, we marked up PCE energy price inflation a little, partly because  natural gas futures prices have a more positive tilt than they did before and partly   August 5, 2008 17 of 145    because gasoline margins will still have some recovering to do  At the same time, we  have become more pessimistic about the outlook for food price inflation  The CPI for  food in June came in at 08 percent, much higher than our forecast of 03 percent   Because we have mostly been surprised to the upside thus far this year, we decided to  move closer to our food price model, which has been calling for larger increases than  we were previously willing to write down  The net result, as you saw in the  Greenbook, is an outlook with faster food price inflation despite the fact that futures  curves for both livestock and crops have moved down since the last meeting  All  told, we now have headline PCE inflation running at an average annual pace of  3½ percent over the second half of this year, nearly 1 percentage point slower than in  the June Greenbook  For next year, we have marked up total PCE inflation by a few  tenths in light of our reassessment of the food price situation and the slightly greater  rise in energy prices that we now see next year     With regard to the risks in the outlook, my sense is that the downside risks to   economic activity have increased since the time of the June Greenbook  That view is  informed by two main factors  First, while we have factored the more unsettled  nature of the financial environment into our baseline outlook, the situation seems  more fragile than before, and the implications for real activity of a sharp deterioration  in financial conditions could be quite large  The first alternative scenario that we  presented in the Greenbook—entitled “severe financial stress”—updates our periodic  attempt to assemble an integrated macroeconomic and financial scenario  Second, the  deterioration in the motor vehicles sector now, to my eye, more convincingly takes on  the profile of what we usually see in the course of a typical recession  During the  intermeeting period, we will be on high alert for evidence suggesting that the  weakness in vehicle sales is a harbinger of a broader shortfall in consumer spending     As for inflation, the upside risks have, in my view, diminished somewhat  Again,   two factors inform this assessment  First, the downtick in the long-term inflation  expectations measured in the Reuters/Michigan survey is somewhat reassuring   Second, the drop in oil prices is a welcome relief from the steady drumbeat of bad  news from that sector and suggests a somewhat diminished probability that  persistently high topline inflation will be reflected in a more serious erosion of  household expectations, with all the adverse implications for monetary policy that  would entail  To be sure, even with those favorable developments, upside risks  remain  We illustrated one such risk in the scenario entitled “inflationary spiral,” in  which we posited an initial shock to inflation expectations of 50 basis points followed  by an adverse feedback loop that causes actual and expected inflation to chase each  other up nearly 1 percentage point above baseline  Monetary policy eventually brings  the process under control but only over a lengthy period of time, partly because the  rule that we use in the simulations has policy responding to actual but not to expected  inflation  Steve Kamin will now continue our presentation      By our highly imperfect measure of margins, which we see through the   filter of the national income and product accounts, margins at this point are somewhat above the   average over the past 30 years, and we have them coming down for the nonfarm business sector    We have them coming down a little, but not very much  So we have some slight erosion in   August 5, 2008 21 of 145    margins, but they remain above average  In the corporate sector, which is measured a little   differently from the overall nonfarm business sector, margins are about average at the moment  So I   would not say that a big move in the markup of price over cost is a material driving factor in our   inflation outlook    We don’t quite understand why this sector seems to have resembled the   cartoon character that keeps running along when we think there shouldn’t be any support   underneath it  [Laughter]  We are staunchly negative about the second half for this sector, and that   view is informed by the precipitous drop in the architectural billings index  That’s one of the   relatively few indicators that gives us any purchase on what’s going to happen in this sector  It’s a   August 5, 2008 23 of 145    helpful indicator of spending about six months ahead  We think that financial conditions are pretty   tough in this area  We’re getting a lot of anecdotal evidence that people are having greater difficulty   financing projects than was the case before, and we’ve seen some uptick in vacancy rates as well    So we think all of those are factors  I guess I would say that we’ve heard very persistently negative   reports from our supervision colleagues as well about what’s going on in that area    Yes    May I just augment my earlier answer?  I spoke about the nonresidential   building sector  Another factor taking down overall nonresidential spending is that the lower energy   price trajectory reduces our expectation for drilling and mining expenditures, which have also   fallen    No  One of the facts that we learn from microeconomic data about, for   example, job flows is that there is always a huge, astonishing amount of churn—job destruction and   job creation—just astonishing; and that’s true even in normal macroeconomic times  So the   background radiation level is not zero  But we haven’t incorporated in our baseline any allowance   for greater cost, and that’s what this alternative scenario was intended to illustrate, making a pretty   August 5, 2008 27 of 145    generous allowance for the potential effect of that sectoral reallocation on the productive capacity of   the economy  But it’s a serious question    The reason is that it operates like a classic supply shock, which presents   monetary policy with just simply a less pleasant policy menu to choose from; and in the context of   that costly sectoral reallocation, the economy is running closer to its productive capacity  Let’s see    I lost my train of thought here    I guess I would push back on the premise that we don’t have a pretty   significant adjustment in house prices built into our baseline  We have house prices as measured by   OFHEO declining 7 percent this year and another 5 percent in 2009, and I wouldn’t anticipate any   rebound in 2010  You know, our ability to measure where that would leave house prices relative to   some notion of fair valuation is incredibly imprecise  But one regression-based indicator that we   follow suggests that it would have house prices relative to rents swinging from a relatively high   August 5, 2008 29 of 145    valuation to a noticeably low valuation  Charles Fleischman illustrated this yesterday in his pre-  FOMC briefing  The major factor that provides some reason for optimism is that construction starts   are now low enough that builders are making progress in chipping away their inventory of unsold   homes  The months’ supply figures remain extraordinarily high because the denominator is very   low; but in terms of units of unsold homes, my recollection is that we’ve chipped away about half   the run-up in terms of absolute number of units in inventory  We also have starts continuing to   come down materially from their current level  So we think that the process will begin to get   inventories into a more normal alignment    I don’t think so    I would just augment Bill’s comment with two other observations  There’s   plenty of probability mass out in the tail  I think it actually is two-sided risk  We illustrated one   side of that risk in our “severe financial stress” scenario  The other point I would make is that our   projection for national house-price declines of 12 percent cumulative in 2008 and 2009 makes   plenty of room for a very much more severe decline in Florida, California, and other highly stressed   areas, and we have attempted to take that regional diversity into account  It’s a rough exercise, to be   sure, but we’re not oblivious to the fact that some areas are doing much worse than the average    That is the nature of averages    We expect starts to stabilize next year, and that will be followed by a pretty   considerable period of several quarters with house prices finally stabilizing  But we think that   builders will look ahead and see that they’ve cut their additions to supply by enough to make even   more rapid progress against their inventory of unsold homes  The question of the dynamics of   house prices is a tricky one because it depends on what model of expectations one assumes that   homebuyers will have  If every homeowner were a rational economic being, then it’s pretty   unambiguous that a lower level of home prices would elicit greater optimism on the part of home   August 5, 2008 32 of 145    shoppers that, gee, the valuation is better compared with yesterday; I should be more enthusiastic   about getting into the housing market; I should be happier today than I was yesterday  I think it’s at   least an open question as to whether expectations aren’t more extrapolative than that  We haven’t   seen any diminution in, for example, the Michigan survey in response to what homeowners expect   to happen over the coming 12 months, and I think it’s a serious possibility that they look at their   recent experience and extrapolate that forward and conclude that over the next 12 months the user   cost of owning a home is going to be really high  We just don’t have a very good grip on exactly   what the dynamics of prices and housing demand will be    I don’t know what the OFHEO does to capture the quality of automobile   that comes in the driveway  [Laughter]  I suspect that there’s no adjustment for that    I don’t know what the story is with regard to permits that you’re   mentioning  I do know that the cancellation rate of new home sales has declined a bit  Previously   we were emphasizing that the high level of cancellations that the builders were experiencing was   actually causing the supply situation to be even worse than one would infer from the Census Bureau   data  Now the cancellation rates have come down, and so that situation is not as severe as it was six   or nine months ago, I believe    We’re certainly aware of that  To my eye the numbers look astonishingly   negative  For foreclosures, we have 25 million foreclosures this year and another 2 million   foreclosures next year  We have a very bleak landscape built into the projection  "
8625,2008-12-15,"  President Lacker, it’s a complicated security, but it’s wrapped by a   guarantee that ultimately the Department of Education will make good on to the tune of 97 cents on   the dollar  There’s one little detail that is causing another piece of friction in the market, and that is   that, if the servicer doesn’t perform on the loan, then the Department of Education has the right to   not make good on the guarantee  But other than that, it’s about 97 percent guaranteed    Apparently the ability of the Department of Education not to make good on   the guarantee is very rarely exercised    I believe Bill’s point is that it guarantees a return to the investor  "

8890,2009-12-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be delivering remarks this   morning that were, for the most part, prepared by Dave Stockton, who can’t be with   us today, as the Chairman mentioned, because of illness  I should note that such   circumstances may have little historical precedent  My colleagues and I have now   completed an exhaustive search of the National Archives, checking all the critical   original source material, and found no instance in which Robin had to clean up   Gotham City on his own because Batman was indisposed; and no mention of Tonto   ever having to face mortal peril by himself because the Lone Ranger was back at the   ranch recuperating from the latest flu pandemic  My colleagues in Public Affairs   often emphasize the importance of expectations management, so in that spirit, I have   set myself the bar of hoping that today’s proceedings go better than when Captain   Edward Smith asked First Officer Murdoch to take a turn at the helm of the Titanic   [Laughter] Now turning to Dave’s remarks—I am speaking in Dave’s voice    I’d like to do three things this afternoon First, we have received an unusually  large slug of data since the close of the Greenbook, so I will provide a brief update on  the near-term forecast Second, I’d like to summarize our take on where we are in the                 December 15–16, 2009 41 of 247  recovery process at present And finally, I will point out what we see as the major  sources of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook   Since we published the forecast last Wednesday, we have received readings on  retail sales, merchandise trade, inventories, consumer sentiment, industrial  production, and producer prices The retail sales data for November were right in line  with our projection As you know, we had been rather skeptical earlier in the fall  when the consumer spending data began to show improvement  We thought  declining employment, weak incomes, sour sentiment, and still tight financial  conditions should be exerting greater restraint on spending than implied by the  incoming data  However, some of that tension was reduced by the sizable upward  revisions that the BEA made to its estimates of labor income in the second and third  quarters Those revisions suggest that the recovery in consumer spending is on a  firmer footing  Last Friday’s reading on consumer sentiment from the  Reuters/Michigan survey showed a further modest improvement that also is  consistent with the pickup in spending that we have witnessed of late  All told, we  now estimate that real PCE increased at an annual rate of about 2½ percent in the  second half, no different from our forecast of last Wednesday, but about ½ percentage  point faster than our October forecast   We also received data on retail inventories late last week  Retail inventories  outside the motor vehicle sector ran off at a slower pace in October than we had  expected, adding a couple of tenths to our forecast of growth in real GDP in the  current quarter And the somewhat stronger-than-expected figures for exports in  October reported in last week’s release on merchandise trade also added a couple of  tenths to current quarter growth  Nathan will have a bit more to say about that in a  few moments  Taken together, the inventory and trade data would lead us to revise  up estimated growth in real GDP in the current quarter to an annual rate of about  4¼ percent   Earlier today, we published our first estimate of industrial production in  November  Total IP increased an estimated 08 percent last month, while  manufacturing output rose 11 percent  We pride ourselves on cultivating a high  degree of collegiality in the Division of Research and Statistics, so it comes as no  surprise to find out that we had built a pretty good forecast of these results into last  week’s Greenbook [laughter] All told, and notwithstanding the downbeat tone to the  December Empire State Manufacturing Survey that was released this morning, the  industrial sector remains on track for a second consecutive quarter of 6+ percent rate  of growth, thus beginning the process of digging out from some very steep earlier  declines   This brings me to the second issue that I wanted to touch on this afternoon, which  is, given all that we have seen in the past six weeks, where do we think we are in the  cyclical process?  These could well prove to be famous last words, but I believe that  the accumulating evidence supports the view that a moderate recovery is under way  and, indeed, that the recovery is gaining greater traction  Not only have we seen an                 December 15–16, 2009 42 of 247  acceleration in aggregate output, but the composition of that acceleration seems  favorable for activity going forward Importantly, domestic final sales are firming   The key elements of that firming include a recovery in housing, the aforementioned  turnaround in consumer spending, and a stabilization in spending on capital goods   Moreover, exports are getting a boost from the improvement in global activity  And  with the overall prospects for sales looking brighter, businesses appear to be lifting  production further in order to slow the runoff of inventories   Finally, we are now seeing more encouraging—albeit still tentative—signs that  the deterioration in the labor market is abating  Declines in private payrolls averaged  90,000 per month over the past three months  That compares with job losses that  were averaging about 700,000 per month earlier this year and were still running at  about 425,000 per month at midyear  Other indicators that labor market conditions  are beginning to turn include an upswing in temporary help employment in recent  months and a jump in the workweek in November  And since the November survey  week, initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to drift down   While the probability that we have entered a self-sustaining recovery appears to  have increased appreciably, considerable risks continue to attend our forecast  One  risk that has been highlighted by the recent data is that of a sharper acceleration of  activity, driven in part by a more rapid attempt by businesses to halt a further runoff  of inventories and perhaps even add to stocks  The book value inventory data that we  have for October show a small accumulation of stocks in the manufacturing and trade  sectors after a long period of huge liquidations, and a sharp rebound in activity caused  by a swing in the inventory cycle has been a feature of some previous, more V-shaped  recoveries In our forecast, we have assumed that the positive figure for October  overstates the underlying upswing, and we have penciled in further moderate declines  in inventories for the remainder of the quarter  We have done so because we just  haven’t seen or heard much that would indicate that a substantially greater snapback  in inventory investment is providing a major lift to production  The national and  regional purchasing managers’ reports point to ongoing increases in factory output,  but moderate ones—not a sudden or sharp pop in activity  And my reading is that the  reports given in the Beige Book do not seem consistent with an inventory-led surge of  major proportions in production   But if we are misreading the situation and the liquidation of inventories is coming  to an end more abruptly than we are projecting, then the growth of real GDP could  easily outstrip our 4¼ percent estimate in the current quarter, and if past patterns were  to prevail, we could see several quarters of outsized increases in real GDP  In the  first instance, a faster turnaround in inventory investment would pull forward some of  the growth that we have projected to be stretched out over the next couple of years   But greater near-term strength could beget stronger household and business  confidence and spending, as well as a faster relaxation of the terms on which credit is  being offered to households and nonfinancial businesses, all of which could amplify  the effects on the growth of real GDP, the path of resource utilization, and price                           December 15–16, 2009 43 of 247  inflation We will be monitoring these cyclical forces carefully in the period  immediately ahead   Despite the generally more favorable tenor of the incoming data of late, there  remain considerable downside risks to the Greenbook projection as well  One  prominent risk is that final sales peter out next year rather than accelerating further as  we are forecasting After declining at an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first  half, final sales appear to be increasing at about a 2 percent pace in the second half,  and we are projecting a 3 percent advance in 2010  Much of next year’s acceleration  occurs in spending for durable goods, especially business investment  In our view,  improving cash flows, an ample stock of liquid assets, increasing confidence in the  durability of the recovery, the release of some pent-up demand, and a further easing  of financial strains should provide noticeable impetus to investment spending  But it  is possible that we are too optimistic in our expectation of further easing of financial  conditions, including the terms of lending from the banking sector, or we could be  attributing too much staying power to the stimulus being provided by fiscal policy   A second risk relates to the labor market  As I noted earlier, we have been  encouraged by the recent data  But it is important to note that, to date, the smaller  employment declines have principally been driven by a reduction in layoffs  As yet,  we have seen few signs of a widespread pickup in hiring in readings from the JOLTS  data, the NFIB survey of small businesses, or measures of help-wanted or job  availability We expect to see increasing signs of hiring in the months ahead as  businesses grow more confident of the recovery  But anecdotal reports suggest that  businesses remain very cautious  If that caution persists longer than we expect, hiring  could remain weak and slack in labor markets could fail to recede to the extent we are  projecting   We made only very minor adjustments to our inflation projection this round  The  incoming data on overall PCE prices were a bit above our projection  But the  surprises were almost completely the result of a somewhat faster pass through of  crude oil and natural gas prices to the retail level and higher than expected nonmarket  prices, which we think have little signal content for underlying inflation  As a  consequence, although we have revised up the projected increase in total PCE prices  in the current quarter by ¾ percentage point to 2¾ percent, we have revised down the  projected increase in the first quarter by nearly the same amount to about 1 percent  The increase in energy prices that was reported in this morning’s PPI release  surprised us to the upside, but in the past, producer prices for energy have been a  pretty noisy indicator of developments at the retail level, so we are withholding  judgment pending tomorrow’s CPI release  Unlike PPI energy prices, the PPI for  medical care does feed directly into the PCE price index, and these prices were a little  lower than we had expected, shaving perhaps a tenth or two off our projection for  core PCE inflation in the fourth quarter   Looking beyond the near term, we revised up our forecast for core PCE prices by  a tenth in both 2010 and 2011 to reflect somewhat higher projected import prices and                      December 15–16, 2009 44 of 247  a slightly smaller margin of slack  Reflecting these revisions as well as some change  in the profile of energy prices, we lowered projected overall PCE inflation by a tenth  in 2010 to 13 percent and raised the projection by two tenths in 2011 to 12 percent   Nathan will continue our presentation  "
9110,2010-11-02,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the whole, the incoming   economic data during the intermeeting period were remarkably kind to our projection   in the September Tealbook, so I will discuss them with relative dispatch               With respect to real activity, two of the key components of private domestic   demand—consumption and business spending for equipment and software—appear to   be running a little stronger than we expected in the second half of this year  But thus   far, the pickup in those sources of demand relative to our earlier expectation has been   met out of imports rather than domestic production  Consistent with that view,   industrial production decelerated in the third quarter and looks poised to slow further   in the fourth quarter  Soft patches in IP during a recovery phase are quite typical,   though an outright decline, should one occur, would be more uncommon   The BEA’s first estimate for real GDP in the third quarter, published on Friday   after we closed the Tealbook, came in a few tenths stronger than we had expected    However, some of the upside third-quarter surprise was in federal spending—a   category that’s constrained over time by appropriations  For this reason and some   others, we trimmed our expectation for the current quarter by a few tenths, leaving   our forecast for real GDP growth over the second half as a whole unrevised from the   September Tealbook at a tepid 2 percent   The one labor market report that we received during the intermeeting period—the   one for September—also came in very close to our expectations  Private payroll   employment increased a lackluster 64,000 in September, and the unemployment rate   was unchanged at 96 percent  Initial claims for unemployment insurance have   retraced their run-up earlier this year, and the four-week moving average is now back   down into the neighborhood of 450,000  However, that level is still high enough to   suggest that the pace of layoffs has not diminished much this year  Meanwhile, the   available indicators of hiring remain weak, so, for the fourth quarter, we expect   private payroll gains to average only about 90,000 per month, unrevised from the   September Tealbook and about equal to the average gain over the past few months    And we expect the unemployment rate to edge back up to 97 percent, again   unrevised from September  This coming Friday, we will receive the first of two   employment reports that will be published during the upcoming intermeeting period   Turning to inflation, the most recent data on core PCE inflation have been a little   softer than we expected  Taking on board the information included in the GDP   releases published last Friday and yesterday, we now have core inflation running at a   09 percent annual rate over the second half of the year, a couple of tenths below our   forecast in the September Tealbook  On the other hand, the bump in oil prices last   November 2–3, 2010 27 of 238             month caused us to nudge up our expectation for top-line PCE inflation over the   second half by a tenth to 14 percent                  Stepping back for a moment from the latest monthly price readings to focus on   longer-run trends, underlying inflation by a variety of measures has declined   noticeably since the beginning of the recession  As Deb Lindner showed yesterday in   her briefing for the Board, the pattern differs somewhat across measures, but the   broad contours are very much the same  For example, the most recent 12-month   change in core PCE prices is down 13 percentage points from its level at the business   cycle peak in December 2007  Similarly, inflation measured by the Dallas Fed   trimmed mean PCE index is down 17 percentage points, by the market-based core   PCE index is down 14 percentage points, and by the Cleveland Fed median CPI is   down 26 percentage points  In other words, all these measures, including the core   PCE price index, show a noticeable decline in inflation over the past three years   On the whole, therefore, the economic situation appears very much as it did at the   time of the September meeting  Real GDP continues to trend upward, though at only   a sluggish pace thus far  Job creation continues at an anemic pace, and the   unemployment rate still seems poised to continue roughly at its current level for the   next few months  Meanwhile, consumer price inflation remains subdued, and survey   measures of inflation continue to move sideways   While there was relatively little news with respect to either real activity or   inflation, financial conditions, as Brian noted, became noticeably more supportive of   economic growth during the intermeeting period  The foreign exchange value of the   dollar moved lower, and stock prices moved higher  The nominal yield on the   10-year Treasury note traversed a wide range during the intermeeting period, but as of   last night, was down about half a dozen basis points, on net, from the time of the   September Tealbook   As best as we could tell, the improvement in financial conditions reflected, in   substantial part, a strengthening conviction on the part of market participants that you   will announce some further policy accommodation at the conclusion of this meeting    In putting together the baseline forecast, we had to specify an assumption about your   policy decisions, not only at the conclusion of this meeting but also in the future  One   obvious possibility would have been to assume no further increases in the size of the   SOMA  Another possibility would have been to assume that you would ratify market   expectations  Those expectations vary widely but seem to center, as best we can tell,   on an increment to the SOMA cumulating to roughly $1 trillion  A third possibility   was to condition the staff forecast on a policy similar to alternative B in the Tealbook,   which lies roughly in between the other two options  A good case could have been   made for any of these three alternatives   To facilitate the Committee’s discussion, we took the approach of showing what   our forecast would look like under all three policies  To do this, we conditioned our   baseline projection on the middle option, and included a box on pages 4 and 5 of   November 2–3, 2010 28 of 238             Book A, in which we sketched the implications of deviating from the baseline policy   in either direction  As described in the box, if you choose not to announce any   expansion of your asset purchases and you convince the market you will not   reconsider that decision, we would trim about 07 percentage point from our baseline   forecast for the level of real GDP at the end of 2012, add around a quarter of a   percentage point to the level of the unemployment rate, and shave about a tenth from   our forecast of both core and top-line PCE inflation  To a very close approximation,   in other words, if you were to decide to undertake no further expansion of the SOMA,   we would respond, based on the information available to us today, to a very close   approximation by handing you back the forecast that we published in the September   Tealbook               On the other hand, if you announce an incremental purchase of $1 trillion, and   likewise convince the market not to extrapolate even further beyond that, we would   add about 04 percentage point to our baseline forecast for the level of real GDP at the   end of 2012, slice about a tenth and a half from the level of the unemployment rate,   and add about half a tenth to our forecast of core and top-line PCE inflation   Finally, I thought I might end by briefly touching on the arithmetic of the supply   side of our projection  At first glance, you might be surprised to see that we raised   the level of real GDP by 06 percentage point at the end of 2012, and yet we have the   GDP gap nearly a percentage point smaller by then  And despite having a noticeably   smaller GDP gap at that point, we revised down the unemployment rate by only a   tenth of a percentage point  To paraphrase my pre-teen daughters, “What’s up with   that?”   The key to understanding how it all hangs together is to remember that we nudged   up our assumption for the NAIRU in this round  In particular, based on some recent   modeling work by my colleagues Charles Fleischman and John Roberts, we think we   can better account for inflation dynamics before the business cycle peak in December   2007 with a slightly higher NAIRU than we had previously assumed  Accordingly,   we now assume that the NAIRU held steady at 5 percent before the recession rather   than edging down to 4¾ percent  We have maintained our earlier assumption that the   NAIRU increased by 1 percentage point during 2008 and 2009 as a result of the   increase in permanent job loss during the recession and the consequent increase in   mismatch between available jobs and unemployed workers  Moreover, as before, we   continue to assume that extended and emergency unemployment benefits have been   affecting the unemployment rate and will continue to do so, though to a steadily   diminishing extent, until the end of 2012   Putting all these effects together, therefore, we now have a NAIRU that, by the   end of 2012, is about a quarter of a percentage point higher than we assumed in the   September Tealbook  Applying an Okun’s law coefficient of about 2, the adjustment   to the NAIRU therefore explains why the output gap at the end of the projection is   nearly a percentage point smaller than in the previous projection, even though the   level of real GDP is only 06 percentage point higher  And the changes to our supply-  November 2–3, 2010 29 of 238             side assumptions also explain why the actual unemployment rate is projected to be   only 01 percentage point lower at the end of 2012, even though the output gap is so   much narrower                      Nathan will now continue our presentation    In our judgmental forecast, we decompose the effect as due about   two-thirds to the dollar effect, with the remaining one-third being split roughly equally between   the lower bond yields and the higher stock values    The part-time or unemployed?    I think it’s pretty hard to distinguish these various categories of   underemployment and detachment from the labor force  They have a lot of coherence across   groups  Permanent job losers is one category that I mentioned in my prepared remarks  There’s   presumably a high degree of overlap between the permanent job losers and those unemployed   27 weeks and longer; part-time for economic reasons is another group  We attempt to discern   differences in the amount of pressure that these various groups are putting on the evolution of   inflation  It’s really hard to get even a first-order effect, and to go to the kind of second-order   distinctions that you’re pointing to is yet another level more difficult    To be clear, I am not disagreeing with you—I am expressing frustration   because, in our experience, it has been difficult to get the data to speak clearly to the issue    But, again, it is precisely with the kind of rationale that you articulated   that led us to move up the NAIRU by a percentage point from 2007 to 2009    It was in the framework memo   November 2–3, 2010 146 of 238            "
9212,2011-04-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s been a humbling realization as  the hours have gone by that the only shot I have at garnering a round of applause  would be to say, “Nathan and I will now be happy to take your questions”  However,  I am going to dash any hopes you might have along those lines and give you my full  prepared remarks   As you know from the Tealbook, a lengthy list of indicators came in to the  disappointing side of our expectations during the intermeeting period  I will keep the  recitation here short and come back to some of these items later in my remarks, and  simply note now that both the residential and nonresidential construction sectors  succeeded in tripping on the already-low bars we had set for them in the March  Tealbook; state and local spending was similarly even softer than we had expected;   April 26–27, 2011 91 of 244              and federal purchases took a puzzling dive in the first quarter, especially in the  defense area   That said, not all of the news about first-quarter spending was disappointing  You  may recall that just before the March FOMC meeting, we received a softer retail sales  report that instantly put a dent in the forecast we had published just two days earlier   But the data since then about consumer spending have been generally encouraging— enough so to restore our forecast for the growth of real PCE in the first quarter to  where it had been in the March Tealbook  Similarly, business investment in  equipment and software looks on track to post a solid gain at an annual rate of  roughly 10 percent in the first quarter, only slightly below our March forecast   Furthermore, the available indicators of business sentiment, including the regional  and national surveys of purchasing managers, bode well for the near-term outlook for  E&S investment   All told, the pluses from household and business spending were far outweighed  by the minuses from construction and government spending, and we downgraded our  first-quarter real-GDP growth forecast by 1½ percentage points from the March  Tealbook to just 1¾ percent  Moreover, we chiseled down our forecast for second  quarter growth by ¾ percentage point, to 3 percent   The larger question that we wrestled with in putting together the forecast was how  to interpret the weaker tone of the incoming data  What underlying economic  mechanisms might be at work, generating an even more sluggish recovery in  spending than we had anticipated?  And most fundamentally, has the economic  recovery become more tenuous?   We don’t think so, but I think it’s fair to say that there are some hairline cracks in  our confidence   One important factor encouraging us in the view that the recovery remains on  track was the news from the labor market  The improvement in labor market  conditions still appears to be proceeding at only a measured pace, but a range of  indicators continue to suggest that it is, in fact, proceeding  Private payroll  employment increased nearly 200,000 per month, on average, during the first quarter,  up from an average of roughly 150,000 per month in the preceding quarter  The  unemployment rate edged down another tenth in March to 88 percent, and for the  next few months we have it essentially following the same trajectory that we foresaw  in the March Tealbook  Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in the  past several weeks have flattened out in the neighborhood of 400,000; at that level,  they (as well as other indicators such as hiring plans and help-wanted indexes) are  broadly consistent with payroll employment gains continuing during the next few  months at about their recent pace  Informed by these data, we left our forecast for  employment gains in the second quarter unrevised from our previous projection   Another source of generally encouraging news about the pace of the recovery was  the industrial sector  Manufacturing IP increased at a robust 9 percent pace in the   April 26–27, 2011 92 of 244              first quarter, and the gains were relatively widespread across industries  Moreover,  apart from the disruptions to motor vehicle production associated with the earthquake  in Japan, the available hints about manufacturing activity in the second quarter are  mostly bright  The IP data are reassuring because they derive from a measurement  apparatus that is essentially independent of the one that is used to estimate real GDP;  moreover, manufacturing still accounts for a little more than a tenth of the value  added in the overall economy, and for about half of the volatility of overall output  If  a more-deep-seated cyclical weakening were under way, it might well leave an  imprint in these data  Thus far, they continue to look solid   Finally, I would note that our forecast of gross domestic income—in principle, a  different way of measuring the same underlying concept as gross domestic product— is still running at a more robust 3½ percent pace in the first quarter, essentially  unrevised from the March Tealbook—a tenuous bit of evidence, to be sure, but  suggestive that the latest reading on real GDP may be understating the forward  momentum of the economic recovery   All told, we interpreted the range of evidence as suggesting that the greater  weakness in the first half of this year is mostly concentrated in a few specific sectors,  and reflects some forces that may be imposing even greater restraint in those sectors  than had earlier seemed evident   One case in point is the housing sector  Although the inventory of unsold new  homes is historically low, the tidal wave of other properties becoming available for  sale is large and looks unlikely to subside materially any time soon  A remarkable  fact is that roughly half of all sales of single-family homes recently have involved  distressed properties—that is, homes that were either in possession of the lender or  involved in a short sale  Banks and others disposing of these properties appear  willing to take relatively steep price discounts in return for being rid of them   Although these distressed properties are not perfect substitutes—this was written  before the “substitution” dialogue today—for newly built homes, they are substitutes  nonetheless, and their presence in the marketplace appears to be putting substantial  downward pressure on the prices of and demand for new homes  We responded to  the intermeeting news by flattening out considerably the trajectory of our single- family-starts forecast  By the end of 2012, single-family starts in our current forecast  are no higher than they were in the third quarter of 2008, long after the collapse of the  sector was well in train   A roughly similar story obtains for the nonresidential construction sector  Higher  energy prices are supporting more investment in drilling and mining structures, but  elsewhere, the still-high vacancy rates for retail and office space, among others, are  driving investment down even more steeply than we had expected   The surprisingly steep drop in state and local government investment spending  during the first quarter—nearly 14 percent at an annual rate—suggests that the budget  pressures under which these jurisdictions are operating is even greater than we had   April 26–27, 2011 93 of 244              thought  Furthermore, state and local governments cut jobs in the first quarter at an  average rate of 28,000 per month, again somewhat worse than we had expected   Although I put consumer spending in a favorable light earlier, I will mention one  cloud behind the silver lining  In particular, the prices for energy and food seem to be  weighing on sentiment—and by enough, we estimate, to take a couple of additional  tenths out of the growth of real PCE over the next few quarters   All that said, we still think the basic ingredients of the recovery remain in place   The accommodative stance of monetary policy, the waning of the negative wealth  effects, the eventual improvement in the availability of credit to bank-dependent  customers and, importantly, continued gradual improvement in labor market  conditions should give the recovery some additional traction over the medium run   The recovery may be proceeding a little more slowly than we had earlier diagnosed,  but we still see the analysis that we gave in the March Tealbook of the dynamics  driving the recovery as a reasonable working hypothesis   As we discussed in the Tealbook, we continue to see the risks around our  projections for the growth of real GDP and the unemployment rate as elevated  relative to the standard of the past 20 years, and the risks around our projection as  reasonably balanced   On the inflation front, most of the news we received during the intermeeting  period was a little higher than we were anticipating, and in response, we made a small  adjustment to our outlook  Regarding core inflation, prices for motor vehicles came  in higher than we had expected in both February and March  The likelihood that  inventories will become even leaner may put further upward pressure on these prices  in coming months  Indeed, some of the motor vehicle manufacturers have already  announced upcoming price increases and reduced incentives  More broadly, we think  goods prices are being pushed up some by the slightly faster-than-anticipated  increases in import prices, services prices in earlier months were revised up, and retail  energy prices appear on track to rise even a few percentage points faster during the  first half of this year than the sharp increases we had already been expecting  None  of these upward revisions have large implications for core inflation taken alone, but  they all lean in the same direction   We gave these developments some persistence into next year based on the fact  that in many of our model specifications, inflation appears to have some intrinsic  momentum  That is, even after controlling for inflation expectations, there seems to  be some carryover of inflation from one period to the next  Commonly, for example,  empirical implementations of the now-conventional New Keynesian Phillips curve  include both a forward-looking term explicitly identified with inflation expectations  and a backward-looking term that might reflect a variety of factors such as costly  price adjustment or the use of backward-looking rules of thumb by some firms in  setting their prices  Regardless of its source, the empirical regularity implies that the  slightly faster pace of core inflation this year should leave some imprint next year as  well   April 26–27, 2011 94 of 244              Based on these considerations, we boosted our forecast of core PCE inflation both  this year and next by 02 percentage point, to 14 percent   As for headline PCE inflation, factoring in the direct effects of the incoming data  on domestic retail energy and food prices brought our forecast for topline PCE  inflation this year up to 22 percent—three-tenths faster than we had projected in the  March Tealbook  Next year, we have food and energy prices decelerating sharply,  essentially in line with available readings from futures markets, and as a result,  topline PCE inflation falls back to 12 percent   It’s a little difficult to compare our inflation outlook with those of outside  forecasters, partly because the most recent available Survey of Professional  Forecasters dates from mid-February, and partly because the Blue Chip survey does  not poll its participants about PCE inflation but focuses instead on the CPI  But it  might be worth noting that our outlook for overall CPI inflation is essentially the  same as the Blue Chip’s forecast for this year and 1 percentage point lower next year   With regard to core PCE inflation, our projection is a couple of tenths higher than  Macroeconomic Advisers’ for both this year and next, and a couple of tenths lower  than the somewhat dated SPF projection for next year   Similar to our analysis with regard to real GDP and the unemployment rate, we  continue to see the amount of uncertainty surrounding our inflation projection as  elevated relative to the standard of the past 20 years, and we see the risks around our  forecast as balanced  And now, Nathan will continue our report    Yes  The advanced report on durables was received this morning  We   obviously haven’t had a chance to look at it carefully, but we were looking for a strong report    At first blush, it looks like we got one, and our preliminary take is that it should leave our   projection about unchanged for the first quarter  "
9289,2011-08-09,"  One Don Kohn unit [Laughter]    Even with a modal rate hanging close to zero through the end of 2013, if   you made a promise not to raise by then, you’d be chopping off the upper part of the tail of the   distribution  As Brian was saying, all of the risk is to the upside  2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will eventually be referring to the  single exhibit behind the cover that says “Staff Report on the Domestic Economic  Situation,” though I’ll warn you that it’ll take me a while to get there  Coming on the  heels of a seemingly unrelenting stream of negative news about the pace of the  recovery that we received during the intermeeting period, Friday’s employment report  provided a welcome respite  The unemployment rate was one-tenth lower than we  had expected on the eve of the report; private payroll employment increased a little  more in July than we expected, and previous estimates for May and June were revised  up modestly; and government employment seemed to be on a slightly shallower  downtrend adjusting for the influence of the temporary shutdown of the state  government in Minnesota   That said, Friday’s report looked good only relative to expectations that had been  greatly beaten down in the wake of the previous employment report  Taking a  slightly longer perspective that may be more relevant for your purposes, Friday’s  report portrayed a labor market that is weaker on nearly every important dimension  than we expected as of the June FOMC meeting  The unemployment rate was one- tenth higher and the employment-to-population ratio three-tenths lower in July than  we projected in the June Tealbook  Private payroll employment increased 105,000  less than expected over the three months ending in July, while for total payroll  employment the shortfall relative to expectation was 150,000  None of these changes  are decisive, but they all run in the same direction   Perhaps the best metric of the net change in our assessment over the intermeeting  period of labor market conditions is the fact that, even after taking Friday’s news on  board, we have private payrolls increasing 70,000 less per month in August and  September than we had in the June Tealbook, and we have the unemployment rate  hanging up near its current level through the end of the year rather than edging down  a couple of tenths   The upper-left panel in the “Forecast Summary” exhibit shows the outlook for the  unemployment rate that we presented in the August Tealbook (the black line)  compared with the June Tealbook (the dashed red line)  As you can see, we rotated  up the trajectory of the jobless rate over the entire forecast period  Had we known  about Friday’s employment report in time for the Tealbook, we still would have                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   August 9, 2011 17 of 162              shown most of this upward revision  But I want to underscore one aspect of the  projection that is not apparent from this chart  Between now and the end of next year,  our baseline outlook has the measured unemployment rate declining about  ¾ percentage point  But the bulk of this decline does not represent an improvement  in labor market conditions  We expect the extended and emergency unemployment  benefit programs to phase down next year, a development that would—by itself, by  our reckoning—bring both the short-run effective NAIRU and the actual  unemployment rate down about ½ percentage point  Thus, in the August projection,  the unemployment rate gap narrows by only about ¼ percentage point over the next  six quarters   The upper-right panel shows our revised outlook for the growth of real GDP  I  will spare you a detailed recitation of the data that caused us to mark down the GDP  outlook by as much as we did, and simply observe that the forecast revision reflects a  more negative assessment on both the supply and demand sides of our projection  On  the demand side, the downward revision is concentrated in personal consumption  expenditures and business outlays for equipment and software  In those two areas,  the news has run to the soft side of our expectations pretty much across the board   Recent readings on spending itself have been disappointing, income is on a lower  trajectory than previously thought, and sentiment among both households and  businesses has slumped  Perhaps the most worrisome illustration of that slump is the  July reading on consumer sentiment from the Michigan survey, which came in at the  lowest level for that series since early 2009   In our August projection, we have real PCE accelerating from almost no change  in the second quarter to a modest rate of growth in the second half of this year—a  pattern that is heavily influenced by the swing in the availability of autos, especially  Japanese nameplates  On the business side, we now have outlays for equipment and  software increasing at a more moderate pace than before, largely driven by the usual  accelerator response to the more subdued outlook for overall activity and business  sales   Turning to the supply side of the projection, the major event during the  intermeeting period was the annual revision to the national income and product  accounts, which showed that output growth over the period from 2008 to 2010 had  been about three- to four-tenths of 1 percentage point slower, on average, per year  than previous estimates had shown  In thinking about how to adjust our estimate of  potential output in response to these revised data, we started by assessing whether  there were existing tensions on the supply side of our projection that might be  addressed by the revisions  In this regard, our assessment of the NAIRU from our  analysis of Beveridge curves still seemed sensible to us, and there were no significant  tensions in Okun’s law or in the relationship between the unemployment gap and  inflation in the pre-revision data, suggesting that our previous estimate of the output  gap provided a reasonable take on resource utilization in the economy at the end of  2010  In contrast, we were concerned that the downward revision to labor  productivity implicit in the revised NIPA data would have left the level of  productivity implausibly below its structural level in 2010 if we did not adjust down   August 9, 2011 18 of 162              our estimate of the underlying trend rate of growth in multifactor productivity   Similarly, results from a more formal statistical analysis using a state-space model of  the supply side of the economy that takes into account these relationships as well as  others suggested that most of the downward revision to output reflected a lower level  of potential  Thus, without any compelling reason to alter our unemployment rate  gap and given the results from the state-space model, we adjusted down our estimate  of potential output in line with the downward revision to GDP, effectively preserving  the output gap at the end of 2010   In this interpretation, the revised data also suggest that trend multifactor  productivity growth has been more stable at around 1 percent than seemed to be the  case before  We carried that flatter profile into the forecast period and so are now  showing potential GDP growth that is two-tenths slower in 2011 than before and  three-tenths slower in 2012  To a close approximation, these reductions in potential  GDP growth show up one-for-one in our projections of actual GDP growth, and so  they account for a significant fraction of the overall downward revision in real GDP   Had the spate of disappointments during the intermeeting period been the first of  its kind in a while, we might have been more inclined to shrug it all off  But as John  Stevens highlighted in his briefing for the Board yesterday, the disappointments of  the past few weeks extended a fairly lengthy run of bad news rather reminiscent of  the losing streaks of the Chicago Cubs that I was used to while growing up  So rather  than shrugging it all off, we attempted a more thorough investigation of the  mechanisms that might account for why the pace of real activity has fallen so far  short of expectation this year  We came up with several possible explanations, all of  which are referenced in the Tealbook  Of those, I want to highlight just one here— the possibility that the shocks that hit the economy in recent years have had a much  deeper and more persistent effect on demand than we have built into the baseline  forecast  For example, it could be that attitudes among households have changed in a  way that is much more negative for their spending even than might be indicated by  the usual measures of overall sentiment or confidence  The lower-left panel in your  exhibit shows one series that has captured our interest of late—a diffusion index  created using responses to a question from the Michigan survey about expected  household income growth over the next 12 months  During the most recent recession,  these expectations behaved in a manner far outside the range of previous experience   Most sobering of all is the fact that this index remains essentially as low as it was  around the trough of the recession  This index certainly raises the question as to  whether pessimism among households might become, to some degree, a self-fulfilling  prophecy, in which consumer pessimism begets weaker-than-normal spending,  weakness in spending begets weakness in hiring, and weakness in labor markets in  turn validates the initial pessimism among households   Since the Tealbook closed, the forces shaping the macroeconomic outlook have  changed quite a bit  As of last night, the stock market was down about 12 percent  relative to our assumption, and Treasury rates had dropped a little more than ¼ of  1 percentage point, oil and natural gas prices had plunged, and the dollar had either  changed little or strengthened slightly  A very, very preliminary reading is that these   August 9, 2011 19 of 162              changes might have relatively little net effect on the growth of real GDP over the rest  of this year as lower oil prices provide an offset to the lower stock prices  But in  2012 and 2013, the net effects turn distinctly more negative, as the wealth effects gain  greater traction, perhaps on the order of one-fourth to three-tenths or four-tenths of  GDP growth in each of those years  I should stress, however, that this accounting is  both preliminary and likely incomplete, as it does not account for any confidence  effects that seem plausible to follow, unless the changes in the past few days are  quickly reversed   Finally, let me briefly discuss the risks to the outlook  In June, we saw the risks  to real activity as skewed to the downside  Today, one could ask whether, with the  downward revision to the baseline, we might now see the risks as more evenly  balanced than before  I am inclined to think not  While there is, without doubt,  upside risk to the forecast that we put before you, the downside risks are surely easier  to name  As Mike will discuss in a moment, the potential for the situation in Europe  to darken further seems more palpable today than earlier  The fragility of our own  financial system seemed all too transparently on display during the past few days  before the debt ceiling deal was struck and then again in the past few days  And the  potential for the malaise among households to intensify and spread more decisively to  businesses cannot be minimized   A different way of approaching the issue of downside risk is to focus specifically  on the possibility that the economy might fall back into recession  Stochastic  simulations of FRB/US in which errors typical of the past 40 years are applied to the  staff forecast suggest only an 11 percent chance that real GDP will decline in two  consecutive quarters between now and the end of 2012  A similar exercise calibrated  to the historical accuracy of the staff GDP forecast over the past 30 years suggests a  little more risk—a 16 percent chance of a two-quarter contraction in real GDP  sometime during the next six quarters   But it’s also possible to generate more worrisome results  For example, my  colleague Jeremy Nalewaik has been working with a range of different Markov- switching models, according to which economic activity spends most of the time in a  “high growth” state but from time to time drops to a “low growth” state  The models  in Jeremy’s stable differ according to how many states he allows and what economic  indicators he shows to the model  The series that I show in the lower-right panel of  your exhibit comes from a model in which Jeremy allows for three states—high,  intermediate, and low—and the model forms its judgments about the pace of activity  based on three quarterly series—the growth of real GDP, the growth of real GDI, and  the change in the unemployment rate  As you can see from the rightmost observation,  this model puts the probability that the economy was in recession in the second  quarter at a disquieting 25 percent  Moreover, rolling the Markov chain forward one  quarter, Jeremy finds that according to this model, the probability that the economy is  in an NBER-type recession in the current quarter is 30 percent   My guess is that these probabilities from the Markov-based machinery are too  high because the model isn’t aware that output was held down temporarily in the   August 9, 2011 20 of 162              second quarter by the effects of the disaster in Japan  But we ran a counterfactual  experiment in which we told the model that real GDP growth had increased at the  roughly 2 percent pace that we think would have prevailed in the absence of the  disaster in Japan  Even in that case, the model puts the probability of recession in the  second quarter at 20 percent, only 5 percentage points less than the baseline result   At the same time, I would caution that there is a case to be made that the probabilities  derived from FRB/US and the staff forecast errors may be too low  For one thing,  there are many quarters in which the NBER deemed the economy to be in recession  and yet real GDP increased, so framing the issue to FRB/US in terms of two  consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth biases the answer toward suggesting  too few adverse events  And for another thing, FRB/US may not sufficiently capture  the kinds of nonlinearities that seem to emerge when the economy is headed into  recession   Turning to the inflation side of the projection, core inflation once again surprised  us slightly to the upside in the most recent reading  With a logic that’s reminiscent of  our behavior on the real side, we responded to this extension of the string of upside  surprises by extrapolating forward into the next few months a little more of the bulge  in inflation that we think has been induced by transitory factors, including commodity  prices, import prices, and motor vehicle prices  Nonetheless, we maintain the view  that these pressures will ease through the second half of this year and into next year   As shown in the middle-right panel, with inflation expectations remaining well  anchored, resource utilization remaining well below normal, and transitory upward  pressures on inflation easing, we have core PCE price inflation drifting down to  1½ percent next year  At the time of the Tealbook, we had energy and food price  pressures abating as well  However, since then, oil and natural gas prices have not  “abated”; they’ve plunged  If those lower prices were to persist, they’d be enough to  take a little more than ¼ percentage point off our projection for overall PCE price  inflation this year, shown in the middle-left panel, bringing the four-quarter average  down to about 2 percent  For next year, we have top-line PCE inflation running  roughly in line with core at 1½ percent  Mike Leahy will continue our presentation    Yes, I think the only part of your statement that I would take exception   to is the pejorative word “lurching”    We’ve been marching determinedly in a negative direction  John   Stevens had a nice exhibit in yesterday’s Board briefing that showed just how much we’d taken   August 9, 2011 25 of 162              the forecast down over the course of this year  Also, I want to just emphasize that I think the   gaps in our understanding of the interactions between the financial sector and the real sector are   profound, and they have, over the past few years, deeply affected our ability to anticipate how   the real economy would respond, and they are continuing to do so now  This is an ignorance that   we share with the entire rest of the profession, and I think one thing that is good to see is the   enormous amount of work that’s going on at the Board, in the System, and in the profession at   large in an attempt to develop a better understanding of the interactions between the real sector   and the financial sector, operating in both directions  But boy, I don’t know whether that   literature is in its infancy, but I would not put it at any more beyond toddlerhood  We’ve got just   an enormous amount yet to learn and incorporate in that regard    It’s hard to know  We’ve been surprised how weak it’s been  We think   it’s importantly driven by demographic or structural factors associated with the aging of the   population, but it’s also pretty clear that there’s an important cyclical component  And there’s a   lot of disagreement, some disagreement among members of the staff here at the Board, lots of   controversy in the economics profession  Getting that decomposition right is very difficult  But   I’d like to ask Bill Wascher to comment   August 9, 2011 26 of 162               I think, and Larry can correct me, that it’s specifically Japanese   nameplates  We’ve seen days’ supply, for example, for Japanese models just plummet to   extraordinarily low levels  This is one of the relatively few aspects of our projection that’s   actually stayed on track  Toyota’s quite confident about its ramping up its production  Honda’s   been running a little behind, but on net, its ability to ship autos to the United States has come in   about in line with expectations  We don’t have final assembly data yet for July; we’ll get that in   the next couple of days  At this point, we’re expecting a 10 percent increase, not at an annual   rate, in motor vehicles IP, so that’s going to provide an extra five-tenths to top-line IP growth in   August 9, 2011 28 of 162              July  It’s a big piece of our output projection for the very near term  And we think that   consumer spending in the second quarter was held back simply by lack of availability on dealer   lots  And one might have thought that they’d go next door and shop for a Chrysler or something   else, but they seem not to have done that  Those other domestic nameplates had very soft sales   in the second quarter as well, so we’re still thinking that that story is in place for the moment    I don’t have a detailed sense of what they’re doing with the liquid assets   that they’ve been accumulating  We’ve spent a lot of time debating whether this is, to some   degree, the new normal  We think that those assets are substituting for other forms of liquidity    I don’t remember who it was who presented a nice briefing sometime in the past month or so that   August 9, 2011 30 of 162              talked about the fact that these liquid assets that have drawn a lot of attention are a substitute for   other forms of financial buffers that firms have been holding    I guess I’d say that the downward revision to E&S is certainly notable,   but by and large, it’s a pretty standard response to just a markedly softer general macroeconomic   outlook  The climate that businesses are facing is going to involve a lot less growth in business   sales, and therefore we think they’ll be motivated to build a smaller stock of E&S capital  That’s   mostly what’s going on    I don’t think so    That could be part of it  But if that is part of it, I don’t think it’s coming   at the expense of domestic investment  And you’re right, I think there has been, to be sure, some   reduction in business confidence, as reflected in the purchasing managers’ surveys, at both the   national level and the regional level  So I think there’s been, for sure, some wind taken out of   the sails there  But we still have E&S growing, now in the mid-single digits, through this year    So to paraphrase President Fisher, it could be worse    Yes, again, this taken alone is not dispositive, but I think that the main   takeaway for us from this series is, boy, it looks like there’s something going on in the household   psyche that has very persistent characteristics    Do you want the last sentence from paragraph 3 in B—about the   Committee being ready to “regularly review the size and composition”?  "
9342,2011-11-01,"  Bud Light  [Laughter]    It would be difficult to analyze that question, in principle, in your   models, because the agents in your models understand exactly what the framework is  I think   November 1–2, 2011 15 of 282              what Michael is saying is that communication clarity is key to the difference between a trigger   strategy and a nominal income-targeting strategy, and communication isn’t an issue that is salient   in the model   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the first exhibit  in the package called “Forecast Summary”    A long time ago, when I was sitting at the breakfast table this morning [laughter],  I was reminded once again of the value of a supportive home environment  One of  my daughters attempted to bolster my confidence by helpfully observing, “Just keep  in mind, Dad, that they’re much more likely to remember you today for whether  you’re wearing a good tie and whether you’ve got any good jokes to tell  At least  Mom has picked out a good tie for you”  [Laughter]   In a departure from recent practice, the outlook for real activity that we provided  you in the Tealbook last week was not a marked downgrade of its immediate  predecessor  Indeed, as Bob Tetlow discussed in his briefing for the Board yesterday,  most of the spending indicators that became available during the intermeeting period  surprised us to the upside  The favorable news included better-than-expected retail  sales in September and a stronger report on orders and shipments of capital goods in  August, and even some surprising further signs of life in the nonresidential  construction sector                                                       3 The materials used by Mr Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   November 1–2, 2011 116 of 282              In response to this news, as shown in the upper-left panel of the “Forecast  Summary” exhibit, the Tealbook forecast that we put to bed last Wednesday showed  slightly stronger growth of real GDP over the second half of this year and the first  quarter of next year than we anticipated in our September forecast   On the surface, last Thursday’s GDP release also looked like it might be mildly  encouraging of a little greater momentum in the recovery  At 2½ percent, the  headline number was a shade weaker than we had forecast in the Tealbook, but the  estimated increase in final sales was considerably stronger than expected, while  inventory investment was lower—a mix that oftentimes in the past has augured well  for near-term production prospects     As is shown in the upper-left panel, however, we did not mark up our medium- term projection in the Tealbook and would not be inclined to do so in response to the  news in the GDP release either  A fair question is why not    Let me proceed in reverse order, beginning with the GDP release  Part of the  upside surprise in final sales was in federal purchases—a source of strength that we  think, for obvious reasons, has no staying power  More fundamentally, however,  Thursday’s report showed a much lower level of disposable personal income in the  third quarter than we had expected in the Tealbook  While we think some of that  downside surprise might be transitory, we’re estimating that perhaps half of it might  persist, a factor that caused us to temper the extent to which we extrapolated forward  the recent strength in consumption spending   Moreover, the broader pattern of the available data suggests to us that maintaining  our medium-term outlook is the best approach for now  The spending data provide a  little brighter perspective on the underlying state of the economy; at the moment,  however, other perspectives are not as encouraging  For one, the labor market still  shows no signs of an appreciable pickup  As shown in the bottom-left panel of the  “Forecast Summary,” the three-month moving average of private payroll employment  gains has backed off considerably from the pace that was evident around the turn of  the year; initial claims for unemployment insurance continue to hover just north of  400,000—a level consistent with only modest employment gains in the next few  months—and job openings and help-wanted advertising have edged lower in recent  months  Likewise, the data on industrial production are less suggestive of strength  than they might first appear  Overall manufacturing IP increased more than 4 percent  during the third quarter, but a chunk of that gain seems to have reflected a recovery  from the supply chain disruptions that stemmed from the earthquake in Japan  While  we cannot parse the upstream effects of the rebound in motor vehicle production with  any precision, we think that IP outside of motor vehicles and related upstream  industries decelerated noticeably during the third quarter and is likely to maintain that  slower pace during the fourth quarter   A range of “soft” indicators remain remarkably downbeat  Most soberingly, as  shown in the lower-right panel of your exhibit, consumer sentiment—whether  measured by the University of Michigan or the Conference Board—has sunk once   November 1–2, 2011 117 of 282              again to the severely depressed levels it occupied during the most intense phase of the  financial crisis   Finally, the factors we treat as conditioning variables are, on net, a little less  supportive of growth now than they were at the time of the September projection  the  dollar is a little higher; oil prices have moved up somewhat—especially the prices of  imported grades; and risk spreads had widened a bit as of the middle of last week  In  addition, the net movement in equity prices from Tealbook to Tealbook was small   Since last Wednesday’s close of the Tealbook, financial market conditions have  remained unsettled  Given the volatility of the past two days that Brian noted, I  would hesitate to draw any inferences for the economic outlook at this juncture   All told, therefore, we are inclined to brighten our assessment of the prospects for  economic activity only a little in the near term, and not at all in the medium term     With the basic contour of the medium-term projection unrevised, we continue to  anticipate a recovery that is subpar by historical standards, with the unemployment  rate still above 8 percent at the end of 2013  As you can see from the middle-left  panel in the summary exhibit, the trajectory for the unemployment rate in our current  projection is virtually indistinguishable from the one we showed in September,  though I would hasten to add that this may be an aspect of the forecast with a  particularly short shelf life, pending Friday’s release of labor market data for October   As we noted in the Tealbook, the gap in resource utilization remains wide  We  estimate that the unemployment rate is about 2½ percentage points above the short- run effective NAIRU today  By the end of 2012, in our baseline projection, the  unemployment rate will have come down about a percentage point, but half of that,  we estimate, will have reflected the expiration of the emergency unemployment  compensation programs  As a result, the unemployment rate gap is still 2 percentage  points in the baseline projection at the end of 2013   We think that there are a number of good reasons for expecting the pace of  recovery to remain subpar by historical standards  The housing sector—often a  locomotive of recovery after previous recessions—remains moribund today due to the  oversupply of houses, a huge backlog of homes in the foreclosure process, the  prevalence of underwater mortgage borrowers, and fears of further price declines— factors that we think are unlikely to dissipate quickly  Access to credit remains  restricted  As Kathleen Johnson showed in her briefing yesterday, a stunning number  of banks are not offering mortgages to households with even the slightest blemishes  on their credit histories, despite the fact that mortgages extended to such borrowers  would be eligible for sale to the GSEs  A similar segmentation seems to prevail in  the market for credit cards as well  In the baseline forecast, we assume that credit  access improves only gradually from here forward  Pessimism appears likely to  remain a factor as well  Although households and firms have solid reasons to be  pessimistic and uncertain about the future—dismal job prospects, the situation in  Europe, and unresolved fiscal problems at home, to name a few—their malaise may  also, to some extent, be a self-fulfilling prophecy  An additional factor slowing the   November 1–2, 2011 118 of 282              recovery is the fiscal position of state and local governments  These governments  continue to face severe budget pressures that have forced them to cut back on their  spending and workforces, and we expect these pressures to ease only slowly   A key consideration in gauging the likely speed of recovery is the health of  financial institutions  Banks and the shadow banking sector face severe challenges  even absent further shocks, and these challenges appear to have intensified over the  course of the year  Given the weaker economic outlook, the flatter yield curve, and  the prospect that shorter-term interest rates will remain near zero for some time,  financial institutions’ ability to earn their way to higher capital ratios now appears to  be noticeably more limited than it did earlier this year   Another factor that we have wrestled with, and that Governor Raskin noted in a  recent speech, is the possibility that the current settings on the monetary dials may be  generating less support for real activity than would normally be the case  For  example, the restricted access to credit probably means that many households and  bank-dependent firms cannot take advantage of low interest rates to the degree that  they would have prior to the recession  And heightened uncertainty about the outlook  has probably decreased the responsiveness of all forms of investment, including  outlays for consumer durable goods, to low interest rates   Although we suspect that the force of monetary policy is attenuated at present, we  also think that it is not blunted entirely  In particular, we hope and suspect that the  stimulus imparted by monetary accommodation through increases in wealth and the  depreciation of the dollar is probably about normal at present, and these two channels  are important  In FRB/US, for example, they account for roughly two-thirds of the  overall stimulus provided by an easing in the stance of monetary policy  In the case  of depreciation effects, the recent declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar  have clearly stimulated production in the manufacturing sector, and further  depreciation would presumably raise global demand for US products even more   The remaining one-third—the direct response of spending to changes in interest  rates—may not be working with its usual force, but it is not entirely shut down either   Credit access may be restricted for many households, but it should not be impeding  the spending response to low interest rates of relatively affluent households  And  even for less well-to-do households, credit does seem to be available to support the  purchase of motor vehicles, so they too are probably responding to low interest rates  at least to this extent  Moreover, a limited number of households have been able to  refinance their mortgages and so improve their monthly cash flow, even if many  others have been prevented from doing so     Down the road, we expect that some of the attenuation in the monetary  transmission mechanism will reverse itself endogenously as the recovery gradually  proceeds  In the absence of further adverse shocks, uncertainty about the outlook  should diminish  We continue to think that the financial accelerator will someday  kick in in a favorable way, with improved balance sheets and reduced uncertainty  feeding the willingness to lend of financial institutions, improved confidence of   November 1–2, 2011 119 of 282              households and businesses leading to increased spending and hiring, and a stepped-up  pace of activity bolstering the condition of the financial sector and easing the strains  on state and local governments     But we think that all that is likely to be a process measured in years, not quarters   In the meantime, you all will face the difficult question as to whether the possibility  that policy may be attenuated today implies that you should adopt an even more  aggressive posture or stay your collective hand   On the inflation front, I have relatively little news to report  As you can see from  the upper-right and middle-right panels in the summary exhibit, our medium-term  projection is essentially unrevised from the September meeting, both for overall PCE  inflation and for the core  I will just briefly touch on two developments in the past  few months in this regard  First, the anticipated deceleration in import prices now is  more decisively evident in the data  Core goods import prices increased 2½ percent  at an annual rate in the third quarter, in line with our September projection, down  from 7¼ percent in the second quarter  Partly for that reason, we think, core PCE  prices also have decelerated  Indeed, last month, the three-month change in core PCE  prices converged back down to its rate of change over the past 12 months, with both  coming in at about 1½ percent  In other words, our outlook for core PCE inflation  survived the two price releases since the September meeting broadly intact   The other point I would highlight has to do with energy prices  We marked up  our near-term projection for retail energy prices for two reasons  First, crude oil  prices came in a little higher than we had expected, especially for imported grades of  crude  Second, we have now taken on board the likelihood that the unusual oil supply  conditions prevailing in the midsection of the country are likely to persist for longer  than we had previously assumed  If our revised assessment is correct, the prices of  retail energy products like gasoline are more likely to be effectively keyed off of  higher-priced imported grades of crude for the next quarters than we thought earlier   This adjustment to our forecast for energy prices accounts for the small upward  revision to our forecast for topline PCE prices in the first quarter, shown in the upper- right panel  Steve Kamin will continue our presentation  "
9383,2011-12-13,"2  Over the intermeeting period, the indicators that we use to  gauge the near-term pace of spending were, on balance, reasonably encouraging   Retail sales in October and light motor vehicle sales in November were stronger than  we expected, and even the incoming news on nonresidential construction was a bit  more upbeat than we anticipated  However, real business outlays on equipment and  software appear to have slowed sharply in the current quarter—about in line with our  October Tealbook forecast—and forward-looking indicators suggest that investment  spending will remain tepid in the near term  Meanwhile, residential construction  remains moribund, with few if any signs on the horizon of recovery, while federal  defense purchases came in lower than expected  I would also note that the data that  have been published since the Tealbook closed, including this morning’s retail sales,  have been, on net, consistent with our expectations, and leave our GDP forecast for  the fourth quarter unchanged from the Tealbook at 3¼ percent   Our thinking in putting together the forecast was also informed by the  substantially weaker news about aggregate income that the BEA published  Based on  data from the quarterly census of employment and wages (which are received with a  lag), the BEA revised down its estimate of second-quarter labor compensation by  $40 billion  This resulted in a significant downward revision to real disposable  personal income, and left second-quarter real gross domestic income, or GDI, roughly  flat  Moreover, the BEA carried forward the weaker trajectory for income into the  third quarter  And although—as I will discuss in a moment—the most recent labor- market report was a little stronger than we had expected in some respects, it did not  point to a larger increase in wage income than we had anticipated   Taken at face value, the lower level of personal income would point to somewhat  weaker growth in consumer spending going forward  We wrestled at length with  whether and if so, to what extent, we should buy into that message from the income  data  In the end, displaying our own attempt at Solomonic wisdom, we split the  difference, taking consumption down somewhat in response to the lower level of  income but not as much as we would have done if we knew that consumption and  income were measured without error  In effect, we’ve left some room for the  possibility that households knew perfectly well what they were doing when they went  out and spent at a respectable rate during the second half of this year, and that the  current estimate of income will ultimately be revised up  But this judgment on our  part admittedly represents a downside risk to our forecast                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)       December 13, 2011 16 of 198              Finally, the news about conditions in the labor market has been a little better than  we had expected  The jobs numbers themselves were about what we had expected   As shown by the black line in the lower-left panel in the summary exhibit, the  estimates of private job gains reported in the establishment survey have been running  just short of 150,000 in recent months  A number of analysts have noted that the  estimates from the household survey, shown by the gray line and adjusted to make  them as comparable as possible to the numbers from the establishment survey, have  been considerably stronger, on average, in the past few months  To ascertain whether  this implies that the establishment survey has been understating the pace of job  creation over this period, we used a Kalman filter model that treats both employment  measures as noisy indicators of an underlying rate of job gains  As you can see, the  model estimate—plotted as the red line—keys far more heavily off of the  establishment survey than the noisier household survey  Over the next few months,  we expect private payroll job gains to continue to run at about the same 150,000 pace  that the model estimates have centered on lately     The far greater surprise in the most recent labor market report came in the form of  a much bigger decline in the unemployment rate in November than we had been  expecting  Here again, we split the difference, taking some signal from the decline in  joblessness but also suspecting that some of last month’s drop was overdone and is  likely to be reversed  I will come back to some of the implications of the  unemployment rate shortly   On balance, we read this mix of both positive and negative incoming news on the  real economy as signaling, by itself, only a small downward revision to our previous  projection for real activity  But all else was not equal, and definitely not on the  European front  In particular, the deterioration in the European economic outlook  that Steve discussed is now having a material influence on our baseline projection  whereas before we had mostly confined consideration of that situation to alternative  scenarios     As Steve described, we are now assuming that Europe will undergo a moderate  recession, and that the path toward resolution will remain sufficiently unclear to  generate continued unease in US financial markets through the first half of next  year  These assumptions affect the US economy by way of a wider trade deficit that  results both from weaker activity abroad and the stronger exchange value of the  dollar; heightened uncertainty in financial markets that holds down stock prices and  causes risk premiums in interest rates to be wider than they otherwise would be; and a  small amount of additional spending restraint on the part of households and  businesses reflecting their diminished confidence  In our baseline projection,  financial market stress and household and business pessimism begin to ease gradually  around the middle of next year as European policymakers eventually succeed in  convincing market participants and others that a viable way forward will be pursued,  but we expect that spillovers from Europe to the United States will continue to  restrain US economic growth into 2013  Of course, even though we have made  some allowance for greater transmission of financial stress to the US economy   December 13, 2011 17 of 198              through our asset-market assumptions, there is, in our view, substantial downside risk  inherent in this situation   The other material influence on our outlook reflects a change in fiscal policy  assumptions  In particular, we now assume that the Congress will extend both the  employee portion of the payroll tax reduction and the Emergency Unemployment  Compensation Program through the end of 2012  Relative to the October projection,  these changes cause fiscal policy to exert a smaller drag on real GDP growth next  year, but a larger drag in 2013 as the tax cut and unemployment benefit extensions  expire  That said, you might wish to set these fiscal changes in the category of  complicating distractions as you chart your policy path forward; because their effects  on real activity are unwound in relatively short order, the fiscal changes have almost  no influence on the prescriptions generated by our optimal control simulations   After all the dust has settled, as you can see from the upper-left panel of the  exhibit, we end up with a substantially more subdued outlook for the growth of real  GDP, particularly in 2013  Nonetheless, the unemployment rate—shown in the  middle-left panel, and the output gap, not shown—are essentially unrevised at the end  of the medium-term projection  This combination of outcomes reflects several  changes we have made to the supply side of our forecast  Specifically, in order to  better square the decline in the unemployment rate over the past year with the  lackluster pace of GDP growth, we trimmed our assumption for the growth of  potential GDP this year by nearly ½ percentage point  And going forward, we edged  down our assumption for potential by a tenth of 1 percentage point in 2012 and 2013  as well, in part reflecting the slower pace of capital deepening in this projection   To be sure, there are a lot of moving parts in the projection, but they can be  summarized as follows  We now judge the gap in resource utilization to be a little  narrower now than we thought at the time of the October Tealbook, but we think the  outlook for aggregate demand is yet a little more subdued than we anticipated earlier   Although this was not a design criterion in putting the projection together, the gap in  resource utilization at the end of 2013 is roughly the same now as we had it in  October   The upper-right and middle-right panels of the exhibit summarize our projection  for headline and core PCE inflation  The incoming inflation data have thus far  corroborated the view that the bulge in core inflation seen earlier this year was largely  attributable to transitory factors, including the pass-through of higher import and  commodity prices and a rise in motor vehicle prices that reflected supply shortages  following the March earthquake in Japan  In recent months, core goods prices— including prices for motor vehicles—have slowed markedly  In fact, we now expect  fourth-quarter core PCE inflation to come in about ½ percentage point below our  October forecast, though a portion of this revision reflects an unexpected decline in  medical services prices that we do not expect to continue  Going forward, our  projected path for core inflation is essentially the same as in October, as we have  made no material revisions to the factors influencing the core over the forecast period   December 13, 2011 18 of 198              Similarly, the path for headline PCE inflation in the December Tealbook is little  changed from October  Headline price inflation has stepped down as the recent  decline in core inflation was reinforced by a deceleration in consumer food and  energy prices  We expect the deceleration in food prices to extend into this quarter  and the next as lower crop prices continue to feed into retail prices  Likewise, we  expect previous declines in imported oil prices to push down retail energy prices  through the end of this year  In 2012 and 2013, energy prices are projected to decline  slightly, leaving headline inflation a touch below the core in both years   In previous briefings, we have shown results from a Markov-switching model  that generates estimates of the probability that economic activity is moving into a  so-called stall state—a slow-growth period that historical evidence indicates is often a  way station along the path to a recession  This model combines data on real gross  domestic income—which, according to Board staff research, provides another useful  indicator of the real-time state of the economy—along with data on real GDP and the  unemployment rate As always, I would caution that one can generate a range of  different results based on seemingly slight changes in the specification of the model,  and that the model has generated false alarms in the past  That said, the lower-right  panel presents updated probabilities from one of the specifications  As you can see,  the estimated stall probability has risen sharply in recent quarters, and is markedly  higher than the value we estimated around the time of the October Tealbook  Mainly,  these higher probabilities reflect the downward surprises in second- and third-quarter  real GDI  It is sobering to observe that, viewed through the lens of this particular  specification, the rise in the estimated stall probability occurred even before the  outlook for Europe took a turn for the worse  I’d be pleased to take your questions  now    The stall probability would come down some, not a lot, because we’ve   only got growth proceeding about in line with its potential in the near term    Yes, but going forward over the next couple of years, we’ve got the   economy expanding only slightly above its potential rate  Those probabilities will stay probably   not as elevated as this, but I would suspect pretty high   With regard to the personal saving rate, it is down  As I mentioned in my text, we have   discounted that to some extent  Once we have all the data in hand and they’ve been   benchmarked using tax returns and other sources of information that would become available   only with considerable hindsight, that lower level of income would cause us to take down   consumption spending by more than we did at the moment  We haven’t unmoored ourselves   entirely from the personal saving rate  There is measurement uncertainty as you suggest; the   personal saving rate from the flow of funds accounts is higher  Discrepancies between the flow   of funds account and the national income account are commonplace and can often be quite   sizable  But we were loath to buy into a rigid view in reaction to those lower income numbers   for a variety of reasons encompassing both model uncertainty and a recognition that the data   with respect to both consumption and investment are imperfect and subject to considerable   subsequent revision  We went part way, but not all the way    The source of those other estimates is the flow of funds accounts, and   historically we’ve keyed our projection more off the internally consistent framework provided by   the national income accounts  But we’re trying to be sensitive to the fact that we’re operating in   a world where none of these concepts is measured with precision  It will be years until these   numbers are benchmarked and settled down  Moreover, different model specifications give us   different guidance about how strongly we should react to surprises in income, and for all of those   reasons we were reluctant to apply a rule-of-thumb kind of marginal propensity to consume to   that decrement in income    In principle, Larry Slifman or Michael, either one or both of you, can   answer—two former chiefs of the Flow of Funds Section here  In principle, one can adjust the   flow of funds data to a conceptually similar basis to the national income accounts    Michael, to the Chairman’s question, using flow of funds accounts, one   can construct a measure of personal saving that strips out capital gains on equity    Can I summarize?  The Q2 number for compensation is a pretty good   number, because that is based on a universe count of employers  In Q3, the BEA has folded in   everything we know, including the upward revisions to employment and all of that  We have   December 13, 2011 23 of 198              done the best that we can to translate all the latest information about those upward revisions in   jobs numbers into the income numbers that we built into this forecast  Now, what the future may   hold, of course, is anybody’s guess  We have given you our guess, but we have tried to take into   account all of the information    Yes  I am not aware that we think there is any statistical inefficiency in   the estimation procedure that the agency is bringing to bear    Yes  You asked me if I could break down, and I may proceed to do so    [Laughter]    I’m going to air our dirty laundry  I’m going to give you a sense of   precision here that will be misleading because around all of these estimates, I am just going to   December 13, 2011 24 of 198              give your our best guesses  We had to put a guess around all of these numbers  We guessed that   the bulk of the downward weight on the GDP projection will occur in 2012  Four-tenths was   what we put down as a total on the growth of GDP, and then an additional negative two-tenths in   2013, so some spillover  Even though the situation is improving, the all-clear signal hasn’t been   given  Now, the bulk of that is occurring through the dollar effects and the weaker activity   abroad  The dollar is taking off a couple of tenths worth each year, and weaker activity abroad is   taking off another tenth  Those two effects combined are worth minus three-tenths in each year    Then as a placeholder, we took another divot, the tenth of 1 percentage point for uncertainty and   risk aversion in 2012  Then, we had that coming back, and so we added back in one-tenth in   2013    But it then switches—we have already seen a substantial part    Yes, at least    I would venture a slightly stronger statement  In partial equilibrium, do   we think a stronger dollar is better for or worse for our trade position?  I don’t profess a lot of   uncertainty about that    That’s intentional  I showed four-quarter percent changes for real GDP,   and I showed one-quarter percent changes for both measures of inflation  And on the fly, we   couldn’t construct the confidence intervals correctly for the four-quarter changes  In previous   editions of this, I have shown quarterly GDP growth  Because of our fiscal assumptions, there is   some unseemly and distracting quarterly variation that I thought wasn’t, frankly, very   informative  We smoothed through that at the cost of losing our confidence interval    I am hiding the unseemly variation in the baseline forecast because I   think that is wholly irrelevant for your policy decision    I don’t think that’s right  Our story has been that the energy price pass-  through has been small, but the import price pass-through is something that survived relatively   well through the past 20 years or so of data  We had a pretty significant surge in the area of,   what, 7 or 8 percent in import prices in the first half—   December 13, 2011 29 of 198               Yes, core import prices    That was a very significant factor, we think, in driving up core goods   prices in the first half of the year  I don’t think that is a change in our story    Right, we think import prices contributed about three-tenths to core   inflation this year, and energy prices contributed only about one-tenth or so  By far, the much   bigger influence was on the import price side    Yes, it already has  We think we have already seen that in core goods   inflation and in motor vehicle prices, for example, in particular, which represents the unwinding   of some of the supply chain disruptions that took place after the Japan earthquake    I completely agree with you  The different specifications, as I had   mentioned in my text, can deliver different results  It’s simply not the case that this is the   specification that delivers the highest probability    We can deliver to you a probability of 100 percent  I would make two   claims on behalf of this specification  One is it puts quite a bit of weight on GDI, and we have a   pretty solid body of research done by staff members now that points to the signal value of GDI in   December 13, 2011 31 of 198              helping to home in on the underlying state of real activity, and some preliminary work   suggesting that GDI is more helpful in that regard than early estimates of GDP  They are both,   after all, attempting to measure the same underlying concept, and so it’s an empirical question as   to which might be more informative, and this body of work suggests that a pretty good case can   be made on behalf of GDI  The second claim I’d make on behalf of this model is that it is the   same specification that generates the red line  So the simple message I’m telling you is that there   is a middle-of-the-road specification of these models that keys off the much weaker trajectory for   GDI in the second and third quarters and arrives at a conclusion that the underlying thrust of the   pace of activity remains quite tenuous  "
