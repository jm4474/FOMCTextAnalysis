8562,2009-08-11," Thank you, Seth I will update the Committee on the  possibility of creating reserve collateral accounts as a means to achieve better control  of the federal funds rate using interest on reserves  As you know, the effective  federal funds rate has generally been lower than the interest rate paid on excess  reserves since October 2008, and the size of this divergence has fluctuated over time  Competition among banks might be expected to narrow that divergence because  buying funds and placing them on deposit at their Federal Reserve Bank is both  relatively inexpensive and completely risk free  One explanation for the divergence  is that imperfections in the fed funds market short-circuit the competitive process by  which the fed funds rate would be bid up  Some banks are paying, for example, 15  basis points to borrow and then earn 25 basis points at the Fed, but other banks are  not bidding up the rate to 16 basis points or higher  Reserve collateral accounts are  intended to facilitate competition that would bid up the rate and generate a tighter link  between the interest rate paid on excess reserves and the market rate  Creating this  tighter link now would help dispel doubts about the Fed’s ability to use interest on  excess reserves to raise the fed funds rate when the time comes   Why isn’t competition bidding up rates more efficiently?  One possible reason is  that counterparty credit risk impedes rate-based competition  Fed funds trades are  uncollateralized loans Consequently, a firm must carefully select its counterparties  and limit the amount lent to each of them  These restrictions limit competition for  funds If a firm could be freed from concern about its counterparty’s credit quality, it  could search among a wider set of firms for higher bids and for larger trade sizes   Reserve collateral accounts, or RCAs, would create the possibility of collateralized  fed funds trades, which would allow many more banks to bid for funds in the market                         August 11–12, 2009 34 of 165  How do RCAs facilitate collateralized fed funds trades?  To begin, note that an  analysis of data from Fedwire suggests that, in July 2009, approximately half of the  daily average of $125 billion of fed funds trades consisted of GSEs lending to banks,  with the other half consisting of bank-to-bank trades  So suppose that two firms, a  GSE and a bank, agree to use RCAs to conduct collateralized fed funds trades  The  bank would request that its Federal Reserve Bank create an RCA, separate from the  bank’s master account  The account would have a unique feature  The bank could  not wire funds out of its own RCA The funds in the account would, however, earn  interest on reserves for the bank paid at the rate on excess reserves  Under the terms  of their collateralized fed funds trade, the GSE would wire funds into the bank’s  RCA, and the next day, the GSE would pull the funds out of the bank’s RCA back  into its own account, using the operational capabilities of the Fed’s National  Settlement Service  So the account can be thought of as a locked box into which  funds are placed and to which the GSE is given the key  The funds are put into the  box by the GSE at night, they earn interest for the bank, and the GSE retrieves the  funds the next day Separately, the GSE and the bank agree on what interest rate the  GSE would earn from the deal     This arrangement would be governed by agreements among the Federal Reserve  Bank, the GSE, and the bank, in which the Fed would acknowledge that the GSE has  a lien on the funds in the RCA That acknowledgement would allow the GSE to  perfect a security interest in the account  As a result, if the bank with which it was  doing the deals failed, the GSE would still get back its principal, as the funds in the  account would be collateral for repayment  With the infrastructure of RCAs in place,  we could expect the GSEs and other firms, perhaps including banks, to establish  RCAs with banks if they can earn higher rates by doing so  Parties to RCA  agreements would be free to borrow or lend on an uncollateralized basis; this  possibility should help in aligning short-term rates through arbitrage activity   Another possible impediment to competition for funds in the current environment  might come from banks’ balance sheet concerns  Some banks might fear that their  buffer of capital to assets above minimum levels is too low for them to bid  aggressively for funds Establishing an RCA would be most attractive to those banks  with the least balance sheet concerns, because they would be willing to pay the  highest rates In this way, RCAs would allow market prices to be determined by the  banks that are best positioned to purchase funds, which would further reduce the  divergence of market rates from the interest rate paid on excess reserves   Our next step would be to approach a number of the GSEs and some banks to  gauge their views as to the feasibility of RCAs and their attractiveness  If a sufficient  appetite for these arrangements appears to exist, Federal Reserve staff would then  plan to establish a Systemwide steering group to form a precise timeline for all the  implementation steps and to determine if any remaining unforeseen impediments to  the creation of RCAs exist I now turn to Bill Nelson, who will update the Committee  on issues in the TALF program                   August 11–12, 2009 35 of 165  Great list of questions  With regard to the workings of the fed   funds market, I think that, as I mentioned, there is about $125 billion traded per day in the fed   funds market  About half of that is bank to bank, and I don’t think we know how disruptive that   would be if there were reverse RPs or whether that would continue I have looked at the   distribution of banks’ balances after you remove the fed funds trades they do per day, and there   are still many banks that operate with negative balances per day and, therefore, have to enter the   fed funds market This is obviously a choice that they are making today  Even with an expanded   balance sheet of $1½ trillion, let’s say, the payments that cross our systems each day amount to   about $3 trillion to $4 trillion So there will still be a need for banks to trade fed funds  I don’t   think that that market would necessarily either disappear or be severely adversely affected   Would these be redundant if we used reverse RPs with the GSEs?  I think largely they   would be redundant, if we use reverse RPs with the GSEs  However, these would be available to   banks as well as to other entities So as Chris explained, if we just remove the balances from the   GSEs, there is still a question of where the funds rate would settle  I believe that the RCAs, by   virtue of their applicability to any participant in the market, would set a harder floor on the fed        August 11–12, 2009 39 of 165  funds market  I think the question is whether we think RPs are more operationally complex,   more hands-on intervening in the market, versus the RCAs, which might be thought of as   allowing the market participants to trade among themselves and find the rate   Then, the question is, Would the market bifurcate into two pieces?  That is a clear   possibility We would have the collateralized market, which would be the floor rate essentially,   and the uncollateralized market, which would continue as it is today  So it would add a new part   to the market  Whether or not that would be seen to be desirable I don’t know  If I may say, as   the Chairman was saying that we have a belt-and-suspenders approach, the RCAs are an idea to   tighten the belt [Laughter]   You are looking at me, but I will turn to Chris as well  I think   that, with regard to the balances of the GSEs, what is important is that all of these payments on              August 11–12, 2009 40 of 165  mortgages funnel into the GSEs So my first answer to your question is that I don’t think that   part would change for the GSEs regardless of their overall regulatory environment   Brokered   I don’t have the figures in front of me  It is in the dozens, and   they lend very similar amounts  We have looked at some of the activity  It is very regular   activity They don’t seem to lend to that many for a period of time  They apparently have lines   of credit with several, but they choose to lend fairly repeatedly to individual participants        August 11–12, 2009 47 of 165   I am saying that we are far from perfect competition  That is a   market with search frictions and dominated by counterparty credit risk  And it is likely that these   impede pure rate-based competition that we would see if we alleviated the need to engage in   counterparty credit risk—a screening They could widen the net of potential counterparties to   hundreds and thousands if they were alleviated from counterparty credit risk if these   collateralized fed funds trades were available to them  The issue is, How can we get competition   so that in the interest rate on reserves that the Fed is paying to banks is a floor for society more   generally?   What Seth is explaining is very similar to the California energy   market, where only one among dozens of generators would have to go out of service in order for   maximum capacity to be used for all other generators        August 11–12, 2009 48 of 165  We gathered that information today with error, and I think we can   improve it if we work with the banks  It is with some delay, so the brokers are real time, which   is a benefit           August 11–12, 2009 49 of 165 "
8698,2010-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The last time that reserve   collateral accounts, or RCAs, were discussed, at the November 2009 FOMC meeting,   a decision was made to delay further operational work on them to avoid any   contention for resources with the implementation efforts for the term deposit facility    As the TDF work subsequently progressed, an RCA planning group was convened    This group consists of staff from all the relevant System groups and is considering in   detail the operational and policy issues associated with their implementation  This   group has explored all the expected operational implications of establishing and   March 16, 2010 9 of 146    managing RCAs and has found no major impediments to their implementation  In   particular, the group has found that RCAs would likely be straightforward to   implement and operate using existing Federal Reserve platforms with only relatively   minor changes to accounting and reserves procedures  The legal aspects of RCAs are   clearly an important element in their creation, and Board and Federal Reserve Bank   of New York attorneys have written a draft agreement under which the accounts and   their transactions would be governed  The degree to which RCAs would fulfill their   goal of a tighter link between interest on reserves and market rates is uncertain; past   interviews with market participants are encouraging but not definitive  I now turn to   a summary of the RCA policy goal and how RCAs would be expected to achieve   their goal; my remarks summarize a memo that was distributed to FOMC members   last Wednesday            The large negative spread between the interest rate paid on excess reserves and   the effective federal funds rate has raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s ability   to remove monetary policy accommodation smoothly using interest on reserves alone    One explanation given for the size of this spread focuses on the limited nature of the   competition among buyers of funds sold by the government-sponsored enterprises, or   GSEs  The GSEs, who are ineligible to earn interest directly from the Federal   Reserve and are significant sellers of federal funds, considerably reduced their lists of   approved counterparties and credit lines starting in September 2008  As a result,   competition for their funds has fallen, and buyers are able to purchase funds from   GSEs at rates well below the IOER rate   If RCAs were made available, GSEs and potentially even some banking   institutions that lend at rates below the IOER rate would have the option of selling   funds to banks that owned RCAs, where the funds in such accounts would serve as   collateral for the repayment of the principal amount of the loan  The dramatically   reduced level of credit risk on these transactions could prompt GSEs to lend to an   expanded set of counterparties for potentially larger amounts, thereby improving the   competitive environment for the sales of funds  Under more competitive conditions,   trading in federal funds would be expected to move closer to the IOER rate     Information obtained through a limited number of staff conversations with two of   the GSEs suggests a strong interest on their part as lenders in the RCA concept, but   conversations with a small number of depository institutions have not yielded much   concrete information about their potential interest as borrowers under these   arrangements  Thus, a significant outstanding question is the likely extent of   participation of borrowers in RCAs, which could ultimately determine their impact on   the federal funds rate  Notably, however, all of the interviewees felt that RCAs   would narrow the spread between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate  One   possible drawback of RCAs is that, if they work as intended, there would likely be   fewer sales of fed funds by GSEs to banks  As transactions of this type currently   dominate the brokered trades used in the Desk’s calculation of the effective federal   funds rate, RCAs could make measurement of the effective federal funds rate less   reliable     March 16, 2010 10 of 146                One question that should be addressed is whether the RCA program would be   needed if the Fed plans to conduct reverse repos with the GSEs  The following   reasoning suggests that RCAs would indeed continue to serve their policy objective in   that case  First, it is not certain that an RRP program arranged by the Fed, where we   expect to conduct term RPs with periodic auctions to settle on T+1 via the triparty   repo mechanism, would necessarily be structured to fit with the GSEs' particular   investment preferences  GSEs clearly prefer a same-day settlement, overnight option,   which we are unlikely to accommodate with RRPs  In addition, because GSEs cannot   incur daylight overdrafts, they would prefer RCAs at a given interest rate because   they control the timing of return of funds, while in the triparty repo mechanism they   have less control  It is also not clear that GSEs would necessarily be able to   participate in RRPs on the scale they would desire  GSE lending volume has   fluctuated between $50 and $100 billion during the past six months and appears to   vary by $10 to $20 billion in a typical month  RCAs may be better suited to handle   such short-term fluctuations in supply than RRPs, which are targeted toward less   volatile supply  It is also not clear what the long-run disposition of an RRP program   will be, in terms of size, whereas RCAs represent a change in the account framework   that would be expected to last as long as there was market demand for the product,   regardless of what we might prefer to do with discretionary operations  Finally,   RCAs put their use at the discretion of the seller of funds, whether it be a bank or a   GSE, while RRPs will be conducted with a specified dealer, money market fund, or   GSE counterparty at the Fed’s discretion   Staff recommends that policymakers ask the planning group to proceed with the   following steps  Complete the necessary legal agreements; enter into discussions   with the FDIC regarding the treatment of RCAs in bank resolutions; share the term   sheet of the legal agreements with GSEs on a confidential basis to allow them to write   the bilateral legal agreements that they would need in order to enter into RCA   arrangements with depository institutions; and, once the RCA proposal is made public   through the publication of the minutes of the March FOMC meeting or another   vehicle, engage the GSEs and their possible counterparties as needed to better   determine their interest in entering into RCA agreements   The planning group would expect to be able to report back at the April FOMC   meeting, and if the RCAs appear to be desired by GSEs and their counterparties, the   group would recommend going forward with publishing a notice for public comment   to amend Regulation D prior to a final decision to make RCAs available  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  That concludes our prepared remarks    Yes, Mr Chairman, and that would also involve essentially   making the concept public to facilitate the discussions with the GSEs and depository institutions    But then we’d report back to the Committee regarding the outcome of all of those discussions, at   which time we’d have a more precise view on how the market would receive RCAs   March 16, 2010 12 of 146     The observation is that they are concerned about the risk  It’s not   necessary that they can unilaterally change the competitive conditions that they face  So the fact   March 16, 2010 15 of 146    that they shed almost half of their counterparties after September 2008 is consistent with their   being very concerned about their risk  The questions are whether any one individual GSE can   change competitive conditions sufficiently to get higher interest rates, and what is essentially the   elasticity of the interest rates that it would face if it expanded its counterparties  That does not,   however, suggest that it wouldn’t be beneficial to both the GSEs and, more importantly, the   market for funds altogether, if there were a more competitive environment for the bidding for   funds  The Federal Reserve is paying 25 basis points to the banks for holding this risk-free asset,   and that is not getting passed on, through a competitive mechanism, to nonbanks  The RCA   program is attempting to achieve that  No individual GSE can affect competitive conditions very   much by adding or dropping one counterparty    Your point about the allocation of rents between the GSEs and the   banks is well taken  But the point of the RCAs is to create a competitive environment for the   purchase of funds generally  And this will set a harder floor on rates as conveyed by the IOER   rate  Again, the problem is essentially that the Fed is paying 25 basis points, and yet that   monetary impetus is not being passed on to nonbanks generally  In a frictionless banking   system, the funding rate for banks would be bid up to 25 basis points  That underlies Jeff’s   comments that the IOER rate should be the funding rate of banks  In fact, it’s the rate that banks   earn on a certain asset, but through competition we would expect the funding rate to be equal to   the IOER rate  In fact, it’s well below the IOER rate now, and so RCAs are intended to make the   link much tighter   Another point is with regard to the volatility of that spread between the funds rate and the   IOER rate  With a more competitive environment at such high levels of reserves, we expect very   little volatility between the market rates and the IOER rate, such as we’ve seen just recently   Finally, on measurement, and perhaps Brian can talk about this, we are considering better   ways of measuring market rates generally, and we expect that the RCA would lead to higher   market rates not just in the measured effective federal funds rate but in repo rates and euro dollar   rates   March 16, 2010 19 of 146     We discussed it  At current rates of euro dollars and RPs, with   RCAs banks would certainly start borrowing euro dollars and RPs  That would increase demand   in those markets and lead those rates to rise as well  So that’s a fundamental linkage between   those market rates    I think that whether we use reverse RPs, term deposit facility, or   RCAs, the GSEs will have to get paid a higher rate for the federal funds rate to rise  An element   common to reverse RPs, RCAs, and term deposits is that GSEs would receive higher interest   rates in the market by their counterparties—under RRPs, it would be by the Federal Reserve—  but the intent is to raise market rates in a way that they would earn higher rates in the market    Again, when the Congress gave the Fed the authority to pay interest on reserves, the idea was to   avoid the reserve tax for banks, and essentially it was an oversight that many other entities—the   Treasury, the GSEs, the World Bank, and so on—had balances at the Federal Reserve, but they   were not reserve balances  The fact that the GSEs are heavy users of the federal funds market is   essentially an unhappy coincidence  What we’d simply like to achieve is a very competitive   environment when they’re out selling their funds, and that competitive environment would be   conveyed to all sellers of funds who are funding banks  It would be essentially a healthier   market overall and not something that would benefit the GSEs necessarily  So we think it’s   perfectly consistent with the legislative mandate  "
