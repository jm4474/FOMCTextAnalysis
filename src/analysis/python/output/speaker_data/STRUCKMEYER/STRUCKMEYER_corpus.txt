 Correct Most of them are not in the CPI     Your next two exhibits detail the supply-side   assumptions of the staff forecast, starting with the projection of structural labor  productivity  In our analysis, structural labor productivity growth is defined as the  increment to labor productivity that can be sustained over time  It is a medium- to  long-run concept that attempts to eliminate the bulk of the cyclical influences on  productivity growth  As shown on the top right, structural labor productivity growth  can, in turn, be decomposed into the contributions from capital deepening, labor  quality, and structural multifactor productivity growth       As indicated in the middle left panel, the recovery that has occurred in the level of   business capital spending over the past four years translates into a pickup in the   January 31, 2006 19 of 106    growth of capital services, although not to the pace that prevailed during the boom  years of 1995 to 2000  The contribution of capital deepening to structural  productivity growth—that is, the product of the growth in capital services per hour  and the capital share of output—picks up gradually over the next two years  Note in  the middle right panel that the bulk of this contribution comes from investments in  information technology—as has been the case for all of this decade      In contrast, the pace of growth in structural multifactor productivity—shown in   the bottom left—has greatly exceeded the pace over the 1995 to 2000 period  This is  just the manifestation at the aggregate level of the driving forces shown in Dave’s  scatter plot  However, we have allowed for slightly slower growth in 2006 and 2007  than in the preceding years as the marginal gains from additional organizational  improvements and embodied technical change begin to wane  In addition, as noted in  the right, we’ve seen some leveling-off in expenditures on research and development  lately, which may well manifest itself in a somewhat slower pace of technological  change in the years ahead     Your next exhibit presents our estimates of potential output growth  As shown on   line 1, we expect potential real GDP to expand at a 3¼ percent pace over the next two  years  As you can see on line 2, total potential hours worked—or trend labor input— is expected to slow somewhat  Although population growth is expected to be well  maintained, the trends in both labor force participation and the average workweek are  offsetting factors  As we’ve noted before, the downtrend in the labor force  participation rate (shown in the middle left) mainly reflects the changing  demographic composition of the workforce  The estimated trend in the workweek (in  the middle right panel) shifted down in 2001—reflecting the introduction of NAICS  in the payroll survey—and is expected to fall at about the same pace in 2006 and  2007 as it has since 2001     The implications of these supply-side assumptions for the labor market are shown   in the bottom two panels  Although nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase briskly  in the near term, we expect gains to slow progressively over the next two years,  reflecting the moderation in the pace of economic growth and the slower growth in  the potential labor force that I just described  Indeed, we expect trend payroll growth  to average only 100,000 per month over the next two years  As shown on the bottom  right, the unemployment rate holds fairly steady this year and next  Given the pace of  economic growth last year, our model of Okun’s law was surprised by the extent of  the decline in the unemployment rate—the gap between the red and black lines  We  are expecting this error to be worked off over the course of this year, and in 2007 the  unemployment rate moves in sync with the Okun’s law simulation      Your next exhibit presents the outlook for the growth in labor compensation  In   the January Greenbook, we projected hourly compensation, as measured by both the  ECI and P&C compensation per hour, to accelerate over the next two years  We  think that continued strong growth in structural labor productivity will elevate wage  demands, while labor market slack will be a relatively neutral influence on   January 31, 2006 20 of 106    compensation growth  Inflation expectations to date have remained anchored, but we  have allowed for some pass-through into wages of the higher price inflation in 2004  and 2005       This morning’s reading on the ECI showed that hourly compensation in private   industry increased 3 percent in the 12 months ending in December—the same as the  judgmental projection in the January Greenbook  However, as you can see in the  bottom left, our econometric equation for the ECI has overpredicted the actual growth  in compensation since the middle of 2004, possibly suggesting that our estimated  NAIRU of 5 percent is too high  In looking at the range of econometric wage and  price models that we follow, the evidence on a change in the NAIRU is mixed  We  have noted a tendency for some models to overpredict inflation lately  But as shown  in the bottom right, the random nature (and the smaller absolute size) of the errors  from one of our better reduced-form price equations does not yet suggest the need to  lower our estimate of the NAIRU  I will return to the implications of this assumption  later in my remarks      Your next exhibit presents the outlook for inflation  Recent readings on headline   inflation (shown in the top left) have remained at the high end of the elevated range  that has prevailed since 2004  Those readings reflect mainly the direct effects of  higher energy prices, which have increased at an average pace of 20 percent per year  over the past two years  In contrast, we have seen some moderation in the pace of  core consumer price inflation, with the twelve-month change in both the core PCE  and the core CPI indexes slowing to about 2 percent       Looking ahead, we have had to cope with somewhat greater pressures on inflation   in this Greenbook  These pressures stem mainly from the upward revisions to our  projections of crude oil prices and core nonfuel import prices that Dave discussed   As a result of these changes, the moderation in PCE energy prices is somewhat less  than in past Greenbooks, and we anticipate greater spillovers on the prices of other  industrial materials (shown in the middle right)  On net, we expect core PCE prices  (line 4 in the bottom left panel) to increase 2¼ percent this year before decelerating to  1¾ percent in 2007 as the influence of these cost shocks recedes     The bottom right panel shows two alternative simulations that address key risks to   the inflation outlook  The adverse shocks simulation assumes that the economy is hit  with additional increases in the prices of oil, non-oil imports, and industrial materials  that match those that prevailed in 2004  Under the assumption that the funds rate  remains on its baseline path, core PCE inflation moves up to about 2½ percent in  2006 and 2007 (the red line)  In contrast, as I noted earlier, our estimate of the  NAIRU may be too high, and a second simulation examines the implications of a  4¼ percent NAIRU—essentially one standard deviation below our current estimate   Under this assumption, core PCE price inflation falls to 1½ percent by the end of next  year  Even though these two simulations embody some fairly large differences in  assumptions from the Greenbook baseline, both simulations remain well inside a   January 31, 2006 21 of 106    70 percent confidence interval about our forecast  Nathan will now continue with our  presentation       Well, the 2001 effect was the incorporation of the NAICS   classifications into the payroll survey  So it was just a methodological change that was realized     It’s discontinuous  If you look at the two slopes, they’re about the   same before and after, but there is discontinuity in 2001     Not to my knowledge      Yes
