9269,2011-08-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would echo a couple of comments already   made in some brief remarks  First, items 1 through 5, as noted, are fine  They seem like, as   others have commented, very practical ways forward   I’d like to make a comment just briefly about item number 8  Well, indeed, we do have   history establishing such a liquidity facility for money market funds  It would seem that we   should have a quite high threshold before we would think about enacting another program under   section 13(3)  We do know how it functions  We could stand it up quite quickly, but as   President Plosser and others have noted, there are two broad categories of money market funds,   those that are Treasury-only and others that hold more generalized instruments  It would be   quite helpful, it would seem, if we were going to go down that path, to be seeing an advent of   August 1, 2011 32 of 53              stress broadly in the money market fund space as opposed to just in Treasury-only funds  In that   regard, it would seem like, if that were eventuating, that would be particularly helpful if the   Treasury were witnessing and were commenting on issues that concern them about Treasury-  only money market funds and at the same time we had a similarly rising sense of angst from a   systemic point of view about money market funds more broadly   The last comment I would make is to echo a point made by President Kocherlakota,   especially in items 6 through 10 but elsewhere in the memo as well  It would be helpful, it   would seem, to consider a scale limit and to what extent our participation in taking on board   defaulted securities for our own account would start to cast a hue that would be other than just   normal market function and could communicate in fairly subtle ways—perhaps more subtle   ways—our intent to have an effect other than to help with the easy function of markets and the   diminishing of systemic risk  Thank you very much  "
