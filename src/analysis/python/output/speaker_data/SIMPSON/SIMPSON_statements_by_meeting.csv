4158,2000-10-03,"  Carol is passing out some materials that I will refer to in my remarks2   Last week, you were sent two papers representing the first installment in  the Committee’s wide-ranging SOMA project  The other parts of this broad  effort--covering selection criteria for alternative Federal Reserve assets,  potential alternative market instruments, and the role for the discount window-- will be discussed at the next couple FOMC meetings          The first paper sent last week contains forecasts of the federal budget   surplus going out a number of years, along with accompanying expectations for  the contraction of the stock of Treasury debt and rise in the System’s share of  that dwindling stock  The second examines the recent performance of the  Treasury securities market and prospects for that market, including the  System’s ability to conduct operations in Treasury securities going forward  I  would now like to summarize briefly our findings, using the handout containing  exhibits from those papers     The upper panel of your first exhibit illustrates forecasts of the cumulative   surplus in the federal budget over the coming decade under different scenarios  for fiscal policy and assumptions for economic growth  The three solid lines  illustrate outcomes under three fiscal scenarios and the middle path for real  output growth--4-1/2 percent per year, the Board staff’s assessment of structural  output growth in the current year  Fiscal policy A represents a current services  path, and does not allow for any discretionary adjustments of tax or spending  policy to rising underlying surpluses  Fiscal policy B is based on future  Congresses and presidents using the on-budget portion to finance tax cuts and  spending initiatives, but not to touch the corresponding off-budget portion--an  outcome that seems to have gained fairly widespread support recently  The  third fiscal policy, policy C, goes beyond B and allows workers to devote two  percentage points of their Social Security payroll taxes to private retirement  accounts  One does not need to buy into the specifics of any of these fiscal  alternatives but rather to regard them as proxies for a range of plausible  outcomes  The paper also considers alternative output paths based on structural                                                               2 A copy of the two staff papers, distributed to the Committee on September 27 and 29, 2000, have  been placed in Committee files  A copy of the exhibits used by Mr Simpson during his briefing is   appended to this transcript  (Appendix 2)      87  growth being a percentage point higher and a percentage point lower than the   4-1/2 percent middle case  The effects of these alternative output paths are  shown in the upper and lower ends of the shaded portions of the chart            As you can see from the chart, the cumulative surpluses continue to rise   under all of the possibilities contemplated in this study  The bottom panel  translates these surpluses into paydowns of marketable debt  Under fiscal  policy B and the middle path for output growth, cumulative surpluses reach  about $3 trillion by 2010, and would leave only about $1/2 trillion of  outstanding marketable Treasury debt in that year        To get a sense of what these projections imply for System operations in the   Treasury securities market, we also forecasted the System’s balance sheet under  the alternative paths for the economy  A number of factors affect the size of the  System’s balance sheet at any point in time, such as the behavior of reservable  deposits and the Treasury’s cash balance at the Fed  But over time the System’s  balance sheet has been driven by the demand for currency, and we expect this to  continue going forward  Using our projections for reserves and currency, the  top panel of your second exhibit illustrates the path of System ownership of  Treasury debt under the current limit on per-issue holdings, which amounts to  approximately a 25 percent share of marketable Treasury debt  Under fiscal  policy B and the middle output path, the System’s holdings would reach that  limit in about three years, and thereafter the System would need to liquidate  Treasuries as total outstandings fell--absent, of course, an upward revision to  the limit  The middle panel illustrates that, under these assumptions, System  holdings of other assets begin to build fairly rapidly starting in three years, and  by 2010 would account for more than 80 percent of System assets  These dates  could be brought still closer by additional dollarization abroad and the payment  of interest on required reserves, which would boost our liabilities and assets   Thus, the time for the System to be ready to adopt alternatives to Treasury  securities for supplying a permanent source of reserves to the banking system  does not seem very far off     Treasury securities have served the System’s needs, and those of a wide   variety of other holders, extremely well, given their very high liquidity and  unrivaled safety  Moreover, the associated well-developed RP market in  Treasury securities has been important for temporary System transactions   However, the large swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus has  already had a notable effect on the Treasury market, prompting various  adjustments by the Desk  The third exhibit is intended to broadly represent the  performance of the Treasury securities market over recent years  It shows bid- ask spreads quoted in the interdealer market in bills, the upper panel, and  coupons, the lower panel  There has been an upward drift in this measure,  which suggests a general erosion of liquidity in virtually all sectors of the  Treasury debt market  Over this period, some notable disturbances have sent  bid-ask spreads soaring, such as the financial market turmoil in the fall of 1998,      88  but these have been followed by partial recoveries, in part owing to adaptations  by market participants and the Desk  Looking ahead, the kind of steady  contraction in Treasury securities that we foresee is likely to be accompanied by  further erosion in the depth and liquidity of that market and greater volatility  and vulnerability to shocks     As noted, the Desk, in response to occasional disturbances in the Treasury   securities market and the general deterioration of liquidity and depth, has taken  various steps to relieve pressures on the Treasury securities and RP markets and  to facilitate its daily operations  These have included suspending bill purchases  in 1998 and 1999, dividing coupon purchases into more tranches and spreading  them over weeks or months, broadening the pool of RP collateral, and imposing  limits on acquisitions of Treasury securities in auctions and in the secondary  market  Prospectively, we expect that in the coming years the Desk will be able  to continue to conduct a considerable volume of operations in the Treasury  securities market  Over time, though, these transactions will be done at greater  cost and with a greater impact on Treasury securities market, and at some point  the System will need to cut back on transactions in this market and begin to rely  on alternatives       Finally, I have attached a list of System staff members who have   participated in this portion of the overall project  Thank you           Right     Yes  Actually, the middle panel is more of a mirror image of the upper   panel  What we have done in the upper panel is to forecast the stock of Treasury debt and also the   growth in our balance sheet, which has been driven almost mainly by currency demand        Right  This project was broken up into several pieces  We thought the   first step was to get some idea of what the Treasury market is going to look like and what kinds of   constraints we are going to face if we choose to continue to rely on that market in the coming years    And the tough stuff is yet to come!     We're not saying that yet!     That's right  "
