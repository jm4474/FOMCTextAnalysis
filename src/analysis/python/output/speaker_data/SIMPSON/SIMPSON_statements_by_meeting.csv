1291,1980-01-08, That's right Thus far we feel that we don't have enough historical experience to seasonally adjust the other transactions balances that go into M-1B 
4462,1992-02-04," Well, it's really hard to pinpoint In dealing with the corporate sector, we certainly hear a lot of stories about firms wanting to strengthen their balance sheets And the announcements of reverse LBOs and so forth suggest that there still is more room to go in that area What is going to constitute the new norm once all this adjustment occurs is an open question Personally, I'm not so sure they will go back to the leveraging ratios of the late '70s or early '80s The household sector is even a little more difficult to evaluate We do hear a lot of stories about individuals straining under the weight of their debt burdens and holding the line and restraining themselves But there again, I'm just not sure-- "
5408,1995-07-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   This is an exercise using the quarterly macroeconometric model What is assumed here is that you are willing to lock in inflation basically at current or recent levels and to hold    7/5-6/95  output at potential Then, in the case of the so-called baseline here, we are taking the CBO's current raw estimate of the fiscal deficit So basically, the things I just mentioned are exogenous to the model the fiscal deficit as well as the inflation rate and the output levels you are assumed to accept Then we solve for the federal funds rate Basically, it's the long bond rate that is driving spending and it's the funds rate or the bill rate and other short-term rates that have the biggest influence on the bond rate   Yes, right   Yes   No I might also point out that in this exercise the simulation starts in the second quarter It doesn't start in the third quarter, so it doesn't acknowledge the large declines that we had in the second quarter   But you're right In the model, the longer- term rates that relate to housing and capital spending are driving the economy The decline in the shorter maturities would not have that much effect on spending in the model   That's in the eyes of the model "
5791,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the handout called  ""Material for Staff Presentation on Money and Debt Ranges"" [Statement and related handout--  see Appendix]   Right, the points would be farther apart   It could alter the slope    7/1-2/97   Right As was mentioned in the Bluebook, we thought that M2  velocity was being boosted somewhat this year by continuing very large inflows to mutual funds,  presumably involving diversions from M2 accounts   If you look at the upper panel, an alternative interpretation would be  that the big upward movement in the early part of the 1990s has slowed rather than come to an  end   As I mentioned, with a supply shock of this sort and particularly if  the Committee wanted to see more of that shock show through in terms of real output, we would  get more nominal GDP and more money growth   That is basically in keeping with the slightly larger deficit that we  are projecting for 1998   It has our assumed fiscal package "
6153,1999-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman   The Committee must decide whether to adopt the provisional  money and debt ranges it chose last July or to modify them In the  Bluebook, we did not present alternatives to the provisional ranges  because of the Committee’s previous skepticism about the reliability of the  relationship between these aggregates and economic performance and  hence their usefulness as guides to policy Instead, the Committee has for  some time chosen ranges for money that it viewed to be benchmarks under  conditions of price stability and of velocity behavior that conforms to  typical historical experience The Committee has not found that this  practice has impeded its ability to extract and use information from the  monetary aggregates as an input to its decisionmaking In the case of debt,  the Committee has chosen ranges based on expected growth--not the price  stability benchmark--but the inconsistency between the money and debt  ranges has not been a problem Today, I would like to review the staff’s  projections and to discuss recent experience with money as an economic  indicator   Your first exhibit presents the provisional ranges and the staff’s  projections of money and debt growth for 1999 consistent with the  Greenbook economic forecast 3/ Also shown are actual outcomes in  1998 The staff foresees growth in both M2 and M3 slowing this year, but  remaining rapid with respect to their provisional price stability ranges and  with respect to growth in nominal GDP Debt of domestic nonfinancial  sectors also is projected to decelerate this year but to finish the year  around the 5 percent midpoint of its provisional range   We believe that the behavior of money market mutual funds is an  important element in understanding recent and projected declines in  monetary velocity As shown in the lower panel of the exhibit, money  funds in both M2 and M3 have grown at double-digit rates in recent years,  and both types of funds registered a pronounced acceleration last year Of  course, if growth in these components came solely at the expense of the  other components in M2 and M3, their strength would not have  implications for overall growth in money However, we are of the view   3/ A copy of the material used by Mr Simpson is appended to the transcript (Appendix 3)     2/2-3/99 75   that much of the expansion in money funds in recent years reflects other  influences that have had the effect of boosting growth in M2 and M3   At the M2 level, we think that money funds may have been  benefiting from efforts by households to diversify portfolios swollen by  the surge in equity values Illustrative of this process is the top panel of  your next exhibit showing shares of mutual fund assets Even with the  hefty double-digit increases in money funds, the money fund share of total  mutual fund assets had been drifting down until the middle of last year It  turned up in the third quarter amid the market turmoil and heightened  demand for liquid and less risky assets and then turned back down in the  fourth quarter Looking ahead, in an environment of essentially stagnant  equity prices, as assumed in the staff forecast, growth of total assets will  diminish But investors are expected to view money fund returns as more  attractive in relative terms than they have in the recent past and to seek to  rebuild somewhat the money fund portfolio share In short, we foresee  money funds continuing to grow fairly rapidly, lifting M2 growth again  this year   As a consequence, M2 velocity should decline further this year even  though stable short-term interest rates imply little change in opportunity  costs, as shown in the bottom panel of the chart The 2 percent expected  drop in velocity and the staff’s forecast of 4 percent growth in nominal  GDP imply the 6 percent forecast for M2 in 1999   Turning to M3 and Exhibit 3, money market mutual funds are  believed to have contributed to growth in this aggregate beyond their  impact on M2 In particular, those funds in M3 only, so-called  institution-only funds, have become an ever-popular cash management  instrument, substituting on business balance sheets for direct holdings of  money market assets outside M3, such as Treasury bills, as well as other  balances in M3 Firms can outsource this function to money funds and  thereby dispense with in-house time and effort required for the frequent  placing of liquid balances in the market We believe that this trend will  continue for the foreseeable future, boosting M3; however, with no further  declines in money market interest rates, and thus no appreciable spreads  favoring money funds reemerging, money funds in M3 only should  decelerate from last year   Another factor that boosted M3 growth last year was a surge in  bank credit and associated funding needs, shown in the bar chart in the  middle of Exhibit 3 This was caused in part by the disruptions to  financial markets beginning late in the summer that led some businesses to  tap bank lines instead of market sources and banks to hold rather than  securitize loans and to acquire securities having unusually large spreads  In the less turbulent market setting anticipated for the current year, we are     2/2-3/99 76   forecasting that growth in bank credit will slow some, contributing to a  slowing in growth in overall depository credit, the bottom panel As a  result, growth in depository credit should move closer to that of total debt  of domestic nonfinancial sectors With the distribution of funding between  M3 and other sources similar to last year, we are led to a still considerable  8 percent expansion in M3 this year, implying more than a 3½ percent  drop in its velocity, which is smaller than in 1998   The anticipated slowing of debt growth this year shown in the chart-­ to 5¼ percent--is accounted for both by a larger run-off of federal debt,  owing to a $100 billion projected fiscal surplus, and to some moderation  in business and household borrowing Nonetheless, growth in total debt  again exceeds that of nominal GDP by about the same margin as in 1998,  as spending remains tilted toward credit-intensive consumer and producer  durable goods and housing and as debt-financed merger activity stays  brisk   Last year, both money and income growth exceeded staff  expectations, resurfacing the question of whether the monetary aggregates  may have become more reliable as indicators of economic performance  As I noted earlier, some of the unusually strong growth in M2 and M3 last  year reflected not only income growth but also outsized declines in their  velocities, much of which had not been anticipated Still, the surprises in  money and income were large and correlated, however loosely Certainly,  the rapid money growth in the fall was suggesting that the banking system  was able to intermediate credit without serious strains   To examine the question of whether the monetary and debt aggregates  may have become more useful as indicators, I have presented some  evidence on Exhibit 4--evidence that should be regarded as illustrative and  not definitive of indicator properties Each panel contains the coefficients  and t-statistics for sixteen-quarter rolling regressions that relate growth in  nominal GDP on a quarterly basis to growth in money or debt on a  contemporaneous and one-quarter-lagged basis  Large, and positive,  values for the coefficients and t-statistics imply value of the aggregate as  an indicator of quarterly growth in nominal GDP growth As shown in the  top panel for M2, the last time the t-statistics approached the important  level of 2 was in the mid-1980s In recent years, coefficients have been  very small and statistically insignificant at standard levels, suggesting by  this metric that M2 has had little value as an indicator of nominal GDP   Moreover, the story doesn’t change much for M3 and debt, shown in  the middle and bottom panels, respectively It is worth noting that these  are quite simple statistical exercises and there may be times when  surprises in the monetary aggregates, allowing for special factors that may  be affecting velocity, are giving off clearer signals that the economy is     2/2-3/99 77   departing from expectations, especially when those surprises are  corroborated by other indicators Thus, at this point we are hard pressed  to suggest that you treat the broad monetary or debt aggregates any  differently as indicators than you have in recent years    The coefficient has turned negative    That’s a possibility, but it is rather hard to come up with the   economic intuition as to why that might be happening  "
6454,2000-10-03,"  Carol is passing out some materials that I will refer to in my remarks2   Last week, you were sent two papers representing the first installment in  the Committee’s wide-ranging SOMA project  The other parts of this broad  effort--covering selection criteria for alternative Federal Reserve assets,  potential alternative market instruments, and the role for the discount window-- will be discussed at the next couple FOMC meetings          The first paper sent last week contains forecasts of the federal budget   surplus going out a number of years, along with accompanying expectations for  the contraction of the stock of Treasury debt and rise in the System’s share of  that dwindling stock  The second examines the recent performance of the  Treasury securities market and prospects for that market, including the  System’s ability to conduct operations in Treasury securities going forward  I  would now like to summarize briefly our findings, using the handout containing  exhibits from those papers     The upper panel of your first exhibit illustrates forecasts of the cumulative   surplus in the federal budget over the coming decade under different scenarios  for fiscal policy and assumptions for economic growth  The three solid lines  illustrate outcomes under three fiscal scenarios and the middle path for real  output growth--4-1/2 percent per year, the Board staff’s assessment of structural  output growth in the current year  Fiscal policy A represents a current services  path, and does not allow for any discretionary adjustments of tax or spending  policy to rising underlying surpluses  Fiscal policy B is based on future  Congresses and presidents using the on-budget portion to finance tax cuts and  spending initiatives, but not to touch the corresponding off-budget portion--an  outcome that seems to have gained fairly widespread support recently  The  third fiscal policy, policy C, goes beyond B and allows workers to devote two  percentage points of their Social Security payroll taxes to private retirement  accounts  One does not need to buy into the specifics of any of these fiscal  alternatives but rather to regard them as proxies for a range of plausible  outcomes  The paper also considers alternative output paths based on structural                                                               2 A copy of the two staff papers, distributed to the Committee on September 27 and 29, 2000, have  been placed in Committee files  A copy of the exhibits used by Mr Simpson during his briefing is   appended to this transcript  (Appendix 2)      87  growth being a percentage point higher and a percentage point lower than the   4-1/2 percent middle case  The effects of these alternative output paths are  shown in the upper and lower ends of the shaded portions of the chart            As you can see from the chart, the cumulative surpluses continue to rise   under all of the possibilities contemplated in this study  The bottom panel  translates these surpluses into paydowns of marketable debt  Under fiscal  policy B and the middle path for output growth, cumulative surpluses reach  about $3 trillion by 2010, and would leave only about $1/2 trillion of  outstanding marketable Treasury debt in that year        To get a sense of what these projections imply for System operations in the   Treasury securities market, we also forecasted the System’s balance sheet under  the alternative paths for the economy  A number of factors affect the size of the  System’s balance sheet at any point in time, such as the behavior of reservable  deposits and the Treasury’s cash balance at the Fed  But over time the System’s  balance sheet has been driven by the demand for currency, and we expect this to  continue going forward  Using our projections for reserves and currency, the  top panel of your second exhibit illustrates the path of System ownership of  Treasury debt under the current limit on per-issue holdings, which amounts to  approximately a 25 percent share of marketable Treasury debt  Under fiscal  policy B and the middle output path, the System’s holdings would reach that  limit in about three years, and thereafter the System would need to liquidate  Treasuries as total outstandings fell--absent, of course, an upward revision to  the limit  The middle panel illustrates that, under these assumptions, System  holdings of other assets begin to build fairly rapidly starting in three years, and  by 2010 would account for more than 80 percent of System assets  These dates  could be brought still closer by additional dollarization abroad and the payment  of interest on required reserves, which would boost our liabilities and assets   Thus, the time for the System to be ready to adopt alternatives to Treasury  securities for supplying a permanent source of reserves to the banking system  does not seem very far off     Treasury securities have served the System’s needs, and those of a wide   variety of other holders, extremely well, given their very high liquidity and  unrivaled safety  Moreover, the associated well-developed RP market in  Treasury securities has been important for temporary System transactions   However, the large swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus has  already had a notable effect on the Treasury market, prompting various  adjustments by the Desk  The third exhibit is intended to broadly represent the  performance of the Treasury securities market over recent years  It shows bid- ask spreads quoted in the interdealer market in bills, the upper panel, and  coupons, the lower panel  There has been an upward drift in this measure,  which suggests a general erosion of liquidity in virtually all sectors of the  Treasury debt market  Over this period, some notable disturbances have sent  bid-ask spreads soaring, such as the financial market turmoil in the fall of 1998,      88  but these have been followed by partial recoveries, in part owing to adaptations  by market participants and the Desk  Looking ahead, the kind of steady  contraction in Treasury securities that we foresee is likely to be accompanied by  further erosion in the depth and liquidity of that market and greater volatility  and vulnerability to shocks     As noted, the Desk, in response to occasional disturbances in the Treasury   securities market and the general deterioration of liquidity and depth, has taken  various steps to relieve pressures on the Treasury securities and RP markets and  to facilitate its daily operations  These have included suspending bill purchases  in 1998 and 1999, dividing coupon purchases into more tranches and spreading  them over weeks or months, broadening the pool of RP collateral, and imposing  limits on acquisitions of Treasury securities in auctions and in the secondary  market  Prospectively, we expect that in the coming years the Desk will be able  to continue to conduct a considerable volume of operations in the Treasury  securities market  Over time, though, these transactions will be done at greater  cost and with a greater impact on Treasury securities market, and at some point  the System will need to cut back on transactions in this market and begin to rely  on alternatives       Finally, I have attached a list of System staff members who have   participated in this portion of the overall project  Thank you           Right     Yes  Actually, the middle panel is more of a mirror image of the upper   panel  What we have done in the upper panel is to forecast the stock of Treasury debt and also the   growth in our balance sheet, which has been driven almost mainly by currency demand        Right  This project was broken up into several pieces  We thought the   first step was to get some idea of what the Treasury market is going to look like and what kinds of   constraints we are going to face if we choose to continue to rely on that market in the coming years    And the tough stuff is yet to come!     We're not saying that yet!     That's right  "
