37,1987-08-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, our best guess was that under alternative ""B"" we'd have M2 growth of 5 percent and M3 growth of 5-1/2 percent; but, as you well know, there is a wide range of error around that As I said in my briefing and the Bluebook, that presumes that money and income grow a little more closely together than they have over the last couple of quarters That could fall short; I can't rule out that possibility The question is whether you would want to react; but with the aggregates after the ""as well as"" clause at the end of the sentence, I'm not sure how strong any reaction would be, in any case   Well, it's several months, clearly; as I think I indicated, whatever we do now will have its principal impact in the fourth quarter But it is also true that this goes the other way a little that is, whether incoming data that suggested the aggregates were running outside a range of 5 to 6 percent or 4 to 6 percent should have any influence on a proposal that Mr Sternlight might make on the borrowing objective is not quite the same as saying you're actually going to have the effect You can react and then assume that your effect would be somewhere down the road   Excuse me, Mr Chairman, I thought I heard the Committee express the view that they wanted to retain the ""as well as"" in front of the aggregates Normand, just read-- "
91,1987-09-22," As you saw in the Bluebook, we are projecting that the rise in interest rates, which is not all that large but is significant, would damp growth in M2 over coming months   If you abstract from September and you just have the fourth quarter Now we have this August-to-December target And then for next year, under the assumption of further moderate increases in interest rates, we would have M2 growth in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent kind of range That implies--   Well, first of all, the rate of increase in interest rates may not be quite as great And there are some things that seem to have been depressing M2 growth that we really couldn't account for this year and we are assuming that they won't be quite as active next year For example, the IRAs won't be around, and that might boost M2 growth a little; so, we have this assumed pickup in growth next year If that came about, with our GNP projection that would imply about a 2 percent increase in velocity But, remember, we're damping domestic demand here; we have slower domestic demand than we have GNP, so if you look at velocity from that perspective, it wouldn't be quite as big an increase That's not all that large an increase-- "
92,1987-09-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman As it turns out, and with no coordination ahead of time, I swear, the initial part of my briefing will deal with the question you asked and the answer will have no more precision than any [unintelligible] And then I want to go on and talk about perhaps some of the implications of any increase in the interest rates [Statement--see Appendix]   My comment, and it's my fault for putting it in the Bluebook, is that the 4-1/2 percent for M2 sounds excessively precise to me, given my knowledge of how these forecasts are put together I shouldn't have put it in there, I guess, and I wonder whether--   Yes, I wonder whether growth rates of from 4 to 6 percent or something like that wouldn't--   Yes, wouldn't that capture the spirit? Well, 4 to 6 percent would encourage--   Yes, it's 6 percent for M3 and 4-1/2 percent for M2   No I was actually thinking of 4 to 6, going to a range; but around 4, around 6 would be--   Yes   That's correct   Governor Angell's suggestion would be fine   Around 4 percent and around 6 percent, respectively   In the past when we have done this, we have explained it as a technical adjustment to keep the actual rates more closely centered around there   Yes, there would be some explanatory sentence "
148,1987-11-03," It was down 60 points at five after ten and bill rates were going back down again   It was essentially unchanged, but it had been down sharply earlier and has rallied   Seven percent or a little below I guess the equations that we estimated might say a bit below 7 percent--perhaps 6-3/4 or 6-7/8 percent "
149,1987-11-03," [Statement--see Appendix]   We would have growth picking up in the first couple of quarters of next year, primarily because of the effects of the lower interest rates in the fourth quarter For example, we have M2 picking up a little to a range of 6 to 7 percent in the first half of next year rather than the 6 percent we have this year We have M1  -27-    11/3/87  slowing down a little, but that's partly because demand deposits push up the fourth quarter Basically, we have these offsetting effects we have interest rates declining and that tends to push up growth, especially as the previous increase in interest rates wears off toward the end of this quarter and the beginning of next quarter; but, of course, we have lower income growth and reduced wealth, and that tends to keep monetary growth down We see some stronger growth--   On M1?   It's partly the monthly averaging results of the gyrations in demand deposits   In fact, we had demand deposits not declining until another week or two; they declined earlier than we were expecting, so I'd expect a lower November and then a little stronger growth rate in December It wouldn't affect the September-to-December path   I'm not sure you can But my thinking on this is that the important variable here, as to whether or not that happens or the degree to which that happens, is the way people are assessing the economy Think back a year or a year and a half ago, to 1986, when we had easier monetary policy, dollar declines, and the bond market declining for the first part of the year Now, oil prices and inflation expectations were important there; [they were expected] to be stable through the rest of the year even as the dollar continued to decline But that was in an environment in which inflation wasn't expected to pick up incoming data were suggesting very little inflation and the economy was widely viewed at that time as being quite weak So, I think if a dollar decline occurred in an environment in which people thought that the economy was weak or that the chance of a pickup in inflation wasn't large, then the bond market effect would be muted; but if the economy didn't look [weak], as a response to the stock market, for example, and the dollar started dropping rapidly, we could be back where we were this summer   We, of course, wrote ""B"" as $450 million because that's what we have been writing into the reserve path I think you can make an argument, and Peter perhaps will want to comment on this, that we really have been operating a bit easier than a $450 million borrowing level might suggest If you wanted to be certain, or as certain as you can be on this sort of thing, that the center of gravity for the funds rate really was below 7 percent and that it's more likely to average in the 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent area and touch 7 percent only seldomly, then a $400 million borrowing target might give you a little more assurance in that regard than a $450 million borrowing target And maybe that is a little more consistent with what we have actually been doing Peter, do you have more?    11/3/87   But not in the one that will be released Friday; you're right about that   Right, the one that will be released Friday leads up to the last meeting   It does have a paragraph in there, however, noting that the Committee has been consulting daily over this period; so it says that the Committee has been meeting and reviewing operations  -35-    11/3/87   Right; and that would be covered in the policy record associated with this meeting   In the one that comes out Friday, yes   A possibility, if the members would want it, would be to expand the paragraph that has been added [to the policy record that comes out Friday] that mentions the consultations We could reference something about some easing in policy to go with that language   That would be released this Friday   Well--   No, that's why I had in that reference to somewhat greater than expected If you keep reading, it says on lines 100 and 101 ""but more rapid growth is possible should preferences for liquidity be particularly strong"" That was exactly the point I was making You may not need the sentence on ""subject to unusual uncertainty"" if you have those sentences that follow "
206,1987-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Do you mean under which circumstance would the funds rate vary more?   It's hard to compare them; one is dollars and one is basis points   Okay The standard deviation of borrowings around the path assumption from early 1984 through mid-1987 has been about $170 million; excluding the year-end periods, it has been about $160 million The root mean square error of the funds rate around what the Desk thought it ought to be was about 20 basis points over that same period   I think that was true in only one reserve period-- right after the reserve period in late October and early November-- when there were more excess reserves than could be carried into the new period Since then, we have not observed that Excess reserves have varied over a wide range, but on average--mostly because of the carry-ins and carry-outs--they have not really differed substantially from what we might have expected over time But we can't see a real effect on excess reserves, and I don't think we see banks losing   Of course, we have tried to estimate the excess reserves that banks want to hold and have built that into the path or made allowance for it in putting out nonborrowed reserves So, in some sense, we are trying to compensate for this phenomenon that you are trying to identify But the excess reserve behavior has not been unusual even though the borrowing behavior has   A decision to go to nonborrowed or total reserve targeting presupposes the decision to target the aggregates very closely and to accept very wide swings in interest rates, as we had from 1979 to 1982, as a result of allowing overshoots or undershoots in required reserves to be absorbed in the borrowing to keep on a nonborrowed reserve objective We didn't have a sense that that's    12/15-16/87  what the Committee wanted to do; that was our presumption in writing the paper Perhaps that can be discussed in item number 6 on the agenda In discussing that item, if the Committee decided it wanted to target monetary aggregates very closely, we could come up with that kind of alternative But an alternative of nonborrowed or total reserve targeting presupposes that you really want to hit the aggregates and you're willing to accept very wide swings in interest rates   Yes   Right, relative to the $300 million [in the path]   Let me address this question of the shift in the borrowing function As I heard the reports from that discount    12/15-16/87  officers' meeting, they were discussing a kind of trend since passage of the Monetary Control Act in the way they have been administering the window over a period of time, rather than anything that had happened very recently When our staff came back from that meeting we ran some equations trying to detect that trend and it was difficult to find We also responded to their concerns and what we heard by trying to reinforce in their minds that there has been no change in Regulation A and that any tightening up on the supply side was inappropriate This is a theme that we play constantly from this end I think the most recent shift has been very large, as Governor Johnson said, relative to the $400 million to $450 million we might have expected That really seems to have occurred very recently I don't know if I can pinpoint October 19th, but I don't think it is related to anything that the discount officers were discussing at their meeting  In terms of what we hear or see in the data, Peter has heard anecdotally from at least one large institution and they in turn thought they knew of other large institutions that were staying out of the market and saving up their chips for year-end Secondly, in the data, we do see that the lack of borrowing is very much at the large institutions with deposits over $3 billion At small- and medium- sized institutions, regional institutions, the borrowing may have dropped a little but not nearly so much as you might expect, given what seems to have happened with the large institutions That led me to think that it's not just the stock market decline, but the whole atmosphere around banks--uncertainties about their credit, quality of assets, and other such things--that has been making them be very, very careful It's not related necessarily to the stock market; that just came in on top of a situation that was already bad   Well, I think that's where I'd start It depends on the Committee's decision tomorrow Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Committee wanted to maintain something like current reserve conditions I don't know what the outcome of this current two-week period will be, but I'd be tempted to write down something on the order of $250 million of borrowings, or maybe a little lower-- perhaps $225 or $200 million--and then be alert to see how things were coming in That's very low, and I would expect it to be higher after the new year I think you're right, Governor Johnson, that there's a lot of uncertainty; but I also think that we can interpret incoming information and adjust the borrowing objective if it looks like we are wrong Now, there's a very fine line between that and [focusing on the] federal funds rate   Definitely   20 basis points is what we--   Well, I think there is a certain amount of inertia  SPEAKER(?) Well, it's a certain amount in a series   Dave commented on the original reason it was in there It was felt that seasonal borrowing behaved a lot like adjustment borrowing in that it was sensitive to interest rates If you have more seasonal borrowing, other things equal, then you're going to have a little more pressure in the funds market [Unintelligible] seemed to be just as good So, given that you had something else that was also related to the funds-rate/discount-rate spread, why not include it in the target variable? Right now--   Yes   Yes, well--   Obviously, it could be done easily; but if it were out, our reserve projectors would then have an interest-sensitive factor that-they would be projecting every week It would become part of ""nonborrowed reserves"" the same way extended credit is Generally, those factors affecting nonborrowed reserves aren't interest sensitive; they are market factors Now, we would be putting a little interest-sensitive element in there and we would still end up estimating that seasonal relationship in order to help the reserve projectors make the right projections So, I'm not sure how much you'd gain Perhaps that's why there is no improvement on reserve things   Only if it were known that only one or two institutions were in the discount window and, therefore, we would be telling the public what those institutions were borrowing It is our policy not to do that   Well, they might know that a particular bank in New York had a wire problem or that a particular bank in Oklahoma or Texas had just come in to the window The [unintelligible] banks    12/15-16/87  would know If there were a lot of banks involved, it wouldn't be a problem; but if a special situation involved one bank or another, I could see a confidentiality problem   They don't know the amounts   No   They have to demonstrate a seasonal swing in the difference between their loans and deposits over the previous two years And, on that basis--   [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think we were assuming they would rise that rapidly My memory of the February exercise was that we said that M2 would grow within its range, but in the lower part of it   Then, in July, I think we tried to make a strong case to the Committee that at that point there was a distinct danger that even without a further increase in interest rates the aggregates could well fall short of their ranges And if interest rates rose-- which, in fact, they have--the chances were pretty good of their falling [below the ranges] So, perhaps the point here is that the models are not perfect, but they generally catch the drift And they are not bad in that they can explain most of the deceleration in M2 and most of the deceleration in M1 So, we have a reasonably good, though not perfect, fix on the demand side; but the problem is that in order to target an aggregate, you have to know where interest rates and income are going--particularly interest rates And, if it requires much higher or lower interest rates at the beginning of the year than you think, then you anticipate that in order to get the income growth you desire, you're going to have much lower or higher monetary aggregates consistent with that income growth   Yes, to some extent   Targeting the federal funds rate, I think   This follows page 16 in the thick memo   Okay With regard first to M1A, I guess we haven't given it more emphasis because we really didn't trust the results This is derived from results over the 1970s into the very early 1980s and is specific to the model; that is the period over which the model is fit Over that period, we find that the income elasticity of demand deposits, M1A--which was M1 for much of that period in any case--was very high relative to the interest elasticity When we extend the models out to the last few years, we find fairly large misses in the demand deposit model Furthermore, those misses seem to be correlated with interest rates--that is, we had much more growth in demand deposits in 1985 and 1986 than the model that generated this chart would have predicted And we had much less growth in 1987 than the model that generated this chart would have said we should have Our conclusion was that this ratio didn't represent reality in 1987--that interest elasticities were probably much higher than in the time period that went into this modeling exercise and the historic relationships it represented That's why we didn't put more weight on it In addition, we did look at a more complete exercise in which we ran the whole quarterly model assuming a certain path for money growth And that helps; that puts in some of the errors in the equation that feed back into that modeling process, more so than just comparing elasticities And that showed M1A as better than M1 or M2, but the superiority was not nearly as clear as this So, even within the period of fit, the errors in the M1A equation are larger, and it looks like the out-of-sample errors are even larger That's why we didn't put so much weight on it  In terms of controllability, it seems to me that we have a tradeoff here in terms of what we can control versus what is related to income Obviously, we can control currency and reserves very  -22-    12/15-16/87  closely, but the question is whether they have a reliable relationship to income What we are finding is that the narrow aggregates, which I agree we can control more closely, are less well related to income They seem to be more interest elastic than the broader aggregates, which I agree are more difficult to control But, I do think that over a targeting period of a year, we could have hit our M2 target if we had wanted to That is, if we had come to the middle of the year, and M2 was at the bottom or below its range and the Committee had said to Mr Sternlight, ""Operate to hit your M2 target"", he could have done it Interest rates would have been a lot lower The whole world would have looked different, but we could have operated to control that aggregate if that's what the Committee had wanted to do, even though it doesn't fit with reserves very closely   Yes, but I guess the honest answer is that a year ago, I had more hopes than I have now We have had a year of additional experience with NOW account adjustments and part of what has happened is that they continue to be very sluggish I harbored the same hope that you did a year or so ago And, in fact, the Super NOW accounts used to adjust more rapidly; but now those accounts behave as one big lump and tend to adjust more slowly It could get more rapid Or if we do get into a noninflationary situation, or back into a situation in which interest rates fluctuate over a narrower range around a lower level, then you might have a situation in which these interest elasticities are less important But if we have swings in rates of the sort we have had over the last 7 or 8 years, then I think we would have huge movements in velocity as a result I haven't given up hope entirely, but I have to confess I'm less hopeful than I was   In the M2 demand equation that was used in this paper, which is not the same one that is used in the quarterly model, we used wealth only as a short-run adjustment kind of thing--that is, a big change in wealth will cause velocity to deviate for a short period of time from its long-run equilibrium And, in fact, the  -23-    12/15-16/87  wealth variable that fit best here was one that didn't include stock market wealth Now, in the quarterly model equation, which hasn't done as well as the one reported here, it builds up from M1 and adds the non-M1 part of M2 and then wealth comes into play more directly as the scale variable rather than income as the scale variable But we have found the one reported here to be much more successful over the last few years   I think it was household wealth excluding land and stock market [holdings]   It's a very low coefficient; it's not very significant and it's very transitory in its effect   Yes   You would have homes and consumer durables; I think that probably dominates the levels of the series   I'm not aware of--   Excuse me, the model [expert] is here   That's correct   M1 does lose most of the horse races, however they are handicapped But so far as M1A and M2 are concerned, I have to agree with you--there isn't much to choose from there But the issue is whether the Committee wants to view this as a question of ""Should we target interest rates or should we target the aggregates?"" I think the exercise really [addresses the issue of] what weight we want to put on any one thing, given that we're looking at a whole array of things   Yes, of the growth rate, you said   Okay   It was indirectly, in the sense that the way the horse races were run, to the extent that the trend embodied in the equation was wrong, that would show up in the error So we simply discussed--   I don't know that it would necessarily be the case a priori that one would have more confidence in a trend of 0 than in a trend of 1 or a trend of 1-1/2 I think in this case--  -25-    12/15-16/87   In this case, it's true because the nature of the narrow aggregates has been changing, with the addition of OCDs into M1 and the deletion of those deposits that used to be in demand deposits   So, because of the changing character of the aggregates, I think you're right   I think M2 is less of a concern because a lot of the [unintelligible] we are talking about are within M2   Surprisingly to me--and I think it's perhaps a touch of luck here--we haven't done all that badly projecting the OCD component of the M1 equation, considering that it has swung around by 10 to 20 percentage points in growth rates over the last few years If I look at the errors in the equation, the largest ones are in the demand deposit portion of the equation   That would be my conclusion   I presume there would be a surge in demand deposits at that time Interest is paid implicitly now, to the extent that firms get credits for their compensating balances in terms of services they receive But, it is also the case that they don't get any credits for excess balances any more; and there are a lot of zero balance accounts, where the excess is put into RPs or whatever The incentive to engage in that kind of deposit-minimizing behavior obviously would be very much reduced if interest were paid on demand deposits   I think only about 26 percent of demand deposits now are household deposits; and before the advent of NOW accounts, it was closer to 40 percent So, the composition has changed and I think that accounts for some of the change in interest elasticity I guess I was never a fan of that real balance effect--that you throw money at people and they automatically spend it It seems to me that for households as well as businesses it was part of a complex process in  -29-    12/15-16/87  which the Federal Reserve changed the liquidity in the economy, and that changed interest rates, incentives for spending and saving, and exchange rates   Well, that's partly by assumption I am completely up front about this In the--   Right   We haven't done as much work from the demand side on M3, which is a good reason why it doesn't get the emphasis here That's because we consider M3 to be primarily a supply-determined aggregate [unintelligible] to the growth of bank and thrift credit But to the extent that that credit has some relationship to underlying activity, then M3 would have some-- "
207,1987-12-15," I think the related point is that the aggregates just haven't been very good predictors of what's going on in the economy in the last couple of years I have here a simulation of the Darby model using M1A, and it has the economy slowing down It has much slower growth for 1987 than it looks like we have been getting and a picture for next year that isn't all that different, assuming some pickup in the aggregates, from the forecast in the Greenbook But it has much more rapid inflation both this year and next year--on the order of 7-1/2 to 8 percent this year and 7-1/2 percent next year I wouldn't put much confidence in that, because it plays off the very rapid money growth, which we never really saw feeding through in 1985 and 1986 Those aggregates in and of themselves have not been very good predictors of future developments in the economy "
208,1987-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, I think it is I think it'd be fair to say that the normal borrowing for a funds rate of about 6-3/4 percent would be in the $400 million area As we said in the Bluebook, we expect about $300 million after year-end, allowing for some downward shift, but not as much as we've been getting recently   After year-end Right now I'd say it's probably closer to $200 million, but I'm guessing that some of that is saved up for year-end   Well, we did it sort of by analogy with the borrowing We never mentioned the borrowing specifically in the policy record   We didn't mention a specific funds rate   The December aggregates--is that what you're asking?   We're now looking at about a -4 percent on M1 That is composed of a further drop of about 16 percent in demand deposits and a small rise in other checkable deposits And we have about a 2-1/2 to 3 percent increase in M2 Some of the revision to M2 is not only this demand deposit drop showing through, but the overnight RPs and Eurodollars also came in quite weak That's a highly volatile series, so I'm not sure how much emphasis I'd put on that The household parts of M2--the bank and thrift savings and time deposits and money market funds--don't look much different than they did last week   It should say the existing degree  -80-    12/15-16/87   About 5 and 6 percent   Well, increasing flexibility around the funds rate   Right It does still suggest that the Desk would be attempting to hit the borrowing number but would be willing to adjust if it looked like the relationship were way out of whack   Well, as the Manager saw that that was consistent with market conditions--   I see (3) as moving in that direction   No, I don't think so, Governor Angell Peter and I had extensive conversations on this, I would add, and we were equally uncertain about it But our presumption was that some, but  -84-    12/15-16/87  not all, of the reluctance to borrow would go away because we still would have a sensitive economic environment We would have the Bank of Boston situation and a lot of things going on which might make banks a little reluctant to be seen at the discount window So, our presumption was that $200 million was more appropriate now and that would rise to $300 million after the end of the year; but there would still be a margin below the $400 million "
272,1988-02-09," [Statement--see Appendix]   That's exactly what we did; that's what our 6 percent--   To be very up front about this, what we do is take the Greenbook forecast and the interest rates implied and see what money growth is implied by that Then there's an iterative process of coming together with the money [growth] and the Greenbook forecast But, in theory, it's all consistent There's an effort to make it consistent   Well, the problem--   No one's talking about targeting aggregates, I think--quarter-by-quarter, in any case   And we do have a situation in which we see money growth relatively strong and velocity falling in the first part of the year because of the decline in rates It's not so much in the first half; nearly all of the decline is behind us relative to our forecast But given the lags in this process, what's left over from October 20th on, in terms of interest rates, would affect M2 growth, particularly over the first half of 1988 And then most of the increase in interest rates we have forecast for the second half of 1988 would have some impact on M2 in the second half of 1988, though it's mostly crystallized with the impact into 1989 But the whole movement of opportunity costs isn't very large, given these lags over, say, the second half of 1987 to the second half of 1988 and we have to--   Absolutely; yes   That's right  -29-    2/9-10/88   We assumed 5 percent M2 growth for '89   That would be about 5 percent   I guess the question the Committee would have to answer is whether the uncertainty is greater now than it has been over the last 12 or 13 years that ranges have been given They've been three points almost uniformly throughout that period And I was arguing that with regard to the interest sensitivity, one source of uncertainty is that we don't know what's going to happen with the real economy, how interest rates are going to move, and then what money growth is consistent with what you want to happen From that perspective, I think there probably is a little more uncertainty now than there was, say, in the '70s or the early '80s Or perhaps we now realize the degree of uncertainty Our experiments suggest that the interest elasticity of M2 is a little higher now than it was 5, 6, 7 years ago   I could filibuster for you  -44-    2/9-10/88   Or you can have the Managers' reports, as Peter and Sam just pointed out   This is only substance--   [Statement--see Appendix] "
273,1988-02-09," For '88 it would be about the same; but for '89 it would be several percentage points less    2/9-10/88   Approximately   One to two percent I guess--in that area   Ultimately, I think one should differentiate between the short-run simulation that's presented here--where you slow money growth, interest rates go up, and that slows the demand for money and the real economy--and the longer-run effect where you might slow money growth, and ultimately you get the price level down, so that you would have lower inflation and then would come back to the trend rate of growth in the economy In fact, all these models have that characteristic that if you slow down money growth, you would come back to, essentially, the trend rate of growth in the economy as a whole As you may remember in the discussion yesterday [during the staff briefing to the Board], we had that question about the function of economic forecasts as a whole They have that characteristic But in the short run, I wouldn't pay much attention to the extent of the tighter monetary policy; but it would give a calibration of what that kind of monetary policy would produce "
274,1988-02-09," In the first paragraph on page 13, under the short-run alternatives, we associated alternative B with $250 million and with funds trading of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent--around the range we expected them to have been trading in the last week   We changed the place this time; maybe that will--   Originality doesn't always pay off   I'd make a couple of points on that One is that the drop in private short-term rates, particularly since the last FOMC meeting, very importantly reflected the passing of the year-end pressures We had a huge decline in those rates in the first week of January and I don't think that had anything to do with the economy or monetary policy or expectations or anything like that   I think that the decline in bond yields does reflect a weaker outlook for the economy and expectations that interest rates will not be rising as much as people previously thought over the coming year But, as I remarked in my briefing, the yield curve still is really pretty flat I think there is an expectation that we will be easing perhaps even further in the very near term, but there is something of an upward slope beyond that When you get out a little, it does slope upward a bit; and I think that reflects expectations that there is enough strength in the economy that we won't be seeing declining rates We don't have a classic situation--a sharp downward slope in the yield curve and tight monetary policy, or anything like that It still has an upward sort of curve I look at those things as an indication, at least, of what the market is thinking and what they're expecting Then you can measure that against our expectations President Keehn's Bank published an article on indicators of monetary policy, which shows that spread, I think, as an important indicator--   I was really concentrating on the short-long kind of scenario   Peter can give his views also, but I guess I would still be tempted to think that $250 million was more a center of gravity for this kind of funds rate range But I would also be ready to adjust that informally, as Mr Sternlight has done through the intermeeting period, if it looked like it was inconsistent with the Committee's expectations I think one week, or even two weeks, of low borrowing is not necessarily indicative that the whole thing has slipped; but it's something that would have to be watched very  -52-    2/9-10/88  carefully So, if you started by writing down $250 million, and it persistently came in under that but was consistent with funds trading in the range you expected, we could take it down as a technical adjustment But I'm not sure that we would have to do it right off   Well, I think it means tightening in terms of the borrowing objective you write in the reserve path [relative to recent actual borrowing] But I think that other sentence in there gives Mr Sternlight the flexibility to fall short of that if market conditions dictate Open market operations should not produce that effect   Well, so did I until recent weeks when it has been coming in lower I think it's a close call, President Melzer We have seen, as people have pointed out, in the last few days some periods in which the funds rate has been fairly close to the discount rate Often that gives rise to an expectation that the discount rate is going to be reduced; and often those periods are periods in which a discount rate reduction is a step away But I guess the idea of the $100 million was to suggest that it probably is possible to get the funds rate down to just a tick above the discount rate using open market operations Whether that sets into motion expectations about the discount rate I think is another question; and whether a $100 million borrowing is what you would do it with or not, I don't know But it does get tricky in this area I agree that it's an important question   Well, it would depend on a combination Alternative B implies funds trading in a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent area, in terms of the money forecast If you were to reduce the discount rate, presumably that would take funds down with it, and that would be more like alternative A   I think it was the alternative A, $100 million--   I don't know--you're talking about M2?   Yes; it's the right direction It would be something lower than the 6-1/2 percent and 7 percent for the [November to March period], and it sounds approximately correct but--   With room for downward adjustments   With room for some downward adjustments if it looks like this weakness is persisting But I wouldn't take the first 11 or 12 days of this maintenance period--   Well, my thought on the matter was that you could retain the 5 to 8 percent M3 range We are projecting growth around 6-1/2 percent, so--   For M3, right So, 5 to 8 percent would encompass that, but 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent is also close As I think President Parry and some others mentioned, we have on occasion in the past-- though not for the last several years--had M3 ranges that were slightly higher than M2 ranges So, it's not without precedence   We had 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent, but if you're widening the ranges for M2 and M3, I don't know--   They may be up there already   It's a slightly reduced pressure   Sought in recent days   Mr Chairman--   I'm sorry--something jumped off the page at me as Norm was reading ""Growth in M1 is expected to remain relatively limited""--we have 6 percent  -73-    2/9-10/88   That may or may not be relatively limited, that's-- "
328,1988-03-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman I have only a little to add to the memo [Statement--see Appendix The full memorandum, entitled ""Issues in the Implementation of Open Market Operations"" also is attached]   I think it was the case--wasn't it, Peter--that the Committee would come into a meeting and would set a fairly narrow band for the funds rate And then there was a great deal of dependence on the staff projections for the aggregates--the funds rate could creep in that band if the projections for the aggregates for the next two or three months drifted away from what was desired But it was a very lagged process and the projections weren't always right I think that's President Parry's point It took a long time, given the process, to have adjustments made--with the combination of the narrow band for the funds rate and the projections--  -14-    3/29/88   We have done it both ways, Mr Chairman Telephone consultations without votes sometimes are reported and sometimes are not reported I think more often reported than not   Yes   Every change in the borrowing assumption   Well, the assumption used in constructing the reserve paths Sometimes these changes were made at Committee meetings; sometimes they were made between Committee meetings   They have been made without a formal Committee vote That's not for all of them but--   It has happened on occasion; and that's the flexibility that we're discussing   Well, I think Peter and I had remembered that these are the kinds of changes that had been made between Committee meetings Let me just add a clarification in response to Governor Heller There are sentences in the directive which allow these changes to be made; and that was the direction of the Committee   That's correct "
329,1988-03-29," [Statement--see Appendix]   Not to my knowledge  -52-    3/29/88   Yes I think the obvious answer was just given, which was to reduce the discount rate   Although there's a footnote in the Bluebook that we did run for fairly long periods of three or four or five months in late 1982 and early 1983 with funds right around the discount rate We have run also for a shorter period of time with the funds rate below the discount rate--in the credit control period in the spring of 1980, for example But you'd probably have to pay a lot more attention to what the funds rate was doing; you couldn't do it off of the borrowing function once we got down to that--   It has to be working off the excess reserve part of the demands for reserves I think it would be very sensitive to small misses in factor projections and things like that  -53-    3/29/88   I guess ordinarily, President Keehn, my answer would be no Almost all of our statistical econometric work suggests that those seasonal movements in borrowing don't get reflected in the funds rate But I would say that at these levels of borrowing, where we're down close to frictional levels and seasonal is such a high proportion on the adjustment side, I would have more questions I think it could well be that if seasonal borrowings were to rise, even at $200 million, this would have some effect on the funds rate And that's one reason why I suggested that if that seemed to be happening that would be one reason for Peter to make non-policy adjustments in the borrowing assumption over the intermeeting period if the Committee wanted to allow it "
361,1988-05-17," Or do you want me to? Sometimes I can't read my writing either By the way, Mr Chairman, I think it could be handled, if you wanted to, by just having the maintain and then the tilt in the sentence But it would be understood, and made clear in the policy record, that the Committee expected to move But if you wanted to state something more clearly in the operational paragraph, my suggestion is as follows Taking account of conditions in financial markets, the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates, the Committee expected that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions would be appropriate in the weeks ahead Depending on  -11-    5/17/88  further developments in these factors, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might--and then you'd have to be clear with the end of that tilt--be acceptable later in the intermeeting period   So, the first sentence has maintain in it; and then, taking out the sentence in brackets, the second sentence says taking account of all those things the Committee expects that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions will be appropriate in the weeks ahead So, I presume that that means if those things don't come in the way we expect, it wouldn't be [appropriate]   Well, no; it's a statement actually stronger than that It says we expect that a firmer--   Right; it says ""in the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions""   Initially, okay And then, taking account of all these things, the Committee expects that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions will be appropriate in the weeks ahead   Would be, okay I had would originally   And then I have depending on further developments in these factors--[that's not] the right word, I'll think of another word--somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might also be acceptable later in the intermeeting period  also?  A strong supposition of a move unless things were surprising, and then the possibility of [a further move], but there's a tilt in the possibility   Thereafter Mike Prell just suggested--   Yes, I said later in the intermeeting period   May to July?   Well, generally we focus on a quarter at a time We'll be meeting again at the end of June, so I'm not clear why you'd want to specify--   The July growth rate won't--   But there's very little information that will come in between now and then that will tell us very much about July's movement   Do you mean April to July?   The contingency came after ""the Committee""; there was an ""initially"" in the first sentence, Bob, and then--   Yes   Governor Johnson, there is a contingency toward the end; it relates to the remainder of the intermeeting period   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   If [there had been] some reaction in 1981, you might not have had the reaction--   Yes, but we can't play with what's--   You have to go over a long period of time and you still get zero but--   Over a period of eight years it has been substantial--   Except that our equations on M2 aren't doing that badly once we take into account the opportunity cost changes   Any and all inputs from Reserve Banks--   No, no   The demand equation, once it takes account of the interest rate changes, hasn't been that far off over the last several years But the velocity changes--   That's the problem, which is what we said-- "
409,1988-06-29," I think it's a little hard to say, because we had these technical factors, as Peter mentioned--the corporate tax date and now the quarter-end pressures It's true that in the second maintenance period we had a relationship which suggested that borrowing was a little low But in the first maintenance period it was high--that was reversed So the more recent evidence might indicate to some extent that the borrowing was low relative to the funds rate, but there are so many other things going on I don't think you could conclude that a further shift--now this would include in our calculations the additional shift that we saw last fall--that another $100 million downward shift in the borrowing function [has occurred] We've just carried that through; that certainly has [not] gone away   Absolutely; yes   In the demand deposits, it could be a problem with this tax date because the surge in demand deposits is in this week of June 20th, which includes the tax date for both the individual non- withheld and the corporate taxes Whether our seasonals capture that right [is a question] The preliminary data that came in yesterday and today suggest a runoff, though not a runoff of the entire amount But the $37 billion increase in the June 20 week offsets a decline of $35 billion in the previous week So demand deposits generally have been running a little stronger than we expected but are highly  -10-    6/29-30/88  volatile A lot of the volatility, by the way, is at the very largest banks, so it may be associated with things like the tax dates   I do think the funds rate could have come under some downward pressure at the end of last week I remember the phone calls we had Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then Monday when funds were trading between 7-3/8 and 7-1/2 percent I think if we hadn't made that change things could have tended more toward [unintelligible] and then they would have firmed up this week So, with the quarter end, I do think there was a possibility--toward the end of last week, maybe early this week--of having a different situation in the interim   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, the relationship is conceivable In fact, these things are derived from cranking them through the money demand model The M2, Treasury bill, and nominal GNP relationships implied are derived from cranking them through the Board staff's models of M2 demand Now, whether the underlying strategy for monetary policy is credible, I think I'll leave that to the Committee But the relationships in here are credible, entirely credible I don't have  -34-    6/29-30/88  any problem with seeing the change in interest rates going with the change in GNP and the change in money   Well,--   Yes   Inverted?   I think it's not--I don't have the outlook for the long-bond rate--   We would not have [the long-bond rate] increasing to the same extent as the Treasury bill rate; increases would be smaller Whether the yield curve would actually be inverted at that time under these circumstances in the models, I'm not sure But we have had situations like 1987 when we had very low money growth and rising interest rates Your point, I gather, is one of inflation expectations and where real interest rates are and where nominal interest rates are And I think if there were a real break--if the markets saw this, believed it, and inflation expectations took a substantial decline--then you might have a point I'm not sure that the interest rate thing--   I'm not sure that money demand would be that much different but, surely, the long bond would be considerably different And then it would be a question of whether money holders trade off their savings deposits and time deposits   No   In our models, the expectations, as Mike Prell said yesterday, are backward looking And then you have labor contracts and what not Some things change slowly in those models; wage rates change slowly, as do prices to a certain extent in response to changes in output gaps, unemployment rates, and that sort of thing So that's the reason why the lags are so long and the unemployment rate has to get so high to get this immediate, relatively short-run, effect for a 1990 inflation rate If the expectations change more rapidly, then you wouldn't have to have quite as much restraint   I can't remember it   Well, maybe we can talk later; I'm not sure what you're--   Yes, the projection under the Greenbook assumption is 4 percent I think you're right--the markets probably will take the midpoint   Yes "
410,1988-06-29," Oh, I see It would be--   The Greenbook forecast under a 5 percent M2 would be something between the baseline and the stable interest rate forecast that Mike gave yesterday That is, we'd have more M2, somewhat lower interest rates, and everything that went with that But the 5 percent M2 would be consistent with some further rise in interest rates from where we are now, but not quite as much as we have in the Greenbook forecast   Mr Chairman, there is directive language that goes with these alternatives that is pretty straightforward You can do it after the coffee break, if you prefer that The language is on page 8  [Coffee break]   It's 6-1/2 percent, I think  SPEAKER(?) 6-1/2   It's not really that obvious I think it would imply some small increase in interest rates, but it depends on what happens over the second half of this year It is very hard to say until you know what happens in the second half of this year what the velocity would be next year, because whatever might happen in the second half, interest rates have a [unintelligible] It's not necessarily--   It is close I think if rates were held about steady here, with the staff's GNP forecast you'd probably get something on the order of 5-1/2 percent [M2 growth] next year So, it would be a small increase in velocity, just with the lagged effects of what we've done through yesterday At least that's what the models say It is not that obvious--especially with 4 points in the range   You could just take out ""in relation to economic activity and prices"" One question is whether the Committee wants to shorten this thing at all We felt that this had been repeated sufficiently   [Unintelligible] repeat this rationale so maybe this aggregate will continue to be evaluated in the light of its velocity  -48-    6/29-30/88  [CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN Mr Kohn]   [Statement--see Appendix]   758 percent   May I ask for a little clarification? I read President Boehne's language as really going to a funds rate target--   Well,--   I think it is the case, Mr Chairman--let's see if Peter agrees with me--that whatever we think funds are today or yesterday or the day before, that our view would be that if you stated $550 million, funds would be just a tick lower, practically imperceptibly, but perhaps a little more perceptibly than if you were at $600 million I think it is a slight firming relative to what would persist if we kept the $550 million and it's--   It's splitting [hairs]   758 percent   Yes   $520 million  -65-    6/29-30/88 "
464,1988-08-16," I agree with what Joan said--there can be no more than a 7-day lag before they get our balance sheet I would just add that I think the only time that it was--   But most of the time those transactions are quite small, particularly taking account of what's done for our own account It really is lost in the noise relative to the Treasury balance, float, and all those other things   There was one period here, in which we did the off-market transactions with that had a much larger effect and caused us, I think, to have a slightly different view of our own reserve needs than the market did But that wasn't the usual kind of intervention   And that only lasted three days in terms of--   It's not reported per se, but it's in 'Other Assets'   I think right before we came in, it had come back a little bit from the low point So it was probably down about 1/2 point or less   President Hoskins, I will be discussing that briefly in my briefing as well "
465,1988-08-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman You'll need the coffee It turns out my comments overlap substantially the subjects Governor Angell covered, post-drought anyhow Wayne, you and I will have to think about the implications of that some time together [Statement-- see Appendix]   Oh, I thought the questions were going to be for Governor Angell   Okay   Actually, I'll give you our point estimates and you can put your own confidence intervals around them Mine would be very wide; I have 3-3/4 percent for the fourth quarter of 1988 and 3- 1/2 percent for the first quarter of 1989   No I don't have one, but--   Oh, I would say plus or minus 1-1/2 percentage points   I just made that up   The basic point, as I see it, is that the rise in interest rates that we already have will be damping M2 growth relative    8/16/88  to its rates so far this year So, I think we'll be seeing things at least below 6 percent, or under 5 percent Now, I don't know how far under it will be--3-1/2 or 4 percent is our basic forecast--but I think the message is pretty clear   I think that's true in a general sense If you look at, say, futures market rates and things like that, bill rates are a little higher by the end of the year than they are now, but not by a lot And I guess I think generally they expect us to firm I'm not sure they'd expect a full half percentage point The Bluebook in part was addressing that point--another half percentage point on the funds rate a week after the half percentage point increase in the discount rate I think you're right in the sense that the market is anticipating some gradual firming of the funds rate over the remainder of the year You can see that in these surveys of market expectations But I don't think they'd be anticipating something of this magnitude this soon; that's all I meant to say   No, you don't In fact, the bill rate looks a little low relative to the funds rate I would associate that a little bit with some of the uncertainties associated with a discount rate increase, a little flight to liquidity--not much, but a little But I think if you do look at the--   Not in ""C"", no But at least the money market services surveys that we get do show some gradual firming seen by--   If the forecasters have the investment funds, they ought to be consistent with one another  SPEAKER(?) That's right    8/16/88   I don't have specific numbers in front of me   Certainly less than alternative ""C""   It's not too bad We missed last year--actually the GNP revisions didn't do us any favors because M2 was low already relative to the model projection by about a percentage point Now it's low by about 2 percentage points after GNP was revised up We have several models, but one of them I'm looking at--this is one that missed last year by about 1-1/4 percentage points in fact--was right on in the first quarter and underpredicted the second quarter by a couple of percentage points It hasn't been bad You should understand that these projections are not strictly model-based projections We do take into account the errors that the models have been making, and make judgmental adjustments for that We pay perhaps a little more attention to what they tell us about the interest rate effects; and then we factor that into our own sense of where velocity is going and the projections of income growth that we get from the Greenbook   Well, for the next six weeks it hardly matters, but the Greenbook really didn't have an increase of interest rates in that very short period of time necessarily behind its forecast   Yes   Firming some at some point in the fourth quarter   I'd say it goes the wrong way The idea of seasonal borrowing is that it doesn't respond quite as much to interest rate pressures as regular adjustment borrowing You have an autonomous seasonal factor influencing that borrowing that should tend to bias the funds rate down rather than up relative to our expectations So I would say that for some time the seasonal borrowing hasn't had any effect It might at very low levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing targets, but we are not there any more I think the most recent period is evidence of that But you're right If you thought that somehow it was having an influence, you'd raise the borrowing target at even higher federal funds rates But I don't think it is   That's right   In that--   Well, I think we came out fine   But we did engage in some operations at certain times that we wouldn't have done if we'd been just paying attention to borrowing In the end, everything turned out terrific   That's correct   Right   If you believe that the seasonal was having an effect on the funds rate it would--that's the direction it would go I guess I would just reiterate that our work in the past has failed to uncover a significant effect of that sort Your direction is right; I  -35-    8/16/88  don't disagree with your analysis It just doesn't seem to show up in the data when we've tried to control for it I think it would if we were at much lower levels of borrowings, perhaps But particularly at this level, I guess I wouldn't expect it   Very close to it   I would say a bit above there, but not that far above   We had a long debate in the Bluebook meeting about whether we should cut off the first letter of the alphabet   It's not a trend!   The monetary aggregate growth, now that it's getting more emphasis--   3-1/2 ""to"" or 3-1/2 ""and""?   Or I didn't hear "
516,1988-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I can answer the second one more easily because I have a table in front of me   We have about 3-3/4 percent growth of M2 over the year 1989 consistent with the staff's interest rate and GNP forecast   Q4 1988 to Q4 1989   And that embodies slightly lower growth rates in the first half of the year than in the second--on the order of 2-1/2 percent in the first two quarters--and that's because we've assumed that interest rates continue to rise through the first half of the year And then things level out   That's correct Now, let's suppose interest rates were flat I don't have a direct table here, but I do have a sense from our model simulations that to those 2-1/2, 3 percent growth rates for the first half of 1989, I would probably add about 1-1/2 to 2 percent per quarter if interest rates were kept flat So I would have more like 4 to 5 percent   It should   Absolutely--with the increase in interest rates through August   Yes, in the first half; and I would expect it to rebound further in the second half as-- "
576,1988-11-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes   We ought to be clear in response to President Parry's second question that when the staff made those one-, two-, or three-year ahead projections, we assumed we didn't know anything about velocity except what had occurred up to that time So all those projections were made with the average velocity up to that period; and implicitly it was assumed that velocity would remain stable But it turns out that the projections are pretty good--amazingly good in my view--on that assumption that the dynamics of the model apparently capture some of the changes in velocity The question really is, if we [unintelligible] the so-called Lucas critique and started targeting P*, would people change their behavior? If I can reinterpret the Chairman's point, if we can show the behavior hasn't changed over many different monetary policy regimes stretching back into the early part of the 20th century, it is probably a pretty good bet that something pretty fundamental is going on there You could change the regime without changing something fundamental in the way people handle their liquid assets   Right We did estimates using various ways of looking at that Most of the results are in the Board [staff study]   When we have used other measures of potential GNP, P* is not that sensitive to that unless those changes are much larger than the kinds of changes that we have experienced in the past   The only way I can answer that is to refer you to Exhibit 5, because this exhibit in effect reports on the experiment you just proposed That is, suppose the equation was fitted up to a certain point, say 1980, and then projected, and then '81 is a slightly [unintelligible]   Right So that this [unintelligible]   All the coefficients do is give you the dynamic path by which you reach the long-run [unintelligible]   Well, that's what made M2 attractive from this perspective In theory there's no reason why you couldn't specify a long-run path for M1 velocity and feed that into the model in terms of its long-run path I think it [would have] been more effective [before] deregulation It's not clear to me that M2 hasn't, but M1 certainly has and that path is certainly not flat So it loses this with the simplicity or elegance perhaps of this model But in theory if you knew the long-run path for M1 velocity, there is no reason why you couldn't put that in for P* over time "
577,1988-11-01," [Statement--see Appendix]   Right I think we could have very sluggish growth for M1 for some time to come Part of this is the demand deposit phenomenon We expect extremely weak demand deposits over the next couple of months as firms catch up on compensating balances It really has practically nothing to do with their transactions and their spending, but rather with how they compensate banks for the services they get In addition, we have a very steep deposit yield curve that I would expect to narrow only gradually, even if rates remain where they are--to abstract from any further increase in rates And that will continue to induce both savings-type balances and other checkable deposits and NOW accounts to move into time deposits So, I think we could have extremely sluggish growth in M1 for some time to come without necessarily having any implications for the economy Think about demand deposits We have a lower level of demand deposits now than we had two years ago, and in the meantime we've had 7 percent nominal GNP growth It just doesn't seem to have very much effect   In the rubber band analogy--, in the NOW accounts, there's still quite a bit that is savings motivated, and I think a lot of that can move out As for M2, which you also asked about, it depends really on the underlying forces in the economy If you had an economy that wasn't showing the kind of strength that's really implicit in this staff forecast, and interest rates were flat, I'd expect income to keep growing, say, along a 6 percent path Then M2 growth rates would have to rise toward that, but very gradually, and perhaps we wouldn't reach a 6 percent rate of growth consistent with that very nice kind of outlook until the latter part of next year But there's enough elasticity in that rubber band, I believe, to support considerable output growth without that much M2 growth or M1 growth   I think the principal effects there would be on M3--there's a little effect on M2--because it will be financed largely through the banks who will be issuing a lot of managed liabilities and  -43-    11/1/88  that will find its way into M3 We've built that into our forecast That's one of the reasons why we have the strong M3 toward the end of this year in the Bluebook There's a small effect on M2 For one thing, some of the managed liabilities they will issue will be the stuff that will end up in M2--overnight Eurodollars, for example For another, you have the possibility that with a huge volume of takeover activity the people selling the shares may take a while to figure out what they want to do with the proceeds, and they might park that in M2 temporarily In the past, we haven't really found a noticeable effect from that, but I'm not ruling that out with the huge volume that could happen this time But I'd expect the effects on M2 to be very small   I'm not sure exactly what would happen to nominal rates That's why I tried to word it carefully to be vague, because I've thought about that And it's not clear because I think it's important that real interest rates not fall in this circumstance Nominal rates I can't tell you about, because I don't know quite what's going to happen to inflation expectations   If inflation expectations really did come down and the Federal Reserve was seen as validating those lower inflation rates so that the expectations are right, then I don't see happening what I think occurred in 1986 when the bond market kind of got carried away with the oil price decline, in effect reducing real interest rates It was very hard to determine at the time and it depends on whose expectations we're talking about As a consequence, we got very strong growth in the economy partly as a consequence of that and the decline in the dollar that went along with it We got very strong growth in the economy in the subsequent two years I don't see that happening right now, but I think it's something that we ought to think about as--   That's in the second quarter I think with the lags in the system, Governor Angell, that the real effects were out after the [second quarter]   You could have lower nominal interest rates And all I was arguing for was a very cautious approach to that, if that's the way things-- I would drag my feet "
641,1988-12-13," That's probably right Actually they were overwrought, right?   [Unintelligible] We are not Mozart, we recognize that I have only a little to add to the memos we've already seen and to the comments Peter already has made in today's discussion [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't know   That's a question the Committee has to answer I would say that we tend to focus on the shifts; that's when the issue is brought to the attention of the Committee and when the discussions occur It's not clear to me that we don't have long periods in which the relationship is sufficiently on track to get approximately the money market conditions that the Committee thought it was getting when it specified the borrowing objective There have been periodic shifts to be sure I can't answer for the Committee what its range of tolerance is I think I tried to indicate in my closing remarks that I thought that by treating both the money market conditions and the borrowing flexibly, we had gotten through what could have been a very difficult period without having to key very firmly on specific federal funds rates and getting locked into narrow federal funds targeting so that we retain the basic borrowing objective But at the same time, Mr Sternlight was sensitive to the potential for the funds rate getting way out of whack with what the Committee expected So, some sort of compromise was worked out that in my view worked out pretty well in the end   [Unintelligible] We have in the Bluebook an indication that under alternative ""C,"" $600 million, that the funds rate would be getting up toward 9 percent   It could be higher over short periods of time, that's right I think it would settle down   We, of course, added or suggested the addition of a paragraph to the policy record describing the November 22 meeting, which attempts to reconcile those two things   On occasion   But we were focusing on [unintelligible] in the early 1970s   I was going to say, in terms of the standard deviation of the borrowing equation, the federal funds band is much larger than we've been tolerating It's more like 3/8ths of a percentage point   [$100 million], plus or minus in terms of standard deviations Is that right, Dave? "
642,1988-12-13," [Statement--see Appendix]   Peter may have another view, but my reading of the structure at the very short-term end of the market is that the market has close to a 1/2 percentage point [increase] in the rate built in Sometime in the first quarter market participants expect the funds rate to be close to 8-7/8 - 9 percent, or something like that   8-3/8 to 8-1/2 percent   Well, adding a 1/4 to that for $100 million and then 1/2 for $200 million   Second $100 million "
704,1989-02-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   We did not consider that, President Hoskins I think there is something to be said for looking out over longer horizons On the other hand, I remember the Committee discussion of last July in which there was some resistance to setting ranges for the next year because of the uncertainties involved in specifying those ranges even 6 months ahead of time So I think it cuts both ways It's really hard to know where you're going to be at the end of 1989 in terms of setting ranges that might be appropriate for 1990, although we've taken our best guess in this forecast   I have to see what's happening at my back here with Mr Prell But I actually--   I think in terms of the short run--over the next year or two--I would have more confidence in the staff's projections for inflation on the grounds that they take account of certain factors that are important I think the reason that the P star [P*] model, as we call it, came in with lower inflation rates for the same money growth is that it didn't take account of factors that are important in the year-to-year rates of inflation In this case I'm thinking of the energy price impact on the early part of 1989 and particularly the assumed dollar depreciation effect on prices in the latter part of 1989 and 1990 Those things clearly aren't taken account of in that P* model in which prices depend solely on money, adjusted for trend velocity and output So, I would have some confidence in that model as giving some sense of where those money supplies might be taking us over extended periods of time But if you asked me which inflation forecast I would have most confidence in for 1989 or 1990 I think I would say the staff forecast, given the additional information they bring to that forecasting process   Right   The lesson I took from the P* model was that if we had M2 growth like we were talking about--in the 3-1/2 to 5 or 6 percent range or something lower--we would be putting some downward pressure on the inflation rate over time more with strategy II than strategy I But even the staff's strategy, which doesn't give you much of a payoff in the short run, is putting into place conditions that will provide at least some payoff over the long run So when we ran that model, even though the results weren't the same, I took a little comfort in that, in my view, it didn't contradict the underlying thrust of the staff forecast   We have not I think in the past the Committee has found it useful to have more than one target given the different kinds of information embodied in the different aggregates Obviously, [we would] if the Committee were to instruct us that it was their choice to go to one aggregate But it seems to me that you would lose a little information that you get from the growth of a broader aggregate or credit or debt I would hesitate to focus so narrowly on any particular aggregate in terms of announcing targets to the public, even though we have keyed our forecasting exercises off either interest rates or the exchange rate or M2 as a target variable   Already I wonder   No, no, not at all   In fact, I was trying to use that to reinforce the notion that that's an appropriate long-run objective for the central bank The Humphrey-Hawkins [language] includes reasonable price stability as one of the objectives of that Act  -28-    2/7-8/89   Unfortunately, I guess, from that perspective it says that one shouldn't necessarily hit that if it interferes with 3 percent unemployment But it does list it in any number of places The whole sentence--   That's correct   Constant nominal interest rates   He gave that in his briefing   That would require faster money growth than even the strategy III For example, I think Mike said 7 percentage points more M2 growth by the end of 1991, whereas this has only 3 percentage points more M2 growth by the end of 1991   My guess is that velocities would decline over the next year or so as offering rates caught up to the flat market rates, reducing opportunity costs and enhancing the demand for M2 Once that equilibrium was reached then M2 velocity would essentially be unchanged   But it would decline over the--    2/7-8/89   It's probably a function of the way the model cycles the offering rates and the market--   Eventually it would end up there, yes But first there probably would be an increase early this year, given the lagged effects Then it probably would come off; I'm sure it would It would have this humped shape as the offering rates caught up with the [market] rates Possibly you'd find at some point a leveling off   Right   Number ""III"" was less money growth   Excuse me, more money growth I didn't have a constant interest rate option in here in part because Mike had one in his briefing I thought rather than replicating the options I would have one that was somewhere in between constant interest rates and the staff's rising interest rate forecast And that was my option three It's easier than the staff forecast but it does not keep nominal interest rates unchanged from current levels over the near term, although the movements in rates aren't very large There still would be some upward movement in rates over the year, but not much   I think we--the Chairman in particular in recent testimonies--put out a very strong statement about our objective and backed it with reasons why price stability is our objective, without necessarily saying [we plan to achieve that] by the year 1993 or something like that In my view, it's a debatable point I raised the issue in part to stimulate the debate There are dangers in putting out various specific objectives--2 percent or 1 percent or even zero, whatever zero is in reality, by 1992 or 1993--because of the problems that arise when you miss it, and so forth So I think we  -31-    2/7-8/89  can continue to make strong statements and back it up with actions Ultimately, as someone was saying, credibility grows out of the barrel of an open market operation It's what we do more than what we say-- read our actions rather than our lips--that sets scores on credibility And as we act over time with that in mind I don't think there's a problem--or there's less of a problem   That's the way it happens   Yes, I think so, right In 1990 or some time?   It must be something like that   It's $160 billion or so   Well, we'll look into this a bit To the extent that it went into money funds, of course--   It's not clear what the preference was for If they were looking for federally insured deposits then they would have to go back to a depository institution   We have made a small allowance for this, indirectly, by presuming that the average offering rates on M2 remain damped And the average offering rates include, obviously, the brokered deposit offering rates and we factored that through I doubt that we've captured the full impact, as Jerry has implied, but--   We ran a couple different types of simulations of how these offering rates would behave and they all shaved about 1/2 percentage point or a little more off of our model forecast   And that's the 3-1/2; it is about a half--  -40-    2/7-8/89   We've often said that we expect growth in the middle of the ranges   Well, in the past when we put ranges out we have-- "
705,1989-02-07," Well, I'll be happy to get [my report] over with "
706,1989-02-07," You want me to take you to the coffee break   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, not in the last six months or so The borrowing has been so low for wide spreads that for whatever reasons-- and we talked about this last time--it is particularly the small banks that are most surprising in the way they are staying out of the window Whether it's their liquidity, whether they're concerned about the thrift crisis and do not want to be seen at the discount window given concerns about depository institutions, or what, I don't know But I guess I don't have any expectations at all that that's going to reverse on us with a big rush or that if it began to reverse we wouldn't detect it pretty quickly and be able to take it into account   About a big rush of borrowing at the discount window? No   Well, I would say that that's a decision for the Committee My proposal was that this flexible approach, which in effect is a blending of the two approaches, continue The Desk has reacted, I think, when funds have gotten way out of line from Committee expectations But it hasn't [zeroed] in very closely on a very narrow range for fed funds; it is also paying attention to the borrowing function But it isn't captive to it if it looks like it's going to push the funds rate way out of whack with what the Committee expects So, it's an approach that I think has enabled us to have more flexibility than the very narrow focus on the funds rate might allow but at the same time hasn't gotten us too far away for too long from what the Committee expects Federal funds, as Peter said, have been running the last couple of maintenance periods a bit over 9 percent I think the last Bluebook said 8-7/8 to 9 percent; we're talking about a difference of 10 or 15 basis points here, maybe So I don't think that's too far out of line "
769,1989-03-28," Well, they're in a lot of trouble! [Statement-- see Appendix] "
770,1989-03-28," Governor Heller, I could add that we do run some what we call St Louis-style reduced form equations on monetary aggregates and they do show slower nominal income growth than the staff projection for 1989 and 1990 But they showed substantially slower growth, particularly in the M2 equation, in 1988 than we got And they made huge errors earlier in the decade, in '85 and '86 On the other side, they had much faster GNP growth, say, in--   What?   How weak is it? Let's see For nominal income growth in 1989 it has about 4 percent   I don't have it broken down; this runs off the nominal model But running it using the base I have 9 percent or so [nominal] But they have all been making such huge errors that I would have skepticism about--   At the end of a certain number of decades, right   Actually, I think we have projected about 4-3/4 percent base growth That model, the base model in particular, has done so poorly that I really shouldn't even have cited it The errors have been in percentage points  -17-    3/28/89   Right "
771,1989-03-28," Yes, I think it's sort of suspicious too This chart is plotted from 1978 because that's when the 10-year Hoey survey started We have done some other experiments using, for example, 1-year rates with 1-year inflation expectations They tend to get very poor results in the 1960s and somewhat better results in the 1970s and 1980s They also suggest that there have been changes in the natural real rate, which was a little higher in the 1960s, a little lower in the 1970s and much higher in the 1980s   I don't know   Yes, it was the last half of February, but I don't know the exact date I know it was after that first PPI number and before the second; that I checked on   Well, I don't know I'm not familiar with--   I don't know, President Keehn I haven't seen a study which tends to do that Generally, these market expectation studies don't show that the market does a very good job of [predicting] what's going to come But also, I look at it not as a way to see if the market may in some sense be more accurate than someone else, but rather as giving us some clue as to what's going through people's minds, whether it's accurate or not   Of a very rough sort "
833,1989-05-16," We have projected about a 4 percent growth of M2 for the year But we would be running closer, even with that upward nudge in interest rates, to the 5 to 6 percent area in the second half of the year Part of that is the bounceback from what we see as the shortfall with the taxes But that additional rise in interest rates, particularly coming later in the year, doesn't have that much effect on M2 for the year 1989   Probably, yes   I'll actually be covering this in my briefing to some extent, Governor Kelley But, very briefly, we think we'll get a little extra push as people rebuild what we see as depleted cash balances after the [tax] season We see that adding about a percentage point, at an annual rate, to the growth over the next quarter or two We also see most of the interest rate effects gradually drifting behind us After all, most of it happened by  -15-    5/16/89  February, right? Those effects should be easing off over the balance of the year, even with this relatively small further increase in interest rates near the end of the year So, in our view, given the movement of opportunity costs, we'll see M2 pick up and start to run closer to nominal GNP   Well, it doesn't affect the year that much if it comes in the second half   If it comes in the second half or at year end "
834,1989-05-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Looking at the first chart, Governor Johnson, we continue to have this rather mild overall downward slope running from the federal funds rate to the 30-year bond   Virtually, in the upper panel, that's the cross   That represents the most recent week in each of these charts   I was interpreting that as not nearly as steep, certainly, as we've come to before past recessions and more indicative of a slight downward slope--well, it is a slight downward slope of the yield curve Then, in the bottom panel, I was noting the fact that that hump was no longer there, which suggested that the market certainly wasn't expecting the Fed to tighten over the intermediate run These are all difficult interpretations, given uncertainties about term premiums   I was discounting the upward slope in the short end there as being supply-related and term premium-related Looking at various expected federal funds rates, term federal funds rates and related shifts among 30- 60- and 90-day rates in the short-term market, I do think they are expecting a mild easing over the next several months--not necessarily next week, but sometime in the next couple of months   That's correct, both the Michigan and the Hoey The Hoey you see on the next page   They don't contain the information that became available in May; that's correct   So that increase from 53 to 57 percent that you see in April from February in the first column of chart 5 could very well have been reversed in May   The Michigan survey, I believe, had 5 percent in April inflation expectations That may have dropped in May also; it's hard to tell But in any case, it remains at a fairly high level   Yes  -31-    5/16/89   If you take the short run, then P* is further below P and would be exerting a little more downward pressure on inflation than you see in that bottom panel   I think the numbers--well, do you mean adjusted for the shift in the--   In 1983? Is that what you're referring to?   But that wasn't adjusted Yes, the shift adjustment begins in 1983 But the numbers didn't come out better if we lowered the whole V* to the average of the last few years, extracting from that one quarter or two of shift adjustment I think you were suggesting that we go with the lower V* all along or at least have some 1982 floor   That did not prove to be better   I can give you the results for the quarter   It's curious that running it with the shorter-term velocity I get 3-3/4 percent inflation in 1990 instead of 4-1/4 percent inflation in 1990   I think I'd have to analyze why it wasn't bouncing back If it wasn't bouncing back because of some special factors that meant that the relationship between opportunity cost and velocity had gone off track--that is, that there had been a shift in money demand-- obviously, I would be much less worried If it wasn't bouncing back    5/16/89  because this scale variable, the underlying income growth, was weaker than we're projecting then I think that would be cause for concern So I'd have to think a little about why it was happening before I could give you a reason The other reason for it not to bounce back would be an even stronger rise in opportunity cost That implies even more of a rise in interest rates than the Greenbook forecast has there I don't think that's what you were thinking   So, I'd have to think carefully about why it wasn't bouncing back--whether the relationship was going off track or the underlying income--   I expect by the time we get to the middle of June that we would have some sense of things, hopefully, bottoming out in the middle of May Without getting too tied into week-to-week money projections--   I'm very skeptical of week-to-week money projections, but I'd want some sense of it moving up at least toward the end of May   I think funds would tend to trade a bit below 9-3/4 percent Peter?   We're running above $500 million--   --in the early part of the maintenance period, which is unusual, and partly it's the seasonal borrowing that's rising In the past I've argued that the seasonal borrowing doesn't affect things very much but I think the level of adjustment borrowing is so low that the increase in seasonal borrowing is showing through more; it's not covered up by the noise in adjustment borrowing   Well, I interpreted alternative B as maintaining about the same funds rate level as we've been running over the last intermeeting period If what you're referencing is what might happen to market rates I agree, as we stated in the Bluebook, that the markets now have an easing built into that It's quite possible that if the data continue to come in weak the markets will continue to expect an easing and rates may not move very much But if the data strengthen a little and we don't ease, I think these short-term rates could back up a bit--retracing some, but by no means all, of the decline that occurred over the last intermeeting period We do have, I think, some sense of a further easing--   It doesn't represent a tightening in the reserves market It may represent a tightening in other markets It wasn't intended to represent a tightening in the reserves market   Peter, please correct me if I'm wrong, but my sense is that the market doesn't have us easing out of that 9-3/4 to 9-7/8 percent range now But they're looking for signs that it may happen   Well, as Peter said in his presentation, coming out of the last meeting they expected us to tighten   When we didn't tighten, short-term rates came down And then they fell further when they started to--   That's correct   Right   I think there are a couple of things going on The most fundamental factor was the rise in opportunity costs in interest rates over the period from March of 1988 through February of 1989 That has particular impacts on Ml not only because demand deposits as compensating balances tend to be very, very sensitive to movements in interest rates but also because NOW accounts serving as savings deposits tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rates when time deposit rates adjust and NOW account rates don't Essentially, NOW account rates have crept up but not very much so we've seen huge growth in time deposits--in the last month we're talking about 25 percent at an annual rate I think, in part, that's a shifting from NOW accounts So we've had very, very weak growth in M1 just because of the past tightening in policy and the rate relationships among bank and thrift deposits that have emerged On top of that, you add the tax situation I put that chart 10 in there to try to underline my point that this drop in M2, which had a counterpart in Ml, seemed to  -35-    5/16/89  fall off a cliff after a certain point And the timing of that drop is tied very, very closely to the timing of the overage in the tax payments and the increase in Treasury balances We only projected 3 percent M2 growth last time under alternative B; so on top of that rather weak projection, given the increase in interest rates, we had the tax effects, and that's what reduced M2 and M1 as well   No, alternative B is intended to keep the fed funds rate where it has been   The increase of borrowing [in the path] is not expected to have an effect on the funds rate In fact, borrowing has been running above $500 million   The Greenbook is not tied that specifically to an alternative that really only stretches to the next 6 weeks In fact, the Greenbook's interest rates, as Mike said, really increase in the second half of the year In essence, the Greenbook is--   It is the case that we adjusted our borrowing targets last year as borrowing came in weak relative to the targets, in order to keep the funds rate from deviating very, very substantially from what we thought [it would be if the borrowing function had not shifted] Yes, we are indexing, basically, on the funds rate   Fundamentally, that's correct I think there could have been a little slowing in addition to that I don't want to slice this analysis to oversell my ability to track every dollar or even every billion dollars of M2 or M3, so let's--   It's our best guess We think we've analyzed the situation   Not too bad, taking into account--  SPEAKER(?) You were ready for that!   --taking into account where the interest rates have ended up There have been some Bluebooks where the actual has come in under, say, alternative B in the Bluebook I haven't done this for a couple of months but I did look at our projections and the errors we had in 1988 Basically, we had captured the fundamental slowdown in the second half of the year pretty well--not to the last percentage point, but we had the basic structure   I think it depends on how they do that The presumption here is that most of the rebuilding comes from redirecting savings flows, perhaps a little asset portfolio shuffling That wouldn't really affect their spending It's possible that some people may cut back on their spending temporarily to rebuild their balances The question [hinges on] what the element of surprise was for you You could have been surprised by the fact that taxes relative to your income came out higher; but you could have been surprised because your income was a little higher--say, you had more interest receipts or  -37-    5/16/89  capital gains were higher It's not clear that that would affect your spending in the same way as other things So, the effects on spending are very ambiguous, whereas I think the rebuilding of cash is less ambiguous   It's not a problem; it would be a phenomenon That is, I think you'd have an easing of the funds rate and then you'd have a tightening if you went back to the $600 million So, it would depend on how you felt about things   I think if you get to $500 million [on borrowing] federal funds would trade noticeably below where they have traded over the last intermeeting period They averaged 983 or 984 percent over the last intermeeting period   They were--   Yes, we publish the Policy Record   1-1/2 and 4 "
896,1989-07-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't think so Remember one year we lowered the bottom end of the M2 range; that was in 1988 Other years we have widened the range I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I'm looking for--   It's the table I'm looking for but am having trouble finding It's about half and half   Yes   Well, the lags can last four or five quarters before the full effect is felt if you just have a one-time decrease I'd say about 100 basis points at the current level of rates probably would give you, say, about 1 percentage point or something like that over four quarters Dave? I'm sorry, it would be more like 2 percentage points in the growth rate over a couple of quarters   Yes In other words, if you did it this quarter, in two quarters you'd have a maximum of about 2 percentage points more growth; and then it tapers off after that The whole effect--   Right I would say that's probably about 1-3/4 percentage points in four quarters, judging from this table  -33-    7/5-6/89   If you think the economy is going to be weaker-- that its underlying demands are weaker or that inflation will be coming down faster and therefore interest rates will be lower--then I do think that We have a 6-1/2 percent growth projected for relatively flat interest rates There's no question in my mind that if you thought rates would be declining significantly and you wanted to get approximately the same nominal income growth, for the same rates then you'd be threatening the upper end of the 3 to 7 percent range "
897,1989-07-05," I think the market probably has about a 50 basis point decline, and maybe more after today--   --built into the funds rate over the next 3 months or so So the question is what their expectations would be if we didn't ease Would they continue to expect that ease down the pike? And that's not--   I think the market has built in about a half point [decline] over the next 3 months or so Joan [Lovett] has a different view The bill rates are way down today; they may be a little more after today But as of, say, Friday or Monday I think that was a fair statement   No, no The way I look at it there's [a decline of] about 25 basis points within a month and the other 25 basis points in another month or so   I don't have the most recent table with me but a few days ago it was about 9-1/4 percent   Well, bill rates are down about 15 or 20 basis points--or the 3-month bill rate is, anyhow   Well, as we were saying to President Parry, a small uptick   Yes, a quarter "
898,1989-07-05," [Statement--see Appendix]   I think about 9-1/2 percent We've said 9-1/2 to 9-5/8 percent, but it's averaged closer to 9-1/2 percent and I think that's about where the markets think it is   That's correct You can see that in alternative A in the Bluebook We have 8 percent, actually, from June to September   June to September And that would encompass a strengthening pattern of M2 growth over that period Consequently, by the time we got to the fourth quarter I think it would be in the 8 percent range or [even] higher   Quarter IV to December under alternative A? I don't know Quarter IV to September is 37 percent, so my guess--   Right, something like that   That's to September; but then to December--   Yes My guess is that it may be closer to 5 percent--closer to the midpoint of the range   Well, it certainly is not unusual for them to be speculating about a change in monetary policy about the time you folks are sitting in this room meeting My sense is that the intensity of the speculation and the immediacy and size of the expected rate movement is a little larger than normal We have had some pretty strong upward sloping yield curves and expectations; one can think back only six months or less about some pretty immediate movements on the other side I don't have a measure of how intense this is but I  -44-    7/5-6/89  have the sense that the expectations are quite firmly held It's not totally unusual And they can go both ways with this   I think that's right   Well, it's 3/4 of a point, I think   And I think that [translates to] about 8-3/4 percent; the mechanical translation varies with the level of rates   It varies with the level of rates, Governor Johnson, because you have to make some estimate for a marginal state tax rate--since bills are exempt from state taxes--as well as the coupon equivalent kind of [adjustment]   And the mechanical translation of 7-3/4 percent [on the bill rate] is about 8-3/4 percent [on the funds rate]   One sense of where this yield curve is you can see on Chart I of the financial indicators that I have; it's really a  -45-    7/5-6/89  minus, as of Friday of last week But you can see that we have had some upward slopes in yield curves, at least measured this way, that are larger than the downward--   Well, I'm never very confident; but I must say that the response of M2 in June and over the last couple months was roughly about what we expected Particularly if I take out the demand deposit component, which has had its own special influences with the compensating balances and whatnot, M2 is running stronger than we projected at the last meeting, and that's consistent with a slightly lower interest rate and a bounceback The June performance reassures me somewhat that we are on an upward trajectory here and are more likely to come back within that range   I agree, certainly And we have built in a very modest [response]--I think about 1/2 percentage point--just arbitrarily assuming that it would get back in over 6 months into our forecast On the other hand, as we go forward, even if rates were to stay at this level or something like it, we do have a little more of the influence of the recent decline in market rates coming in So, we'd expect those two factors together to have a slight downward impact on velocity   We have the monetary base growing at about 3 percent this year, so we have it bouncing back Because we have M1 essentially unchanged over the last half of the year, that dominates the reserve aggregates; we have them growing from June to December But on a Q3 to Q4 basis they are essentially unchanged And we have currency growing at about a 5 or 6 percent pace So I think the reserve aggregates would tend to flatten out and the base would tend to grow a little faster, the base being 2/3 or 3/4 currency   That would be our expectation on the basis that the decline in Ml would cease   Well, as noted in the Bluebook long-run strategy section, we have P very slightly above P* here We would expect this to be roughly consistent with Mike's Greenbook forecast stretching out to 1991, which was a very, very small deceleration of inflation It was eerily similar to the staff baseline forecast   I think in the Bluebook we said ""interestingly;"" I wanted to say ""eerily""   I think there's a trend over time One of the questions raised was Does that trend in the activities of, say, pension funds in the stock market--and I assume in the bond market too--add to volatility? Do people tend to move from one side of the ship to the other--   I think that the academic findings are, as we heard at President Guffey's conference last summer, that volatility is greater than can seem to be explained by fundamental factors in the market Whether this has gotten worse over time, with the pension funds and financial services--that's the question I think it's more of an open question We have had other periods--one can think back to a year ago when we were starting to tighten--in which expectations were very strong and the market bond yields moved up from, say, February through March; we were in this 7-1/2 or 7-3/4 percent area in February of 1988 and we were at 9 percent within a couple of months So I'm not sure that--   I do think this movement, say, since late '88 has been unusual I'm looking at a chart of the bill rate and the funds rate now We had similar kinds of movements in early '85--this sharp up and down There are some [periods] like that, but in the last two years, say, the size of the movement is fairly unusual   It'd be roughly $600 million   For alternative B   No, Governor Johnson, it isn't because of the--   It [includes] seasonal and adjustment borrowing-- "
958,1989-08-22," I think there are one or two other points, President Hoskins One is that I don't think the need to drain [reserves] has really hindered Mr Sternlight's ability to let the easing show through over June and July In fact, it may even help a little in the sense that it lets the reserves sit out there a little longer and tends to put downward pressure on the funds rate by waiting to take it out In some sense it's helpful The other point is that, to a large extent, our need to drain--although it has been revealed by the decline in the Treasury balance--resulted importantly from the warehousing of the ESF funds and also our own intervention This sterilization, really, of that part of our balance sheet gave rise to a lot of this need to drain "
959,1989-08-22," The bond market went down on balance by a very small amount, about [unintelligible]   There wasn't much change until this March "
960,1989-08-22," I hope you have had enough coffee to keep yourselves awake! [Statement--see Appendix]   That would be a policy issue for the Board to handle along with the Reserve Banks We could bring that up I know there's at least one Governor who has suggested that before   Mr Chairman, can I make one further suggestion? We had 6-3/4 percent for M3, which sounds excessively precise to me Can we change that to 7 percent so it's a nice round number? "
1021,1989-10-03," The guidelines [that] the Committee has passed by majority vote--   My judgment would be, President Parry, that if the market had to bet whether policy would go one way or another they'd bet that policy would more likely be eased than tightened If you look at the term fed funds markets and fed funds futures and things like that, they don't really have much ease built in there On the other hand, surveys such as the money market services survey do show a little downtick by the end of the year of maybe a quarter of a point So it's a little; I don't think they have much built in there It's  -18-    10/3/89  essentially flat with maybe some bias towards ease before the end of the year   We could certainly do that That request has been made elsewhere in the System Governor Angell has asked that same question The seasonal borrowing is about what it was last year So this is really the second year--   Seasonal credit is a little higher than it was, but the spread is a little wider than it was For the October 5th period last year seasonal borrowing was $433 million; I don't know what will come out this year   I think this will be something of a time consuming exercise at the FOMC meeting as well as for the staff between here and there Aside from this Neal question which, if it needs to be answered by early November would precede the FOMC meeting anyhow, we do have a two-day meeting scheduled for December The November meeting was to be a Tuesday afternoon meeting in any case So before President Parry brought that up I was going to suggest that maybe we schedule it for the December meeting, but I'm not sure how it interacts with this Neal letter We could have a Tuesday afternoon/ Wednesday meeting   Some Presidents don't like that when they have Thursday directors' meetings  -46-    10/3/89 "
1022,1989-10-03," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, eventually you would have to see that You would have to see 3s [in M2 growth] to imply price stability; this is in line with Governor Johnson's question earlier If you look at the financial indicators that were distributed--the last chart, chart 9 has the P*--we are assuming 6 percent M2 growth in 1990, about in line with nominal GNP, and a small decline in velocity In 1991 we have 5 percent, a bit lower than nominal GNP, and a small rise in velocity since we have this upward drift in interest rates in that year Those two taken together imply in the P* model--to keep P* just a little below P--a very mild deceleration in inflation, not a rapid one The line is tilted down but not at a very steep angle   I can tell you that in a second Well, at the end, if P were lower than--   Well, given the money growth that we've assumed, that would require then that prices come in less than the rate--   --and presumably we would have that P equal to P* That would imply very little further downward pressure on--   Right   Okay   At the end of 1991 P* is 1345 and P is 1381, so [the calculation] is 04 over 138 It's about 3 percent, I'd say, or whatever 04 over 138 is   Well, 04 over 138 So it's 2-1/2 percent or so   2-3/4   I'm not sure I understood what you just said   I'm sorry   Right Actually, relative to the Greenbook, in '91 the P* would give you 3-1/2 percent on the implicit deflator The Greenbook has 3-3/4 percent, so it's not much different I thought what you were getting at is what it would imply for '92 Presumably, that is where you're coming out of '91 and that would imply some further deceleration   Well, if interest rates were to hold steady, I would not expect money growth to accelerate in the first quarter particularly   Presumably, if interest rates didn't come down we wouldn't get the acceleration; I would expect M2 growth perhaps to decelerate slightly But it would be basically in the 6-1/2 to 6 percent area in the first quarter   In the short run that's right This is the phenomenon that we discussed in July, I believe, when we were talking about the long-run ranges The staff forecast with relatively flat interest rates was consistent with M2 growing about in line with  -37-    10/3/89  nominal GNP So if you think you're going to have nominal GNP growth on the order of 5-1/2 or 6 percent next year you're going to get M2, given that we've had a little decline in these rates, on the order of 6 or 6-1/2 percent, just mechanically working it through But you could raise interest rates a bit and you would get a little lower nominal GNP You would also get even more impact on M2 given that interest rise   We discussed that to some extent If there is, it could be a bit of a replay of 1986 If people realize a lot of capital gains quickly and then store the money waiting to pay their taxes next April, for example, we could have some temporary upward movement of M2 or a [unintelligible] level of demand for M2 in the short run, which would then come back presumably after the taxes were paid It would be a little different than we saw in 1989 when we thought people were surprised in April by their tax returns and they drew down their M2 balances and then had to move them up You could argue in this case that, perhaps having learned from 1989, people might deliberately make a decision on the basis of taxes in that they might be more tempted to take some of the capital gains they got and leave them in M2 and have that ready--   Depending on who's doing it, yes If it were--   Possibly I think there are probably a number of households with very high wealth and, therefore, potentially high M2 holdings who--if they were to park it there temporarily--could do this Presumably, if there were a mood shift out [of M2] into M3-type liabilities, such as large time deposits, etc, from the bank and thrift perspective they would have to issue fewer other types of M3 liabilities So, I'm not sure whether that would really affect the level of M3 so much I think there might be some impact on M3 "
1078,1989-11-14," Mr Chairman, I'll be brief--well, not too brief [Statement--see Appendix] "
1079,1989-11-14," Well, even under alternative A [the funds rate] would still be a point above the discount rate The difficulty, I guess, is that we're obviously looking at close to frictional borrowing levels If the Committee were to decide to ease, for example, I do think that Mr Sternlight could inject some more nonborrowed reserves, attain a funds rate that wasn't somehow out of control in relation to the discount rate, and borrowing would decline Now, we said that under alternative A you would get a $100 million [decline in borrowing] for the 50 basis point [decline in the funds rate] I wonder whether it wouldn't be less than that, given where we are on what's probably a very steep portion of the borrowing function right now--whether it would take a very small change in borrowing to accomplish that easing in policy I think it's possibly quite feasible I don't think we're in a situation where we're in danger of somehow letting the funds rate/discount rate relationship get out of whack or losing control over where it's running now   I gave this some thought There were two major factors weighing in my mind for not having an alternative C One was that not having it in the Bluebook didn't mean the Committee couldn't vote on it at the meeting if it wanted to But the other factor was that policy had just eased and thinking about reversing that action after it had just been taken seemed so strange And, we are just talking about policy between now and [the next meeting]--December 17th  -26-    11/14/89  or 18th or whenever it is So, I made a judgment that alternative C was so unlikely to be chosen that I didn't put it in the Bluebook   Well, we expect it to stay at something close to the 7 percent range through year-end; and at the current level of interest rates we'd expect to see it growing about like that in the first quarter of next year I certainly have no problem putting in an alternative C for those who are bothered by that level of money growth As I said, we thought about it this time and didn't do it; but most of the time we have it in "
1140,1989-12-18," President Forrestal implicitly raised another question that President Hoskins also raised, and we wrestled with it to no end And that is What are the costs and what are the benefits of going to zero as opposed to a steady rate of inflation if you could maintain it at 4-1/2 percent? And they [concluded] that if one believes in one's gut that that's the right thing to do, that's the way we have to go But looking at the literature, there isn't very much out there that enables you to pinpoint the costs of staying at 4-1/2 percent, if you were able to, as opposed to going to zero There are some things we can identify having to do with interactions with the tax system and so forth, shoe leather costs, and what not But they are very hard to quantify and, therefore, would be very difficult to convince the body politic of   Right; that's correct   Right   That's a very difficult question and one that I thought about with regard to the Committee's decision tomorrow morning, in fact, because we do have a situation now in which M2 is running pretty rapidly One can see that it's really a function of the drop in opportunity costs of interest rates rather than some overrun in current-quarter GNP At the same time, what I was going to say tomorrow morning is that it strikes a note of caution when the money supply moves this fast Not many people would put money right into prices; in some sense, it's all a part of a very complex set of interactions And the question is whether the interest rates, or perhaps exchange rates, that have gotten you those money supply growth paths are going to lead some time in the future to higher rates and increases in inflation I think what we've learned over time is that when the money supply grows rapidly over long periods of time, even though we can explain it contemporaneously by the past declines in opportunity costs, inflation rate, [unintelligible], it's a cautionary summons It's a warning bell going off The P* model was an attempt to cut through all that and to say Suppose velocity grows at its long-run trend and output grows at its long-run trend, then how does money in a statistical sense feed through to prices? And where we are right now is that P* is below P We've got a sense of restraint on, but I think in one of Dave's charts, Exhibit 4, you can see that the projected growth in money gets you down where there isn't any difference between P and P* in the early part of 1990 and then it rises again when money growth eases off I don't think there's an easy answer to your question, Governor Angell Ultimately, you would have to crank the whole thing through a big model of interest rates and money demand and all that sort of thing The P* model tends to cut through it a bit I do think that some attention to these money growth rates when they get very high or very low provides a sense of discipline on the central bank to make sure it's not going too far off the track one way or another And that's essentially what P* attempts to do   At some point you have to take account of the decline in velocity, this so-called reentry problem   So, if nominal rates are coming down because inflation is coming down, at some point you've got to increase the real money supply to take account of that drop in nominal rates because velocity will react to that But there are different scenarios; you can do it earlier or you can do it later in some sense   I think you do, because--putting it in other terms--what that M2 growth has done with the monetary restraint is that it in effect contained inflation at least, so that it no longer seems to be accelerating So you're in much better shape than if you had started from a position in which M2 had been growing 2 percentage points faster and inflation was threatening to accelerate Then you really would have more sacrifice to make The sacrifice ratio might not be different, but the total sacrifice might be So, absolutely, I think by acting with restraint over the last couple of years you have simplified or made a little less painful the job of the next 5 years if you were to aim at zero inflation And by getting inflation expectations down, as Governor Johnson pointed out, and by getting I think a bit of credibility, you can see it in the bond market in 1988   Fairly what?   Right   That's correct   Right Actually, consistent with the Greenbook forecast we have a 6 percent M2 growth One of things that we've adjusted here is an assumption about how banks and thrifts respond with their deposit rates It might not be quite the same [assumption] as they use in this other model So we have 6 percent and essentially no change in velocity next year  -25-    12/18-19/89   Right   Mr Chairman, I don't have the wording in front of me, but Section 2(A) of the Federal Reserve Act says in the first sentence, before you get to the Humphrey-Hawkins stuff, something about the growth of money and credit at rates consistent with the expansion of the productive capacity of the economy And I think you could interpret that, with a view to promoting price stability [unintelligible]--   Not quite Other parts of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act may, but the part in the Federal Reserve Act I'm not sure does   I agree with what Peter just said Past studies had shown that seasonal and adjustment borrowing were somewhat different; as Peter said, seasonal borrowing is a little less interest sensitive than adjustment borrowing But we found that when we added the two together we had a function in which seasonal borrowing--the part that wasn't interest sensitive--got lost in the noise of the overall function And I think what's happened here is that with adjustment borrowing being so extraordinarily damped the seasonal borrowing now shows through into the overall function So we've been making these technical adjustments sometimes between meetings We have pointed this out in the Bluebooks for some time now and are trying to take account of it This is something that we've been doing for at least a year I would say   And the swings in seasonal borrowing have been much wider than previously; we're at record levels of seasonal borrowing   By the way, my notes suggest that funds did firm a little toward 8-3/8 to 8-1/2 percent at the close The average on the day was 8-3/8 percent, so there was quite a bit of trading at the [8-1/4 percent rate]   We have a memo underway on that We have been consulting with the discount officers at the Reserve Banks I think we have it on the Board's agenda for late January Is that right?  SPEAKER(?) It's not actually scheduled yet, but that's what we are planning   We are planning to put that on the Board's agenda after further consultation with the Reserve Banks So, yes, we are looking at the seasonal program, even in terms of whether we should have it   That's one reason why we were pushing to get it on the Board's agenda   In our thinking about this, President Boehne, we were certainly going to give an option--if there were major changes in the program--to delay those changes That would be one of the things the Board would need to consider   In the current situation, Governor Johnson, if we were just targeting adjustment borrowing we would be encountering problems of equal magnitude I agree with Peter I don't think we would [unintelligible] the level of adjustment borrowing to shifts in demand for adjustment borrowing I don't think the seasonal borrowing is really the root cause of the problems with the borrowing function   Well, we have thought about it In fact, we had a special session about this at the discount officers' conference in October This is all second hand because I wasn't there, but [they felt] the major issue really had to be the concerns of the banks about coming to the window and what that would convey to the rest of the market in an environment in which there were a lot of questions about bank soundness Although we don't announce discount window borrowings --that's confidential information--often other people in the market know it, in part because we do ask the banks to go out and bid vigorously for funds before they come to the [discount] window So there's somewhat of a pattern of purchases in the federal funds market that tends to broadcast that fact and often it does get out one way or another So I think that's a major issue There were some other factors, such as monitoring their accounts more closely partly because of daylight overdrafts and a few other things like that We put in a penalty discount rate for very large borrowing, which may deter some big banks So there were a number of factors; no one of them seems to explain it  -63-    12/18-19/89   I've given that some thought, Governor Angell It makes me inherently nervous to release projections Maybe this is a bureaucratic problem because quite frequently we're going to be wrong on those projections [Unintelligible] and we also have a problem with the required reserves inherent in that [Unintelligible] So we've given that some thought As I say, I don't like the idea of releasing projections because of the problems and also because I think the market would tend to say Well, they're projecting a $2 billion-a- day need so they ought to be doing $2 billion today It would tie the market's expectations into our projections very, very closely and I think in the end it would reduce our freedom of action If we saw signals in the funds market that tended to contradict our projections, for example, I think releasing the projection would give rise to some very specific expectations about exactly what the Desk would be doing given those projections and would tie our hands even more So, I have some questions about releasing daily projections of two-week reserve needs every day   It might I'd have to think about that and so would Peter That might loosen things up a bit though I think it would have some of the same problems, perhaps ameliorated to an extent One issue that Peter and I have discussed is whether we should release our previous day's balance sheet every day so at least the market would know where we were I just throw that out; that would take care of part of this problem but not all of it and it's something we will be looking into There are pros and cons on that also and a lot of thorny issues that need to be resolved But it's something that Peter and I were planning on looking at over the next month or so   [Statement--see Appendix] "
1141,1989-12-18, P* has almost precisely the Greenbook deflator; it has 39 percent and the Greenbook has 4 percent For 1991 it shows a little tilt down that the Greenbook doesn't; it has 36 percent and the Greenbook stays at 4 percent My guess is that that's the dollar effect going through   That's running it with 6 percent in 1990 and 5 percent in 1991 
1142,1989-12-18," I don't know I can tell you what we were forecasting last time and it's running about 1/2 to 3/4 of a point above that   Well, I think we've had a more vigorous response to the drop in [rates] I'm sure it's running above what we had forecast in September because we have lower interest rates now than we were forecasting in September   But we don't have lower rates than we were forecasting at the last meeting since we just had that easing I just think that we didn't factor in quite enough response to that ease-- quite enough of a drop in velocity, really, in the current or the next quarter We got a faster response and a bit stronger response   I think we're having a somewhat stronger response to the drop in interest rates in October and November than we had [anticipated]   Well, that's the way I would read it, Governor Johnson--that is, I think we are off the peaks And that is sort of confirmed in the long-term real interest rate I think real rates have come down a little but not a whole lot I would ignore those little dips there in what looks like the spring of 1989 because I think that was a surge in inflation expectations associated with food and energy rather than some underlying factor I think the Committee has eased policy since February; real rates have come down but [not] as much as nominal rates The more difficult question is Where are they relative to some equilibrium level? I never thought that rates were that high relative to the equilibrium level, so my guess would be that we've come down a bit but probably not that far from where we ought to be Looking at the long-term rates, including the measurement we did for the Committee a year or so ago on the corporate bond rate and how that lines up with our estimated equilibrium real rate, we're very close--about 20 basis points below   Well, no Do you mean money growth rates?   No, I wouldn't say that Yes, if you carried the 8 percent rate out--I'm not sure I understand the question   I agree If you were to carry 8 percent money growth through '90 and into '91--   Yes, I agree  -89-    12/18-19/89   That's correct At current levels of interest rates, I expect growth on the order of 6 percent for the year as the effects of the previous [rate] declines wear off   It gets you about 1/2 point For Q4 over Q4 we're at a stage where 50 basis points will get you about 1/2 point; 50 basis points now would get you--   Approximately 6-1/2 percent   I'm afraid I don't know, Mr Chairman  SPEAKER(?) Virgil [our General Counsel] is back there   We've had two [unintelligible] without recording them   8-1/2 and 5-1/2 percent   We could use 6 to 10 percent, which is more closely centered on 8-1/4 percent "
1209,1990-02-06," [Statement--see Appendix]   I think they are The forecast that we gave you is our best guess As the Bluebook noted, it lies in the middle of the range of the model forecasts But I think there's some chance that offering rates on deposits might be somewhat lower than the models would judge from past history As I noted in the briefing, I base this on a couple of things One is that we see bank credit as relatively moderate and we see banks acquiring a lot of core deposits from thrifts as they shrink and as the RTC shuts them down In addition, if the RTC gets active again and starts putting out more funds for thrifts to pay off high cost liabilities, thrifts might start shrinking their core deposits a little more--reducing the rates they offer And that would put downward pressure on offering rates So I think the risks are weighted a little more toward 6 percent growth than 7 percent growth on M2   That would obviously work in the same direction We put in fairly restrained bank credit growth, given that we do have them taking over, in effect, a chunk of mortgages from the thrifts-- not literally In some cases they might do clean bank deals in which they would acquire these thrift mortgages But we see them, as they have been in the last several months, a little more active in acquiring mortgages, secondary mortgages essentially But even allowing for that we have fairly restrained bank credit growth If it were even more restrained, then I think the first option [for banks] would be to reduce their managed liabilities and to rely a bit more on retail deposits, which have a more stable base So, I'm not sure how aggressive they would be in reducing that But if they really got their managed liabilities down very far then they could [unintelligible] into the core deposits   That's correct Because we're expecting M2 growth at the top of its range there's nothing preventing you from being tighter than the expectations in that regard I saw the tighter range as in some sense forcing the FOMC's hand and then signaling its intentions But you're absolutely correct   I don't have any quarrel with that statement   By and large the Committee has not adopted a policy of explicitly taking account of where the end point is I think implicitly, though, it does that That is, presumably the economic and financial conditions you're facing as you make this decision are partly a function of, or at least involved with, where M2 ended up last year So, I think the Committee's point always has been Where are we right now? What are the conditions we wish to foster from here on out? Wherever we ended up in the range last year, we can assess the situation right now So, the Committee generally hasn't chosen to worry explicitly about tying one year's range to where it came out in the previous year or intended to come out Rather, it has said Here's where we are; let's go on from here The accusation has been made that, in effect, the Committee has allowed money to drift up more than down over time, although I'm not sure that we haven't corrected some of that upward drift over the last few years The previous thought was that the Committee tended to allow it to go up, but I think in the last couple of years the ranges have been taken from the [actual fourth-quarter level in the previous year], which had come in at the lower part of the range The point is that you look at where you are and see where you want to go forward from wherever you ended up last year   We have real interest rates rising about a point in the baseline and maybe 1-1/2 points in the tighter scenario I would caution you that that's well within the margin--   Well, actually, nominal goes up But to get the real interest rates up because of the momentum behind inflation-- Let's take the tighter scenario since it illustrates the point a little better That has nominal interest rates, say, the nominal funds rate, going up this year and next but only to about 9-1/4 percent, something like that So, it's only a matter of--   The tighter one Under the baseline we used the rates in the Greenbook forecast for this year and next, which only go up very marginally; and then we'd have another marginal increase in 1992 But you do have to have some increase in nominal rates because you can't get the increase in the real rates, given the momentum behind inflation, without some increase in nominal But then they come down in the later years As inflation comes down, nominal rates come down with it, leaving real rates a bit higher in the tighter scenario   In 1994?   Yes, you're right   [Unintelligible] But anyhow, you're right it's something like that   Right   In effect, what's happening in that scenario is that the decline in interest rates from the end of the last half of 1989 tends to push up M2 and push down V2; and then the rise in interest rates in the tighter scenario tends to exert the opposite force and they about offset So, you get essentially no change in velocity for the year   A declining velocity? Because of the drop in the inflation rate, you're saying?   It does in the out years Once that inflation rate goes down and we start seeing that in nominal interest rates under that strategy--in 1993 actually and in 1994--then you get the velocities you're looking at So, it's a question of how fast inflation comes down Under the Chairman's thought that you might get faster 10-month years it would bring that forward But you don't get it for a while because you have to get those real interest rates up and keep them up, in the conventional wisdom of the model, to induce a gap in resource utilization to get the inflation headed down   If the declining commodity prices tend to take the price level and price expectations down with them so that nominal interest rates could fall, then I think you're right That's the way I would think through your scenario-   We have 5 percent in 1991 because we have the runoff of thrift assets slowing down as more thrifts meet their capital requirements   May I make another statement at this point, Mr Chairman? There is some risk [on debt] Although we have 7 percent debt growth for 1990, that is on the assumption that the RTC is off budget and not in the federal government sector That would add a few--    2/6-7/90   The point I was going to make is that if growth came in a little low on M3 that would balance off by being a little high perhaps on debt, if that's the way that came out  SPEAKER(?) I'm ready for lunch! "
1210,1990-02-06, Or [it may reflect] their expectations of what the equilibrium real rate is not only because of Eastern Europe but because the stronger data suggested to them that the economy could go along with sustained growth at higher rates than they previously had thought 
1211,1990-02-06," [Statement--see Appendix]   I would agree with half of the statement but not necessarily the other half, partly based on what you said earlier today, President Parry That is, alternative B is in a projection sense consistent with the 6-1/2 percent [staff forecast] for the year We're assuming for the year essentially no change in interest rates under ""B"" We would expect [M2] growth in the first half of the year  -45-    2/6-7/90  to be stronger than in the second half of the year under those circumstances and to run along the top part of the range rather than the lower part By the same token, if you had adopted a lower range-- the alternative III range--which you didn't do, you would be hard pressed not to begin to lean a little toward ""C"" But to echo what you said earlier today, I think having adopted alternative II doesn't mean you can't lean toward alternative C and tighten because there's a lot of room on the down side Alternative II does not get in the way of running a tighter policy than assumed by the staff It might get in the way of running an easier policy   I agree If you were in favor of ""III,"" you'd be more inclined to ""C""   Relative to the staff forecast of 6-1/2 percent [for M2 growth] you'd have to have an increase of about 1-1/2 points in interest rates in the first half of the year to get [M2 growth] down to 5 percent for the year   That's for Mr Prell; he's in charge of the IS curve! "
1276,1990-03-27," Business credit at commercial banks slowed down around the turn of the year Some of that was the slowness to [move to] lower primes, so commercial paper surged at the same time And a lot of it was merger-related financing If you take out the merger- related financing and add back in the commercial paper, you get a very sluggish picture in short-term business credit But it's a picture that's been present since at least the beginning of 1989   Well, I just have the bank real estate data We're estimating for March, on a very preliminary basis, about a 10 percent increase That follows increases of 13 percent in February and 7 percent in January The January number, however, was probably affected by writedowns Last year we were running in the 10 to 12 percent area and that seems to be continuing pretty much   And March is close to February; it's just a little [less] "
1277,1990-03-27, You were presented alternatives in February and will be again in July 
1278,1990-03-27," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes My sense is that in terms of long-term rates, we have a couple of things working here One is, of course, that the fed funds rate hasn't moved since December 22 or whenever it was we last changed policy Long-term rates have moved substantially higher Inflation expectations may be an element there, but I would put them as a fairly small element I think the response came  -37-    3/27/90  primarily in terms of a stronger economy here at home [plus] some of the pull from the European situation We never did have good data but we have even less information on inflation expectations than we had before now that Mr Hoey is between jobs, but my guess is that they'll do a survey in April   My guess is that people probably are holding off in revising upward their long-run inflation expections on the basis of the last couple of months' data Now, I'm sure there might be some short-run [effect] So, I think most of this is a sense that real rates need to be higher just to keep inflation somewhat in check rather than an increase in inflation expectations But it's certainly anyone's guess   If you thought that most of the increase-- particularly in long-term rates or even the short-term rates--was inflation expectations, then indeed you would need to raise rates   Oh, I think the market would see that as a tighter policy and long-term rates would rise a bit That's what we have in the Bluebook The response might be fairly damped but I really would expect, if you surprised the market by tightening policy at this time, that bond yields would rise at least initially   But it's not as if raising the funds rate would be doing what the market expects you to be doing and, therefore, simply moving out along a yield curve I think what happened before was that the market expected policy to ease Now they don't, and they're doing what the yield curve says So you would be surprising the market with an increase in the funds rate It may be appropriate, but it would be a surprise   Those odds are always there and, particularly if it strengthened the dollar, I think you'd get a feedback through the dollar If you tightened policy and the dollar went up quite strongly --just ignoring what the reactions might be overseas for now--you could have a very substantial feedback on bond yields and bond rates They might not rise very much at all and could even decline, depending  -38-    3/27/90 "
1335,1990-05-15," Part of the issue is what they think the Committee is looking at, President Boehne They are trying to guess what the Fed is going to do and they think that the Committee pays a lot of attention to those numbers   [Statement--see Appendix] "
1336,1990-05-15," I'm not sure I understand Alternative C would--  Right   If alternative C increased our credibility and reduced expected future inflation, that's correct My guess, as noted in the Bluebook, would be that the initial response to such a policy probably would be a rise in bond yields But, as I think the Bluebook also noted, to the extent that this was seen as the Federal Reserve giving extra emphasis to its inflation objective over time, those bond yields would move lower in nominal terms Now, it's also fair to say that the real bond yield might be higher in that case because I think there would be a higher path of expected future real short-term rates than perhaps is built in now But nominal rates could be lower after a bit, especially if the dollar firmed up after our tightening   We have a 5-1/2 percent estimate now for M2; that's down from around 6-1/2 percent at the last meeting The reason for the decrease is two-fold One is the incoming data, which were weaker than we expected, and we scaled down for that; the other is the change in the interest rate path, which is worth probably about half a point So, if you told me to change only interest rates, and I suppose there really wouldn't be much feedback on the economy in 1990 from assuming a different level of interest rates, I'd probably tell you M2 growth will be around 6 percent But it also probably would be strengthening a bit as the year went on, or toward the end of the year, if the economy were picking up a little more speed than we have projected   Yes, with the assumption of rising interest rates So, it would be 6 percent with steady interest rates and nominal GNP as in the Greenbook   Well, I guess I'd have to say it was a combination of both Certainly, the inflation data were far worse than people expected When the March CPI came in, I think that caused an upward revision in expected inflation On the other hand, the incoming economic data continued to suggest that the economy was chugging along at least at a moderate pace and wasn't weakening I think it was a combination of those two things Because the dollar was firm through that period, although a lot was going on in Germany and Japan at the same time, I'd be hard pressed to argue that inflation expectations had picked up to such an extent as to overwhelmingly explain the increase in nominal rates I think real rates at least held steady or probably were a bit on the firm side through that   Well, if instead of just focusing on the last couple of weeks or month or so you go from the end of the year, I think it's true that some of that increase is definitely an increase in real rates But the equilibrium real rate--where real rates need to be to keep the economy in check--is higher So, that increase in real rates would be restraining, but only relative to a lower level of real rates It was an endogenous response, I think, to what has been going on And the previous increase in rates did embody an expectation of Federal Reserve tightening That was very clear in the structure of rates until the most recent employment report "
1391,1990-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to tables in the Bluebook as I go along [Statement--see Appendix]  [Meeting recessed]  -27-    7/2-3/90  July 3, 1990--Morning Session   Yes, especially with regard to M3 We are assuming that the thrifts continue to shrink in 1991 and shrink at close to the rate that they did in 1990, or a little less The marginally solvent ones will remain under pressure and there are enough assets and liabilities out there in the conservator thrifts to keep the RTC going at a pretty good clip for the next six quarters at least So, we built in a continuing shrinkage of the thrift industry and [continuing] activity of the RTC We built in moderate growth in bank credit--about 6-1/2 to 7 percent--which would be a slight pickup from now So, we have diminishing effects relative to the second quarter when we had no growth in M2 and M3 We don't have that built in; we have that moving down or decreasing over time But there are still some effects, yes   Well, I can't tell you exactly what we were assuming for thrift resolutions in the face of the decline in thrift assets last February I'm sure that the staff was not assuming as much as we got in the second quarter But I think maybe the more fundamental point here is that, whatever our assumptions were, we have never tried to set monetary targets in a period in which the depository institutions system was shrinking the way it is now This is unprecedented I agree with your point and Governor Mullins' point that we knew something was going on; we knew things were going to happen I hope I'm not being too defensive if I say that in this    7/2-3/90  situation it's very difficult to judge how the whole thing is going to play out One can easily get surprised and have it then seen as more of a velocity shift or a structural shift rather than a violation of the underlying policy But there is some of the other too because we've had very weak bank credit growth; some of that may be a restraint on the economy, and one can't excuse that altogether So, there is a mixture, I think, and it's not easy to sort out   Well, I think they were both M1 adjustments; the M1 ranges were increased [because] we had velocity surprises They happened to be in the direction of increases rather than decreases   Mr Chairman, there is language in the Bluebook suggested, if the Committee did decide to reduce the 1990 range for M3 and wanted to consider special language   And maybe then just say ""taking account of the unusually strong M3 velocity"" instead of ""the outlook for""   Just take out ""the outlook for"" there since you already would have said it's more than anticipated; so you're saying it's unusually strong   You could take a straw vote, Mr Chairman; that way we wouldn't have to record it "
1392,1990-07-02," The rule of thumb we have been using is that [a decrease of] about 2 percentage points on the funds rate for the year will give you about 2 more percentage points in M2 growth on the standard M2 demand [function] Now, whether that still pertains is another question   I would view this more as a shift in the level of the money supply as interest rates fell or rose--fell, in this case-- and then growth would be along whatever you thought the old equilibrium was relative to whatever inflation rate you want it to be I don't see why this would result in a permanent increase in the growth rate of money; rather, I think it's a level adjustment "
1393,1990-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] "
1444,1990-08-21," If you moved to contain nominal GNP growth under that alternative, two things would be pushing up nominal GNP growth-- both prices and output And if you tried to hold nominal GNP growth, then you'd have more price with the adverse inflation and [unintelligible] less real growth for that nominal GNP growth "
1445,1990-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, let me make one or two comments and then Dave or Ted may want to comment as well One is--and this follows the conversation we had before--that I think it's important to distinguish between GNP prices and the CPI   You get a lot more [effect] on the CPI, given that it has imports in it and given that it has a higher weight on energy, than you would on GNP prices Secondly, it's sort of a function of the model; it falls out of the model's parameters, which are based on past experience I think you could argue that past experience was distorted; we had controls in certain cases and things like that So, I think it is particularly difficult to get a reading on what's going to happen now    8/21/90   Yes, everything was distorted by the controls, certainly in the first period So, my thought is that past experience may not be that good a guide And that simply reinforced my own feeling that one can start with the staff forecast as a first approximation, but this is probably a period in which the odds on that coming through are less than I would usually say is true for the staff forecast and, therefore, that one needs to be somewhat more adroit and alert in changing policy if in fact the incoming information is not so suggestive--   We have 4 percent quarterly average growth in the fourth quarter But I believe the monthly numbers, which I don't have right in front of me, are lower than that We come out of the third quarter higher, so I think we're looking at rates more like 3-1/2 percent on a monthly basis in the fourth quarter And partly because we have the RTC activity picking up at the end of September, once again that starts depressing M2 growth early in the fourth quarter And then we have opportunity costs perhaps even widening a little as banks and thrifts reduce their offering rates in lagged response to other rates So, we don't have any big push in M2 for the fourth quarter We did raise the projection for the year to 4 percent based largely on incoming data, revisions to past data, and how we saw the third quarter We didn't really strengthen our outlook beyond the third quarter very much "
1502,1990-10-02," Mr Chairman, if I could add to this for a second I think--we'll see whether [Peter] agrees--that things became even tighter after that Thanksgiving problem we had but loosened up a bit recently I think the problem in the last few weeks has been one of extraordinarily volatile expectations that we were going to ease, perhaps momentarily And if we're not doing what the market expects us to be doing, that's always going to be a problem for the Desk And there's also a greater disconnection between the funds rate and the underlying reserve conditions I wonder, without being able to prove it, whether that isn't partly a function of the problems with the way these banks are changing their operations to some extent in the money markets That creates another set of problems for the Desk So, I think we've had some pretty unusual circumstances over the last three maintenance periods   But in general, my sense is that we've loosened a bit over the last few months relative to where we were right after Thanksgiving   I wasn't trying to make that case, no I'm not sure that would help them in terms of trying to guess what we're going to do tomorrow, which is really what it's all about--not what we did yesterday "
1503,1990-10-02," For the fourth quarter?   We have a minus 2 percent velocity Now, we wrestled with this issue, and we tried to address it at least in a sentence or two in the Bluebook Obviously, we did not have a comparable slowdown in money to accompany the slowdown in nominal GNP Just from a modeling perspective, we find that the models are driven by consumption, and nominal consumption remains quite high A lot of that is prices--oil and whatnot--and it's not real But nominal spending--dollars flowing through--remains quite high, and that should help to support M2 From a more theoretical perspective, the notion is that holdings and increases in holdings of M2 are related in some sense to notions of permanent income and longer-term trends So, we wouldn't ordinarily expect money demand to react very sharply contemporaneously to slowdowns in nominal GNP It would work through in the sense that it averages through in a slower path in nominal GNP over time That's how we tried to square this circle We really don't expect a comparable slowdown in M2 for those reasons "
1504,1990-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think we're still seeing that velocity shift That is, if you look at the resumption of growth that we've had on a quarterly average basis, we're still seeing in the third quarter a quarterly average growth of only 3 percent even with the last two months being strong And that's about 2-1/2 percentage points less than the model was predicting for the nominal GNP we think we have gotten We have growth in the fourth quarter projected at about 4-3/4 percent on a quarterly average basis; it's 4 percent month-over-month And even that, I think, is close to 2 points less than the model predicted So, yes, there has been some pickup in M2 growth, but certainly if it slows down to the 4 percent pace, that's still consistent with the velocity shifts we thought we were getting before We have about 4-1/2 percent for the year and that's a 1-1/2 percent shift over the year, which is not completely out of line with past history though on the outer edge of it So, I don't think the pattern really contradicts what we were talking about at midyear; it may be a little stronger, probably impelled by these uncertainty factors I think the underlying shifts are still there Governor Mullins remarked about the deposit components still being weak, and that was part of the picture [Banks] didn't need to make loans; they didn't need deposits; they weren't going to compete for funds and I think that's still true   Slightly, in the sense that as I thought about the sort of--   For the tightening alternative, ""C""?   I think there is some support for it If you thought it was sufficiently severe, my feeling was--I think I used the word ""practical"" as I presented these--   Under the circumstances of a tightening fiscal policy and widely expressed concerns about credit conditions, my feeling was that an alternative C was in the Bluebook but I didn't see expending a lot of the Committee's time on it so close to lunch   No, the easiest alternative I had was exactly the same as this--an ""A minus/B""  SPEAKER(?) That's right   I think they'd go down Peter, I think, may disagree The market is not expecting that, but in a situation in which the economy is seen to be very weak and fiscal policy is moving toward restraint, whether it's enough or not, I think long-term rates would go down They wouldn't go down by anywhere near the 50 basis points, though It would be a restrained reaction And if the dollar fell and if the incoming data in the subsequent couple of months didn't confirm the economic weakness [unintelligible], then bond rates would end up two months from now higher than they are right now  SPEAKER(?) Absolutely   We have a little, but slowing down This is not a war forecast or something like that We have conditions settling down somewhat, but still we have allowed a little for the flight to liquidity Though we still have this velocity shift going on, it's not as much as we had in the third quarter; we have much less in the fourth quarter in a settling down kind of process  -39-    10/2/90   It's up a little, but not much   As I indicated in my briefing, I think an action before the budget is at least more wrapped up than it is now would be a little confusing to the markets They wouldn't know whether you were responding to fiscal policy or to credit market conditions and that sort of thing Under those circumstances, I would advocate that the Chairman look for an opportunity to explain that and explain what was propelling the Committee and give the reasons why you did it I think that would be important, especially if it were separated from the fiscal policy response   I think I'll stay out of it! [Laughter] Obviously, we aggregate these things; they work better that way  SPEAKER(?) Good choice   We would make a shift adjustment for this, so all our published data [would reflect that] Traditionally, whenever we publish reserve requirements, as St Louis does for its monetary base requirements, we would make a shift adjustment In dollar terms it would drop the monetary base   I'll talk to you after the presentation; save it up for next time "
1566,1990-11-13," It would be more a problem if we were trying to judge the adjustment borrowing--   We have operated before with the funds rate below the discount rate    11/13/90   Our projections, President Hoskins, actually have us squeezing through February with a little breathing room; I'm not sure about Peter's It is the case after the dewarehousing--and obviously depending on what happens to the dollar and the reserve requirements and what not--that if reserve requirements were reduced as a policy move, something would have to be done about using the foreign currency holdings We don't have enough space to move   And they used to pay up more, even before, at the end of the quarter on the statement dates; the spread would widen for a day or two and then come back down So, it's clear that people, rational or not, were having trouble showing that [borrowing] on their balance sheets   My view would be that it would not, because the difference in interest rates, in effect the fed funds rate, is very minor and, therefore, the demand for required reserves would be affected by a very, very small amount I'd be skeptical, as Peter is   I think their participation was down from the previous couple of auctions but still pretty high given that [market] rates had come down closer to the deposit rates    11/13/90   Maybe It's close, but it looks as if we have a much better chance than we did before the [dewarehousing]   Yes, by the Board   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It will be published the Friday after the December meeting--about the 21st   I doubt there were any such instances   Since the end of 1982, when we went off the nonborrowed reserve-- "
1567,1990-11-13," The authors of the Bluebook had in mind a bit how the market perceived the Fed's priorities in making this [recent] move The Fed has been seen as a very reluctant ""easer"" through a period of weakness If the next move were perceived as changing the priorities--moving toward [concern about] the real economy and a bit away from prices, that could have a significant impact If, on the other hand, it didn't see it that way-- That's why there is this uncertainty; it's really impossible to answer the question because it's a question of the psychology and the perceptions about our reaction, basically "
1568,1990-11-13," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, it's largely an assumption The incoming data are quite weak The most recent weekly data actually suggested a decline; I don't have anything new since the Bluebook Our presumption was that, with short-term rates having declined, some of the weakness was a bit of an aberration and some of that would level out and start back up again So, it's a projection based on past relationships and based on the staff's economic forecast which is for weak income growth and still an increase in nominal income   We certainly have projected considerably less money than the models suggest   We've actually allowed a larger shortfall from the model's projection in the fourth quarter than we've had for the past few   1-1/2 and 0   Zero? Can you have 1 to 2 percent on M2 and just forget M3? The 0 is for M3   Just forget about M3?  -45-    11/13/90   Sure I think we won't get it, but that's fine "
1628,1990-12-18," We expect some increase, but relatively small It is very hard to gauge, given that banks presumably would re-orient and    12/18/90  re-configure their transactions to avoid those overdrafts if possible In terms of required clearing balances, my understanding is that that is driven primarily by the commercial banks in an effort to avoid overnight overdrafts   Our projections agree with Peter's   The Chairman signed a letter--I asssume it went out last Friday or Monday--to the Hill notifying them and an S-letter notifying the [Reserve Banks] Hopefully, there will not necessarily be a public announcement; it's up to them An S-letter should be already out or will be going out to the Reserve Banks with the appropriate documentation to the Federal Reserve agents That was supposed to go out at the same time, so it might have left yesterday   As I indicated in the Bluebook, I think that would produce a little uncertainty I agree completely with Peter that from a technical perspective he could execute policy either way, particularly now that we pay a lot more attention to the funds rate and a lot less attention to borrowing than we used to But I do think putting the funds rate under the discount rate would raise a question    12/18/90  in some minds as to whether we had gone to a penalty discount rate And it also would raise questions because the newspapers have reported that there are preferences within the Fed not to do that So, I think if they see that, they then would be waiting for a discount rate change It would raise a bit of uncertainty but it's certainly completely doable from a technical perspective It would perhaps lead to a small increase in federal funds rate volatility, but very small   [Statement--see Appendix] "
1629,1990-12-18," We tried to stick with about a normal difference First, we have a different base here We are meeting earlier in the month than usual Ordinarily, we would have a December-to-March base and we'd be meeting around the end of December or early January So partly, it's because we're meeting a couple of weeks earlier Aside from that, we didn't do anything special to widen the difference We used the usual assumed elasticities   I think that's roughly in line with what we see as the elasticities after three or four months   I can give you some numbers on what if the funds rate changes by x basis points, that kind of thing   A 50 basis point decrease in the funds rate--now this is a quarterly average, so it won't show up the way it would in the monthly numbers--gets you about 3/4 point for the year, but it's loaded into the first and particularly the second quarters So 1/2 point on the funds rate will get you about 09 by the second and third quarters and then it tends to drop off after a while   Dave just handed me a note the elasticity after, say, four or five months is about 08 or 09   Well, I think in this case a lot depends on how the offering rates adjust to the market interest rates That adjustment drives this a lot; the elasticities are lower over time because the offering rates then adjust to the market rates So over time--after a couple of years--you get some very low elasticities But our assumption here is that the offering rates, while adjusting perhaps faster than we would have thought a couple years ago because the market rate is moving down and we presume the banks don't want [to attract deposits], would still adjust sluggishly   About the second quarter of this year Well, that's not quite a fair response We've had large errors from  -28-    12/18/90  quarter-to-quarter and even for a couple of quarters in a row But in terms of cumulative error, this year we're going to have the largest error we've had, even outside the sample period, by at least a half point   In terms of alternative A?   In the 6 to 7 percent range, I think It would still be an increment from where it would have been otherwise So I guess what we would have would be more like 7 percent   I think you could have that kind of growth I'll try to be a little clearer here We are assuming that this upward shift in velocity continues--a downward shift in money demand--so we're sort of going off a base If we had alternative A, say, that will give us about 125 or 150 basis points [since] this past summer Before, we would have expected much more rapid growth by the second quarter of next year if it weren't for this shift Our models, in fact, are projecting growth of around 6-1/2 percent in the first quarter; instead we have 2-3/4 percent growth So, we have that down by an increment, but that's relative to the fourth quarter which is already coming down So, we still get the trajectory going up It just has a couple of percentage points shaved off what you would have expected before the second quarter   We're trying a number of experiments using yield curve variables and things along that line to try to capture substitutions in and out of M2 Our expectation was to try to supply the Committee before the February meeting--well before the February Committee meeting, we hope--with a memorandum summarizing the various experiments we've been running to help to explain this number A pure model forecast with alternative B in it has a 5-3/4 percent growth in the first quarter and then 4-3/4 percent in the second quarter [One- and-one-half percentage points of] the impetus [behind] that 5-3/4 percent is an interest rate effect; the interest rate decline we've had through the fourth quarter has its biggest effect in the first quarter in that model   The problem, President Black, is that it rests on an assumption about what the equilibrium velocity level is And I think the discussion we just had--   Occasionally, we have some doubts about whether we will return to V* or not at that--   We're beginning to accumulate a few quarters that tend to move it away, but so far we certainly don't have any long-run evidence that it has moved away If velocity were to return to its old pattern and if we were to get the same M2 growth--so that the Committee didn't compensate by having more M2 growth as velocity shifted back--then you'd get this pattern of prices   Peter may want to answer this as well, but my thought was that you really have two instruments for that One is the press release If this were the decision of the Committee and the  -30-    12/18/90  Board separately arrived at [a decision to cut the discount rate] but somehow coordinated that, we could hint--without necessarily saying the funds rate will only drop by 1/4 point--that it's partly to catch up to previous decreases in market interest rates That would be a very broad hint and we could play with that wording to give the best possible clue in the press release And I think it would only take a couple of operations by Mr Sternlight thereafter to make it clear If they dropped the funds rate further than the Committee wanted it to, all we have to do is bring in some reserves in a pretty aggressive way Now, I think you're right that the churning around year-end is a problem; and my view is that if we're going to do something, we probably ought to do it in the next couple of days to get it out there and done with and then pretty well even keel it through this potentially difficult period around year-end But I don't see why it can't be done in the next few days   I don't know We had a grand debate when we were writing the Bluebook as to whether something like this would take the prime rate down Most of us felt that come hell or high water banks probably wouldn't do it before the first of January I do think that another easing and something as symbolic as the discount rate might pry a few people loose even before year-end A further easing in my mind would raise the odds to a very, very high level that the prime rate will come down after year-end The issue is whether they might reduce it sometime in the next two weeks The discount rate change might do [the trick] by focusing some attention on it But I think it almost certainly--he says hesitatingly!--would happen at some point after the first of the year It would still leave an unusually wide spread between funding costs, assuming CD rates came down pari passu with the funds rate So their margins would still be wide   It has   Norm, I would put 4 percent and 1 percent in the two blanks at the end "
1686,1991-02-05," I assume they would run off as they mature   Yes   The FOMC has been authorizing the warehousing on an annual basis when it votes on this   Several members of the Committee and other presidents questioned the need for it Several expressed the view that, indeed, whoever was doing this leaking knew it was wrong, so why do we have to pass more rules? A couple members of the Committee were concerned that the language having to do with verbal or unwritten--as well as written--material was overly broad and might end up gagging their ability to discourse in public even in the normal course of business without [divulging] anything that could be used in that way Let's see, those were two of the reasons Really, it was Why do we need this? It could be misinterpreted; it could be used against the Committee at some point It seems unnecessary, so why go forward with it? That was, I think, the general nature of the objections Norm, do you--   If we didn't sterilize it, the supply of reserves would be changed and the funds rate would be different So, I think in order to peg the funds rate, we have to sterilize it If I can see that the funds rate is being basically determined by supply and demand for reasons--   Either way I think it's--   If we didn't sterilize it, then it would show through presumably to total reserves, to interest rates, to borrowing, or whatever it is the Committee is targeting   Bigger and longer, too   Yes, it suggests that they're close to what they would hold for clearing purposes alone   Transactions balances are a very small proportion of total deposits; they're less than 10 percent, or in that range  -10-    2/5-6/91   I think there is still a tax involved in this reserve requirement because if one were transacting with a private bank, one might hold these balances but at least receive compensating balance credits or earnings credit on them They would serve double duty for you We don't allow them to serve double duty, although that's part of what is going on The banks are building up their clearing balances and those balances do serve double duty, but the required reserves [do not]   $26 billion, I think   Right, but that's not included in our required reserves We have about $16 billion of required reserves this week, which is the seasonal low, plus another $26 or $27 billion of required clearing balances   Yes   Well, I think that $26 or $27 billion will rise over time so that people feel more comfortable with the total level of their balances with the Federal Reserve   The last time the Board testified to the Congress on this, which was 5 or 6 or 7 years ago probably, we linked those two proposals partly because we were concerned about the politics of giving the banks money and enhancing their profits We thought both of those were desirable for really very different reasons but [the proposed legislation] didn't go anywhere   Yes, I think it probably would be welcomed   Well, yes I think that's part of what has been going on really for a couple of years now I don't know that it's the shift of the borrowing function; the borrowing function has gotten down so close to the origin that it's hard to imagine further shifts But I would guess, if anything, that in the last several months it has been worse   Yes, the safety valve I will talk about this tomorrow, but in some sense the safety valve of the discount window doesn't seem to be there and so we get these 90 percent funds rates that banks feel they have to bid before they come into the window As Peter said, there has been a lot more use of the window, partly because they were just about forced--they had to [borrow] in order to avoid overnight overdrafts I'm not sure that's so bad; it creates a little background in borrowing here   No, I think it was for monetary policy purposes   I think the other point was that we can't reduce the reserve requirements--say, take them down to 8 percent and then put them back again and pay interest on the difference between 8 and 12 or 14 percent or something like that There was some protection, I believe, in the [law]   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   My interpretation of the charts--and I think Mike had the same interpretation--was that something unusual did seem to be happening in the depository sector It was hard to see it reflected-- in his charts, anyhow--in total credit or total borrowing really The flow of credit relative to GNP didn't look all that different from past recessions--although it was consistent with a recession, which we weren't anticipating at the beginning of the year   Right The banking depository credit was extraordinarily weak, and we think that's what is being reflected in M2 Now, part of the reason we have a velocity shift is because some part of that weakness in depository credit doesn't matter As Mike pointed out, to the extent that it just reflects easily securitized consumer credit or mortgage credit that flows through different channels, the final borrowers--for example, households in this case-- don't even know who is holding their credit It doesn't matter to them whether it's a bank or someone else But when it seems to cut a little further into small businesses, where information is important and where the cost of rechanneling the credit may be rather high, then [it does] So, to the extent that it's easily rechanneled, we could get an increase in velocity because the banks wouldn't need to issue time deposits GNP would be whatever it was anyhow and M2 would be weak relative to GNP But to the extent that it cut into not so easily rechanneled credit, it would have an effect both on M2 and on GNP That's why I say I think some of the weakness we saw in M2 was reflected in GNP over the year and some of it was this velocity shift But the velocity shift persists To the extent that it does persist, we don't need to worry about that amount of shortfall in M2 relative to GNP And I think that is the part that's easily rechanneled in our depository institutions   Further questions for Don? Governor Angell   That's because in the past we haven't shown those interest rates in here In the baseline forecast, for example, we would have interest rates averaging about 5-3/4 percent by the end of 1995--just to give the end point   We have a 5-3/4 percent funds rate in the baseline and about 5-1/8 percent in the slower M2 [growth scenario]   Sure In the fourth quarter of '93 it's 6-1/2 percent, rounded, in the baseline and it's about the same actually [in the slower M2 growth scenario] The fourth quarter of '93 is about where the crossover occurs   That is the funds rate   Governor Angell, I can give you the deviation from the baseline I don't have the charts showing the actual rates in the baseline, but I can tell you for the corporate bond rate that by the end of 1995 it is lower in the tighter alternative than in the baseline by about 15 basis points   Certainly, without credibility it would be higher The way this works is that in the slower growth scenario--in order to damp money growth even more than the staff forecast, given the momentum of GNP--you have to raise interest rates You have higher nominal and real interest rates that damp spending gradually That then feeds through to inflation How fast it feeds through might depend on credibility effects; in the model there aren't any credibility effects And then the [lower] inflation will bring down nominal rates, although you'd still have higher real rates, at least  -40-    2/5-6/91  with a backward-looking expectations [model], and a higher unemployment rate at the end of this period under the tighter alternative, as you see from the table   Right   Right If there were credibility effects, obviously, that would feed through faster and bond [prices] would probably rise; but [the markets] have to believe us In my mind, the credibility comes mostly from our actions rather than from our words So, it would take a while for that credibility to build But once it did, then I believe that bond yields certainly would come down faster than we've captured in here   Do you want to read that portion, Norm?   8-1/2 Let's not swallow it back too much; it's 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent "
1687,1991-02-05," Are you referencing the Bluebook?   Right It's our view, which we expressed in the Bluebook, that we could get either the [unintelligible] However, if [the Federal Reserve] had some credibility, we think the tighter alternative would give you some combination of higher output and lower inflation than presented here These simulations embodied entirely backward-looking expectations   I think that's also noteworthy with respect to your observation about real GNP over this time In some sense it helps that we've started above the assumed natural rate so that you can push the economy for a little while It's a bit like Mike's alternative simulation Inflation takes a while to begin picking up because we don't drop below the natural rate for a time So, in some sense this was a favorable starting point for a more expansive policy But you'll note that when we get out to 1995 finally, we do have lower growth in output; it's a little higher level of output and we do have a soaring inflation At some point, presumably, the Fed would have to [rein that inflation] in   Seven percent "
1688,1991-02-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   If we build in the error that seems to be in train for the first quarter--that is, if we put in the 4 percent and the 5 percent that we had for February and March--that would give us 2-1/2 percent for the first quarter Now, the model has something like 6 percent for the second quarter but we wouldn't expect anything like that We'd be looking probably at something more in the 4 to 5 percent area as a judgmental forecast We're looking at a 1-3/4 percent approximate shortfall from the model for the year; we have a substantial part of that in the first quarter but not entirely I don't have a projection for the first half that really goes with alternative B, but I would guess off the top of my head that it implies something like 5 percent, which would be about a 1-point shortfall from the model; the latter was saying 6 percent   It never was very high   Can we say 3 to 4 percent, using round numbers, rather than 3-3/4 and 3-1/2 percent?  -61-    2/5-6/91   We have it projected up there by March   3-3/4 percent for M3 and 3-1/2 percent for M2   We're going to write 3-1/2 to 4 percent in there? "
1754,1991-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman I can summarize our points briefly First, the task force noted that over recent history there have been periods of fairly automatic passthroughs of discount rate changes to federal funds rates and periods in which on a number of occasions only part or none of the change in the discount rate was echoed in the federal funds rate The first regime has tended to prevail since late 1979; the second in the 1970s Under a borrowed or nonborrowed reserve operating target for open market operations, the passthrough tended to be automatic When open market operations were geared to achieving federal funds rate targets, discount rate changes often flowed through but the decision was more discretionary; the adjustment was often not basis point for basis point And when intermeeting ranges for the federal funds rate were narrow, as in the late 1970s, chances of inconsistencies were heightened and the passthrough became less frequent  Second, we did not attempt to resolve what was meant by ""pressures on reserve positions"" in the current directive Clearly, the FOMC has in mind a specific federal funds rate level And the Desk operates with an anticipation of that level being achieved with only secondary thought given to the borrowing objective At the same time, the Committee has deliberately avoided explicit announced federal funds targets and explicit narrow ranges for movements in the funds rate objective over the intermeeting period  Against this background, there seems to be something to be said for at least a fairly strong presumption of a passthrough of discount rate changes in many, if not most, circumstances Such a policy would retain one element that has fostered a degree of flexibility in federal fund rates in the 1980s, avoiding the rigidities that became built into the system in the 1970s Inconsistencies between passing through changes in discount rates and the FOMC directive are likely to be rare Whatever information causes the [Reserve Bank] boards of directors to vote for a change and the Board of Governors to approve the change would usually also call for an adjustment under the directive At the same time, there are circumstances in which the potential federal funds rate response to a discount rate adjustment would seem to call for a discussion by the Committee One such circumstance might be when the change in the discount rate was not intended to show through entirely; this would involve an adjustment to the borrowing objective Another would be if the full passthrough of a discount rate change implied an especially large change in the federal funds rate between Committee meetings    3/26/91  The task force suggested enhanced consultation in these circumstances If possible, this would include advance notice to Committee members of the action contemplated and an opportunity for thorough discussion of the alternatives Now, I'd like to give my colleagues, Peter Sternlight, Karl Scheld, and Virgil Mattingly a chance to add their thoughts I think Peter does have a few things to say   I would only comment that it wasn't clear to us and we deliberately did not attempt to specify exactly what open market operations meant This goes back to the ambiguities as to what the directive really [unintelligible] It was clear, I think, from 1979 to 1987 when open market operations were aimed at borrowed reserve and nonborrowed reserve targets Now, it's less clear So,    3/26/91  the legal appendix didn't really help much--it didn't help me anyhow-- in a policy sense of deciding what ought to happen   I think there were instances in the middle '80s period when it went both ways Norm and I looked in the record before the last FOMC meeting and found at least one meeting in which the Board had acted right before an FOMC meeting and then another meeting several months later during which the FOMC members had a discussion such as the one at last December's meeting So, it went both ways   But, as Peter remarked in his briefing, it's not just a technical thing Part of the reaction in the markets was [because] we didn't lower the discount rate and it looked like we weren't intending to do anything again very soon So, I don't think I agree entirely with Peter's answer that if we did lower it, the market's reaction would be entirely neutral It would be seen as giving a scope for further easing much as when the Germans raised their [Lombard] rate and made a very loud noise about how it wasn't going to affect their overnight rate and everyone assumed it was going to affect the overnight rate eventually anyhow It's very hard to change [the discount rate] when the spread had been zero, [and have] a neutral effect at this point   Without it showing through or with it showing through?   I think it would have much less of an impact on the dollar than if an actual cut in the funds rate had accompanied it "
1755,1991-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman It's late, and Governor Mullins gave half my briefing, so I'll try to summarize what I have left [Statement--see Appendix]   None   I think the largest false positives previously of an up movement in the stock market in the middle of a recession have been about 5 percent   Mr Chairman, the only issue I'd raise is whether, given your tendency not to move, ""might"" would be a better word than ""would"" "
1805,1991-05-14," There is nothing to ratify   On the 3-year note, they were very close to the previous one; but I'm not sure about the 10- and the 30-year issues   On the index I'm looking at, which is the Merrill Lynch index, although the spreads have narrowed by 4 percentage points from their highs around the end of the year, as Peter said, they are    5/14/91  back to where they were in the first half of 1990 And that's 4 percentage points over where they were in '86, '87, and '88 "
1806,1991-05-14," [Statement--see Appendix]   Norm, it will be fun writing the policy record on this one!   The one that was distributed "
1856,1991-07-02," [Statement--see Appendix]   Obviously, there's a wide band of error around any of these projections Mike would be the first to admit that   We're obviously giving you our best guess based on experience, model results, etc We are coming at this from the trough of a recession in which we do have some slack in resource utilization, which gives us some encouragement that we can both reduce that slack, keeping the unemployment rate above the natural rate of unemployment, and get some progress on inflation It is a middle road It's a new version of a soft landing in some sense and perhaps the ideal outcome Obviously, there's a lot of room for slippage on either side And the issue for you, I guess, is whether you want to aim at that or aim at something else The other piece of slippage, of course, is between money and the objectives Not only is there uncertainty about the underlying forces in the economy but there is a lot of uncertainty about what money growth paths one would choose in order to hit some agreed on set of objectives So, that compounds it   If I may take the liberty of retranslating your question Our forecasts are based on a path for nominal interest rates and they relate that to spending and through that to output, employment, and inflation; and another way of putting your question is whether over 5 or 10 years I would have as much or a little more faith in a money/nominal GNP relation than I would in a nominal interest rate/GNP relation I think as we practice policy we end up looking at both of those and at a number of collateral pieces of information to try to interpret the interest and exchange rates--with money being an important piece of collateral information But we'd be hard pressed to put entire reliance on one or another set of these things   No, I guess I wouldn't I think the widening of the ranges reflected two things One is the increased interest elasticity of M2 So, working as we do with interest rates and nominal GNP, and feeding that back through M2, a mistake on the interest rate/nominal GNP spending side means that the Committee would tend to push interest rates higher or lower and, because M2 is more interest sensitive now than it used to be over short periods of time, we can get quite a substantial response in M2 to get the same nominal GNP with the same inflation outcome in the short run, cyclically The other point would be that, if anything, I'm a little more uncertain about the relationship of M2 to nominal GNP now than I was two or three years ago when I thought we had a very good handle on it--at least it looked like--over four [to] six quarters Now I'm less sure So, the fact that we came out near the midpoint of the ranges the last few years is almost a coincidence, involving offsetting surprises to some extent I know, for example, that last year, 1990, we expected money growth--and I think the Committee didn't disagree with this-- near the upper part of the range by the end of the year And it fell way off So, I think there's at least as much uncertainty about those relationships now as there was when the Committee widened its ranges   I think I just expressed my uncertainty to President Hoskins I'm not sure I could emphasize it any more We see that miss being related in part to the unusual developments in the  -29-    7/2-3/91  depository sector over the last year the shrinkage of the thrift industry and the simultaneous problems of the banks and the effects they are having on both depositors and depositories Since we're projecting an expansion in the economy and a slow abatement of the credit crunch--and that these pressures on the depositories and the thrift adjustment, while continuing, won't be accelerating anyhow-- we're projecting that in growth rate terms M2 and GNP will come back closer into their historical alignment over time But it is purely a projection that comes out of this notion of the abatement of some of these severe pressures with the economic expansion But there is just a huge amount of uncertainty about that It is the case that relative to the models the errors in the first half of this year were a little less than they were last year, and that by either extraordinary skill or pure dumb luck we actually projected the model error at the beginning of this year The model error we got for the first half of the year is pretty close to what we expected   We tried to hint at that in strategy IV, in which we were sort of having fun fine-tuning this We said ""Well, suppose the Committee put a little more money in now How fast would they have to take it out so that at least they didn't get off the track of strategy I?"" But, obviously, there are lots of permutations and combinations   We start with the presumption of a strategy for policy involving slow deceleration of inflation, holding the unemployment rate around 6 percent We ask what nominal GNP and interest rates would be consistent with that and the M2 fell out of that We did not set out to design a rule for money growth You couldn't hold--   Exactly And we recognize in the P* simulations-- they are sort of footnotes here--the notion that you couldn't hold to 5-1/2 percent forever and get decelerating inflation It's too fast   It's our best guess and I agree with you that we could have some more If you thought that the shrinkage of the depository institutions system was just beginning, by asking for more capital, closing all these thrifts, we would really be rerouting credit away from these institutions The new banking bill will put depositors, at least uninsured depositors, at risk if it passes and I think accelerate that process If anything, one could easily make a case for asking what they are going to do with all those M2 [funds] They won't need them; they won't have any loans to make and we will have greater downward shifts in the out years I think one could also make a case, which is sort of embodied in the P* model, that we've had a constant velocity since World War II on average Actually one can go back earlier, I guess--is that right, Mr Chairman?--to World War I and we've had constant M2 velocities since then And what the staff is assuming here is that V* is changing; that is in effect what we're doing here We have permanent velocity shifts, which is fighting an awful lot of history So, I can make arguments, as I just did, on both sides of that   Well, in fact, the 5 percent growth for the year 1991--5-1/2 percent over the two quarters of the second half of the year on average--really has very little further downward shift relative to our standard demand model So, it will be interesting to see whether that happens   Okay, I'm not sure I see the 3-1/4 percent; I see 2-1/2 percent   Oh, I see I'm sorry; you're right I think the point is that you tighten up a lot earlier in strategy II and then in order to keep the unemployment rate from rising, at some point you have to ease off a bit and push in a little real M2 or you're going to have even faster increases in the unemployment rate out there The other point is that with the slower growth--this probably accounts for  -31-    7/2-3/91 -32-  even more of it--and the lower inflation of strategy II, the tighter strategy, nominal interest rates are moving down pretty substantially by the end of the period, almost a percentage point below the baseline Baseline nominal interest rates also begin to move down in '94 and '95 as inflation abates, to keep the real rates from rising too much They move down even faster in the slower money growth strategy because inflation is coming off even more As those nominal rates move down, you get increased demands for money in the usual velocity sense of lower velocity And if you didn't push in more M2, you wouldn't get the decline in nominal rates; things would explode in a tightening way So, you need more M2 in the out years in order to satisfy demands for money compelled by lower interest rates   Right, but even more under the tight scenario in the late years because inflation is coming down more and nominal interest rates come down more For nominal interest rates, although they go up in the tight scenario right away and stay higher, the decline is a full 2 percentage points from '92 through '95 In the baseline scenario, the decline is about 3/4 of a percentage point   Well, the answer is in this interest rate effect-- that is, the effect of money once you take account of the demands for money associated with lower interest rates It isn't that much; the growth doesn't accelerate that way under the tighter alternative; you get some additional [growth], but not as much as [under the easier one]   Below alternative I? Below 6 percent? That would be a lot of credibility! But it's moving in that direction   Anything is possible, Governor Angell   Mr Chairman, could I interrupt just a second? In the Bluebook we raised the issue of whether the Committee wished to delete the words ""a resumption of sustainable growth"" in the first sentence We put that in when the economy was in recession   Yes, the long-run part of the directive "
1857,1991-07-02," I can address this now since the subject has been raised, and I'll skip it when I get to my briefing We see a couple of things that are different this time than in past recoveries First, we are still predicting some further downward shifts in money demand We've had a history over the last year of money falling short of what we'd expect, given nominal income and interest rates Based on historical experience, we're predicting that that will continue, although at diminishing rates So, we have some downward shifts of money demand that we haven't had in previous expansions Secondly, we came in, as Mike just said, with a less steeply sloped downward trajectory of interest rates I believe that a lot of the extra money we got early in an expansion before was a lagged effect of the previous stimulus coming in And we have considerably less stimulus coming into this trough, in terms of the trajectory of the federal funds rate, other interest rates, and certainly long-term interest rates, than we've had in other expansions Third, this is the first expansion we've ever had without Reg Q or without Reg Q being removed Look at 1983 A huge portion of the M2 growth in the first year of that expansion was the result of MMDAs and the removal of Reg Q ceilings So, we don't believe that deposit rates have been held below equilibrium over the last couple of years as they probably were in a Reg Q environment We are predicting that deposit rates could edge down even further in the first couple of quarters of this expansion That will raise opportunity costs and damp M2 demands So,'those are the three factors that we think differentiate this from previous expansion periods   Well, in the staff's estimation, in order to hold down money growth and nominal GNP, you have to have higher real interest rates And in order to get this kind of price performance by '95 you have to hold [real rates] up there and the unemployment rate has to be high Clearly, we could have fine-tuned this to some extent to get a little more unemployment now and a little less later I was bothered also by this accelerating path of unemployment   But I think the basic point there is that without credibility effects and the sacrifice ratio somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 or a little less, you're going to have to have quite a bit of unemployment to get price stability or something approaching price stability by 1995   Yes   Well, the baseline was the extension of the staff Greenbook forecast So, we had the 5-1/2 percent we're projecting for the next 18 months Then we extended that through '93 with the judgmental forecast and also through '94 and '95 We didn't set out with a 5-1/2 percent rule What we did was to set out what we thought was a policy strategy that is, to bring the unemployment rate down gradually but to bring the inflation rate down gradually at the same time Recognize that if you're going to continue to bring the inflation rate down, you can't have the unemployment rate at or below  -10-    7/2-3/91  the natural rate And these money growth rates fell out of that calculation We didn't say ""Let's do 5-1/2 percent forever and see what happens"" It was an accident of the relationship of nominal GNP and interest rates   Right "
1858,1991-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be much briefer this time [Statement--see Appendix]   As you know, Governor Angell, we explored such possibilities a little while ago, partly at your urging I think there is nothing actively underway now If the Committee wished, obviously, we could do something I think the key question the Committee would need to ask is whether you're going to have reserve targeting and have it tied in some way to M2; this would be a stretch, given the pattern of reserves, as Harvey Rosenblum pointed out [to me] yesterday, but you could do it We played in the past with ""shadow"" reserve targets but not tied to M2 The premise there would be that movements in M2 would provoke some reaction The Committee would have to have enough confidence in its reading of M2 that it would want money markets to be moved around by deviations of M2 of some size--the Committee could decide [what those should be]--from its projection The underlying confidence needed is in the relationship of money to the outcome   Well, I think your plan would limit the movements in the funds rate, depending on where the penalty discount rate was in terms of a ceiling and where something else was in terms of the floor But if you wanted a substantial band in there, then you would have to tolerate increased federal funds volatility within that band; that would go along with this So, it would help in some sense I don't think it would negate the need to make the fundamental decision about whether you wanted to tie federal funds rate movements even within a band to relatively short-run movements in M2 Now, if the Committee so desires, we can certainly work to see how we could do something along the lines of tying reserves to the funds rate and M2 But I think there are some decisions that need to be made by the Committee if we're going to go ahead with it   We will commit to bringing a memo to the FOMC by August, at least outlining the issues and the sorts of decisions that we think will need to be made I would invite the research directors around the edge of the room to supply me or my colleagues with any of the work that you have already done on this, please   I don't know; it would worry me And I would have to be honest with the Committee and say that the numbers handed to me this morning suggested weaker M2 than we built into the Bluebook for the latter part of June in terms of preliminary data This wouldn't necessarily affect the July growth rate, but we'd probably be marking June M2 down by close to a percentage point relative to the Bluebook, based on the data for the last two weeks As I tried to say in the briefing, one way of approaching it is to say Well, everything is going fine; the economy is recovering; all the incoming data on the business cycle etc, seem very consistent, and we assume they will continue that way over the next few months, consistent with the outlook of the staff or of the Committee for a recovering second half of the year I might also say that something odd is going on with peoples' portfolios, so just ignore it; it's a demand shift [unintelligible] missing money [unintelligible] I guess I would have trouble if it persisted, particularly through August, and growth was edging down toward the lower part of the range I would have trouble making a judgment to dismiss it out of hand If people are moving out of M2, they're finding other assets more attractive In the past when the Committee has eased or tightened, for example, the first effect on M2 is just a portfolio shift You raise or lower the rates on other kinds of instruments; people shift their M2 portfolios and later change their spending If we're seeing a situation in which interest  -46-    7/2-3/91  rates in bond markets, for example, are so high that they're attracting a flood of savings, it may be that those interest rates are so high that they're not going to support the kind of expansion [we envision] If we're seeing a situation in which depositories simply don't want the retail deposits or depositors are still so scared and uncertain about what is happening at depositories that they don't want to give [funds] to them, the re-channeling of that credit may not be entirely effortless So, I would hesitate to say that if it continued weak like this, I would definitely ease policy But it would certainly make me think hard about where we were going three, six months from now and whether we really did have a satisfactory policy in place It would be an extraordinary miss in the predictive power of M2, which isn't very great There's a wide band around our expectations but it seems to me that when you get to one or another edge of the band you're probably getting a signal that you shouldn't ignore it unless it is overwhelmed by other signals It would weigh on that side in my mind   It's in the non-M1 components I started talking about the revisions that I just got handed me this morning   Slightly, I think I can't remember exactly what it looked like yesterday But it's widespread Small time deposits, which had been consistently weakening, have continued to weaken; there are big minuses there But the interesting thing in this is that the MMDAs have weakened as well   Yes, in fact Ml, if anything, was revised slightly upward   Yes, particularly since the strength is in other checkable deposits We will be publishing a drop in M1 on Friday, but the preliminary data for the latest week suggest that that comes back, with a $2 billion increase on July 1   We have actual data on the bond and stock funds through May, which show very large increases We've talked to the managers of those funds and they say that it's not less for the stock but more for the bond funds and that those inflows have persisted in June So, I think there is some of that there  -47-    7/2-3/91 -48-   Well, I don't know I think that's an analytical issue Whenever M2 is weak, it can be weak for one of two reasons Income is weak or people are reallocating their portfolio I do think it's not giving us a signal that the economy was somehow collapsing in June Of that I'm quite confident But as to whether the portfolio reallocations can be entirely ignored, I'm less confident "
1916,1991-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting several members of the Committee requested that the staff look at alternative operating procedures The Committee seemed to be motivated by concerns about the announcement effects that we get for each change in policy these days, and in particular in the context of a possibility that at some point--perhaps later this year or next year--policy would have to be firmed to keep the Committee on track toward price stability The Committee was sent a memo by Dave Lindsey with an attachment by Al Broaddus and a cover by myself [See Appendix] I'll summarize the issues very, very briefly  In his memo, Mr Lindsey mentions two types of related, but potentially distinct, alterations in operating procedures One would involve somewhat looser targeting of the funds rate than the very narrow targeting around a single level that has become the practice in recent years, without necessarily any implications about how this target is arrived at Allowing some ambiguity for System intentions would tend to diffuse reactions to a change in policy partly because it would take some time for any such change to feed through into the market It would allow Peter to drain or add reserves more freely than at present, perhaps damping some of the end-of-maintenance-period volatility that we have now because [earlier in each maintenance period] he is constrained [in his operations] by the level of the federal funds rate It would allow demands for reserves to show through a bit more It might allow the Desk to ""test the waters"" with respect to a policy change, without necessarily committing to it On the other hand, ambiguity does have its disadvantages It does risk that the market would get the wrong idea from time to time, and that puts extra volatility in the funds rate It risks that there would be delays in having the market recognize changes that the Committee felt desirable And additional ambiguity risks additional calls--from Congress, for example--for us to be much more explicit about our operating targets  The second strand of change in operating procedures that Dave covered was a shift toward an operating procedure that was keyed at least semi-automatically to changes in reserves or monetary aggregates This would introduce a greater automatism, and the funds rate would then be seen as falling out of the shifting demands for money and reserves relative to the Fed's supply, much as in the 1979 to 1982 period We would be seen as targeting the funds rate much less The problem here is to identify something to which you want the funds rate tied automatically There were sufficient concerns expressed when we were using Ml; the Committee gave up on that because of the volatility and changes in M1 velocity That would seem to throw some doubt on reserves--nonborrowed or total reserves--because they're tied now exclusively, really, to Ml And even though M2 has become a more prominent target for the Committee, there is still a lot of doubt about the short- or even intermediate-term relationship of movements in M2 to movements in the variables the Committee cares about--nominal income or prices--in the short or intermediate term So, as you undoubtedly noticed, the staff didn't come up with any conclusions about where to shift to There seem to be pros and cons    8/20/91  on all of these alternatives I would ask whether Dave or Al has anything to add to my summary Dave indicates that he does not Al?   I agree with both Al and Dave I think what I'm hearing from the Committee is no sense of urgency for coming up with something new, partly because of the skepticism Dave expressed as to whether there really is something new out there that would solve our problems or appreciably [lessen] the difficulty we see with the current procedures What I was going to suggest, Mr Chairman, is that I consult with Al and other research directors around the room to see whether we could at least have some ongoing research on these issues The McCallum research on targeting the base, which keeps popping up in every conference I go to, for example, and some of these other things are areas in which the System ought to be doing work It doesn't mean that something has to be done by the next FOMC meeting We ought to be able to focus our resources in a way that at least answers some of the outstanding questions or approaches I think that would be the right thing for the central bank to be doing   Well, I would intend to coordinate with Al and other research directors   I didn't intend to make it just a Board staff project at all--as little as possible! [Laughter]   I don't have anything to add to what you said Obviously, we would try to be helpful and come up with suggestions for implementing whatever the Committee decided it wanted to do   Governor Angell, there is a sentence already in the directive If you look on the last page of the package with Governor Kelley's memo, there is a copy of the July meeting's directive The first sentence at the top of the page that precedes the discussion of the long-run ranges does, in effect, do that We could change the wording of that sentence   ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output"" It's page 2 of the directive   Now, we could play with that The issue is how the intermeeting directive fits into those already stated goals "
1917,1991-08-20," In that context, Mr Chairman, it's awfully difficult to talk about M2, but I thought I'd do it anyhow It's not perhaps at the top of everyone's mind right now [Statement--see Appendix]   Not since the July Bluebook   Since it's already down in the 2 percent area there is not--   Well, we tried to look at that in a sort of reduced form way through the various ranges of causality tests in the VAR models In the case of the more extended VAR model it had an effect but a fairly small one That is, once you took account of interest rates and stock prices and so forth, a 1 percent deviation of M2 took about 1/4 point off of real growth for the next year and a half or so So, there was an effect in that model, anyhow; it was fractional But even taking account of all those other financial variables, there was a significant relationship between M2 leading income   Why don't you just have a show of hands or something?   Because then people who dissent may have to write dissents!   More accurately, the Secretariat would have to write dissents for people   Well, make it 1 percent "
1968,1991-10-01, [Statement--see Appendix] 
1969,1991-10-01," Well, judgmentally   From here on out you mean?  -26-    10/1/91   Yes, about 3 percentage points higher   Yes, we have smaller errors in the fourth quarter than we had in the third, but the errors are still substantial--on the order of 3 percentage points In the third quarter we had an error in our model of 6-1/2 percentage points   Our projection is that whatever mysterious forces were causing that will abate, in part because people with MMDAs, savings deposits, or other deposits have had a chance to reallocate their portfolios "
2075,1991-12-17," And to our knowledge, they haven't tried to enlist the Fed in this effort--at least not yet "
2076,1991-12-17," [Statement--see Appendix]   I would interpret its signals as partly wrong and partly right in the following sense I don't think we're getting the extent of the damping in nominal income one would have expected from the kind of money growth we've had, especially with interest rates coming down That should have boosted money growth and it didn't Essentially, we have had unchanged velocity for the year but one would have expected a very sharp decline in velocity So, I think we've had some shift in the money demand function That means that not all the weakness shows through At the same time, the forces affecting money growth--the credit crunch type forces, to use the overarching phrase here--clearly also have been affecting income So, while not all the weakness in money growth has shown through to income, it has been a bit of a leading indicator, and I think that was true in 1990 as well as in 1991 in terms of weakness in income Now, we tended to discount it in 1990 because the war intervened; the weakness in money was followed by weakness in income but that was said to be because of the war Maybe looking back, the weakness in money should have been  -28-    12/17/91  telling us something about an underlying process in the financial system that was showing through to income I wouldn't put percentage point by percentage point M2 and income together; I don't think one could do that But I do think M2 has had some [leading] properties "
2134,1992-02-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   That's correct   I was hoping you had forgotten me!   Well, the standard model would have it something close to 6 percent with a 5 percent GDP; that's because it would still be getting some push from interest rates early in the year Our yield curve model, however, has been doing a bit better these past few years, although it has been missing; it would have [M2] growth more on the order of 4 percent So, I would tend to split the difference in the models and tell you something like 5 percent on M2 to get 5 percent GDP  -38-    2/4-5/92   Well, as I indicated in my briefing, I think 3-1/2 percent growth is our best shot   But if there were a risk to this, I think it might be that we could get a little more M2 growth or something like the FOMC [members' forecasts of] GDP, which is higher than the Greenbook GDP And it would be because of the fact, as Governor Mullins mentioned, that [the effects of] some of the initial shifts in the yield curve may be wearing out and so forth I guess to some extent we're perhaps a little gun-shy on this because those are arguments we've been using for the last six months about why banks in response would have higher--   It's true that velocity was unchanged in 1991 But it took an incredible decline in short-term interest rates to keep it unchanged And all our past relationships in models and charts and whatnot would suggest that that would give you a huge decline in velocity--a lot of M for a little bit of GDP--and we didn't get that Now, some of that may unwind a bit this year, but our best guess is that the credit for the expansion in the staff forecast, which I think is an entirely credible one, would basically come from outside depository institutions Most of it is going to come through the capital markets So, I don't see loan demand picking up at banks or thrifts; they're still on the securitization route Certainly, marginal banks and thrifts under the new banking law are under tremendous pressure--even more pressure than they were before--to downsize to get their capital up So, I don't see those credit conditions deteriorating; I also don't see them snapping back a lot And I think there are still a lot of portfolio shifts coming that we haven't seen yet A lot of small time deposits [that depository institutions] put on a couple of years ago are just maturing   Right   That largely reflects some remaining--questionable in Jerry's terms--interest rate elasticity That is, nominal interest rates are coming down so that you'd have to get a little extra [money growth] If you believe the P* model and the assumption of a constant P* and the economy is growing at 2-1/4 percent--our current estimate of what the capacity of the economy is--presumably M2 over a long period of time would have to grow something on that order as well   That would give you more like 3 or 3-1/4 percent, if you thought 1 percent measured inflation were equivalent to price stability   Yes, I think you're right about the price level and the measurement problems So, I would say a range of about 1 to 5 percent would probably do it for you We used to worry about what would happen as we approached price stability and nominal interest rates fell and we'd have this surge into M2 [assets] so that in order to keep the economy from plummeting at that point we'd have to pump in some more liquidity to meet that demand But we've had our decline in nominal interest rates without a surge in M2, so perhaps this reentry problem isn't so bad unless long-term rates come down and we end up with 4 or 5 percent long-term rates with this thing Then, all of a sudden those bond funds won't look so attractive relative to a 2 percent OCD or NOW account rate and we could get a surge of funds back into M2 So, there might be complications as we approach price stability, but I think your sense of around 3 percent in a steady state is probably [right]   There have been studies I heard Bob Gordon give a paper at the Tokyo Conference--Dick Syron and Ed Boehne were there-- and his view was that something between 3/4 and 1-1/4 percent, given his sense of distortions, was about right  -42-    2/4-5/92   We have a letter from Chairman Neil on that issue and I'm sure you'll be asked to address it at your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony "
2135,1992-02-04," In terms of intermediation and [unintelligible] depositories, which is part of what I thought you were getting at, we have this securitization process for mortgages, which has been underway for a while but has certainly gotten going on consumer debts    2/4-5/92  So, the relative contribution of depository institutions to the whole credit flow has been depressed by their own choice through this securitization process Other intermediaries are taking it "
2136,1992-02-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I thought as Norm was reading that the ""slightly"" did tend to capture the sense that it wasn't an unusually strong--   It did capture the sense And perhaps if in your judgment, Mr Chairman, more than one move became necessary over the intermeeting period, which is a long intermeeting period, I believe a consultation with the rest of the Committee would be appropriate "
2197,1992-03-31," This first arose when Continental borrowed billions and billions of dollars in a very short period of time and we had to offset the reserve effects of that I think there was a concern that at a time of financial crisis there is definitely a flight toward Treasury bills and that would be a market that we could easily sell into But we weren't sure what would be happening in the coupon market And selling into a market that might already be--   --treacherous or tender would not be a good idea   That refunding action itself has no effect on the maturity of the debt held by the public because our allotment is just an ""add on"" to Treasury auctions "
2198,1992-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix  Finally, Mr Chairman let me briefly update the Committee on the money supply data received this morning It's very weak, much weaker than we expected and than we built into the Bluebook path For the week we're about to publish--and these data ought to be reasonably [firm] by now--we're looking at about a $4-1/2 billion decline in Ml, a $10 billion decline in M2, and a $12 or $13 billion decline in M3 The downward revisions were mostly in demand deposits but in many other categories as well The very preliminary data for the week of March 30th show no snapback from that In fact, they show further declines Now, these are based on only 3 days of information, so they can revise; but they do show further declines, with M2 approaching the lower end of its range if they were to come out that way Thank you   Don't blame the messenger, please!   Mr Chairman, on President Stern's point, he is correct that even with these very weak numbers, we would have growth for December to March of around 3-1/2 percent, which is what we expected before But the other part of that is that we would be coming out of March in a week that is billions and billions of dollars below the monthly average; ie, the monthly average weakness is coming in this next number   It's right around 25 percent   Mr Chairman, one further point I'm quite sure that if our staff sat down and had to do money projections right now, they'd probably come out lower than the 3-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent [shown for] M2 and M3 with constant interest rates At the same time, if the Committee were to write those lower, say at 3 and 1 percent, that would in effect be allowing and accepting a bit of the undershoot that is coming, and the Committee may not want to do that That is, you might want to stick with the 3-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent, which is still slipping below the midpoint But I thought it wise to warn you   That's right   So, you would stick with the 3-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent? "
2255,1992-05-19," Well, I think that's right There are several Reserve Banks, including your own in particular, that have used other opportunity costs that took into account the intermediate- and longer- term time deposit rates And that does a little better Although it doesn't pick up all the unexplained shortfall in money, it does help to explain it to some extent Now, it has always been the case that the division between money and investment assets--particularly for money after deregulation and after Reg Q was taken off NOW accounts-- is very hard to see It's hard to draw a bright line between something you would call money and something you would call investment assets Other checkable deposits, NOW accounts, have elements of investment assets; people hold them because of rate expectations So, that has always been a somewhat fuzzy picture I agree that our measurement of opportunity costs probably could be improved I think one issue here is what that is telling us when banks aren't competing for these intermediate- and longer-term CDs It's telling us in part that they don't see loan demand; they don't intend to make a lot of loans out in the future Then we have to go back and ask whether that means something whether it is just a relatively benign redirection of credit flows or whether it is saying something about the intermediation process that could feed back on aggregate demand So,    5/19/92  I agree with your point on opportunity costs; but once you cut below that point, it still leaves a lot of ambiguity about the meaning of the slowdown in money   Governor Angell, I had some work done, drawing it with the two-quarter lag that people like to use and assuming that the Greenbook is close to right for GDP That also shows some pretty sizable increases in velocity in the first half of the year, unlike last year when velocity was a bit flatter So, after a while, as I'm about to say in my briefing, I think there is some reason to believe that the weakness in M2 we see this year is not sending us the same kind of signal, whether it's coincidence or not, that it seemed to be sending last year But there is a question of confidence here The    5/19/92  weakness is extreme and even if the signal-to-noise ratio is very, very low-- "
2256,1992-05-19," [Statement--see Appendix]   President Forrestal, if you look at paragraph 15 in the Bluebook, it gives a sense of where the aggregates might come out for the year--1/2 point more or less than for Alternative B with the selection of ""A"" or ""C"" We have been going for many, many years with this [procedure], but I agree with you The reason that paragraph 15 is in the Bluebook is that the effect of anything done in the middle of May probably would be greater in July and August than it would be in May and June, so you do need to be thinking about that   Well, I think the issue would be how it feeds in Perhaps it's an issue that really should be discussed in July because it's a question of having annual ranges and where the aggregates are [currently] relative to those ranges or whether you care where they are relative to the ranges If you were to drop the--   Sure   Certainly  -34-    5/19/92   We do actually do that as an internal matter from time to time   Well, on the taxes, I certainly expected the sort of snapback we saw [Our analysis suggested that] those checks would be clearing in late April and the first half of May--   --and that's when one would expect to see a snapback [in money growth] So, the fact that we had a $9 billion increase, or whatever it was, in M2 last week and that we have another increase in the $4 to $5 billion range coming for the week of May 11th is not surprising And it's heavily in the M1 component, which is where the transactions money is, where you'd expect most though not all of the tax payments to be made So, I'd expect the tax [effect] to play out pretty much by the second half of May The other [factors] I think are much harder to explain The [effect of] RTC activity is a bit contrary to common sense We have always found, though, that there were some lags in that That is, RTC activity one and two months ago was having an effect on M2 growth this month Now, I think that's partly because it does take a while peoples' depository relationships are disrupted; they get notices that their rates are reduced or a new bank has taken over and it takes them a while to react to that and to reconsider their portfolios So, perhaps it's not that contrary to common sense, but there is a little  -35-    5/19/92  lag there So, given the lack of RTC activity after about the second week of April or so, we probably will begin to feel that more in June and moving into the third quarter And on the other one, the interest rate [effects], the lags are of course even longer so that they can play out over a longer period of time We have by the way, President Forrestal, about 3-3/4 percent growth on a quarterly average basis projected under ""B"" for the third quarter and then 4-1/2 percent for the fourth quarter So, we would have a strengthening in the third quarter, presumably   I'm sure I would have been projecting several percentage points more than we had, but at the same time we did embody in the projections to the Committee last year and in February of this year an expectation of downward shifts in money demand So, I don't think we would have been as far off as you might imagine just from feeding that [funds rate decline] through because we were aware at the time that things were out of kilter relative to the standard models We allowed for that; last February we were predicting only 3-1/2 or 4 percent [M2] growth for 1992 So, we had allowed all along for some slippage there But I'm sure we would have been predicting probably about 2 percentage points more--maybe instead of 3-1/2 percent more like 5-1/2 percent for 1992--if you had told me in July that we were going to have 2 percentage points lower interest rates   Well, there used to be, but I don't have much confidence in that right now given that we've had a string of about eight shortfalls in a row counting the second quarter of this year A couple of years ago I would have said that I'd expect some offsetting errors and come out about right But I don't expect that now We are not projecting an offsetting error in our projections of 3-1/2 percent for 1992 and 4 percent for 1993 for M2 growth consistent with the Greenbook GNP; we do not have offsetting errors built in We have continued increases in velocity We do have a fading out of some of the shift that's occurring; instead of continued downward shifts we have it fading out gradually   Right  -36-    5/19/92   Right   Well, no, in the sense that in 1982 one could identify a specific deregulation event We knew the MMDAs were coming We actually surveyed people to find out what they were shifting into NOW accounts and whatnot In one sense you're right If the shifting stopped and it was just a level adjustment, that would be fine I'd have more confidence in that if I saw the shifting stop But in an underlying economic sense, I think a very different kind of thing is going on One can't identify it so strongly with an external deregulation or technology change as we had with Ml in the mid-1970s It's something much deeper in the intermediation process and I think harder to analyze   I think it's about 1963 to 1986 Is that right, Dave?   It's the same model, however, that we used in the conference we had in 1987 on money demand   Well, I think it's a smaller issue than expected in increases in real interest rates because of where we've driven short-term real rates and perhaps inflation as well I tend to discount it to a certain extent On the supply, one thinks of not only government but even more particularly corporations and households shifting way out on the yield curve On the other hand, we have had the households supplying the funds in some sense through shifts into bonds and mutual funds It probably had some effect but a small one relative to the other [factors], in my judgment   Well, in terms of our models we actually have the demand shift pretty well dying out by next year We do have an increase in velocity next year on the order of 1 percent We would view that partly as still a working down of some things like savings accounts and NOW accounts, in our models anyhow And I think that will probably be true in real life as well Rates on some of these types of accounts, like NOW accounts and savings accounts, will continue to drop very slowly over an extended period of time in response to the lower rates So, we will have an increase in velocity next year but not really a money demand shift   No, that [effect] sort of dies out The way the yield curve plays out in our model is that it is affecting [M2 growth] this year and is rather neutral for 1993 It's not affecting it much one way or another   Well, assuming that the CD rates then come into closer alignment with market rates and market rates level out, then I'd expect some reflows into M2   Only a little, I think We implicitly had a sense that banks would not be actively pursuing deposits in order to make loans in part because the cost of making loans is going to be higher We have not specifically factored in the risk-based premium We had, I believe, a notion that premiums would be higher; whether they would be risk-based or not is another issue That may be more an issue of distribution of loans throughout the banking system rather than the total   The Secretary's view is that ""might"" captures that thought better than ""would""   Mr Chairman, there is active staff work not only here but at the Reserve Banks looking at different measures, and it will be a topic on the agenda at the Financial Analysis Committee meeting in St Louis in June; there is at least one paper on that   I would write in there 2-1/2 and 1-1/2 percent; I don't like writing 1/4 percent on growth targets "
2312,1992-06-30," I'm not sure about that because the amount of reserves is very small I agree with Joan's earlier implicit assessment that if the Committee does not ease at this meeting, particularly if the employment data were on the soft side, short-term rates would back up a little The market has built in a Fed reaction to the incoming data I think that's equivalent to what you're saying   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, basically we assumed that the forces acting to raise velocity in the first half of the year would persist over the second half of the year So, for example, relative to our standard money demand model, which has been missing for two years now, we assumed further shifts Looking out to '93, and if we were to look out further than that, I think we might assume that the additional shifts would taper off; but we would not be tempted to assume that the level of velocity would tend to come back to what it was before That is, if you interpret this as basically a shrinking of the depository system for one reason or another, as I think the memo to the Committee noted, some of that shrinkage might be a temporary reaction to the problems of the past But I think a lot of it must be permanent The safety nets are being priced differently and people view depositories differently So one wouldn't expect the level of velocity to come back, say, to the old P* [assumption] but--   I think it is a different structure Clearly, one could imagine without too much trouble that at some point in here growth rates will come back into alignment and that the growth of the monetary aggregates and the growth of nominal spending will move together again in a relatively predictable way But I rather doubt that the level would adjust back, and there's a lot of uncertainty about growth rates in the interim   I would want to be clear though, President Black, that we have made our forecast based on the Greenbook projection for nominal income So, if that projection is anything like what the Committee wants it to be, then we would say that the monetary growth you ought to want is something in the neighborhood of our projection, with this huge margin of uncertainty around all those things   Well, we've set our [M2] projection, we hope, with the risk balanced on both sides Now, as Bob Parry remarked, we did lower it quite a bit this time relative to where we were last time; in the February Bluebook I think we had 3-1/2 percent [M2 growth], or roughly the same as nominal GDP So, we've gone from 3-1/2 to 2 percent in stages Quite frankly, my thinking was influenced a lot by the expectation of a bounceback by May and June; we didn't get it In fact, we are getting quite a bit of weakness and that has caused me to reevaluate this relationship, assuming that the economy has expanded as we expected over those months So, we made this downward revision I think we have it centered more or less in this wide sort of very flat probability fan there I couldn't say that there's no probability that we would have higher velocity; of course, we could have larger velocity increases At the same time, one issue here is how the Committee wants to treat the possibility of even lower M2 growth, ie, how worried it should get about M2 or even M1 and whether to put a little weight on that While I would put the probabilities of a greater velocity increase as obviously not zero, the Committee needs to consider how closely it wants to examine its federal funds rate target if money comes in weaker because it might be telling us something as well   Oh, I see So, the fact that the range wasn't reduced even further to center it around 2 percent is what you're reacting to?   No As I tried to indicate here, I would say that I tend to use them a little both ways In some sense, in terms of the current situation, we have other information coming in about hours worked and retail sales and this, that, and the other thing So, the lead [time] of money [supply data] over that information, although it's subject to revision, isn't that great It might give us a little sense that things were developing somewhat differently than expected but we have a lot of other information coming in So, I give it some weight that way But the other issue is whether there are some forward-looking properties to it; and I think in the past there have been, although they have been rather loose I think money encapsulates both our actions and the demands coming from the market, and one can see influences on them before one sees the influences in the economy So, in terms of this leading indicator property, I'd differentiate money from, say, the way we treated it from 1979 to 1982 when M1 was the direct target of the Committee and we moved the federal funds rate around very vigorously in a semi-automatic way in reaction to deviations in money growth from the path Clearly, since the fall of 1982 it has been more of an information-indicator type variable   Just on 1992, assuming the Committee votes to retain the 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent range, the staff had put in a sentence, shown at the bottom of page 21 and the top of page 22 of the Bluebook, that the Committee might want to consider if it wanted to say that velocity increases might persist and that it recognized that [money] growth could be low As I read this in the full light of the FOMC meeting, my recommendation is that, given the uncertainty, I wouldn't use the second half of this sentence saying that M2 and M3 could come in around the lower end of the ranges; we just really don't know So, I think there are really two alternatives One is to say ""In evaluating the aggregates, the Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist in the second half of the year"" or something like that so at least you convey some sense that something unusual is going on While you were talking I was writing something else similar to that ""In evaluating the growth of the aggregates relative to the ranges, the Committee recognized the unusual behavior of velocity apparently in train this year"" or something along those lines So, I would recommend against the second half of the suggested sentence But the Committee might want to say something like the first half of the sentence in the directive Obviously, this will be said in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, so it's not as if we wouldn't be communicating with the public But you could say something in the directive about anticipating unusual velocity behavior this year   Right   Sure It's just a question of completeness of the record   It's not important  -58-    6/30-7/1/92   Just the first half of the sentence Okay, so it would say ""The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist in the second half of the year""   We do The last sentence says ""The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets""   The sentence refers to velocity ""increases,"" so I don't know whether the Committee wants to make that statement about next year particularly [unintelligible] ranges I think it recognizes the fact that growth is coming in at under 2 percent, Q4 to June   ""Plans and objectives"" "
2313,1992-06-30," A number of members yesterday gave the reasons I'd already written down for why the Committee might want to choose one of the other courses for the intermeeting period and I won't repeat them I do have a few background points, though, to bring to the attention of the Committee as you make your decision on short-run policy First, I can bring you up to date on the monetary aggregates; we do have some new information this morning and it suggests a further weakening in money growth and credit The revisions are exclusively in the Ml category [Statement--see Appendix]  -61-    6/30-7/1/92   Well, Governor Angell, I don't have that answer for the new Ml, incorporating the latest revisions I guess I'd subtract about 1/4 or 1/3 of a percentage point; growth from Q4 to June before was 12-1/4 percent so my guess would be 12 percent or a little under that   Yes   Well, it was 6 percent and now it would be 5 percent approximately   For the week to be published Ml would be about flat and M2 and M3 would decline by about $3-1/2 billion and $9 billion respectively I hasten to add that these are very preliminary data subject to substantial revisions   I think it's highly likely The banks didn't respond last time; I think another cut would put pressure on them I suppose they might try to resist, especially if there weren't a discount rate cut at the same time It would be a nice test of whether there is any aggressiveness out there in seeking loans   No   Mike has a guess   We were looking particularly for about 1-1/2 percent in May and 3-1/2 percent in June, which we didn't get   Not for the second quarter, or at least if we did, I'm not aware of it Dave Lindsey, are you aware of anything? I didn't ask anyone for it   I wouldn't know exactly what the ceteris paribus is there, but I think probably not That is, the interest elasticities in those models, while still of the appropriate sign, assume that long rates react a little with short rates since there's a lot of yield curve [unintelligible] [If] long rates go the wrong way or don't move at all, then the interest elasticities go essentially to zero or even turn around But assuming long rates came out as they did over the second quarter, it would have taken a very large reduction in short-term interest rates--I don't know the number--to have gotten M2 growth into the 2 to 3 percent area over the quarter  -63-    6/30-7/1/92   I think dropping the zero maturity yields isn't going to help M2 growth In fact, that's basically the story we're telling for the rise in velocity in the second half of this year and into next year That those zero maturity yields along with the effects of the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) will be dropping offering rates And while some of that will just keep money [in] time deposits to some extent, people with savings-type money in NOW accounts will be looking elsewhere to put that money outside of M2 So, I don't think dropping those rates will help   Right, and the federal funds rate would be under tremendous downward pressure   Right And so as long as the Committee sets the federal funds rate with an instruction to Ms Lovett to hit it, the reserves could contract under that situation If the Committee were to choose to target a reserve level and that happened, then I think the federal funds rate would drop very substantially in the short run   That depends on how one measures policy   Well, let's see Do you want a whole number?   We gave you our best guess, ie, 2 percent   Right   It's certainly the case that this problem will be addressed extensively in the policy record as well as the [directive]; it's in the paragraph on the long-run ranges The draft sentence was a response to a request made at the last meeting   The sentence feeds back into the previous sentence or the two sentences before It says that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives you will be looking at monetary developments So, we've already sort of said that and this kind of--   I don't think it's the conditions that are uncertain   No, no   Well, part of the idea behind putting this sentence in was to give a sense of flexibility--that you wouldn't have to react to this Without such a sentence here the directive doesn't relate at all to the long-run ranges, which may be fine "
2377,1992-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll attempt to summarize my presentation in an effort to cut it down at least by a few minutes That may make it slightly more incoherent than usual! [For Mr Kohn's full statement, see Appendix]   Well, I tried last time and I got beaten up! The reason alternatives C and D are in the Bluebook is because of the issue that arose last time about writing down a monetary growth number  -35-    8/18/92  --particularly now that it would go through the end of the year--that was inconsistent with the range you just gave to the Congress However, I went back and looked at the report and the testimony and I do believe that they are sufficiently ambiguous as to leave open the possibility that monetary growth would drop below the range And that would be judged on the basis of incoming information about how velocity was behaving So, I think a sentence along the lines of either ""C"" or ""D"" would line up with the report and testimony and the decision of the Committee at the last meeting that it didn't know enough, really, to change the existing growth rate [objective] for the year So, I think you could do either ""C"" or ""D""   That's a very difficult choice Clearly, we have major questions about both of those They go together; I can't separate those two questions; I can't answer one or the other The way we do the forecast is to take the path for [nominal] income in the Greenbook and the path for interest rates implied in the Greenbook and ask what money growth would come out That's how alternative B is put together It's all part of the same process I don't see it as two different questions   Well, the other question is If the Committee said to Peter Sternlight that it wanted 2 percent M2 growth, give or take a percentage point, and didn't care what interest rates and income went with that, I believe Mr Sternlight could achieve that over a period of six months or so Now, we might get some very wild interest rate [movements] in the process and perhaps as a result wild [variations in] income growth; but if that's all the Committee cared about, I feel some confidence that within a tolerable range and over a sufficiently long period we could achieve the M2 growth that the Committee asked us to achieve   Yes   Yes, I think so   In support of that, we can certainly take many more words in the Policy Record itself to explain how the Committee decided to do what it did We're not confined to [the wording in the directive] So, the record would accommodate this relationship   The Policy Record would explain that the Committee recognized that this put [M2] on a trajectory where it might fall short but took into account a number of different things in choosing this without having to specify exactly--   Well, you have the direction right; it's a question of what the size is, and in particular our models operate with some lag So, a lot of this would be feeding through into the fourth quarter It gives us more confidence Yesterday, Governor Angell was challenging me on why I had any more growth under alternative A than I did under alternative B, given our recent experience I think the decline in intermediate-term rates gives us a little more confidence that we'll get the 2 percent [M2 growth] or a little more in the fourth quarter under ""B"" and that we'll get some more under ""A"" So, I think it's the kind of thing that builds confidence We had a shortfall in July--more than we expected--and we carried that shortfall forward but slanted up growth from here on out, partly based on the decline of intermediate-term rates   I think if we lowered them in October we'd have to raise them in February I would doubt very seriously that we'd have room to get to the next seasonal low point even after the actions we have taken We could take at look at that this fall, but I'd be skeptical at this point   Right The key is to have a stable and predictable demand for central bank liabilities, whether it's the reserves or clearing balances, off which Peter can operate in his open market operations   Taking account of today's data, 2 and 1/2 percent "
2424,1992-10-06," Then we'll have to tighten later   I take that back I think we've had something of a contradiction in this whole episode of an upward sloped yield curve which suggests that at some point--[unintelligible] through liquidity premiums or whatnot--rates would have to come back up again and [given the] immediate expectations of consumers or constant disappointment with how the economy is turning out, the Fed will ease So, I don't think there is anything new If anything has happened over the last three or four months, it's that the middle part of the yield curve-- the one, two, and three-year part--has really come down quite a bit, particularly after the June employment report So, a sense of when the rates would have to go up has been pushed out [in time] "
2425,1992-10-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman I saw him nod; some of us are very attuned to those nods [Statement--see Appendix] "
2480,1992-11-17," Edify you? [Statement--see Appendix]   So, all you're doing basically is speeding up the announcement process by two or three hours Right now it comes out at 1130 am the next day, and you want to do it at 900 am  -57-    11/17/92   Speculation in the market and things like that "
2481,1992-11-17," I couldn't hear what Governor Lindsey said   We're going to start with the long run, then?   I actually have two briefings here on this One possibility, Mr Chairman--if the Committee has the patience, since it will take about 15, 16, 17 minutes combined--is that I could read them both   Okay, hang on Here we go [Laughter] Everyone has had coffee, so we may be able to make it through! I'll start with the long-run ranges [Statements--see Appendix]   Yes   The particular wording in the testimony was ""no later than next February""   And Chairman Greenspan sent the Feinman-Porter study to the Committee chairman   Yes, we have I think it was indicated in a footnote in the cover memo, although I guess that was for the last Greenbook Under the current Greenbook assumptions of nominal GDP and short- and long-term interest rates, depending on whether we use the narrow or the broad model, we get about 2-1/4 percent M2 growth for 1993; [it's] 2-3/4 percent M2 growth under all the Greenbook assumptions using the Feinman-Porter model   I'd say an average of 1/2 point But one reason we [projected M2 growth] below that was because that model does not take into account some things coming into play like the FDICIA  -29-    11/17/92  [provisions] and the RTC and whatnot So we put in a slightly [larger] velocity increase for 1993   Well, we have, Mr Chairman, assuming you signed the letters last week   The study has gone up to the Hill   There is another opportunity We have a letter in the house from Mr Gonzalez   And we could use that as a vehicle He asks why we let M2 growth fall below the range Assuming we get to 4-1/2 percent GDP growth this year, I think the question--   We could use that as an opportunity   If you're postponing your decision on that second [vote]-- "
2540,1992-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   You can interpret some of what the Committee does to a certain extent that way I think it's a difficult question The Committee does not have a nominal GDP target that it announces It's difficult partly for political reasons The Committee has no authority to announce a nominal GDP target; and to the extent that it  -24    12/22/92  would imply something about real output and unemployment rates, that could get you into some hot water [depending on] how people interpret it A nominal GDP target has a lot of attractive aspects, I think You have to think about how to react to unexpected developments or shocks It implies equal reaction to shortfalls in inflation and output, and you might not want to do that; it might be very dependent on where you are in the business cycle But there are a number of caveats, if you think about it And even a nominal GDP target is implicitly still a forecasting exercise It really involves trying to figure out where the economy is going to be any number of quarters ahead of time So, I don't think that gets around the problems you and President Melzer raised earlier about having to rely inevitably to a certain extent on your forecast of the economy I don't think there's any way around that   Well, I think that's the same thing I was trying to say before about how the Committee reacts If you do tighten because real growth is much higher next year, I think it would be because your projection was that this was moving the economy closer to potential and there would be a danger of short-circuiting the downward trend of inflation or even accelerating inflation the following year So, it wouldn't be explainable necessarily just on the nominal GDP terms; it would be looking forward regarding what that implies about inflation   Well, I don't see anything in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act that would preclude us from announcing whatever target we wanted to as long as we still have money and credit targets   Sure   But in the case of a supply shock, a lot of people have advocated nominal GDP targeting We discussed this actually in August of 1990 in the face of supply shocks It is supportive, as Governor Angell said, because it has some of these automatic stabilizer-type properties that Mike was talking about; you can't overshoot too badly on one side or another and you bring about corrective actions, particularly when you're unsure with prices going one way and quantities going the other way  -26-    12/22/92 "
2599,1993-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the Bluebook in the course of my remarks [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, first of all I'd like to say that I think our forecast of 2 percent M2 growth in 1993, given the Greenbook forecast, is balanced I wouldn't want to leave the impression that I think all the risk is that M2 will come in higher and velocity will be lower I think I'd go about making the case for higher M2 by saying that as the economy gets going, bank lending should pick up some and banks should be a little more aggressive in seeking deposits The case might also be made by saying that we've had a lot of portfolio adjustments so far Time deposits have been running off for a while and the sticker shock aspect of seeing new low rates on time deposits should be wearing off, so perhaps an awful lot of that adjustment may be behind us and only a little more ahead of us Also, banks have been rather prompt to reduce deposit offering rates and maybe those rates won't be coming down quite so much in 1993 as one ordinarily would think since they've done a lot of that ahead of time But for every argument I just made I could make a counterargument   One of the counterarguments might be to look at the first quarter We are getting very, very weak money growth; the economy looks okay And, if anything, we're going to get our projections of 7 percent plus velocity increases in the first quarter   No, I don't find it incredible I think what happened in putting the simulations together is partly driven by that model We've speeded up the changes in long-term interest rates I think I noted here two changes in short-term rates So, a given change in short-term rates has a bigger effect because it's almost forward-looking You could argue that perhaps that's not a terrible idea although the model hasn't done too badly with this backward- looking yield curve so far So, the baseline has the declines in long-term rates that Mike noted and actually extends that out And then the easier policy has even sharper declines So, if that would add some bigger changes in the funds rate, that has the same real--   We haven't projected the growth in stock and bond funds I think a memo was circulated to you yesterday about last year, and my rough guess would be that those would taper off a little over time Part of what's going on here--look at the baseline picking up over the time period--is that the yield curve is flattening and some of the yield curve effects, of which the bond and stock funds are a symptom, are ebbing over time So, I would say we'd probably add a couple percentage points in '93, maybe a few less in '94, and then see it ebbing over time as the yield curve flattens and as the portfolio adjustments have already been made   I think so Was it, Norm?   Well, when we've been trying to work on this issue of an alternative monetary aggregate--adding back the bond and stock mutual funds--one of the problems is defining the opportunity costs when we have bond and stock funds in there because we've got interest rates all up and down the maturity spectrum It's really the opportunity cost relative to spending, I guess It's not clear what the alternative asset is as one makes the monetary asset definition wider and wider So, one of the problems in working with this is defining a demand function that has prices in it Obviously, it's related to income and spending or wealth perhaps--   The old opportunity cost isn't operative    2/2-3/93   In the back of the Porter/Feinman study, you'll remember, there is a section about these alternative monetary aggregates They found, looking at things like the variability of velocity and whatnot, that the velocities of the [money] stock with the stock and bond funds were slightly more variable than M2 and didn't do as well over time in these Granger causality tests with income But the world is changing over time--   My memory is that that has been developing over time There was some capability even back in the late '70s but it has spread to more and more--   Well, there are a couple of things going on here One is that there are lags, and it's hard to line things up year-by- year The other is that velocity is being driven a lot by the long- term rates and the spread The Porter/Feinman M2 is pretty darn insensitive to short-term interest rates So, in effect, if you had a weaker economy--I'd have to hear the rest of the story, say, in the Corrigan scenario--and short-term interest rates were lower, I'd expect somewhat more M2, somewhat less nominal GDP Maybe you'd have two offsetting effects on M2; it's hard for me to sort them out   Right   You could get a perverse effect on M2, as I think President McTeer was alluding to yesterday   In general, I'd expect that the decline in short- term rates would mean we'd have smaller increases in M2 velocity Now, that's what happened in 1992; if short-term rates hadn't been declining, velocity would have been even larger So, if we did have this perverse effect--if we had short-term rates declining and long- term rates going up--then the yield curve effect would outweigh the short-term effect and we could get a smaller M2 It's not clear what's being held constant here, but for the same number--   I think the more general point, and one that Chairman Greenspan has made when challenged on this issue, is that in a sense we were working through this period with market expectations, as we discussed yesterday, that had inflation turning around, especially if you think about the [time around the] middle of the oil crisis The Federal Reserve had to be fairly cautious or had to take account of market expectations when making its policy moves [It had to consider] consequences I think more serious than just what would happen to M2 growth, but what would happen to long-term rates, market expectations, and the balance sheet/portfolio restructuring process if inflationary expectations had gone the wrong way   I agree with what you just said   Right If, contrary to our expectations-- contrasting the System's expectations with the market's--long-term rates were to go up, then we might have some people surprised by that We had some evidence of that in 1992 as far as the [unintelligible] This is a bit in response to Chairman Greenspan about what the opportunity costs are Are realized capital gains to be included in the returns and all that sort of thing? It's a little hard to see exactly, but one can make a case I think that those flows slowed down for a little while, particularly when the stock market and bond prices went down on a few occasions I think if there were a major turnaround in the market, the initial reaction of investors would be, of course, ""I've got capital losses; these things aren't as safe and as liquid in some sense of certainty about return as I thought they were"" Now, the end result would be a steeper yield curve So, I think the initial reaction might be [a move] out of stock and bond funds, assuming both the stock and bond markets were going down at the same time, for a while and perhaps a little less enthusiasm over time But I would have a steeper yield curve in the end, so that would be working perhaps over the longer period of time a little against M2 But I agree with your analysis If we had a major break in stock and bond markets, I think that would make people think twice about where they were putting their time deposits   No, we didn't I think actually, President Broaddus, in the past we've done what we did this time, which was to use the same model but note in the write-up of the tighter policy scenario that if there were credibility effects things would be better; we'd have lower sacrifice ratios and a faster return to price stability I don't think we've ever done a simulation Now, we have done the P* simulation, but given these projections for M2 and the implied shifts in V*, the P* model, which is on the last page of the Financial Indicators tables, shows deflation in 1994 We thought there would be some internal dynamics For instance, if that's what was happening, M2 growth would be faster if we weren't getting the shifts somewhere showing this   Well, Mike may want to comment on this, but I think we take account, as he did yesterday in his Chart Show, of an increased trend in productivity in calculating the potential that's implied here Also, as noted in the write-up, there's a sense that perhaps the NAIRU right now might be restructuring itself; raising the growth rate of potential might also raise the NAIRU since there are a lot of people between jobs who need to find jobs The matching of the jobs and the people, which is one of the things determining the NAIRU, might be particularly difficult right now--especially with the downsizing in the defense industry and in other areas as well We could see more frictions in the job market We've actually assumed here for the purpose of these simulations that the NAIRU is 6 percent for a couple of years before dropping back to the 5-3/4 percent that we think it was over the last few years   It might take a higher real wage to get them to move from southern California   Well, obviously, there's a wide spread around this [forecast] As I noted, I think the spread is evenly distributed  -37-    2/2-3/93  around it I can think of reasons why [velocity] might be even faster So, it's not a tight relationship, particularly given that as last year went on, there was [considerable] evidence that the credit flows continued to bypass the banking system The banks are faced with restraints on growth or at least incentives to keep very high capital ratios or face increasing costs of regulatory deposit insurance That would cause them not to bid so aggressively for deposits Businesses and households are both borrowing in long-term markets They're not seeking bank credit or thrift credit particularly, and that's being accommodated as they leave the banking system and go into the bond and stock markets through the mutual funds I think this process will continue, and I'm fairly confident that under the Greenbook projections for nominal GDP and relatively flat interest rates, even without necessarily the decline in the long- term rates, that we will have a reasonably substantial increase in velocity this year--whether it'll be 3-1/2 percent or something else I find it much easier to predict an increase in velocity than flat velocity There's enough evidence that this readjustment/ restructuring process is continuing   And the thrift industry   That's at an annual rate!   I think in the past Mr Chairman, both you and Chairman Volcker have answered whether there were any dissents without necessarily naming names In this case it won't matter   Right   Well, that sort of indirect language is there to give a sense of the uncertainty about it The fact that it suggests that the Committee expects it but does so in this indirect language I think gives it the sense of maybe yes or maybe no   ""The Committee anticipates developments contributing to unusual velocity increases would persist during""   ""Are likely to,"" yes  SPEAKER(?) I like that   I think the idea was, Governor Mullins, that we would like to know whether the Committee agrees with the conclusions on ""A"" through ""D"" and then whether the Committee thinks that ""E"" should be explored further And then we would do that extra-- "
2600,1993-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman I don't see a lot of short-term policy issues in front of the Committee today, so I will be brief I also heard Committee members say that they were militantly ignoring M2 I also note that it's crossed out of the table, but if we could devote about 2 minutes to that-- [Statement--see Appendix]   Mr Chairman, what do you want to do about the language?   In the Bluebook we had a small plus for M2 and a small minus for M3 My guess is that the small plus for M2 has turned into about zero after the revisions today That is, we had a +4 percent for M2 over the two months and a -7 percent for M3 Now, I guess it probably would be about zero for M2 and -8 percent or something like that for M3 "
2775,1993-07-06," We, of course, have no legal authority to force the mutual funds to report to us It's not like the deposit data used to calculate reserve requirements We have worked with the ICI in setting up their weekly data series--they consulted with us last summer about that--and on the money market funds data They are torn; they would like to have data; they want to be cooperative On the other hand, they don't want to put burdens on their membership It is entirely voluntary and they hear a lot of complaining from their members if they call them excessively to clear up data anomalies So, there's quite a bit of tension on this score with Board staff and ICI staff even on the money market funds data   Well, they had an experimental process under way to collect a weekly series on the bond and stock mutual funds   No, it's not; it's still a one-day number   Yes, absolutely Still, there's the issue of checking the data, looking for anomalies, calling the funds back and so forth, and there's not a lot of appetite for that Now, maybe one thing we could do is to help subsidize them if that were a problem But I think the problem is more the tension; they don't [want to] involve their members too much    7/6-7/93   We do have the money market funds data already in M2 but it's a very small piece   The problem is that if we just do that, the outflows could exceed the inflows because of that capital gain that people are taking out and we could have a very funny looking [number] But we could use the inflow data to help analyze M2 rather than trying to build an artificial aggregate that doesn't have capital gains   That was when the NOW accounts were authorized   We did surveys of consumers and did micro analyses of banks to see what was happening between NOW accounts and other accounts   Right   I think that over time the two wouldn't be that much different I would assert that the capital gains and losses would make it a not very good predictor of nominal GDP It's partly fortuitous events--the changing way people react to the yield curve and the accessibility--that have made this velocity relatively constant over the last few years, and we can't really count on that   We do have the bond yields in the sense that we've put yield curve variables in our M2 equations And when bond yields go up and the yield curve steepens, then we tend to get flows--   My guess is we just don't have enough experience with that That's basically what this aggregate--   I'm not sure We had a huge runup in stock prices in '86 and '87 and we didn't notice much of a shortfall in M2 growth When stock prices came down--the crash of '87--we had a little surge into M2   The stock market is an alternative repository for savings And peoples' expectations about future returns in the stock market will affect their assessment of what they're going to get out of a time deposit versus [the stock market] So, there's going to be some relationship But I would doubt that it's very strong   There are a number of alternatives that the Board could contemplate in terms of publishing this, including just making it available on an informal basis to researchers [and others] who call We did include a chart of the flows in the Humphrey-Hawkins report last time--in the back where only the aficionados look--and we can certainly continue to do that   Right    7/6-7/93   I think there are a few   Institutions have offered them from time to time I think it's a very, very small amount   But it's minuscule   One addendum, Mr Chairman To the extent that members of the Committee are aware of people at their own Banks or also people outside who are doing research on this issue, we'd be glad to share our data   Well, we've sort of put together a series We're almost a troubleshooter! [Laughter] That wasn't fair The ICI publishes monthly data We've been trying to adjust them to take out the IRA/Keough accounts, to separate the [holdings of] institutions from [those of] non-institutions, and generally to put them more on an M2-type basis in terms of trying to put together a data series that is a little more comparable with the concepts--   In dollar terms?   I doubt it but I'm not 100 percent certain since I think those things move pretty slowly On some of these we only have once-a-year data, the level on December 31st So, we just smooth between two December 31sts   Thank you, Mr Chairman After my recent experience I'm tempted to say that the hour exam will cover both the lecture material and the texts, Bluebook and Greenbook!   Actually a few aides will be grading this, Henry Gonzalez and Don Riegle   The first lesson will be on IS-LM and Phillips curves, starting on page 8 of the Bluebook [Statement--see Appendix]   I doubt it The question here is if short-term rates went down whether long-term rates also would be going down because of disinflation   Right That could give a pretty good push to money I agree with the thrust of what you're saying It's hard to determine; we don't have much experience with yield curve-type variables On the one hand, we could see the decline in long-term rates; there would be [unintelligible] capital gains and that might damp M2 for a while But I think a flatter yield curve would help Now, depending on how much short-term rates went down at the same time, I think such a [structure] would tend to push up M2; whether it would violate a 3 or 4 percent upper limit [I don't know] You might have trouble on the 4 percent upper end of alternative III It's possible it could be pushed up there, but it would take a lot more interest [rate] response than we've seen from M2 recently But your general presumption that having long-term rates go down and short-term  -45-    7/6-7/93  rates go down would push in that direction I think is correct It's just a question of how fast and how hard it would push   I guess it would have to be a sharp decline in both long- and short-term rates It would depend on the size of that [decline], with the yield curve effect pushing money out of M2 but the short-term interest rate effect pulling money in I'm sorry, but partly because I don't have much confidence in our projections of these elasticities I don't have a good notion of how far interest rates would have to drop to do that My guess is that both long- and short-term rates would have to drop quite a distance to push M2 growth beyond 4 percent   Our presumption, Governor Lindsey, was that as we got out into the years '96, '97, '98, that is ""after a while""--   -- that some of these shifts would be over, that people would have adjusted and that something like an M2 aggregate would reemerge with the old relationship to nominal GDP That is, it would react somewhat the same way with respect to interest rates and income Obviously, we can't know in advance what that would be like The other point I'd like to make is that I think we sometimes risk idealizing the way M2 used to be This Committee violated deliberately or ran very high in its M2 ranges frequently in the '80s and ran low sometimes as it moved interest rates against the thrust of changes in spending It did a pretty good job moving M2 around and stabilizing nominal GDP So M2 velocities from year to year always were highly variable; one could make an argument that stabilizing nominal GDP, given shifts in spending, forced the Committee to have variable M2s and variable velocities The notion of M2 we came to toward the end of the '80s was that even if there were questions raised about it year to year, the Committee should at least examine what it was doing if M2 seemed to deviate a lot up or a lot down, cumulated over long periods of time--the old P* notion And the innovations of the last two years have called even long-term stability into question I think it's quite possible that over time long-term stability will reemerge to a certain extent, but I don't think we'll ever have a short-run relationship such that the Committee could count on setting a tight M2 target for a given year and assume it would get  -46-    7/6-7/93  a particular nominal GDP for that year M2 is just one of a number of indicators of what is going on in the financial system   Well, the logic of what I was saying is that it'll return to something around zero   I think the chances are, though, that there will be continuing innovations A lot depends on what happens to depository institutions [and whether] they continue to shrink as a proportion of total intermediation It depends on whether you think we're in a sort of stock adjustment period in terms of depository credit or in a continuing decline I lean toward the former rather than the latter, but I certainly don't rule out the latter That is, I think there will be a nub of credit [extensions] that depositories are well suited to making and will continue to make Now, if they start securitizing small business loans and that sort of thing, depository institutions may just continue to fade as important intermediaries, in which case the upward trend in M2 velocity would continue for quite some time   I think there is an intellectual case in the following sense In my response to Governor Lindsey I said there are questions about the underlying trends in the economy and the depository sector; we're not tied down to something like a V* that we thought was constant On the other hand, as I noted in my remarks, we haven't been that far off in our predictions of velocity and M2 Our annual predictions have been remarkably close though some of that is offsetting errors, which I'd be the first to admit But even the velocity predictions since the middle of last year, when we sort of caught on to what was going on, have been off by maybe a percentage point or less on a half-yearly basis So, my guess is that it is no more and may be even less than we had in the '80s when we thought we had a stable range over the long term So, in theory, you're right If you don't know where things are going to go, where the equilibrium is, you're more uncertain about where you are in every year On the other hand, we do understand something about these processes; we think  -47-    7/6-7/93  we do anyhow And I'm not sure we're much more uncertain about the second half of 1993 than we were about the second half of 1986 or 1985   Well, I think the Chairman has done a very good job communicating   Right Well, in some sense, that's what drove me to put in those very low ranges, 0 to 4 percent or whatever   No, President Broaddus, we did not take account of credibility effects, as I think we put in a footnote on the next page The tighter and easier scenarios were keyed off of the baseline And since the baseline is like the Greenbook forecast, as you discussed yesterday it is a little more pessimistic on inflation relative to output That carried through in a sense to the tighter and easier alternatives You're right that if we had some credibility effects we could get inflation down faster for the same output or we could get higher output for the same inflation gain I think the evidence on that in the past has been mixed We may be on the verge of getting some [credibility effects] beyond what we've gotten so far But we did not assume changes in credibility [in the tighter scenario] nor did we assume that losses in credibility on the easier side would adversely affect the numbers   Mr Chairman, I think the tighter M2 path, which as I was discussing with Governor Lindsey had underlying it the notion that things would come back to more normal alignment, suggests the difficulty of doing that We have 4 and 4-3/4 percent M2 growth partly because the yield curve is flattening I think that's the other factor, as you mentioned before If the yield curve is flattening from its highly unusual alignment right now, then that process--it's sort of what Governor Angell has been saying--will push up the M2 growth at least for a time So, it's hard to know what's consistent with price stability   I'm fairly confident, which isn't very confident I agree, that we are going to come in under the range this year You could always say that When we wrote our Humphrey-Hawkins report last year, the experience of writing it was that it was difficult to say we've got this range but we're ignoring it Well, why do you have the range? You changed it in February; you thought you knew enough in February to change it It conveys something about our longer-run intentions, but it doesn't convey anything about what we want to do this year or what we think will happen this year We can write that; we can do that, but it's a little more awkward than saying Well, given the velocity developments in the first part of the year, we think this is going to happen I think there's an additional vulnerability this time--and I don't know which way it cuts--which is that M2 growth is 1 percentage point below the range and you have revised down your nominal GDP forecast So, Senator Sarbanes can get religion again and say See, you missed that and you missed nominal GDP at the same time I'm not sure which way that cuts I think if we don't lower the range and we miss it, then we are vulnerable If we do lower the range, we're vulnerable to the question that Governor Lindsey talked about That is, does the lowering mean you've lowered your nominal GDP? Well, we have a little But even if we don't lower the range--   --and start falling short, we're vulnerable to the continuing flow of letters over this half of the year So, it really is somewhat of a tossup   My judgment is that the probability would be small, given the current shape of the yield curve   A major acceleration in M2 growth?   I guess I don't see those forces [that are affecting M2] abating As I've said, I think the risks on our forecast are balanced I think there's some possibility that M2 could come out around 2 percent, but to have a big surge would be highly unlikely given what we know is happening with mutual funds, sales in bank offices, and--   If the trend of the stock market--   That's possible And that would be a good example of an M2 surge which you'd certainly want to accommodate If the stock market were dropping, you'd have trouble explaining why you weren't reacting   That's M2++!   It's on page 2 of Mr Gonzalez's letter   Mr Chairman, I perhaps just ought to remind the Committee very briefly that on several occasions over the last six or eight months it did consider this question of whether it should release information immediately We had a Mullins' subcommittee on this and a full and open discussion on the issue While a few members of the Committee tended to favor immediate release, they were, I think, a minority; certainly, no one moved to change the situation The concerns of the Committee at the time were the questions of flexibility in policymaking, whether an immediate announcement of a directive, say, like the asymmetric directive in May, would constrain the Committee from going to asymmetry because they wouldn't want the announcement effect In fact, the effect was that it did have markets raising interest rates; if they weren't sure, they were going to raise rates By constraining [the ability of] the Committee to take actions to go to an asymmetric directive or off asymmetry to symmetry, it would in some sense remove by very small amounts some of the flexibility of the Committee That was the concern the Committee had  The other issue that you need to think about if you're considering going to an immediate release is what to release If in May, for example, right after its meeting the Committee had released the fact that it had gone to an asymmetric directive would that have significantly called off the reporters? One has to wonder At least I would have to wonder whether the reporters wouldn't be all over the Committee members wondering why you had done it and under what circumstances a change would be made [But] it would help [to release such information] and in most meetings it would stop right there, I think, once the Committee announced its decision But then you do have the question of what you release along with that and how far to go So, there are a couple of issues that were raised when the Committee last discussed this "
2776,1993-07-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  -65-    7/6-7/93 "
2838,1993-08-17," I thought I would start my briefing with some thoughts on this topic using it to lead into the discussion of current  -29-    8/17/93  policy options Those of you attending the Jackson Hole conference will note some similarity between the first two pages today and what you will hear on Friday It's called ""Economies of Scope"" [Statement--see Appendix] "
2839,1993-08-17," I don't know the answer   We've had very few periods of five or six months where we haven't [moved] the federal funds rate We had a period from September through December of last year in which we had asymmetry toward ease and didn't move Our last move was right after Labor Day last year We continued to be asymmetrical toward ease and didn't move over the ensuing months Then we were neutral for several months and didn't ease And, obviously, we've been asymmetrical toward tightening for two months and didn't tighten We looked some time ago--I guess it was before the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony-- at periods of unchanged federal funds rates We found a few of five or six months, but not too many And I don't remember what the directives were in those times My guess is that they were probably not biased rather than asymmetrical, but I don't know that for a fact   It has happened from time to time, but it is unusual We did look at that We actually looked before the last FOMC meeting for one-month switches and I think we found one or two   They were sometimes associated with things like stock markets [or other] external events   That was the one   So, there are a few examples like that; they are rare but it does happen   In theory, obviously, it's the nominal rate minus the expected inflation rate over the period   Presumably, in theory you'd want something that has the same duration   Yes, we have these surveys but--   I would think so, yes Now, the Philadelphia Fed does surveys and I think they have about 3-7/8ths in the most recent one; that's several months old The Michigan surveys are closer to 5 percent   I don't know what they ask for--about 5 to 10 years   Not that I'm aware of   But I think it shows that you're more ready to go in one direction or another   Well, if people think you're using it to posture rather than to take action, I think there's a little danger of that But it seems to me the Committee needs to think about what its posture really is here Is it more ready to move one way or another? Whether you move or not, that's what you're signalling with this These are instructions to the Desk and the Chairman about how you would like to react to completely unexpected developments in the intermeeting period   It depends on whether you're talking about the forward rates 10 years out or the 30-year rate, which is heavily weighted by intermediate rates If the markets perceive us as running a tighter policy for a time, that can raise real rates--   Well, it's going to tend to raise the forward rates out a few years, I think And then the question is What are the weights of those in the 10-year security or the 30-year security?   Yes "
2890,1993-09-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   It's true that our models also have been tracking M1 pretty well, as you can see from this chart We use short-term interest rates--the [3]-month Treasury bill rate--relative to rates on NOW accounts basically as the opportunity cost for [the NOW account component of] M1, and the short-term interest rate itself relative to the zero on the currency and demand deposits [components] We find that our models underpredicted M1 a little over the last few years and we think that's primarily because of the currency flows overseas and maybe a little because of the mortgage repayments which are mostly in demand deposits So, I guess we don't see a major disconnect that needs to be changed here We have slightly slower M1 growth projected for next year based on our expectations that in fact interest rates will be flat and that there will be some further decline in NOW account rates It continues to be [unintelligible] at the end of this year and the beginning of next year by mortgage refinancing So, I'm not sure we see anything major that needs to be explained M1 has always been very interest-sensitive, and I think that was the reason the Committee stopped targeting it in the early '80s It's just that  -33-    9/23/93  in order to make any sense of the connection between M1 and nominal income one had to be very clear about the connection between interest rates and nominal income When NOW accounts were invented, the swing between [small] time deposits and NOW accounts as interest rates moved became very dominant in the M1 demand [function], and it became extremely interest-sensitive So the initial response of the Committee was a widening of the bands for M1, then they re-based it midway through the year, and finally they just threw up their hands If you couldn't get a fix on interest rates, you couldn't really get a fix on the M1/GNP relationship I agree with your original observation that, unlike for M2, we don't see major unexplained misses in M1 relative to interest rates and income It's just that the relationship [between M1 and nominal GDP] is not very tight The velocity of M1 swings over very, very wide ranges So, therefore, it hasn't been all that useful to the Committee in guiding policy "
2945,1993-11-16," The questions of what to do about the existing transcripts and about release of information regarding deliberations at future meetings involve subtle and complex considerations As background for your discussion of these matters, the staff supplied you with a series of options Obviously, we didn't exhaust the possibilities, but we thought the ones we listed would highlight the main issues you confront  The options were presented in two groups--one for disposition of existing transcripts and the other for release of information about this and future meetings Nonetheless, decisions with respect to one may interact with the other The critical consideration is the effect of the options chosen on the deliberative process going forward Therefore, a decision concerning the disposition of past transcripts doesn't necessarily mandate your actions going forward For example, you could decide to release the transcripts, edited or not, going back in time, without necessarily committing to do so in the future  Virgil has outlined some of the legal considerations bearing on these decisions, and the Committee has in the past debated extensively the effects of various options for the monetary policy process and its interaction with markets By now, many of these arguments are well known to the Committee and I won't repeat them in detail as I review the options However, there is an important third class of considerations that has been highlighted by the hearings and their aftermath--that is, the public's perception of the FOMC information release process, and the implications of that perception in the political sphere The Fed was already viewed as insufficiently open--and our reasons for current practices somewhat inscrutable--by many in the press, Congress, and the markets The existence of the transcripts has no logical bearing in terms of the effects on markets    11/16/93  and monetary policy of what we do going forward, but it has heightened public and Congressional awareness of current practices and seems to have placed additional pressures on us either to change practices or come up with more convincing explanations Against this general background, I will review some of the issues raised by each alternative on the outline you received  With regard to the existing transcripts from 1976 through September, one alternative was for no release in any form until the transcripts were transferred to the National Archives in thirty years This would provide maximum protection for participants who had no idea their words were being saved for later public release, many of whom have no way of reviewing the transcripts for accuracy Any release of the transcripts--edited or unedited--will be unfair to some degree to these past participants However, this option would seem to have legal and public perception problems Legally, it may be difficult to convince the Justice Department to defend against a FOIA request for very old transcripts on the grounds that it would harm the deliberative process This defense could be more difficult if the Committee were to decide not to tape meetings in the future, since in those circumstances one might argue that release of past transcripts could not affect future deliberations  The second alternative was for release of the raw transcripts after a considerable period--perhaps from 5 to 10 years--deleting only the most sensitive information about international developments or individual domestic firms The longer the lag, the greater the protection for unwitting participants Release of raw transcripts avoids our trying to divine what people really intended to say, since we would not correct the material This course would seem to be defensible under FOIA, though some of our critics would question the lag In the past, the Committee has deemed a 5-year lag, albeit for an MOD, sufficient to protect the deliberative process An important additional problem would involve obvious errors in the transcripts-- the ""not"" where it doesn't belong and was never intended Such miscues result in misrepresentation of what people were saying at the meeting Reasonable users of the transcripts would undoubtedly interpret each sentence or thought in its context--in effect, doing the type of editing we would do for a lightly edited transcript or MOD But we may not be able to count on such reasonableness This option avoids the problem of placing an FOMC imprimatur on the document The Committee could state that this transcript has not been reviewed or approved by the FOMC and is therefore not an official publication  One way to address the problem of transcription errors would be through the annotation process mentioned by Virgil Another would be lightly edited transcripts--the third alternative, which would correct such obvious errors of transcription as well as smooth through some of the more severe syntax problems and remove some clearly extraneous material But no change of substance could be made Only under these circumstances would the Archivist consider a schedule allowing for the raw transcripts to be discarded as the edited versions were completed They stressed their need to carefully compare the lightly edited transcripts against the raw transcripts before they could approve the procedure The question that arises with edited transcripts is whether it is fair or appropriate to represent such a transcript, which would involve some deletions as    11/16/93  well as attempted corrections of remaining errors in transcription, as the language of the speaker--as would be implied by the transcript form--especially when the speaker has not had the opportunity to review what is being released  The fourth option--an MOD--was suggested to deal with this concern The MOD would involve a more complete editing to remove further problems and get at the underlying intent of the speaker, but would put the results in third-person format The difficulty with the MOD for meetings in the past is that the Archivist is not likely to approve a schedule allowing us to discard the raw transcripts once the MOD was completed We could make available an MOD and a raw transcript at the same time; the MOD would represent the Federal Reserve staff's attempt to make the transcript more comprehensible and useful The cost of an MOD is greater than for a lightly edited transcript--more than twice as high according to the cover note from Mr Bernard  The outline also raises issues associated with review of a transcript or MOD An awkward situation may arise if parts of a transcript are edited because some participants are still able to do so, while other parts are not Perhaps the cleanest approach would be to have the staff do the editing of transcripts for past meetings without review by any participants Each transcript, edited or not, would carry a statement noting that these were not official records of the FOMC, had not been reviewed by participants, and likely contained errors of transcription Since they would not be official records, the FOMC could consider not publishing them officially, but rather making them available to interested parties  Options for meetings going forward are presented in Roman II on page two The first option would have the Committee continue to release only what it does now and turn off the recorder Any tapes and transcripts prepared could not be discarded under the National Records Act, and would be subject to subsequent FOIA or other requests for release Premature release or threat of release of a transcript could have adverse effects on the deliberative process As an alternative to taping and transcribing, the Secretariat would need to take notes to use in preparation of the Minutes; it is possible that these notes would be subject to the Records Act The quality of the Minutes might suffer to some extent--depending on the extent and accuracy of notes--and today's mostly reliable source for determining exactly what occurred at FOMC meetings would be lost, for those rare occasions when such questions arise Finally, if this option were chosen, the Committee would need to consider its repercussions on the public's view of the Federal Reserve and on Congressional attitudes about the need to strengthen our accountability The extent and seriousness of these repercussions is subject to differing judgments, and might depend in part on whether we were able to tell our story more convincingly and, in addition, how forthcoming we were with the existing transcripts  Alternative two--enhanced minutes--might help ameliorate some of the reaction, although this issue would still need careful consideration The exact nature of the enhancements could take several forms The one suggested in the outline would be more attribution of individual policy views to encompass those in the majority as well as those in the minority who now file dissents This    11/16/93  would be consistent with Board practice in which individual Governor's views are often covered in the minutes of the meetings In addition, the Board occasionally publishes concurring views with its decisions, when those voting with the majority wish to emphasize different rationales or concerns Adopting these practices would go a considerable distance toward satisfying requests for greater accountability It would, however, detract to an extent from the idea of collective responsibility for Committee decisions The public would be getting more information than it currently does In particular it would get a better sense of the nuances among the views of the policymakers and probably a more complete idea of all the arguments brought to bear on the final decision The tape also would be turned off for this alternative, with the implications discussed above Moreover, the enhanced minutes would still not reveal to scholars the full detail of the reasoning that went into policy decisions  Alternatives three or four--the MOD or lightly edited transcripts--would give that detail As between the two, the greater expense of the MOD would need to be weighed against the additional constraining effect the members might feel a transcript would have on the free flow of Committee deliberations If the MOD or edited transcript contained all the substance at the meeting and was subject to review by participants shortly after the meeting, we are reasonably sure the Archivist would treat the raw transcripts as working documents that were no longer needed once the final record had been completed In both cases, confidential information would be redacted from the publicly released document A number of members have supported the production and release of MODs in their letters and public statements, with appropriate lags and redaction The Federal Reserve itself produced such documents and later had no major objections to laws that would require them Most of those favoring the MOD, however, expressed considerable concern about protecting it from public release for a substantial period No law can guarantee against a Congressional request, including a subpoena However, as Virgil noted, it now appears that the chances are quite high that we could protect MODs against premature release to the public under existing FOIA, assuming an appropriate lag for release to the public Obviously though, there can be no guarantee against a judge with a different interpretation or a Justice Department with more extreme views on this matter in the future  One aspect of FOMC information release that we did not treat in the outline, which may have some bearing on public perceptions, was the publication of the directive or the Committee's policy stance Our current policy of delay, while soundly based in my view with respect to the potential effects of other alternatives on the flexibility of decisionmaking, certainly contributes to the perception of the FOMC as a secretive organization The Committee may not want to rule out considering once again the costs and benefits of the current practice, especially if it decides not to produce edited transcripts or MODs going forward, but still wants to improve its reputation for openness   If the lightly edited transcript faithfully includes all the substance of what happened at the meeting and didn't change or even guess at what people's intent was in what they said   Yes   I would guess so   No, I did for the MOD, but it would be the same thing I think that's possible As I mentioned for the MOD, we could do the raw transcript [and] the MOD, with the MOD then representing Norm Bernard's attempt to make sense of the raw transcript Then scholars could use it or not and compare it or not I think the same arguments would go for the lightly edited transcripts Certainly we could do both The reason I raised it with the raw transcript and the MOD is that the Archivist would absolutely force us to do that If we did an MOD, we'd have to do the raw transcript; with the lightly edited transcript we wouldn't have to do both but, sure, we could   Right   There can be a miscue or someone [mispeaks] or is quoted out of context and that sort of thing So the light editing would be an attempt to smooth through that and avoid some of that [problem], although we're never--well, an unscrupulous scholar or other person would always be able to take sentences and pieces out of context The light editing we thought would help a little   Well, I presume we can do a combination of lightly edited with annotation But I think an advantage of a lightly edited transcript is that we can take out some extraneous material, jokes and the like, and clean up the syntax a little to make it flow better so that the underlying meaning becomes a little clearer   It's more articulate, Governor Angell   Going back you mean?   Well, my understanding from Virgil is that once we release the memoranda of discussion, which have all the deliberative material in there, we would not be able to fight a FOIA request for the raw transcripts   We have about half a dozen FOIA requests, but--   Scholars who work for American Banker and The Wall Street Journal and--   Yes   Yes, our--   Our thought was that whatever the Committee decided about releasing to the public, the Chairman would write a letter to Chairman Gonzalez saying that the Committee met, decided this about releasing to the public, and we assume this takes care of your problem Obviously, this is the Committee's choice, but the thought was that we wouldn't give something to Chairman Gonzalez that we weren't releasing to the public at the same time, at least as an opening shot here   Our hopes in that regard weren't very high but we thought that if the Committee had something that could be sold and looked reasonable that his odds on getting the rest of his Committee to go along with the subpoena, if he then decided to request it, would be much lower In effect our letter back to Chairman Gonzalez is really a letter to the other 50 members of the Committee saying what our decision was and defending it as reasonable in the circumstances   Five   No, the attribution idea was not from the discussion with Congressmen; the attribution idea really came from the Board's current minutes And also the notion of accountability--   Yes   Yes Now, for the discount rate, for example, I think those minutes are released with a longer lag than the--   The Board's current minutes, I'm sorry And there are concurring statements in those minutes when people vote in favor but differ on the reasoning It doesn't happen very often   As I understand it from Virgil, if we saw a ""not"" where clearly it didn't belong, the Archivist would hesitate to allow us to take it out but he would allow us to put a footnote there and say ""Editor's note Read in context this word doesn't seem to belong""   President McDonough, you said five?   It's four for everything   My recommendation, Mr Chairman, after hearing the initial discussion, was for the Committee to vote on the past and get those transcripts behind us so we've got a clear--   Essentially we did that already   The next part of the suggestion was to tell Chairman Gonzalez that the FOMC is looking at different means to enhance our openness and disclosure [practices] We would not tell him exactly what we're planning to do because it didn't seem that we had a consensus; but we would make a commitment that after the December FOMC meeting we would tell him what we're going to do Part of [the reasoning behind] that was to reconvene the Mullins' Subcommittee so it could make recommendations to the FOMC at its next meeting That was my recommendation   I certainly regret anything I said! [Laughter]   Well, he has made suggestions about what you should do before He suggests you release an MOD after 60 days and raw transcripts after--   His demand is for the past [transcripts]   This is very similar, Governor Angell, to what Chairman Burns replied to Chairman Patman in 1975--   --who asked for the last five years of unpublished MODs and Chairman Burns said no "
2946,1993-11-16," Mr Chairman, you'll be relieved to know that I'll be considerably briefer this time than in the previous briefing [Statement--see Appendix]   This would be an easy one to write up with attribution "
3011,1993-12-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   He asked if we would make the tape and transcript ""available for review"" Those were the words   Technically, yes That's correct   FOIA isn't aimed at monetary policy; the exemption is aimed at the deliberative process, whatever the outcome is  -46-    12/21/93   I don't think it's necessary "
3012,1993-12-21," Two meetings, May and July   I don't know I did have a table put together; it doesn't have it by episodes But it has the number of asymmetries and moves made after the asymmetries Of course, we had two this year with no move In '92 we had six asymmetries and moved three times; in '91 it was five for five; in '90 four for five; in '89 two for five; in '88 four for six; and '87 two for five So by my calculations about 60 percent of the time we were asymmetrical we [subsequently  -29-    12/21/93  moved in the direction of the asymmetry]; it was 65 or 66 percent if I took out the last two   August 18th we were asymmetrical toward firming Oh, you're right; early in the year we must have been asymmetrical toward tightening--I don't have the complete record here--but we went back to symmetry then back toward firming in August and then back to symmetry And then toward ease after the crash   Well, if this table is right, which goes from '87 through November of this year, we took seven actions from symmetric directives   Out of 20 from asymmetric directives   No, I don't have any rules of thumb, Governor Lindsey The point I was trying to make was that if you do delay and inflation expectations in particular get going, you're going to have to raise rates not only to cover the higher inflation expectations but--   -- if you have a certain inflation target you're going to have to overshoot to get that down again But I don't have a rule of thumb It would depend on where you were in the cycle and how far you--   No, I don't   I'm not sure, Governor Angell "
3083,1994-02-03," This is the short-run policy part of the meeting [Statement--see Appendix]  -43-    2/3-4/94   I will be referring to page 8 in the Bluebook in the course of my report [Statement--see Appendix]   Right, assuming a flat velocity   The monetary aggregates could come back in a sense of predictable velocities In fact, we haven't done that poor a job of predicting them in recent years, but we believe it's not a stable situation But you're right; if the M2 velocity comes back to its  -59-    2/3-4/94  flat path, the 1 to 5 percent range would be approximately the right range   I think it's a balancing of a couple of things here--the federal government versus the private sector The private- sector debt growth as you know was very low and total debt growth actually was close to GDP, as you can see by the flatness of that line, largely because the federal government was such a heavy borrower Now, federal government borrowing is being cut back but we believe the private debt growth will be picking up a bit; in fact, it did over the second half of last year The projection for 1994 is basically that the pattern of the second half in terms of household and business borrowing--there are tradeoffs between the two but taken  -60-    2/3-4/94  together the total--will be about the same as it was in the second half of last year We're not predicting an acceleration of that   Although I think that's what works out of a complicated underpinning in which we say, as Mike pointed out yesterday, there will be more corporate use of external funds over the coming year or two because their cash flow is slowing relative to their spending Household borrowing growth, on the other hand, is expected to slow a little   Going from 1993 to 1994, we have two special factors One is the mortgage-backed securities situation, which added  -61-    2/3-4/94  a couple percentage points to M1 in 1993 and will subtract a little in 1994 We are assuming that the refinancings of mortgages will settle down or actually decline, and they have, and that subtracts from demand deposits Number two is which shifted a bunch of deposits, about $7 billion or so--we're not quite sure how much yet but in that order of magnitude--from NOW accounts to MMDAs It doesn't affect M2, but we think that subtracted about 3/4 of a percentage point from M1 growth For M1 growth, when you go from 1994 to 1995 the principal effect is interest rates We've assumed that the short-term interest rates consistent with the Greenbook forecast start on an upward trend in the second half of 1994 and continue that way through 1995 One thing we have found about M1 is that it is a very interest-sensitive aggregate There's the issue of compensating balances and the earnings effects, but even more so, I think, there's the issue of NOW accounts When time deposit rates or maybe even savings deposit rates start to rise with market interest rates, some of the funds that had been shifted into NOW accounts-- because rates on NOW accounts and small time deposits were about the same or not much different--may well be shifted back to time deposits So, we think the NOW accounts in particular have become extremely interest sensitive And that's why you see the velocity of M1--on Chart 5--has become highly variable, especially after 1980 It's because of the interest rate effects Primarily what's happening, going from 1994 to 1995 in particular, is the effects of the rising interest rates   Demand deposits but the NOW accounts as well We think that rising interest rates will pull funds out of the NOW accounts into small time deposits which would have, obviously, no effect per se on M2 but would have a major effect on M1   We would assume that that spread would widen Our experience is that the NOW account rates adjust very slowly and sluggishly whereas the small time deposit rates in recent years have come to adjust fairly rapidly We would think that the retail CD rate would rise with a lag but fairly promptly as the fed funds rate rose and other market interest rates adjusted higher, but that the NOW account rate would be quite sluggish   Yes, although I think the baseline is a little toward the upper end, but we are assuming that these special trends in velocity do come to an end We do have some declines in short-term rates in 1996 and 1997 in the tighter and easier alternatives, which push up money growth a little We have long-term rates coming down so we have the yield curve flattening So, there are a few special factors, which are pushing up money growth out there But the underlying assumption is consistent with what the Chairman said, that is, aside from those special factors having to do with the shape of the yield curve, in the out years we assumed--without any evidence yet that it's happening--that the big shifts in money demand did cease   Yes When the interest rate effects die down in 1998 and 1999, we have assumed that velocity growth will be zero as you said, that the special shifts will--   Yes   It's two things One is that we recognized when we talked about whether we should fine-tune this strategy, in particular when we got out there, that in fact real interest rates are rising in this tighter strategy We have the unemployment rate still at 7 percent I think that in fact if the Committee were to engage in the tighter strategy--that is, raise rates higher now--it would end up reducing the funds rate in the out years It just seemed like a degree of fine-tuning that perhaps wasn't needed But we recognized the problem you're raising, which is that the real rate is rising out there, and the Committee would have to bring it down I think it is important to emphasize that to get the kind of disinflation embodied in this scenario and without credibility effects--as we pointed out we're just working off short-run and long-run Phillips curves--you do need to keep the real interest rate a bit above its equilibrium level in this tighter policy to keep slack in the economy, to keep the inflation rate pointed down So, it's not surprising that the real rate in the tighter strategy is above the real rate in the baseline or the real rate in the easier strategy; that corresponds to the various unemployment rates in the model which you need to get the inflation rate--  -63-    2/3-4/94 "
3084,1994-02-03," Mr Chairman and President Jordan, I'll be addressing this issue a little bit in my own briefing when we talk about whether the 1995 forecasts should be submitted to the Congress at this time I think your point, President Jordan, is well taken in the sense that there would be a temptation to interpret the 1995 results as what the Committee members on average desire to happen Although the lags of policy are long, one assumes that they're not so  -12-    2/3-4/94  long that you couldn't take some actions in early 1994 that would move you a good ways toward where you wanted to be in 1995--given the constraints of where you are starting and the underlying structure of the economy, which give you sort of a policy frontier as to the best you can do   With the long-term ranges   Well, I was going to include it as part of my briefing and it's up to you after that!   He read the memo!   No, that is not our intent   We've done a few of them; Norm, where are we? Let's toss the ball back down there   No   Then they have to go through an international and legal redaction process But I think it's reasonable to--   The 22nd   That would be the end of 1987   Mr Chairman, the former Mullins Subcommittee, whatever it is now, is to meet on this issue tomorrow after the FOMC meeting, so I don't think there's any reason why the Subcommittee can't put the finishing touches on whatever recommendations it is going to make in the very near term and get them out to the members   Mr Chairman?   You asked me to remind you to remind the Committee of the highly confidential nature of the subjects being discussed, and the fact that you would take drastic measures if something were leaked   The other interesting aspect was that bill rates went down 3 or 4 basis points and the funds rate, which had opened at 3-1/8 to 3-3/16, went down to 3 to 3-1/16 and remained there So in some sense at least the certainty of firming today was taken out by the employment numbers Now, maybe as the bond market and everyone else reassesses them, the adjustment will be reversed   I just got a market update The long end is now off 5/32, which puts it about 2/32 below what I had written down at 829 and 59 seconds am [Laughter] But the funds rate is still at 3-1/16; bill rates are still down 4 basis points We took a reading on the fed funds futures market at 855 am and that suggested, at least at that time, a substantial lessening of expectations about Federal Reserve action For example, the one month ahead futures rate went from 326 at the close last night to 319 at 855 am this morning "
3085,1994-02-03," I would say ""slightly,"" Norm "
3148,1994-03-22," [Statement--see Appendix]   I'll try to be brief, Mr Chairman Drawing on the work of the subcommittee, Messrs Boehne, Kelley, and Melzer considered a couple of options for announcing the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee What they hit on finally was that the best bet was to announce changes in our instrument settings much as we did last time but just say what we did That is, in this case we could say, using the wording proposed by Joe Coyne ""The Federal Reserve decided today to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions This action by the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates"" The thought was that this sort of announcement could be coupled with additional explanations if the Committee thought that was necessary in unusual situations, but the important thing was to get out the fact that we acted  One option that the subcommittee thought about was releasing the whole directive, but that has some disadvantages That would involve releasing the symmetries and asymmetries right away and whatever is left of that symmetry/asymmetry flexibility would  -54-    3/22/94  certainly go away because knowledge of that decision does move markets So the Committee might be less likely to adopt asymmetries On balance, the subcommittee thought it was a good idea just to release the decision The reception from the public was good last time The Fed looked and was more open We in effect ran an experiment that worked pretty well from that perspective  I think there is one minor note of hesitancy The Committee looked at this about a year ago, or maybe a little over a year ago, and rejected this announcement option The Committee was concerned at that time that it would lose some flexibility There were two instruments the discount rate, which rang the gong; and open market operations, which didn't The February 4th experience, although there were a lot of special things involved, does suggest the possibility that there might be stronger reactions to announced moves both in the markets and in the public which could complicate the implementation of open market operations from time to time So there is concern about loss of flexibility But in thinking about this, the balance of the costs and benefits in the view of the subcommittee had shifted toward the notion of announcing changes in instrument settings when the FOMC decided on those changes  There are also a couple of technical issues One is when to announce The thought was that the best approach would be to set a more or less fixed time on the afternoon of the day the Committee met; that would be this afternoon It should be early enough to allow trading on the news in the markets but late enough so that the markets wouldn't sit around wondering how long the Committee had met That is, we would have a reasonable prospect of being finished our work before the usual announcement time We wouldn't want the usual announcement time to go by and have the Committee still thinking about its decision, but people assuming that the decision was for policy to remain unchanged So the time should be late enough so that you would finish the meeting but early enough to be traded in the market, somewhere around 215 pm to 230 pm seems about right to Bill McDonough and to me What to announce I think I've already covered The subcommittee did not think a decision for no change had to be announced; only changes would be announced And as I noted, the subcommittee thought that an explanation such as we had last time would be the exception rather than the rule That would help maintain a bit of a difference between a discount rate action and open market operations I invite any of the subcommittee members to comment "
3149,1994-03-22," I'm not sure I can add very much to what Mike said in response to your previous question except to say that my words in regard to alternative C were meant to suggest that strong action--50 basis points now and likely considerably more down the road--would probably be more consistent with getting inflation down than the more gradual, though not very gradual, path in the staff forecast I think it's the same issue In effect, the staff forecast has inflation leveling out at 3 percent In the judgment of the staff, given our assessment of spending and inflation pressures, stronger action may be needed to bring inflation down And that's what I tried to convey--   I was just suggesting that that's the alternative you ought to consider if you really want to bring inflation down and make measurable progress That would be one reason for looking at alternative C   We don't have current data on that We do have a sense that the flows overseas are large I don't think we have a good fix on where they are going, especially since where they might go initially--suppose they went to Switzerland or something like that-- doesn't indicate what the final destinations might be   I tried to suggest that some of the slowing might be in response to the rise in interest rates, though ordinarily we would think that it would take longer On M3 in particular, we have these institution-only money funds that are very sensitive to small changes in interest rates, and we think that accounts for a substantial part of the minus 7-3/4 percent M3 in February On M2 and on M1, I think we have a somewhat different phenomenon A lot of that is in the mortgage prepayments and, in fact, they have come off, as you know, as mortgage rates have risen since last October That has a temporarily depressing effect on M1 deposits, which we expect to come back So if anything, I would think that M1 has dipped below its longer-term trend or what we might expect over the longer run and might come back a little But with higher interest rates, we would certainly expect M1 in particular to slow substantially from the 10 percent plus pace of the last few years That would be our analysis M2 is more questionable We think that M2 does respond at least for a while to higher interest rates, but then we have questions about the effects of higher interest rates on the flows to the stock and the bond funds So the effect of higher interest rates, particularly if accompanied by rising bond yields and capital losses, on people's preferences for M2 versus bond and stock funds may muddy those waters But we would expect higher rates to damp M2 growth a little, at least for a time   Right "
3203,1994-05-17," The day before the March FOMC meeting nobody expected us to change policy that day or to announce a change that day but funds were still high   And if we had not gone in, that would have looked as if the decision somehow had been made ahead of the meeting   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] "
3204,1994-05-17," The backward-looking survey indicators contained in the financial indicators package put real rates at 3 to 4 percent   Yes, except for the 1980s; the rate is about where it was for much of the 1950s and 1960s  -12-    5/17/94 "
3205,1994-05-17," It's hard to parse this, President Melzer In fact, April tax payments were up considerably from last year while last year they were low relative to the year before It is true that this year's payments were less than we and everyone else had expected So it's a little difficult to know exactly what seasonals were built in Before we got this surge in early May, it looked as if the shortfall was bigger, and the low level of tax payments in April was one of the factors we were citing as a reason why M1 might have been slow in April because people hadn't built up their balances in order to pay taxes That explanation didn't seem to have as much weight after the extra billions came in in early May and the tax receipts over the April-May period looked as if they were about 10 percent higher than last year There might still be something in there since M1 growth this year is still low relative to its growth before the last year It's very difficult to know what seasonals are implicitly calling for   Well, a couple of points First, as between the 4 and 4-1/4 percent, I had assumed that those were the two options on the table To be sure, moving eventually by more can't be ruled out-- 75 basis points or even more I tried, but perhaps it didn't come through in my remarks, to raise the issue that 4-1/4 percent certainly might not be enough; and I expressed some concern that we not get stuck calling this neutral and therefore find it hard to rise beyond that I agree that the Committee certainly needs to keep its options open--that 4, 4-1/4, even 4-1/2 percent may not be sufficient  As to the slope of the yield curve, I think that's been a sometime thing in predicting economic activity The yield curve was extraordinarily steeply sloped for several years in this current expansion before the expansion seemed finally to have gotten under way in a self-sustaining sense It's certainly true that the markets have built into this spread more tightening than the staff forecast I think it's a question of judgment as to where the implied economic strength is Moreover, in judging the yield curve one has to take account of uncertainties and liquidity premiums With all the uncertainty and higher volatility, some of the level of long-term rates is reflecting liquidity premiums, not necessarily expected movements in funds rates But I don't disagree with the the overall thrust of your comment, which is that 4 or 4-1/4 or even 4-1/2 percent may not be high enough I think Mike came to the same conclusion "
3260,1994-07-05," Joan can comment on this as well, but I think the experience of the last month or so is that the bond markets would tend to react negatively That is, they would be concerned about one of two things One, that the decline in the dollar/yen relationship was itself indicative of inflation expectations, and that might end up affecting the bond markets Or, two, that in fact a very rapidly sinking dollar, given where the economy is and the strength of aggregate demand, would have inflationary implications via direct price and indirect aggregate demand channels So, I think at least over the recent period, the decline in the dollar has had an adverse effect on bond markets We have had periods in which the dollar has fallen and there has been no effect on bond markets, but that has occurred in the context of much more slack in the economy   But that's a problem in itself   [Statement--See Appendix]   There might be a reaction that the Fed is paying a little more attention to debt, that is, you bothered to change the range instead of leaving it But I think it would depend crucially on the rhetoric that was associated with the change If it was explained that slower debt growth has been occurring over recent years and should continue to be associated with slower nominal GDP and damped inflation, I don't see us creating a new feeding frenzy around debt, if that's what you are concerned about I think it is perfectly explainable It is a very high range, especially compared to the M2 and M3 numbers   I think the models embody a vertical long-run Phillips curve; it takes a while for it to come out here   Yes If you had not noticed that the inflation rate is up at 4 percent and the only reason it's not continuing on the upward trajectory is that we bent the unemployment rate up and so you have--   No   In this time period, that's right But if you stretched out--   If the unemployment rate had not come back up toward the natural rate, inflation would have continued to accelerate on a straight upward line If you believe that there are some costs to inflation, those are not embodied here; that is, the uncertainties and costs of higher inflation rates are not in here I think it is very strongly the Committee's view that they are not indifferent to creating a 4 percent inflation rate versus a 3 percent inflation rate   But if you didn't do that, the inflation rate would continue to accelerate forever   You have a percentage point of inflation cost There is, as you say, an interval if you go from 3 percent inflation forever to 4 percent inflation--without taking account of the feedbacks on economic growth but just in Phillips curve terms--in which you will realize some extra output in the meantime because you can drive the unemployment rate below the natural rate for a short time before bringing it back up to the natural rate But you will end up with 4 percent inflation, not 3 percent inflation   When you tried to bring inflation back from 4 percent if there were a cost associated with 4 percent rather than 3 percent in terms of the efficiency with which the economy operates   Unless there is a feedback from the 4 percent to 3 percent on productivity and on efficiency   The baseline is judgmental; the deviations from the baseline come out of the MPS model   I was going to suggest not only removing the dates from the horizontal line but also removing the scale from the vertical line [Laughter] I agree with what you said, Mr Chairman; it is supposed to illustrate tendencies   The model itself doesn't have, I don't believe, losses in output from higher inflation rates   I don't believe so   Isn't there a lot of cross-country and cross-time evidence that once you get past very low rates of inflation, there are costs in terms of growth and efficiency at higher levels of inflation? Higher levels of inflation tend to be more variable; you get a lot more uncertainty; people have to interact with the tax system and other things that aren't indexed to inflation rates So, there are substantial costs Now if the System had confidence--   It was very, very good until we started to target it! [Laughter] The nominal GDP/debt ratio fluctuated around a fairly constant level until the early '80s, and then there was the explosion of debt in the '80s In the last few years, debt has come back much more into line with nominal GDP, and our projection, as Mike showed in a chart yesterday, is that it will remain in line There is no guarantee, obviously; it's hard to see the natural force that is necessarily keeping debt in line But it did fluctuate closely with nominal GDP for many, many years, before the leveraging phenomenon of the '80s   It was a week after the lunch!   Mr Chairman, I heard a marginal preference among those talking about debt aggregates for lowering the range for next year but leaving it unchanged for this year  SEVERAL Yes   Okay   Well, he needs to read the debt sentence for 1994  -58-    7/5-6/94   I don't think so  -59-    7/5-6/94   Mike and I were just discussing this morning's Washington Post and how I should adjust my presentation Have you seen this morning's Washington Post?   I'll let Mr Prell tell you himself   This was cited as evidence of confusion and uncertainty in Federal Reserve thinking!  -60-    7/5-6/94 "
3261,1994-07-05," We had outflows from bond funds mostly in March That situation stabilized and subsequently we had some small net inflows Inflows to the stock mutual funds actually were quite strong However, the data received as the Bluebook was going to press or perhaps shortly thereafter showed that in the most recent week both stock and bond funds were weaker There were outflows in all of those accounts But our assessment is that the initial shock of the upward movement in long-term rates and the downward movement of the stock market had their major effects--driving people out of those funds who were surprised--in the ensuing four to six weeks Looking forward, we would expect continued flows to those funds, but at much lower levels than in 1992 and 1993 on the presumption that people have learned their lesson; they now are recognizing those are riskier assets than perhaps they thought before   Initially, they had very large inflows in the period in which the bond funds had the outflows But since then, they have cooled down quite substantially; their pluses match bond fund minuses reasonably well   The other point I would make, President Minehan, is that the Bluebook had tighter alternatives, a no change alternative, and no easier alternative   We ran simulations with the funds rate flat, and as Mike said, we didn't get much effect on inflation by the end of 1995, but the unemployment rate was significantly lower Given our assumption about where the NAIRU was, we started getting an uptick in inflation by 1995 and more noticeably in 1996 and 1997 We assumed that the Committee had a strong presumption against that increase in inflation occurring, so we didn't include this alternative Obviously, aggregate demand is also a consideration; if aggregate demand is weaker than in the staff forecast, the funds rate can stay the same Actually, that simulation indicates lower inflation But given the staff's aggregate demand projection and its assessment of potential, we had some significant effects in 1996 and 1997 "
3262,1994-07-05," Well, I am sure I won't relieve any of the current uncertainty here and probably will add to it [Statement--See Appendix]   Mr Chairman, I was hoping, as President McTeer was suggesting, that we would be in the position by now of having established a regular announcing time  SPEAKER(?) 215   And if an announcement is not made by that time, it would be clear that no action had been taken I think I'd ask Joan Lovett and maybe Joe Coyne to comment Both of them have some concerns that not announcing would leave people on edge and guessing that something was going on, with a result that could be a bit disruptive Joan   As I said in my briefing, the use of asymmetry in the past has been an expression of the Committee's disposition about how it would like to react to incoming data If you think the risks are more on one side than on the other and if for example you would like to react to stronger data before you reacted to weaker data, asymmetry would send a signal to the Chairman that when the data come in a bit to the stronger side, or the data don't suggest a weakening that you would like, he should give serious consideration to a firming move, acting on behalf of the FOMC, or to having a conference call   It's sort of leaning to one side in reacting to incoming data   I don't know offhand   I think in the past, Mr Chairman, a number of these intermeeting moves have been made after releases of data The markets often tend to move ahead of us and then barely react when we move--say, when we were in the process of easing But that evidence is not definitive, I would say "
3323,1994-08-16," [Statement--See Appendix]   I think, Mr Chairman, we would plan on releasing the statement around 215 pm as we have been doing   Yes, after the Board meeting "
3324,1994-08-16," Of course, we did have a period in the second half of 1988 and early 1989 in which short-term rates were moving up smartly and long-term rates were doing nothing "
3325,1994-08-16," First of all, I think the function of the Bluebook is somewhat different from that of the Greenbook, at least I conceive it as such, and that is to take the alternatives that I think the Committee will be seriously considering and say what we think the short- to intermediate-term consequences of choosing those alternatives will be in financial markets and to a lesser extent in the economy and give the Committee pros and cons on each of the alternatives The latter are then amplified in my briefing to give you some things to think about leading up to your decisions It is true that one alternative might be to take the funds rate up 100 basis points right now I didn't see that as a viable alternative I'm not sure, given the uncertainties, that even the Greenbook would be in favor of something that large right away, surprising the markets by as much as that But I can see your argument; it's like the argument of last February If you think you have to go a percentage point and you're reasonably confident in that, the longer you take to do it, the more uncertainty there could be in the market and the less likely you might be to get your outcome But it just didn't seem to us to be one of the alternatives that the Committee would be considering seriously "
3376,1994-09-27," Beyond the technical aspect, the issue I believe is what the market is building in for our prospective actions As new data have come in, market participants have built in a steeper trajectory of Federal Reserve tightening actions not only over the next few months, taking out the effects of ""for a time,"" but for the years beyond that Certainly, since early this year, we have seen huge moves in these intermediate-term forward rates because of the strength of the economy and changing market estimates of the likely Federal Reserve action needed to counter the inflation pressures   That is, we will say that the meeting is over and we don't have any further announcement, rather than that we didn't take any action   Right And the other point to remind the Committee, Mr Chairman, is that the asymmetry remains confidential until seven weeks from Friday "
3377,1994-09-27," You can see in the fed funds futures that we showed on the chart in the Bluebook that futures for the next few months went up because we tightened by more than people expected, but the rate then sort of flattened out and it was revised down for the months farther out Whether that was the result of the announcement or of the tightening action is a little hard to sort out I think it was also a bit of a knee-jerk reaction The last time the Fed announced something like this, in May, intermediate- and longer-term rates went down, and so as soon as markets saw something like that repeated, those rates started to decline Within three days the decline had been reversed, though the subsequent rise in rates didn't really occur until much later "
3378,1994-09-27, [Statement--See Appendix] 
3436,1994-11-15," The month-to-date effective rate is 481 percent, Mr Chairman   That 511 percent futures rate implies 534 percent for the remainder of the month "
3437,1994-11-15," The Richmond Fed did a study once that showed that, at least back in the 1970s, it looked like the responses were biased toward showing tightness Now, the psychology of everything has shifted so radically in the current cycle that I wonder whether that same bias is there   Right That was true back in the 1970s when the bias was found   We just don't know  -6-    11/15/94   In fact, you're right, President Jordan, in the sense that the M1 that we have been getting for the last two years or so has been pretty much on the M1 demand curve But that aggregate, of course, is very interest elastic We are predicting even slower growth next year than the 2 percent that we have for this year and another hefty increase in velocity I have to admit that our models suggest that if the same relationships hold, M1 might even drop next year consistent with the Greenbook GDP and interest rates We have projected essentially no growth We don't have the drop built in, but I couldn't rule out the possibility that we could get the Greenbook    11/15/94  GDP and a decline in M1 It would be right on the model and not a surprise   We do have opportunity costs narrowing over the latter half of next year, and we do have M2 picking up then We see those costs rising in the first half of the year when we expect very damped growth in M2 As you can see in your Bluebook, we have built in declines through March We do have a bit stronger growth built in for next year partly because some of the special factors, like the reduction of demand deposits stemming from the fade out of mortgage refinancings, will not be there So, we do have a little strengthening next year as things come a little more into line with our models In fact our models for M2, based on the same interest rates and the same incomes, predict much stronger growth in M2 next year than this year We trimmed it by a percentage point or two, so we only have 2 percent growth "
3438,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, as I think Governor Lindsey already remarked, the decision facing the Committee at this meeting would seem to be not whether to raise interest rates but by how much   The teakettle is probably a better metaphor than the automobile metaphor we so often use--steering back and forth and tapping on the brakes (Statement--See Appendix)   I think it could be ""increase significantly"" The announcement will make it very clear what the Committee has in mind  -43-    11/15/94 "
3491,1994-12-20, [Statement--See Appendix] 
3492,1994-12-20," Just for 1996  -36-    12/20/94   1995, excuse me "
3551,1995-01-31," Mr Chairman, I would like to put another point on the table That is, the Committee made several policy changes last spring that involved only open market operations and not discount rates In those cases, except for that first change, you simply announced the fact that the rate had changed without a full explanation at that time Explanations came later when the Committee's actions were taken in conjunction with changes in the discount rate This is really a question for the Committee Does the Committee wish to put out discount rate type announcements when discount rates are not changed or would it prefer to try to maintain this tiny distinction between what Governor LaWare used to call ""ringing the gong"" with the discount rate and a less open policy change involving only the federal funds rate?   So there would be no announcement unless the discount rate is changed?   A statement would say more than just ""we changed the interest rate"" but would give at least some boilerplate explanation as to why we changed   And so can the draft, lightly edited, that is sent to the members for review   The draft version for you to correct   One point of clarification, President Minehan For earlier meetings before the Committee started to review the transcripts--that is, those before January of last year--we are not permitted to throw away the raw transcripts   But for all the transcripts that the participants in the meeting have reviewed and made corrections to their statements where necessary, we can throw away both the tapes and the draft transcripts That would cover everything from the start of 1994 on   So far, pending this discussion, we have kept everything   Going forward, once the lightly edited transcript is finished, we would throw away the other transcript and the tape   I don't know what the timeframe will be It might take a couple of months before we get all the corrections and are able to incorporate them into the lightly edited transcript By the time we send the draft transcripts to you, you send them directly back to us, and we incorporate corrections, there may be a meeting that goes by   Yes   What we would destroy is the draft transcript that does not incorporate your edits We would then have a complete lightly edited transcript--   Yes, before release to the public The unredacted transcript would be turned over to the National Archives after 30 years   It is done when the meeting is over   And the tape is not on   Thank you, Mr Chairman First, I want to point out that the Secretariat is distributing or will distribute a memo sent to me from David Small that contains some of the information that Governor Yellen talked about this morning, including Taylor's rule It is for your information and gives everybody access to what she was looking at; she indicated that a number of people had asked her about this material Secondly, for the sake of expediting matters a little,  -102-    1/31-2/1/95  I will spare you some of the pearls of wisdom that I was going to talk about in terms of long-run scenarios They will probably still be good in July; I have saved them on my word processor [Laughter] I did want to say a few words about the fiscal policy situation--we have one scenario on that--before getting into the long-term ranges [Statement--see Appendix]   I do not know what the current situation is My guess is--and it is a wild guess--that if the warehousing got up to $20 billion, we could be in that situation   Brian Madigan said he thought the projection of free collateral was $8 to $10 billion over some indefinite period "
3552,1995-01-31," It is a 1-1/2 percentage point decline in the equilibrium real rate that came out of the model simulations I think to get a sense of the level you might look at the chart in the Bluebook that follows page 11 The end point there for the funds rate is 6-1/2 percent without fiscal contraction and 5 percent with the contraction That is your 1-1/2 percentage point decline in the real rate The inflation rate is about 3-1/2 percent, so I would say that without fiscal restraint the equilibrium real funds rate--this is cutting things much too fine--is approximately 3 percent "
3553,1995-01-31," I will be even briefer, Mr Chairman [Statement --see Appendix]   I agree that that chart is not long-dash line is the tighter alternative from the charts The short-dash line answers the question funds rate have to be with a lower NAIRU to get the outcome as from the tighter alternative? It is not  well labeled two previous What would the same inflation well labeled   A reasonable supposition "
3616,1995-03-28," President Jordan's,suggestion was to go from 4 to at least 6   When it comes to returning punts, I am no Brian Mitchell, I can tell you that! I would suggest that you let me poll  -2-    3/28/95  the rest of the Committee to see whether people really want to move from 7 to 10 on access to the Greenbook This is a pretty sensitive document; that is what we are talking about I don't know if Mike has any views on this   Yes, Part I of the Greenbook   Right The number having access is now 7 and President Hoenig's suggestion is to raise that to 10 I guess I'd like to think about it and see whether there is a ground swell from the rest of the Committee "
3617,1995-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman The first sentence of my briefing comes directly from Governor Blinder's comments I expected coffee in between! [Statement--see Appendix]   A credit variable or borrowing?   There are really two issues, Mr Chairman, and I would like to subdivide my response accordingly One is the issue of what Peter Fisher is looking at every day when he is adding or subtracting reserves We used to have a borrowing objective that was really a proxy for what was going on in the money markets It had a little more flexibility in it than direct funds targeting Now, Peter really is keyed to the funds rate When the Committee's target is at 6 percent he must react every time it is at 5-15/16--although that is not quite true I think going back to targeting borrowing by  -38-    3/28/95  depository institutions instead of the federal funds rate would be very difficult because the borrowing is very low, and the borrowing function itself has shifted around  The other question that perhaps you are raising is how the Committee keys its decisions about changing the federal funds rate target that it gives to Peter That is where the aggregates used to play a role in the sense that if they were running very high or very low relative to expectations or to the targets, they would weigh on the scale on the side of the Committee changing its instructions to the New York Fed We have noted in the Bluebook the last several times that M2 demand seems to have become a little more consistent with our old models, although the whole level of M2 demand has shifted down With regard to M2, even when it was on model, it only gave a broad longer-run perspective on policy I think it would be much too early to say that it was going to stay in its old configuration with interest rates or opportunity costs and nominal income M2 just keeps chugging along at 1 to 2 percent, and the model now is predicting 1 to 2 percent It may be that as soon as the model predicts something else, M2 will just keep chugging along! I think we need much more information that somehow the innovations in financial markets--the availability of mutual funds and what not--have not altered fundamental asset decisions by households  On the other variables, there may be a little information in the credit variables and even the broad money aggregates Certainly, we look at credit conditions in the sense of trying to see how willing banks and other lenders are to make loans This ought to show up in some of these flows So, in terms of broad flows of credit through the economy, there might be something there that would provide a little extra information--in addition to the kinds of information we already have on spending and nominal income--that would give us a little sense of what was going on in the financial markets But I would be very, very skeptical that we could ever put very much weight on those data compared to the other more direct measures of spending   No, you couldn't really There is no way of targeting those broad money or credit variables directly It would all be through interest rates and nominal income   The only thing we ever targeted directly, more or less, was M1 We did move reserves around to achieve M1 targets from 1979 to 1982   Yes, but the borrowing targets were really proxies for what was going on in reserve markets They were not being changed in direct response to, say, M1 or M2 I think M2 played a role in changing the borrowing target, as indeed we could see in the 1989 episode, but there wasn't a direct tie between the borrowing and M2  -39-    3/28/95   Obviously, it would depend on the Committee's outlook for inflation If the Committee were concerned that inflation was more likely to rise than to fall and it wanted to resist that rise, the asymmetry would tend to convey that If the Committee felt the risks on inflation were evenly balanced around the 3-1/4 percent core CPI projected in the Greenbook but did not like that outcome, then it seems to me the Committee also would want to tilt a little bit toward the tight side   No I think first of all that the growth of foreign holdings of our currency has distorted growth of the base substantially We have only the roughest notion of what proportion of our currency is held overseas and how it changes month to month We have a lot of work going on here at the Board trying to estimate that, and people are refining their estimates using all sorts of sophisticated econometric techniques--comparing seasonals and things like that But in the end, we are still only part way toward knowing what those holdings are  The other point I would make is that even ignoring the currency part, the reserves part of the base tracks Ml; that is what it is The velocity of M1 is extremely variable as we have seen The Committee itself abandoned M1 targeting back in the early 1980s because M1 became very interest elastic once NOW accounts were introduced and depositors began shifting funds between NOW accounts and time deposits That sort of thing also shows through to the base So, I would not put a lot of weight on movements in the base For the St Louis conference on operating procedures a couple of years ago that Al Broaddus was involved with, we cranked McCallum's rule for the base through the MPS model We found a distinct tendency for instrument instability McCallum has his base rule being adaptive to changes in velocity, but even with the adaptation, we had huge swings in interest rates and no clear gain over looking at nominal income or other variables directly We do have some work continuing on this and hopefully we can circulate it to the Committee pretty soon   I think they would be more appropriate now, particularly if in order to make 50 basis point moves, the Committee felt it had to wait for more information I thought the lesson of my sermon was that it is better to be a little flexible, and maybe even have to reverse after going in one direction or another, than to get stuck on a particular rate that gets harder to change the longer the Committee is stuck on it One can see a little of this in Germany and Japan right now, I think   Sure, but they would be announced   In fact, I saw a comment recently that suggested it might be wise, if the Fed is going to tighten, to do it with the funds rate rather than the discount rate   I think it was in one of the incoming Reserve Bank letters on the discount rate That would allow the spread to widen and make it easier to reverse, because if the Committee started to reverse in tentative steps, the discount rate would not have to be cut Now that both discount rate changes and funds rate changes are announced, the difference between them has certainly narrowed And since the Committee is going to announce any funds rate change, it would need to decide whether there is to be any distinction in the type of announcement it would make between a plain open market operations change and such a change accompanied by a discount rate change "
3670,1995-05-23, You lose a lot of money! [Laughter]   [Statement--see Appendix] 
3671,1995-05-23," I was just going to say, building on what you said, Mr Chairman, that in the long-run scenario in the last Bluebook, as Mike pointed out, the real funds rate was coming down to stabilize not prices but the inflation rate One of the factors making rate declines necessary was that the impulse from the decline in the exchange rate was wearing off over time So you are absolutely correct I think one has to define neutrality relative to what one expects to happen to exchange rates as well "
3672,1995-05-23," I think it is the implicit deflator   I would suppose so   If you use the implicit deflator in his rule, you come out with a federal funds rate around 4-1/4 percent now If you use the CPI rather than the implicit deflator, you are around 5-3/4 percent   But using the CPI in the equation for earlier years does not track Committee actions as well as using the deflator In particular, by persisting at a higher level through the 1991-1993 period, the CPI predicts a much higher federal funds rate than the Committee actually adopted   Except that, Governor Blinder, this rule was not estimated   He just did something that seemed to make sense and things fell out But you are right, if you were to estimate it, obviously it would come out somewhat differently "
3729,1995-07-05," It's published on the weekly H41 statement; I don't know whether there is a separate internal notification There    7/5-6/95  already are $8 billion of special drawing rights outstanding in addition to the $11 billion of gold stock   And then we sell government securities, as they draw down the balance   The current SDRs are distributed throughout the System the way every other asset is   It could be the inter-District settlement account; Cathy says it is But the other point, Mr Chairman, is that that deposit never shows up The Treasury knows in advance that it is going to get $2 billion It doesn't call $2 billion of funds in from the commercial banks So, the Treasury deposit is $5 billion or $7 billion or whatever it is the Treasury is targeting that day   Right Then the Treasury doesn't call in the funds The Treasury's account--   On the same day   Maybe   That other asset is Treasury securities tHat Peter sells to offset the increase in SDRs   And it happens the same day The Treasury's balance at the Federal Reserve never changes, whether the SDRs are issued or not They target that at a given number; they know in advance what it is They don't raise cash; they don't sell bills   Right   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   The trend in velocity growth?   The whole level of M2 velocity has shifted up by, I think, about 15 percent; M2 is about 15 percent lower than we would have thought using old standards There is some evidence that the growth rate relationships among M2, nominal income, and opportunity costs have come back roughly on track in the last two years or so If that were the case and if we had any confidence that it would persist, we might be able to imagine a situation in which the growth rate of M2 demand was back on track and velocity then would fluctuate around its current level rather than around the lower old level That is a distinct possibility, but the point I was trying to make in my briefing is that, given our uncertainty about these relationships, I think it is a little early to pronounce M2 velocity back on track   Approximately, yes Now, we have had more M2 growth in the second quarter--by several percentage points--than this model was predicting In growth rate terms, the model was right on for 1994 I think what happened in the second quarter of this year was that M2 was reacting to the decline in intermediate- and long-term rates, whereas the model uses the bill rate to proxy for alternative investments So, it didn't capture those declines Going forward, whether this old standard model--it is now nearly ten years old--will capture the dynamics will depend in part, I think, on whether short- and long-term rates move together in their traditional cyclical relationship   That would give you a midpoint of 3 percent The Committee has looked at that as providing some sort of benchmark for what it might expect from M2 when reasonable price stability had been reached   For next year the models actually see growth at the upper end of that range--perhaps consistent with what you are saying--in the 4 to 5 percent area, approximately   No, I don't have enough confidence In the past, M3 growth has tended to run approximately a percentage point above that of M2, so a 2 to 6 percent range for M3 would not seem to be a    7/5-6/95  bad alignment But the past experience applies to a period in which depositories were capturing an increasing share of credit extensions If your best guess were that their share of credit flows would remain about constant, then perhaps the M3 range ought to be about equal to the M2 range, assuming that depositories rely on retail and wholesale deposits in roughly the same proportions So, it is hard to know It really depends on the role depositories will play in the financial system To repeat the earlier point, an M3 range of 2 to 6 percent is roughly consistent with a range of 1 to 5 percent for M2 in terms of historical relationships Whether it would be consistent going forward is a much harder question   I think you are right, Governor Yellen, because for a number of years the Committee really has not been taking these aggregates seriously as guides to policy, and as a result it has not been moving the ranges around to make them consistent with its outlook Part of the problem is that it is very hard ex ante to know what those ranges ought to be We may now have a little more confidence about that, but even relative to the staff's nominal GDP forecast, which is 4-1/2 percent for 1996, the 1 to 5 percent range for M2 is obviously low And if I took the Committee's nominal GDP, which is higher than the staff forecast--and especially if I assumed that interest rates would have to be lower to get that nominal GDP--we might have a decline in velocity That is, we might need even more M2 as market rates went down I have not run the exercise, but I would guess that we would be talking about an M2 projection of 5 percent or even a little over 5 percent to be entirely consistent with the Committee's nominal GDP forecast The other way to work this, which is more or less what the Committee has done over the last few years, is to say that we see this range as something that is out there to provide a benchmark in the future, and we are not paying much attention to this now--and let it go at that   There is a demand shock built into the baseline, which is the fiscal restraint needed to balance the budget by the year 2002 That is already in there, so you would not add more fiscal restraint on top of that unless you thought even greater fiscal restraint would be forthcoming One could also imagine a situation in which the path of fiscal policy is a little more front-loaded than the staff is assuming and therefore the restraint happens sooner rather than later As Mike noted yesterday, the assumptions for 1995 and 1996 on fiscal policy lie somewhere between those of the President and the Republicans So, if you thought about a situation where the Republicans somehow prevailed on the stance of fiscal policy, that also would be a demand shock--at least over the next few years   What we used was a saving rate shock, but I believe we noted that you could think of it also as a situation in which we had more fiscal restraint than we were expecting   In terms of a trend interest rate?    7/5-6/95   I'm not sure it is easier! Of course, the staff has 4-1/2 percent M2 growth projected for 1996 with the interest rates of the Greenbook, and that means a gentle decline in interest rates toward the middle of 1996 If I used the interest rates of the tighter scenario--that is, the 75 basis point increase--that gets the projection for M2 down to 3-1/2 percent   It would require slightly more tightening than the tighter forecast The tighter forecast has M2 growth of 3-1/2 percent; to make the 3 percent you would need slightly higher interest rates, perhaps avoiding the drop in interest rates in the second half of 1996 or you might have to raise rates a bit and keep them up I think the tighter scenario gives you a baseline to think about that   Your letter has not been sent yet, Mr Chairman   I wanted to talk to them about it before sending the letter over   We have tried to establish a regular time so that people, not knowing exactly when it would come out, would not be hovering over the Telerate machines and reading great amounts of meaning into the timing of the release, how long you argued about policy, or whatever So, we thought it was better to establish a routine time rather than making it 155 pm after one meeting and 235 pm after the next That was the reason "
3730,1995-07-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Right, or A-minus I don't know how you want to characterize that "
3789,1995-08-22, More investment in producers durable equipment [Laughter] 
3790,1995-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman As it turns out, my comments begin where the last two commentors left off I'll be organizing my comments this morning around the real federal funds rate [Statement--see Appendix]   First of all, I don't know what the overnight inflation expectation is To make a guess about inflation over the short run, it's pretty reasonable to assume that people would look at inflation in the recent past, so we use a one-year backward-looking inflation measure It does not give a significantly different result from the Philadelphia Fed's one-year ahead inflation measure We don't have any shorter measure of inflation expectations I do think that if folks are trying to guess at what inflation is going to be over the next few months, those guesses are not all that different from their guesses about inflation over the next year or what inflation was over the last year But I'd be the first to admit that our measures of expectations are highly imperfect I took a little comfort from the fact that both the backward-looking and the forward- looking measures gave roughly the same answers, though I think the forward-looking measures are--   A full percentage point? I guess if you use the three-month moving average   I would say 2-3/4 percent if I were going to guess This has 31 percent built in I am using the last 12 months   Yes   That's closer to a 2-1/2 percent rate, so it would be about 1/2 point perhaps   The premise of the question is that somehow on a given day you knew the size of the shock and it was huge relative to GDP So there was no uncertainty going forward about how long the shock would persist and what its size would be   My first thought is that if the issue is resolved, you know what the resolution is and where things are going, and everybody else knows--this isn't some inside information the Fed has-- I don't know why you wouldn't reduce your rates right away rather than gradually I'm not sure I see the advantage of gradualism in the case of an identified shock whose effects I am quite confident that I know, provided that the rest of the world sees the situation the same way so they don't misinterpret your policy actions Governor Blinder was shaking his head ""no""   If I knew now that this was going to happen--is that the question?   If I knew what was going to happen but the markets didn't?   That's the key because, as I think Mr Simpson demonstrated last time, if the markets know what will happen they will take bond yields down and that acts basically as an automatic stabilizer It doesn't matter quite so much how the Fed validates it Eventually you have to validate it, but the timing of our moves is not so important If you knew today that there was going to be a major contraction beginning on November 7th, you would have to proceed somewhat gingerly because there would be a problem if the markets didn't know it They wouldn't know how to interpret what you were doing even if you stated what you were doing If they didn't believe you, there could be a potentially adverse effect on inflation expectations or a lot of confusion and volatility in the markets So, you have set up a very difficult problem where the central bank does have inside information, while the rest of the economy doesn't have it  -31-    8/22/95  and might or might not believe the central bank if it provided that inside information So, I think you would have to proceed very cautiously in that kind of situation   I would say, President Broaddus, that I see it as much more of a mixture, perhaps with a little more emphasis on the real rates but not exclusively the real rates That is, I think the information that hit us and the market over the intermeeting period was that real growth was stronger at those old interest rates than we had been expecting In classroom jargon, the IS curve was out a bit further than we thought That to me would suggest that in fact real interest rates need to be higher over the business cycle to keep the economy at its potential If you look at the pattern of forward rates, a lot of the bulge in forward rates over the intermeeting period is at business cycle frequencies of three, four, five years At the same time, I think we probably can never settle this because we don't have inflation-indexed bonds Given that the economy was stronger, I think it's logical that inflation expectations might have been revised up at least a little, but I would put much more emphasis on the real side than on inflation expectations   I don't think I can help your headache [Laughter] I can try to explain what I was thinking about I think that the Federal Reserve can affect real rates by changing the federal funds rate, real and nominal, since the two are about the same because inflation expectations don't change in the near term I think expectations about what the Fed will do with interest rates do have an effect on real rates, at least through the intermediate part of the term structure I believe that's the primary channel of Federal Reserve policy to the economy In 1979, 1980, 1981 this institution raised real rates to very, very high levels and had a major effect on economic activity Those real rates rose at short- and long-term maturities in order to put slack in the economy and reduce inflation So, I think the Federal Reserve can affect real rates, at least over a business cycle I agree that in the long run productivity and thrift determine the long-run real interest rate The premise of our meeting here and making policy changes is that in the short run we can affect real rates and lean against business cycles Perhaps we don't do a perfect job all the time, but I think the evidence of the last 15 years shows that we have done a pretty good job on at least a few occasions in smoothing through these cycles by changing real rates  With regard to alternative A, I believe that if you were to lower the nominal funds rate, you would have an effect on real interest rates at least through the intermediate-maturity spectrum People would change their idea of what this Committee was going to do with interest rates What would happen to nominal rates is a bigger question and one that we debated amongst ourselves in writing that particular paragraph That is, if our policy was not credible, if people thought that lowering these interest rates would simply provoke more inflation, then nominal intermediate- and long-term rates might very well do nothing, in which case the inflation expectations part would rise even though the real rate was lower, or these nominal rates might even rise My view in the end was that the FOMC has a lot of credibility and that if the Committee lowered rates and in particular if you said that you lowered rates because you had an optimistic view on inflation, that would carry some weight in the market at least for a while If I remember the paragraph, it would only be if the incoming data failed to confirm the Committee's expectations that rates would then back up But I agree it's entirely a guess as to where inflation expectations will come out if you do that   Yes, but there are two differences One is the taxation Treasury bills aren't subject to state income tax People often use a New York resident as the marginal holder, so it's a nontrivial tax rate like 10 percent The second point is that one is the obligation of someone who hasn't defaulted--at least until a few weeks from now--and the other is a private rate There is a different risk premium   Fed funds rates are higher than bill rates because banks are riskier than the government   That sounds too high to me as well Dave is saying 50 basis points In the Financial Indicators package there is a one-year real funds rate; I don't know whether that's helpful in terms of the point you are getting at   Yes The difference is about 30 basis points now and it looks like the average may be about 50 to 75 basis points It was low for a long time   Treasury bills?   I will have it plotted and distributed to the Committee "
3846,1995-09-26," If the Board wanted to go to a system of low, broadly based reserve requirements, that would require legislative changes It is one of the options we are looking at Obviously, if you wanted to pay interest on reserves, that would require legislative changes It may be a little late for that Legislative changes also would be required for a system under which the Federal Reserve might pay a low interest rate on excess reserves to put a floor on the federal funds rate and impose a Lombard rate or something like that to provide a ceiling We are beginning to look at a broad range of alternatives I think the issue has caught up with us a little faster than we thought it was going to a month or two ago   At this point I tend toward the latter view If we were able to pay a market rate of interest on reserves, that would remove the incentive for sweeps In that event, the current sweep arrangements might be undone, but it would be very hard to get the legislative authority in the current budget environment The other approaches we are looking at would not remove the reserve requirement tax or the incentive to reduce required reserves   Mr Chairman, I think that Governor Lindsey raised an important point in his last comments on the issue of flexibility When Don Winn and I have talked to Hill staffers and asked them about this issue, one of the major points they make is that the Fed is defining price stability and defining the conditions under which you are getting there Certainly, they would expect you to tell them if there is an adverse supply shock, so that getting there might be delayed They viewed the provisions cited by Governor Lindsey as affording us flexibility When I asked about the sentence, ""the Committee shall take into account the potential short-term effects"" and what it was meant to apply to, I was told that it was pretty much deliberately ambiguous They were trying to cut between certain factions that they were dealing with They could see that the literal wording did not apply just to the transition period, but the sentence still could be read as applying to the transition period because of where it was in the bill I think their view was that the Federal Reserve would have quite a bit of flexibility under this legislation, although they admitted that wasn't unambiguous "
3847,1995-09-26," [Statement--see Appendix]   With regard to the first question, President Melzer, our Legal Division has written a number of letters to institutions that have inquired The letters lay out the criteria for a sweep arrangement that conforms with our Regulation D My understanding from Reserve Banks is that many of the inquiring banks already have in hand copies of the letters that the Board's Legal Division has sent to other banks So, there are guidelines out there from our Legal Division There has been an attempt to circumvent the regulation with sweeps that are entirely sleight of hand bookkeeping A bank has to have a real sweep account I don't know all the legal ins and outs; we could explore that later if you wanted to  With regard to the second issue, we are exploring that I agree with you that it would be good to get these numbers out somehow, but there are two difficulties There is the one you mentioned if we publish a monthly series, in some earlier months and even in some earlier quarters only one bank or two banks had introduced such accounts Publication would give information to their competitors, and we try to avoid that That has not been true in the last few months when many banks have introduced sweep accounts, but that would not be the case for the early part of the series I think there may be ways we can publish the series using quarterly or semi-annual data at first or something of that sort, and we are looking at that We intend to publish The second difficulty is one of interpretation All we know are the initial impacts of these sweeps; that is what we get through your data departments, your accounting people, and our edit checks We don't know what happens subsequently, and I think we have to be very careful in looking at these numbers to resist simply adding them back to M1 and assuming that we are getting what M1 would have been otherwise or what the monetary base would have been otherwise When we do put the series out, I think we need to take a  -33-    9/26/95  lot of care in how it is put out and hopefully lead people away from misinterpreting what they have They need to understand the very limited nature of the data that we have, but we are looking at ways to publish them   We have given some thought to that as well   The currency flows to foreign countries have slowed substantially We have a lot of data on the flows, but we can only guess at the total The shipments data we get through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggest that for the last several months the amount of currency outside the country has been fairly steady, and in the last few months it may actually have gone down with net shipments back to the United States Now, it is very hard to figure out what is going on One story, as Ted just mentioned, is that the situation in Russia has stabilized to a certain extent It is hard to see that in the direct shipments to Russia, but a lot of currency gets to Russia through Switzerland and other countries, and we have seen a slowdown there The other area where we have seen a slowdown, and perhaps I should turn to Ted and Peter on this, is in lower shipments to, or even a reflow of shipments from, Latin America For a while we thought we had an Argentina story--that is, that there were huge volumes of shipments early in the year, partly after the financial crisis in Mexico, in preparation for something awful that would happen in Argentina The something awful never happened and some of that currency came back But I think the reflows have been wider than just those from Argentina; we are getting some shipments  -34-    9/26/95  back from the rest of Latin America In summary, I think an important part of this currency story has been the growth in shipments abroad early in the year--a lot of which were to Latin America and shipments destined ultimately to Russia--and the slowing since then "
3907,1995-11-15," The Committee needs to ratify the Mexican swap renewal   The market has built in a spike of about 1 or 2 percentage points as best we can guess We have to make an assumption about what the market is thinking the federal funds rate will be and then subtract that to estimate the spike   Yes If anything it may be a little less    11/15/95   Right It's a highly conditional forecast But, if anything, it appears that the markets are expecting slightly less of a spike at year-end this year than they have at this point in recent years   Correct Reserve Bank and Board staff have been talking to Treasury people about procedures to follow to avoid the concern that President Broaddus just expressed, so that wires wouldn't be sent if funds were not going to be available We want to ensure that Treasury staff sending those wires understand that and simply would not send them Those are among the procedures that have been under discussion between the technical staffs at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve The Treasury is fully aware of the position that Chairman Greenspan just stated--that we cannot lend to them directly If they got into an overdraft position, it would have to be entirely inadvertent Therefore, in their financing operations, they have been talking about keeping their cash balance fairly high to avoid the possibility that funds would clear that would put them in overdraft inadvertently   That is, a special open market operation and not the normal course of business "
3908,1995-11-15," Mr Chairman, may I interrupt a second? Secretary Rubin announced a little less than a half hour ago that he is disinvesting trust funds, in particular the Civil Service Retirement  -28-    11/15/95  Fund as well as the G-fund, by enough to permit the Treasury to raise some $60 billion in the market This now gets them up to the last business day of December   I believe he said the $60 billion would get the Treasury through December 30 He did it by using the $21-1/2 billion in the G-fund as everybody expected But apparently he must have made a finding that this crisis, or this debt limitation problem, could go on long enough to enable him to disinvest about $39 billion of the Civil Service retirement fund This suggests that he found it might go for about a year or so   In the last few days, attention appears to have shifted to the appropriations process and the debt ceiling issue has come off the table There was some presumption that the Secretary had enough tricks in his bag to keep it off the table for a while "
3909,1995-11-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referencing, by the way, the last chart in the Financial Indicators package If you don't have that with you, I think Carol Low has some extras I would like to begin by discussing a new chart that appears at the end of that package and use that as a transition into a discussion of the current stance of policy [Statement--see Appendix]   It doesn't look very good, but I don't know what ""very good"" means That is, the Taylor rule does not track what actually happened, particularly over the previous seven or eight years in the Volcker era Real funds rates were considerably higher than the Taylor chart would have suggested   Perhaps Governor Yellen or Governor Blinder will remember better than I, but it seems to me that the federal funds rates were too low That would confirm the notion that policy was easier than it should have been to achieve price stability Do you remember?   No, it doesn't do a very good job   Yes I think it matters a lot over what period one is estimating it Of course, I think John picked those in part out of some experience with large-scale modeling exercises, such as were carried out under the aegis of the Brookings Conference a couple of years ago I think they also were picked because they looked reasonable The bottom panel is a statistical exercise and that does show pretty high weights on the unemployment gap, the resource gap--   Some of these estimates don't show the FOMC paying much attention to inflation   It's fitted to be a close representation of what we did   Sure   Right   Yes, although I would have to think about that a little The fact that everything goes to the output gap suggests that you are not particularly sensitive to what the inflation rate is when you close the gap   You need something on that inflation target to provide you with a nominal anchor it seems to me   Yes I am not sure what John Judd did at the San Francisco Bank, but when we fit this the constant actually embodies both the equilibrium real rate and the Committee's inflation target So, you have to make an assumption about one to separate out the other "
3960,1995-12-19," There was more news on the budget and, as I understand it, more pessimism about the prospects for an agreement   It was down about 1/2 point   [Statement--see Appendix] "
3961,1995-12-19," I think under those circumstances it would be below where it is now You are talking about 2 percentage points less inflation than now, 1 percent instead of 3 percent So, as a first approximation, I would shave 2 percentage points off the nominal funds rate just to keep the real funds rate from rising, since inflation is that much lower As to what real funds rate is consistent with the economy growing at its potential, which is the other part of your question, I think that is really difficult to say We have discussed that a couple of times over the last six months You can see that so- called equilibrium funds rate bouncing around quite a bit in any model simulation or any look at how the real funds rate has behaved over  -29-    12/19/95  time relative to how the economy has behaved We ran for much of the 1980s, certainly the middle part of the 1980s, with nominal interest rates pretty consistently above the growth of nominal GDP, though not every year That pattern was consistent with a fairly vigorously growing economy and steady inflation in the 4 to 5 percent range Now, that was associated with some fiscal stimulus, so I think we had a higher equilibrium funds rate in that period Most people think that the equilibrium funds rate is probably down relative to what it might have been in the 1980s, but how far down is very hard to say The structure of the economy and the structure of financial markets have changed markedly since the 1950s and the 1960s We don't have Reg Q, for example, to cut off spending when market rates get high It is quite conceivable to me that the long-run equilibrium real interest rate at steady inflation right now would be higher than it was back then One could perhaps run with nominal interest rates above nominal GDP for awhile; it would depend on the stance of fiscal policy and the other things that affect the economy I don't think there is a simple mapping of nominal GDP growth and nominal interest rates, although there is a relationship   What is the transition mechanism for getting inflation down?   I think there are two points One would be that slack occurs that you had not anticipated, perhaps because potential is higher than you thought or there is a shortfall in demand you had not anticipated When that occurs, you are going to have a little slack in the economy You react to get rid of that slack, but meanwhile you are running below potential and that would put downward pressure on inflation I think the opportunistic strategy here is to take that downward pressure Don't try to push the economy back above potential to make up for the output that you have lost in the meantime So that's one source Another source would be that inflation expectations have come down--something that, as I hear it, some of the people around the table think has happened recently If inflation expectations have come down, that would put some downward pressure on the inflation process As Governor Yellen mentioned in her remarks, if they truly have come down and particularly if they are in the process of declining further, that would enable you to hold the economy at potential and have inflation come down further Now, whether you could logically count on much of this sort of immaculate conception of a decline in inflation expectations--if you'll pardon the expression--while holding the economy at potential is difficult to say But that would be the other way it could happen You are right, President Jordan, in suggesting that the economy is constantly being  -30-    12/19/95  hit by shocks, and it is not a question of deliberately putting slack in the economy to bring inflation down It is a question of taking those shocks, whether they are on inflation expectations, demand, supply, or whatnot, and using them to bring inflation down Over time, if you react asymmetrically to shocks, strongly to upward shocks and less strongly to downward shocks, the inflation rate will work its way lower   I am not sitting in moral judgment here I think it is a question of your ultimate goal and the gains you think you are getting from your ultimate goal--that is, price stability--and the losses you are willing to incur to get there If you really believe that 1 percent inflation would produce over time a lot higher productivity, a lot higher output, a lot more benefit to the economy than 3 percent inflation, then perhaps deliberately giving up short- run output gains would be warranted to allow you to get to 1 percent inflation faster If you are somewhat uncertain about the net gains of going from 3 percent to 1 percent inflation, it seems to me that you are potentially maximizing society's welfare by going there slowly and taking advantage of the opportunities of getting there without necessarily punishing the body economic   That's a good point A lot of models put in utility functions that penalize large misses from output more than small misses from output On the other hand, if you think that the world is pretty linear and symmetric, in the end it's not so clear I think it's an open question if you really want to get there, whether going there slowly results in higher utility for society than going there quickly, assuming there is a lot to be gained when you get there You are giving up years at price stability by going there slowly   I would interpret it under 3bi in my outline, that is, leaning hard against potential increases in inflation As you saw inflation developing, you moved vigorously against it So, I think it's perfectly consistent with the opportunistic strategy Some of this may be a bit endogenous since the people who practice that policy are defining the opportunistic strategy But as I defined it-- we are listening to you folks--I think that is perfectly consistent with an opportunistic strategy lean hard against shocks in one direction, take a more measured approach to shocks in another direction   I think that from the perspective of the real world situation of the last six months, it is a little fuzzier than it seems in these boxes For one thing, I think the Committee anticipated a drop in inflation and inflation expectations when it cut the funds rate in July That's why you did it Inflation had come up, and you could see that that rise wasn't permanent It was going to come down, and you expected it to come down If you had not expected it to come down, you would not have cut the funds rate at that time What we really need to know is what you thought inflation would be when you cut that rate Judging from the central tendencies in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, you thought inflation would be about a quarter point higher than it seems to be turning out for 1995 Whether that's what the market expected and how your expectations compared to that is not clear But you have had a favorable inflation surprise relative to your own expectations as given in the Humphrey- Hawkins report I just don't think it's a full half point because some of that is the market catching up with what FOMC members expected to happen The other point, of course, is that leaving real rates unchanged assumes that the intended real rate was the right real rate That's the other judgment you have to make In fact, you have had a lot more growth in the second half of the year than you anticipated in the Humphrey-Hawkins report   I am not sure I followed you entirely, but there are a couple of points Part of this is the asymmetry of the opportunistic strategy Several types of supply shocks are possible, and I think that is a complication as well If you are looking at the middle panel here with a positive supply shock, cutting nominal rates enough to keep real rates unchanged is what keeps you at potential, since under the opportunistic strategy the Committee is not seeking to drive the economy below potential or have it above potential On the other side, if you have a negative kind of supply shock, you might want to drive real rates higher to lean against that supply shock That was the example in 3bi of my outline where policy attempts to hold the line against increases in inflation by accepting output losses in the event of adverse supply developments So, it seems to me that if you had an adverse supply shock, you would want to raise nominal rates perhaps by even more than the increase in inflation expectations in order to raise real rates This presumes that you thought the supply shock was feeding through to inflation expectations, and you wanted to respond so that you wouldn't end up with a higher inflation rate at the end of the day than when you started   Okay   I thought in effect that's what I had in the lower row here One way to think about this--the way I thought about it as I was writing it--was that the upper row had the Greenbook assumption and the equilibrium real rate approximately where it is now The lower row had some words like this--   That's exactly what I had in mind I was not taking a stand since I had two alternatives here, but I think those notions of the real rate were behind these alternatives I want to go to one other comment that you made because I think it raises an interesting issue that I tried to point out as we were going through this The question of why you take disinflation but you don't seek disinflation does rest on these points about the utility of less inflation and how much is gained or lost by different actions relating to the level of inflation versus a change in inflation or the level of output versus movement of output away from potential I think these are the sorts of things we need to think more about to write down a model in which we really can be confident I agree that my colleagues have written down an interesting model that produces this result, but it is that issue that I think is the most difficult to confront when you are talking about the opportunistic strategy I think we talked about this at the September meeting If the Mack bill ever becomes law, the Committee will need to confront these issues Why are you doing this deliberately? Why are you not doing this deliberately? Why do you have the opportunistic approach? Is it worth going to price stability? Why not get there? This question of justifying this opportunistic strategy in a fundamental underlying sense of society's utility will, I think, be very much on the table if we have to confront that particular bill   I don't think the Committee would want to cut rates in that case  SPEAKER(?) No, a rise in rates "
4013,1996-01-30," You are right, President Melzer They did accelerate in January and also in December We keep projecting that the adoption of sweep accounts will simmer down a little, and then another large bank or large bank holding company chain decides to adopt them and the reserves effect grows even faster I should note that the banks compensate not so much by holding excess reserves, although that may happen in the short run as they adjust, but by    1/30-31/96  holding clearing balances that they can use to pay for services But that has been a small fraction of the reduction in required reserves, I think on the order of about 15 percent on average So, the total required reserve balances do continue to drop I think our projection indicates that once we got through this seasonal low, the rise in the seasonal demand for reserves would offset this trend, and we would be okay for a while What will happen a year from now is another question   Although I have read it, I didn't feel qualified to evaluate it It rested very heavily on the tax system and the interaction of inflation with the way capital income is taxed and the resulting distortions to asset accumulation and savings by households through this It was a study that was looking at welfare losses characterized by some sort of four-sided figures, trapezoids or something   Right, under the curve There were a couple of comments at the conference, as I think I indicated in my notes One of them was by somebody who approached the subject in an entirely different way, with a general equilibrium model, and he found something that was roughly comparable to Feldstein's findings But that was very theoretical and abstract Some other people had doubts about the extent of the welfare findings One commentator, Ben Friedman, noted that the findings of most of the loss of welfare depended on the interest elasticity of saving by households--that is, that the after-tax rate of return really did affect how they accumulated assets As you know, that is an open question Judging from what I heard at the conference--Larry Lindsey and Mike Moskow were there as well and I don't know whether they would disagree--it was a suggestive approach but not definitive   I think that's true in concept The problem, as President Stern and others have noted, is finding it in the real world That is, when we look at sacrifice ratios across countries that have inflation targets and others that don't, we can't find an improvement there Now, there are a lot of other things going on in those countries and that doesn't mean that there would not be some improvement in the United States, but researchers also had trouble finding improvements in sacrifice ratios going from the 1970s to the 1980s after the huge disinflation we had and the change in the makeup of the Committee and the objectives of the Committee So, I agree with the concept, Governor Lindsey It ought to be there, but it's very hard to find in the data either across time in the United States or across countries   It might be asymmetric  -49-    1/30-31/96   Mr Chairman, a reminder Under our usual procedures our announcement will be made at approximately 215 pm Particularly since there will be a luncheon before then, we have to be very careful not to allow any inadvertent word of today's policy decision to get out before the announcement Peter Fisher pointed out to me that last time there was a story on the tape by one of our well- known Fed watchers that suggested that he might have known something It was ambiguous as to whether he did, but we have to be extremely careful that knowledge of this decision stays with the people in this room until 215 pm   215 pm  -63-    1/30-31/96   The Committee would need to make some changes I think in the past the Committee has wondered whether it wanted to have the market sitting there for hours wondering exactly what time the Committee meeting would be over and speculating, in the event of a delayed release, whether something unusual might be going on There was some merit in regularizing the time of the release The Committee could change that "
4014,1996-01-30," To accompany my briefing, I have prepared the material in front of you called ""FOMC Monetary Policy Briefing"" [Statement--see Appendix]   There is a footnote in the Bluebook that says that going from a deficit of about 2 percent of GDP, which is approximately  -50-    1/30-31/96  where we are, to a balanced budget over seven years would produce a change of about 1 percentage point in the equilibrium rate in our model Now, that number should be viewed with a huge standard error around it, but that is the order of magnitude   I am not sure, President Parry I agree that at least in concept putting out a mathematically precise rule would be clearer than something as vague as an opportunistic strategy But I think that in practice the market has come to understand, as a few members such as President Boehne already have said today, that the Committee has very strongly resisted increases in inflation The Committee's actions in 1994 were very helpful in that regard I think the market also believes that the Committee has its eye on a price stability objective over the long run Market participants do not, as President Melzer pointed out, anticipate that the Committee will deliberately take action to reduce the inflation rate below 3 percent But I think they actually have developed a rather good understanding of the Committee's intentions and operations by looking at its actions in various contexts You would have to judge whether acting in the way you think is best as circumstances change over time is better for the economy than putting out some rule that might describe your actions over some period of time I would think that inevitably you would have to violate that rule sometimes   For the same set of shocks hitting the economy, the output loss relative to no disinflation is the same   In a linear world that would be correct, and that is true in this model I don't think the Committee has behaved that way, and many models suggest that the output loss is not totally linear In such models, large misses and large variations in output are weighted relatively more heavily than small variations in output But it is an open question whether minimizing variations in output around the mean, even with the same integral of output losses, is better than having a few big recessions to get to price stability That is one of the questions that the Committee would need to consider if it were thinking about adopting a time frame for getting to price  -51-    1/30-31/96  stability Should you go there quickly or should you go there slowly? A lot of people think slow is better than fast, but there may be no way to prove that--or at least it would be very hard to prove one way or another   Right It is a question of how the economy adapts and how the institutions in the economy adapt I think there are reasons to believe that going to price stability slowly and allowing institutions to adapt to lower and lower inflation rates would remove some of the frictions one might worry about, say, in the financial sector Reality is much more complicated than the models say I agree with you that these models are very linear, and fast or slow, deliberate or opportunistic will give you the same integral of loss The output loss of eight percentage points would be the same in the model, but I suspect that it's quite different in real life   I think we have done that before when this situation has arisen "
4070,1996-03-26," We will have a race between my briefing and the setup for the coffee I'll talk fast and maybe I can win! As background for your policy discussion, I thought it might be useful to take a closer look at a key development in financial markets over the intermeeting period, the rise in long-term interest rates that a number of you have mentioned [Statement--see Appendix] "
4117,1996-05-21," I was thinking about the upcoming July meeting and recalling the Committee's discussion in February about paying a little more attention to its long-run objectives, in particular its inflation objectives Taking into account speeches such as the one that Vice Chairman McDonough made on this subject, it struck me that it might be useful for the Committee members to discuss where they expected to be in 2-1/2 or 3 years in terms of those objectives That would be in addition to the usual discussion leading to the selection of monetary aggregate ranges that the Committee is still required to establish under the law The discussion might surface some of the pros and cons of this longer-run look at policy So my proposal, Mr Chairman, was that Committee members, in addition to the usual 1996-1997 forecasts that they would turn in for inclusion in the Humphrey-Hawkins report and that you would discuss in your testimony, also submit 1998 forecasts of real growth and inflation The purpose would not be to publish those additional forecasts, but rather to help structure the Committee's discussion The other point I tried to make is that, if the Committee members decided to go ahead with this, it would seem to me that the 1998 forecasts would incorporate what the individual members thought ought to occur They would be more in the nature of goals necessarily than forecasts and would be based on the monetary policy that the members as individuals would pursue if they did not have to take account of their colleagues around the table   Well, the members have to submit 1996 and 1997 forecasts in July 1996   That has always been an ambiguous issue and one that I think has produced some confusion in the past when the Committee has discussed an extension of its projections When you are asked for your 1996 and 1997 forecasts, you are asked to make your own assumptions about monetary policy  -40-    5/21/96   No, we have asked the members to base their projections on what they think an optimal policy should be   When you are projecting 1996 and 1997, obviously much of what is going to happen, even if you were to run your optimal monetary policy, has already been ""baked in the cake,"" given the ongoing trends in the economy It seems to me that by the time you get to 1998, you have had enough time to adjust your individual monetary policies to look at 1998 as a goal   Pretty much   Two points, President Jordan First, I think I tried to emphasize in my earlier comments that your 1998 forecasts or goals would not be published for at least five years, unless you decided otherwise Secondly, I think it might be useful if you chose to submit written notes to explain how you arrived at a particular configuration of GDP and inflation The staff would then be more than happy to try to present a fuller explanation of where the goals came from  -42-    5/21/96   Mr Chairman, we were hoping even before we had this discussion that we would perhaps have time at the July meeting-- probably at the end of the meeting--to discuss the swaps issue, which we have kept pushing off Hopefully, we will have a full Board by then, but who knows We were thinking of starting that meeting earlier, say, at 100 pm on July 2 Perhaps we could start the meeting with lunch Would that be-- "
4118,1996-05-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Whenever It would be nice to have a little discussion at this meeting Whether you want to do it after you have discussed the near-term policy choices--   That's fine "
4178,1996-07-02," We do have some folks looking at what you are referring to--the notion of contemporaneous reserve accounting versus lagged reserve accounting There would be transition costs to going back to lagged accounting and the issue is whether those costs would be outweighed by the benefits of reduced reserve requirement uncertainties We have staff both at the Board and at the New York Bank looking at how we could simplify things   When we designed this, we had to design it around the Greenbook forecast, which already had some uptick in inflation Our design process was to level out the PCE and not allow it to rise any further In the baseline run, the solid line reflects the fed funds rate assumption in the Greenbook and then shows what tightening has to be implemented at the end of the forecast horizon to stop inflation from rising perceptibly further The other simulation does start the tightening earlier and levels out the inflation rate a little sooner But you are right; in both cases, the small acceleration in PCE inflation that is in the Greenbook stays in for the most part   In order to bring inflation back down to 2-1/2 percent, we would need at least the beginnings of a tighter policy "
4179,1996-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, it is and that is because it has always been there When we think of these things, we do it based on history, and the uncertainty premium has been in the real rate historically I think that would be another reason why the real rate might move around over time If people are less uncertain now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and it is quite likely that they are, then you might think in terms of a lower equilibrium real rate   In thinking further about my answer to your question about where the uncertainty is located, I believe we have to be careful There is uncertainty in financial markets that leads them to demand a higher real rate premium But we also need to think about the individuals and the businesses that spend the money My answer assumed that they also were uncertain about the outlook for inflation and that uncertainty would damp their spending at given interest rates If that uncertainty does not affect them, then we have a different situation The equilibrium real rate probably would not have declined in that case But I think uncertainty probably does play into spending decisions as well as saving decisions, and so it might be reasonable to think that with less uncertainty, the real long-term equilibrium rate would be lower   I would have to say that I am not very confident about any of those measures There is a band of uncertainty around them all I do think that, as Mike Prell has commented--and I think Governor Meyer said this yesterday as well--there used to be more confidence about the NAIRU calculation In Mike's chart yesterday, we saw a lot of scatter points around the regression line, but they were fairly tightly bunched However, the more recent information raises questions about the level of the NAIRU I think our estimates of inflation expectations are a very weak link We really do not have a fix on that The Philadelphia Fed survey is very arbitrary because it is a survey of professional economists and, as highly as we might think of them, they are not necessarily representative of savers and investors in society The Michigan survey has its own problems It seems, at least in terms of the means, to be skewed toward too high a number I have very little confidence in our projection of inflation expectations or knowledge of what they actually are currently I tend to look at how they are changing, not in terms of levels If several surveys and other indicators are all moving in the same direction, that might suggest that inflation expectations are moving the same way  On the PCE versus the CPI, I think one answer is that, if it is just a level adjustment, it is not a problem because we are comparing the calculated real rate relative to history We can revise historical and current values and the gap remains the same But I think the point that the Chairman made yesterday--and one that you will hear again shortly--is that we might be getting very different signals from the CPI and PCE, not just a level adjustment but different information about what is going on in the economy That is obviously a much bigger problem than just making a level adjustment   Once again, I think the assumption about where the equilibrium fed funds rate is situated is very shaky When we look at history, we have to conclude that things move around, other things are not equal, the equilibrium real fed funds rate varies, and as I said in my briefing, that sort of exercise is at best only a starting point for thinking about the much more complicated issues relating to developments in financial markets   I guess that depends a bit on what you think will happen if you do not move One hypothesis would be that, if you do not act now, in Mike's words, gravity will take over and the market will begin to correct itself even without the Federal Reserve In that case, waiting to act might even be a positive in the sense that by the time you did act, the market already would be at more reasonable levels and less likely to overreact to our tightening action On the other hand, if that correction were not going to occur, if the froth were to remain in the market, I think your question contained the germ of the answer The more people build that froth in, the more likely you are to get a strong reaction That is one interpretation of what happened in 1994, in the sense that we had a low funds rate for a very long period of time and a very steeply upward sloped yield curve As economists, we could say that a steeply upward sloped yield curve means that markets expect us to tighten; such an action should come as no big surprise The Chairman had testified several times telling the markets we would be tightening Yet, when we embarked on a tightening course, which was widely anticipated, I think a lot of people who thought they would be the first out the door actually got caught Everybody ran for the door at the same time, and there was a rather strong reaction in financial markets "
4238,1996-08-20," We can certainly look at the daily correlations, Mr Chairman, to see how the bond and the exchange markets were moving I think it is still true, though Charles Siegman may want to comment on this, that over time the dollar and interest rates tend to move together But there is a lot of ceteris paribus behind that tendency, and it certainly does not happen all the time and every day Certainly, real interest rate differentials might be the relevant issue   President Jordan, with respect to the third factor, I think the evidence for unexpected demands for money and credit or intermediation services through the banks is not strong in this period If anything, money growth in July came in weaker than we were expecting While it strengthened in August, it is still growing along a very moderate track So I do not think we are seeing a situation in which we are having trouble assessing developments, other than the problems that Peter mentioned of the week-to-week and day-to- day demands for excess and required reserves I do not think we see a situation in which we are persistently underestimating the demands for reserves because money supplies are coming in stronger and it looks as if we are accommodating a perhaps inflationary increase in liquidity That is not a situation that we have seen, if that is what you meant by your third point "
4239,1996-08-20," That is based primarily on the observation that the incoming money growth data are a little weaker than we had anticipated   The way we go about this is entirely endogenous As you know, a nominal interest rate, particularly one that is the Committee's target, is not a nominal anchor I think that the process that Mike described is exactly what went on "
4240,1996-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman There must be something in the water here! I began my briefing exactly as Governor Meyer began his and Governor Yellen began hers, but it diverges thereafter I will cut through the first part of my prepared text a little [Statement--see Appendix] Thank you, Mr Chairman "
4290,1996-09-24," Mr Chairman?   I have a procedural question When would it be good to stop for lunch? [Laughter]   It was Mike Prell's question and I agree with it The members and staff could get their lunch and return to this room with it; it could be a break of about 5 minutes   I do not recall   As we sold the bills, it would make the average maturity of the debt in the hands of the public much shorter   That approach would help in terms of averting the effect on prices in the market if there were a concern about selling coupons because there was a flight to liquidity as well as to quality Presumably, the Treasury would do it at the market value of the securities   The Treasury has shortened the debt structure   The other point on the liquidity of bills, President Minehan, is that we could absorb reserves very readily by simply allowing them to run off at maturity   That was one reason why the Committee decided in the mid-1980s to shift more of the portfolio toward bills because that meant that outright sales in the market would not be required to accomplish a large amount of reserve absorption   I think in the past the Committee has talked about conducting at least some transactions in the coupon end of the market just to be in the market from time to time, and the possibility of buying coupons in certain unusual circumstances probably should not be ruled out It is something that the Desk has done in the past Only four or five years ago, the Committee was concerned that the portfolio was getting too liquid, and the Desk was instructed to stop moving it in that direction "
4291,1996-09-24, [Statement--see Appendix] 
4398,1996-12-17," We would have a better sense of the demand for reserves late in the day I think that one of the phenomena of this low reserve balance situation, at least a couple of years ago, was that things could shift rather dramatically in terms of demands for excess reserves very late in the day I think many other central banks operate more than once a day, and particularly if there is an interest rate target, it would be nice to have that flexibility   Peter, I now have a table in front of me that shows this The standard deviation of the daily federal funds rate from the FOMC's targets this year is a little higher than in 1993, 1994, or 1995 and about the same as in 1992 So, it really has been in about the same range for several years I think an interesting aspect, though, is that the intra-day variations have been a little higher this year There has been a tendency, as Peter reported before, for spikes to occur late in the day If one looks at the highs relative to the average and at some of those types of volatility measures, they are a bit higher   The high-low range, for example, is wider this year than it has been for a couple of years "
4399,1996-12-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] "
4457,1997-02-04," I think Thursday resolves our problem Sometimes, as happened when  President Moskow raised a question at the last meeting, it takes a while to revise the minutes,  reproduce them, and then get the copies out to the Reserve Banks so that they are available for  release    2/4-5/97   Particularly since the minutes are approved at the beginning of the  Tuesday-Wednesday meetings, then presumably any problems would be cleared up on Tuesday,  so a Thursday release would work   For the Saturday papers   Maybe we could consult on the timing The other issue, Mr Chairman,  is that domestic market participants sometimes complain when we release things at the end of the  day, particularly on a day when the Japanese markets are opening for the next day's trading in  Japan   Consulting with Mr Fisher   Of course, even if banks do not need any required reserve balances at  the Reserve Banks at the end of the day, they need clearing balances through the day and at the  end of the day So, even if every bank in the system were unbound, I think there would be a    2/4-5/97  demand for balances at the Federal Reserve, and we would be able to implement monetary  policy I suspect there might be a critical level, Peter I think the rate of change is important  We have been pleasantly surprised that, with this gradual rate of change, the banks have adapted  My guess is that they will continue to adapt, as Peter says, as long as the rate of change is low  But there might be some level at which the clearing needs are the operative needs rather than the  reserve needs Clearing needs vary a lot from day to day Peter will still be able to get the right  average funds rate over a period of time, but there might be more volatility We just do not  know where that point is I think it is lower than some might have suspected it was, based on  past experience It may be considerably lower than its present range in terms of inducing more  volatility But I think even if no bank is bound, there still will be a demand for balances at the  Federal Reserve   And still something for Peter to operate on in carrying out the  Committee's policies   I don't think so   I guess I am a little unclear about what you are proposing, President  Jordan In the staffs view, you would have to raise interest rates considerably to get the lower  nominal GDP growth that you want If you are asking us what would happen if hypothetically  nominal GDP simply decelerated with the funds rate being held at 5-1/4 percent, obviously  money growth would come in lower That I agree is an arithmetic problem that we could solve  If we were to raise interest rates as in the chart 2 case, money growth as Brian said would come  in even lower because we would be moving along the money demand function at the same time   That is totally plausible to me, given that we had 3-1/2 or 3-3/4 percent  M2 growth associated with the smaller increase in the federal funds rate in the stable inflation  alternative So, lower M2 growth could well be associated with those higher interest rates   I agree and we tried to convey that point in a long, complex footnote  Maybe it was hard to read through I will be covering it in my briefing as well, President Parry   But I agree with you I think that it is very likely that people, in forming  their price expectations, look at the whole array of prices that they are paying and not just at the  core measures To us, the core PCE was a little more revealing of the underlying sense of what  was happening to inflation, and it abstracted from CPI measurement changes and related  problems So, the core PCE was better from that perspective, but I agree that it overstates the  decline in real rates in 1997 If you use total PCE, you see that real rates actually change very  little in 1997 Indeed, they rise a little because of the assumed decline in energy prices, which  depresses total PCE or total CPI Real rates would then go down in 1998 as the total PCE starts  to trend up again But in 1997, it looks as if real rates actually rise a tick, if you just literally use  the total PCE rather than the core PCE "
4458,1997-02-04," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   No, we have not I think the question becomes one of how much  confidence the Committee or the Committee member involved has in this projection that  inflation will pick up This is a forecast and there is a range of uncertainty around it It is true  that under an opportunistic strategy, there would be an inclination to lean very hard against  tendencies for inflation to pick up and less hard against shortfalls So, I do not think we have  modified the definition If an opportunistic Committee member became convinced with some    2/4-5/97  degree of confidence that, in fact, policy was too easy, that member would need to vote for a  change to be within this somewhat arbitrary definition of what opportunism means   I think it would mean that you would have sufficient uncertainty about  the forecast and a sense that it was desirable to wait a while to get more information, particularly  given some of the factors we have talked about that will be holding down overall inflation and  probably inflation expectations this year You would have to weigh the costs and benefits of  waiting to obtain more information, given your degree of confidence in that forecast   The cost of waiting would be that in the event of some upcreep in  inflation and inflation expectations and given the lags in policy, you would have to induce more  slack in the economy to keep inflation at the current level The benefit would be that if you had  acted sooner on an incorrect forecast, you would have put some slack in the economy and caused  some variations in output that were unnecessary to meet your objectives as an opportunistic  policymaker   I think it is premature As a general matter, the bonds were, as you  know, in greater demand and better received than most people thought they would be I think  there is still uncertainty in the market about how to trade them, what they should be trading    2/4-5/97  against, and what we as analysts should be comparing them to try to intuit what the difference is  We have done some analysis here that was shared in the Board briefings that you all have  received The analysis suggested that the bonds could trade like a floating rate note if all the  shocks were inflation shocks, but they would trade more like a 12-year bond or a note with that  duration if all the shocks were real shocks My understanding is that in the UK they trade more  like a shorter-term security than a longer-term security We would have to get more experience  and hopefully over time have trading occurring at more than one maturity to be able to analyze  the behavior of these bonds in our market   I dont fundamentally disagree with your analysis I guess I was  motivated in part by my own concerns, and I did not have any good answers about how the  Committee would act preemptively, particularly in a situation where we had a slow, steady    2/4-5/97  upcreep in inflation and some market commentary that, because of the uncertainties, we would  need the so-called smoking gun in order to tighten But I agree with you that it is not the  predominant market commentary now   Our assessment of the market's interpretation of us, this looking-in-  the-mirror question, has become more complicated over the last few years because you folks  have done such a good job When you do not tighten monetary policy, people say the FOMC  must know something that they do not know--that the underlying inflation pressures are not as  intense as they might have thought was the case It is very hard to sort out the effect of your  actions on their expectations of the underlying inflation pressures from their reading of what  your intentions are and whether you would act preemptively   It would be symmetrical, President Guynn   You could look at that higher NAIRU simulation in the Bluebook and  subtract changes rather than add them to get an idea    2/4-5/97   The first will be February 26   We have scheduled a pre-lunch discussion of the surplus issue after this  meeting "
4513,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   ""Deliver"" "
4556,1997-05-20," President Jordan, in thinking about the real rate relative to its  equilibrium or natural level, I don't believe that a real rate a bit below its equilibrium level,  as apparently it has been, would be inconsistent with the staff forecast In fact, it is perfectly    5/20/97  consistent with the economy producing at a level beyond its potential on a sustained basis  and inflation just creeping up under those circumstances It would not necessarily be the case  that if the real rate were a bit below its equilibrium rate, the gap between where the economy  was and its potential would widen So, I do not think the staff forecast requires the  equilibrium rate to drop back down again In fact, the staff forecast is consistent with the  equilibrium rate being a bit above where real rates are right now   In our judgment, President Jordan, we are seeing some slowing in  money growth in recent months when we abstract from the accumulation of balances for the  payment of taxes In looking through that kind of thing and taking account of the fact that  we have essentially a no-growth forecast for M2 in May, we think that the rate of growth in  that aggregate has in fact decelerated a couple of percentage points from the first to the  second quarter    5/20/97 "
4557,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman (Statement--see Appendix) "
4607,1997-07-01," Board staff is working on a memorandum for Board consideration that  proposes a return to lagged reserve accounting The Board has not seen any of this or heard this  discussed previously because we are still working on this issue at the staff level I think there are  two factors that make this a potentially opportune time to consider this issue One is that as  reserve balances have dropped, we have had increasing difficulties predicting required reserve  balances from week to week The reason is that vault cash has been high enough to enable some  banks to shift back and forth between being bound by reserve requirements and not The previous  formulas that were used to predict which banks were going to be bound and which were not no  longer work We have tried to improve these predictions, and I think we have The errors have  dropped substantially, but it is still more difficult to make predictions about demands for reserve  balances in an environment in which we cannot even be certain that one or another major large  bank will be bound by reserve requirements Secondly, the Federal Reserve System is in the  process of changing the programming and accounting regime for reserve requirements, and it  would be relatively easy to allow for a shift back to lagged reserve accounting once that  programming is completed Previously, we were told that it would be a major undertaking to go  into the reserve accounting system and change it from contemporaneous to lagged accounting  The implementation of the new accounting system, which I think will occur about a year from    7/1-2/97  now, would be an opportune moment to shift back to lagged reserves As I mentioned, we are  going to come to the Board with a proposal on that   As you and President Broaddus remember, the reserve requirements are  geared to Ml, and there are no reserve requirements on non-M1 deposit balances   Especially if the revision went back a couple of years   It is also the case that when we fit these things econometrically, we find  small time trends both for the period covered by the bottom line and for that covered by the top  Thus, the charts show bigger misses relative to the fitted line than there are in our models  because the models have this time trend in them But I think your basic point is still correct In  some sense, it is amazing how little velocity has shifted up given the huge flows into stock  mutual funds   On that low NAIRU alternative, we would have small effects on  nominal GDP and lower inflation It is not clear which way nominal GDP would go since we  would have higher output and lower inflation Actually, I think nominal GDP would be a bit  lower in that scenario than in the baseline scenario Interest rates would not be rising, which    7/1-2/97  would help boost M2, but nominal GDP would be a little lower because inflation would be so  much lower So, I don't know which way it would go, but my guess is that the net effect would  not alter our projection of M2 a great deal   It has struck us in recent Humphrey-Hawkins write-ups that putting the  word ""monitoring"" in front of debt makes it sound as if that aggregate has a quality to it that  differs from the Committee's use of the monetary aggregates I think the existing practice  evolved when the monetary aggregates really were more indicators or targets, somewhere in that    7/1-2/97  nexus, while debt was never intended to be a target and was on trial as an indicator The  Committee decided to call it a ""monitoring"" range so that people would not expect any action by  the Committee if the actual behavior of debt fell outside the range However, it has struck us that  no one should expect action just because one of the monetary aggregates is breaching its range,  and in fact the ranges for monetary growth are not even set with that in mind So, the  differentiation is awkward The question before the Committee is whether we can drop the word  ""monitoring"" in front of the word ""debt"" since in effect all the ranges are ""monitoring"" ranges "
4608,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will begin with some thoughts on the  longer-term strategy section of the Bluebook, and I will be referring to the charts in that  document I will talk a bit about how the results of those exercises might or might not relate to  the current situation and finish with some comments on proposed changes in the wording of the  operational paragraph that are shown in the Bluebook [Statement--see Appendix]   I think ""both"" is the answer The models actually do not have to  differentiate as such between supply and demand shocks In effect they do, but it should be  noted that they are just reacting to output gaps and to inflation gaps From the perspective of the  rule, the ruler, I guess, does not have to say this is a supply shock or this is a demand shock  Having said that, I would like to mention that certain rules work better for demand shocks and  other rules work better for supply shocks, as the other paper that was circulated pointed out more  clearly So, if you have some clue as to whether you are dealing with a supply shock or a  demand shock when making policy, you would want to use that information to shape your policy  response instead of adhering rigidly to a particular rule In theory, you do not have to know what  type of shock it is, but you could make policy better if you did know  Concerning the problem of uncertainty about the structure of the economy, this is a  really complex subject that President McDonough brought up at the last meeting, and it is one  that I must admit I have not sorted out to my own satisfaction As he pointed out, there is an  older literature starting with Bill Brainard that says, if there is multiplier uncertainty--if you are  not sure of the connection between a policy action and the response in the economy--that ought  to induce some caution If you are not sure what will happen, you go part of the way there, see    7/1-2/97  how it works out, and go a little further The so-called Brainard uncertainty should induce a  much more cautious response than you would get from the Henderson-McKibbin strategy  On the other hand, people have done other exercises in which the coefficients are  known, the slopes of the lines are known, but their position is uncertain For example, we may  be uncertain about the position of the NAIRU but quite sure that we know what the slope of the  short-run tradeoff is Those kinds of uncertainties do not necessarily engender sluggish  policymaking You would proceed on the basis of your best guess with that kind of uncertainty,  see what happens, and adjust later So, there are different kinds of uncertainty  The real world clearly is much more complex Various uncertainties interact You  observe things happening; you do not know whether a multiplier effect is involved Things are  not happening the way you expected; you do not know whether the reaction of the economy has  changed or the whole position of some function has changed And you do not know what caused  the change, whether it is a supply or a demand shock While I do think uncertainty counsels  caution in policymaking, I would get a little concerned if it counseled paralysis The other part  of the lesson is that when you see an output gap opening up, if that is your best guess, you have  to do something at some point or the pressures producing that gap will mount and you will have  a worse problem later My concern about cautious policymaking is that it can get so cautious  that problems build   No, there is no long-term Phillips curve built into this I think you have  to be a little careful, President McTeer, about the scale of these charts We are talking about  small declines in inflation and fairly small output gaps The sacrifice ratio built in is 3 over a  very long run That is consistent with many, many modeling exercises The sacrifice ratio we  used in the first set of simulations, 2 over a period of 5 years, is also consistent with a lot of  modeling and empirical work done over a quite long period So, there is a short-run Phillips  curve built in here We do not have a persistent supply shock that allows us to get a free lunch in  the form of lower inflation without giving up something in terms of output These are  symmetrical shocks around zero, so there are as many positive as negative ones In order to get  inflation down, you have to give up some output in these kinds of exercises The only way you  could get around that is illustrated in chart 3 If in fact you have a positive and persistent supply  shock and the NAIRU is lower than you thought it was, then you have the type of favorable  tradeoff that Dave Stockton talked about yesterday in another variant But in the stochastic  simulations, the shocks are all temporary They average to zero over time, and so the short-run  Phillips curve dictates that you need to give up some output to get inflation down on average    7/1-2/97  over this time period Again, there is no long-run Phillips curve built in here In fact, there's a  negative relationship between output and inflation, as I tried to point out, but no positive one  That is, the model does not produce any gain in efficiency and output from having lower  inflation, though we think there really are some gains   The implied sacrifice ratios are in line with what we have been using for  quite a while   I think we have been facing a situation in which there have been some  very favorable supply developments, and that means we have not had this short-run tradeoff   I don't think I have a lot to add to what you said, President Jordan You  indicated that you might not react as strongly to demand shocks as to supply shocks, and I  wonder about that If you really thought that demand had shifted up in the first half of this year,  starting from a position in which the economy was close to potential and was now going past  potential, you would want to react rather strongly to that On the supply shocks, I agree with    7/1-2/97  what you said in the following sense I think they are very difficult to analyze I thought Dave  Stockton in his briefing yesterday gave a very good example of the kind of supply shock you  were discussing In that example the equilibrium real funds rate rose because there was an  increase in productivity in the economy, and at some point the Fed would have to tighten to  avoid the overshooting in demand that you were talking about There could be other kinds of  supply shocks I think, for example, that a NAIRU shock has a different flavor to it So, supply  shocks do require differentiating to see whether they require or will eventually require raising or  lowering interest rates to equilibrate supply and demand in the economy It is not always  obvious which way that is going to go and how the tradeoffs will go Supply-side shocks are  more difficult to analyze because they come in different varieties   If you turn back to page 10, you can see that in both the target zone and  the opportunism simulations we had a strong reaction to inflation outside the target zone or  outside the zone of indifference for opportunism   And certainly, almost by algebra, you are right If you reduced those  coefficients on inflation outside the zone from 25 to 15, then you would get a less strong  reaction, and it would take longer to get to price stability On the other hand, I think we have to  be a little careful Look at the Henderson-McKibbin deliberate rule That is a case in which the  policymaker does respond more strongly to output gaps than to inflation gaps, and it performs  fairly well in terms of getting to low inflation If you have a demand shock, of course, there is  no conflict The output gap opens and that is going to raise inflation strongly in response Both  are moving in the same direction It is with supply shocks that you get conflicts So, it is not  necessarily the case that a policymaker who puts a lot of emphasis on output relative to inflation  would take a long time to get to price stability The Henderson-McKibbin policymaker takes  less time than the opportunist and only a bit more than the Taylor policymaker   Mr Chairman, it might be useful to ask the members to differentiate  between the first sentence and the second sentence Some may favor changing one and not the  other "
4664,1997-08-19," As long as we publish our forward position, Mr Chairman!   There are futures markets in both the 5-year and the 10-year issues Those  issues are eligible to trade in those markets, but as of a week ago there had been essentially no  trades--a few trades in the 10-year bond--and no positions I believe the markets also obtained  permission to trade options on the futures contracts, but there had not been any such trading as of a  week or two ago So, the markets are there but they are not being used "
4665,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman As background for the Committee's decision today, I will begin by taking a few minutes to discuss real interest rates, concentrating on the real federal funds rate, given its occasional use as an index for the stance of monetary policy In the course of my discussion, I will be referring to the set of charts that has been distributed; these update selected charts from the Financial Indicators package 2  As you can see from the panels on the right side of the first chart, the real federal funds rate has risen considerably this year when lagged CPI inflation is used to proxy for expected future inflation The increase is a product of the Committee's decision to raise the nominal funds rate in March as well as a decline in inflation expectations, as estimated using these proxies One might question whether inflation expectations actually have decreased as much as has measured inflation--especially total CPI inflation, which has been driven importantly by temporary swings in energy prices over the last two years But qualitatively similar movements are also evident when real rates are constructed by subtracting the results of surveys of inflation expectations  Moreover, as you can see by comparing the bottom to the top rows in the lower panel, the current level of the real federal funds rate is fairly high relative to history--in the neighborhood of a percentage point above its average over the entire sample, from 1965 to the present This sample period was chosen because it has about the same inflation rate at the beginning and the end This should indicate that over this interval the economy experienced about the same amount of excess demand pushing up inflation and excess supply pushing it down so that, on average, output was at its potential Consequently, other things equal, the average real federal funds rate from 1965 to 1997 might be a reasonable approximation of the natural or equilibrium federal funds rate consistent with holding the economy at potential and keeping inflation steady  But, of course, other things have not been equal One set of developments that probably has been tending to shift up the equilibrium real rate over the last 30 years has been deregulation and innovation in financial markets The dismantling of regulatory interest rate ceilings and the spread of loan securitizations and other means of diversifying sources of funds have removed or reduced important sources of nonprice rationing in credit markets Greater reliance on the price of credit to allocate scarce saving implies that higher real interest rates are needed  Aside from such structural changes, the equilibrium real funds rate will depend on cyclical or one-time influences on the economy and financial markets Certainly, the required level of interest rates was lifted in the early-  2 Copies of the charts used by Mr Kohn are appended to this transcript (Appendix 2)    8/19/97  and mid-1980s by an expansive fiscal policy, and reduced in the early 1990s by the so-called credit crunch  What can we infer about equilibrium rates in recent years? Note that, although the actual real rate has risen to a fairly high level of late, it is now only a little above the range of the last few years Moreover, if the staff and Committee members are right about the slight pickup in the CPI next year, some of the very recent increases in the calculated real rate will be reversed Real funds rates near these elevated levels over the last three years have not connoted a restrictive monetary policy Instead, over this period, robust growth has propelled the economy to a level that exceeds many estimates of its long-run potential An important reason for this, as Committee members have pointed out in past meetings, is the strong demand for capital goods The profitability of this investment means that higher-than-normal real rates may be needed to avoid inflationary pressures on resources And this profitability has been reflected in other financial markets, such as for equity, where high prices have reduced the cost of capital and boosted net worth, further damping any restraint from short-term real rates  Moreover, a somewhat different picture of financial conditions is portrayed by longer-term real interest rates Much of the run-up in the real federal funds rate over this spring and summer apparently has not been transmitted out along the yield curve The rise in the real funds rate resulted importantly from the drop in measured inflation expectations against a fixed nominal funds rate But nominal longer-term rates have been free to decrease with inflation expectations--and they have done so, leaving real yields on the Treasury's indexed debt fluctuating fairly narrowly The top panel of the next chart shows other measures of real long-term Treasury yields Despite a small upward trend since early 1996, these rates remain appreciably below their peaks of 1994-95 The uptrend is even more muted in private rates, the lower panel, which have been held down by low and narrowing risk premiums The behavior of these premiums is indicative of the generally ready availability of financing for private borrowers, which itself would boost required real rates on federal funds or Treasury securities  The effects of the flattening yield curve and declining risk premiums on the real private bond yield can be seen in chart 13, which plots this yield against the subsequent year's change in inflation This technique, like the use of historical averages, is limited by the implicit assumption that history provides reliable guidance to future developments--that the equilibrium rate has not shifted significantly over the past 15 years And, as you can see, the fit is not tight Nonetheless, real long-term rates in 1996 and 1997--plotted in the diamonds marked 97 and 98 for the Greenbook projection of the change in inflation for those years--are not elevated by this standard; they are certainly not in the restrictive territory implied by recent readings of the real funds rate    8/19/97  While not evident in domestic credit and equity markets, elevated real short-term rates may still have some restraining effect For example, they may be one factor behind the strength of the dollar, though questions about foreign economies and policies likely have been important Whatever the reason, the appreciation of the dollar should help to hold down US production and prices Moreover, further increases in real short rates--through policy tightening action or declining inflation expectations without compensating policy easing--would put upward pressure on real intermediate- and long-term rates  In sum, short-term real rates are high, and they have risen recently The current real level of the funds rate may provide some assurance that policy is not highly stimulative But, in the absence of policy action, the real funds rate is likely to begin to edge lower as some of the special factors holding down inflation wear off and higher inflation rates begin to affect expectations Moreover, even very high real federal funds rates may not necessarily indicate restraint or even neutrality in monetary policy when other important elements in overall financial conditions are considered, especially taking account of the strong demand for capital Real short- and long-term rates close to current levels have apparently allowed output to overshoot sustainable levels, and in the staff forecast this situation is not corrected without a change in policy  Still, considerable uncertainty persists about the level and growth of potential output and the implications for inflation of operating for a time with the current degree of tautness in labor markets, which may be seen as supporting a continuation of the wait-and-see posture of alternative B The drop in inflation expectations provides an additional counterweight to the effects of resource pressures on prices, allowing the Committee to await firmer signs that inflation is likely to intensify without risking a substantial acceleration in prices And with inventory investment likely to slow, the odds on a near-term strengthening of production that would increase resource utilization rates have diminished Recently more volatile conditions in financial markets may also counsel caution This development may be associated with some second thoughts about just how rosy the outlook for prices, profits, and interest rates may be If markets become more cautious, equity prices and credit spreads would become a little less stimulative  If the Committee were to choose to keep the stance of policy unchanged, it would need again to consider whether to retain the asymmetry in its directive As compared to the situation in early July when the Committee last voted to have an asymmetric directive, the favorable behavior of prices and price expectations, along with a slightly less expansive staff forecast for growth going forward, may be read as reducing the urgency to take action should any signs of inflation pressures emerge over the near term On the other hand, the basic situation has not changed since early July The    8/19/97  labor market continues to operate at levels beyond most estimates of sustainable potential, and strength in consumption and investment spending seems to suggest that financial conditions, at least those prevailing a little while ago, have not been tight enough to prompt a closing of any output gap  This brings me to the language of the directive As you suggested, Mr Chairman, I polled the members for their views on the wording of the two sentences, and as I suspected, there were almost as many suggestions as members I tried to boil these down to a few alternatives, which were sent to the Committee and are repeated beginning on page 12 of the Bluebook On the first sentence, most members preferred the alternative sentence in the June Bluebook, though some suggested relatively minor wording changes President Boehne's alternative, labeled ""New Alternative,"" seems to have the advantage of eliminating the somewhat/slightly distinction from the first sentence--employed in the past to differentiate 50 from 25 basis point actions, but perhaps not needed to describe actions taken at the meeting now that the Committee is explicit about the actual federal funds rate it expects It also eliminates the tighten/maintain/ease choice on reserve conditions, which several other members also suggested  Consensus was less clear on the second sentence Although quite a few members preferred the June Bluebook alternative, there were a number of other suggestions The wording given as ""New Alternative 1"" is also based on President Boehne's suggestion and would conform the June Bluebook alternative for the second sentence to his alternative for the first sentence In keeping with a suggestion several of you made, it puts the possible change in terms of an increase or decrease in the federal funds rate, instead of reserve conditions However, a few of you also thought that the asymmetry was about presumptions, or inclinations, or risks rather than weight given to incoming data This approach may be more consistent with the notion that the directive tilt is a signal of the risks the Committee sees, and hence the more likely direction of its next action, without any necessary implication for the upcoming intermeeting period In the circumstances, the tilt implies that you would move relatively promptly if the data seemed to confirm your concerns, and that you have a hard time imagining moving in the other direction, though such an action cannot be ruled out in very unexpected circumstances I tried to capture some flavor of this in the second new alternative However, on re- reading this alternative, I'm not sure better language couldn't have been found to express this view--for example, ""In the context of  , the Committee believes that developments are more likely over time to require a tightening than an easing of reserve conditions to attain its objectives""  The difficulty of framing a consensus on the second question may suggest that leaving the current wording in place for this sentence, or tinkering with it only very slightly, ought to be seriously considered The current wording, however awkward, does not try to spell out what the Committee    8/19/97  means by asymmetry but merely states the kind of actions the Committee would, or might, find acceptable If the Committee changes the first sentence but wants to leave the second essentially unchanged, it could conform the second sentence simply by substituting ""higher"" and ""lower"" ""federal funds rate"" for greater and lesser reserve restraint, though even this change might not be needed   Okay I'm on page 13 of the Bluebook and I will start with the ""New  Alternative"" If you chose Alternative B and translated the July directive into this, it would read  ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks conditions in  reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 5-1/2  percent In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable  economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary  developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate  might be acceptable in the intermeeting period""   We have two methods of establishing that; the other is the use of ""would""  and ""might""   You could ask for a show of hands maybe without doing a vote That way  everybody could be included   And President Boehne   Right   I think that if we took it literally, and I would have to look at that, it  actually would be a little higher if we used the GDP deflator over time, which is what Taylor's rule  is based on These days the GDP deflator tends to run a little below the CPI, but over time I think it  runs a little above So, if we use the deflator, the gap between the 2 percent and what we might  think of as history over the 1965 to 1997 period would be a little larger So, we need to think about  that rule in the context of what price index we are using, what changes have been made to the price  index over the years that might have distorted it going back in history, and whether it may be less  distorted now I think most researchers, as we have been told over the past few years, have not  found a big change in the amount of bias in the indexes, but we need to be careful about that I  think all these factors are important I know that partly at your behest, Governor Meyer, people on  the staff are trying to take account of these various factors and make a more sophisticated,  technically justifiable estimate of the real funds rate even for the very simple Taylor rule The real  funds rate in that rule is not allowed to move around The other major issue, even if we know how  to measure the real funds rate, is whether it moves around from time to time So, we should take  account of all these other aspects   That is one of the factors, President McDonough, in the sense that  relatively small trades can push these rates around because these markets are not liquid, and I think    8/19/97  we need to be careful about interpreting small ups and downs in the yields On the other hand, I  don't think the lack of liquidity in the market vitiates their usefulness entirely There are a few  folks out there, at least as one talks to people on the Street, who are keeping their eye on these  things They are doing a little trading And if there were a sense, for example, that the economy  was terribly strong and the Fed really needed to raise real interest rates a lot to keep inflation down  and was going to do so, I think these yields would go up Now, we would have to be careful about  whether we should count every basis point and look at that spread for every basis point I think it is  useful to look at that yield and at the spread in a general kind of way, but we have to be careful not  to slice it too thinly  Another factor here is relative supply The Treasury has cut back on its note auctions,  and in particular it has eliminated a ten-year note auction or two and is concentrating more of its  issuance in the indexed area So there may be, particularly with a thin market, some relative supply  effects that ordinarily we would think would wash out very quickly in a nominal bond market but  that may have some effect in the indexed market Nonetheless, I think the fact that the spread has  come down by almost 50 basis points over four months suggests something   The other point I would make about the sentence that you pointed to is that  we characterize it as inflation compensation There is another part to inflation compensation It is  not only expectations; it is the inflation risk premium One had a sense, particularly over the spring  through the end of July, that not only were people perhaps a little more optimistic on inflation, but  they were a little less uncertain about their optimism So, one reason that nominal yields might  have dropped relative to the real yield is not entirely a decline in inflation expectations but a    8/19/97  decline in the insurance premium that people buying nominal bonds required for the possibility that  inflation would turn out to be a lot different than they expected it to be   It is a reduction in the actual compensation that investors are demanding  for buying a nominal bond Its size would depend on their expectations for inflation and on the  standard error or standard deviation--   Right "
4714,1997-09-30," Thank your, Mr Chairman The sustained strength in final demand since the last FOMC meeting and the staff projection of    9/30/97  building inflation pressures suggest that the question facing the Committee remains whether, or perhaps when, to tighten the stance of policy  Prices in financial markets do not seem to embody this asymmetry of risks or potential Federal Reserve action, perhaps because, as Mike noted, investors have become entranced by visions of a new era I say investors because, once again, a survey of economists at primary dealers taken in advance of this meeting indicated that a majority--albeit a slimmer one than in the near past--expects policy firming by year-end Nonetheless, futures market rates and the overall slope of the yield curve appear to make no allowance for such a rise in the federal funds rate Moreover, equity prices continue to advance and credit remains readily available, both of which are consistent with a lack of concern that real interest rates or labor costs might move higher to impinge on the growth of income and profits and the ability of households and firms to service debt If the economists, including the staff, are right that risks are tilted toward higher inflation, investor behavior is complicating the Committee's job because markets are not acting as an automatic stabilizer; indeed, the vigilantes seem to have been lulled to sleep so that financial conditions, if anything, are exacerbating any economic overshooting that may be occurring  Market mistakes are not usually prolonged, implying that this circumstance would correct itself to some extent without System action if cost pressures do, in fact, develop As profit margins disappoint, equity prices will fall and lenders may become a bit more cautious However, such a reaction, by itself, is unlikely to be sufficient or timely enough to forestall potentially emergent inflation pressures With financial markets determined to be optimistic, markets are more likely to follow than to lead inflation pressures  If the Committee sees a high likelihood that the economy is or soon will be producing beyond its sustainable potential, action sooner rather than later would be called for The longer disequilibrium is allowed to persist, the more disruptive can be the actions required to correct it The Committee has been most successful in recent years and has minimized needed policy corrections by acting preemptively Following that pattern, if the Committee were confident of an intensification of inflation pressures, it might want to act at this meeting  But such preemptive policymaking presupposes a level of conviction about the outlook that the Committee may not have today, given the uncertainties about price/output relationships Allowing for the possibility that there may be no disequilibrium lies behind the arguments for alternative B In short, the persistent, unexpected, favorable behavior of inflation of late may call into question our understanding of the underlying inflation process Moreover, some of the projected impetus to inflation    9/30/97  comes from what will be, not what is already, in the pipeline the projected further edging down of the unemployment rate given strong final demands and the ending of the restraining force of declining import prices All of these inflation influences seem to have been particularly difficult to pin down of late, and the Committee may want to wait for surer indications that inflation will increase before tightening After all, unnecessary tightening does have costs in terms of lost output and market disruption Moreover, with inflation already fairly low, the Committee may view the gains from the resulting additional, unintended disinflation as relatively small Action once those surer indications begin to emerge may be effective in restraining inflation, provided such action is prompt, and perhaps relatively forceful, but the new elements and uncertainties in the current situation make such indicators--short of the ""smoking gun"" of a string of adverse inflation data-- difficult to identify  One class of indicators the Committee has used in the past is early signs of pipeline price pressures Price increases for commodities or goods at early stages of production and the stretching out of supplier deliveries and the like have been important not so much for their direct implications for business costs, but rather as indications of pressures on resource capacity They were prominent in 1994, helping to cue the need for more tightening than originally anticipated, and timely System action did forestall a more general increase in inflation However, at this time, with industrial capacity more ample than labor force potential, the cost and price pressures may be less visible and more gradual Rather than easily observed increases in crude and intermediate materials prices, pipeline pressures may manifest themselves in a steady upcreep in labor costs and a gradual squeeze on profits  Another indication that tightening is in order might be the continued growth of aggregate demand beyond that of the economy's potential It was the threat of persisting unsustainable growth in demand that motivated the Committee's firming in March, and the current circumstances closely resemble those the Committee faced at that time, but with utilization rates in labor and capital markets now higher Nonetheless, the Committee may see some differences in the situations that counsel caution For one, the real federal fund rates probably has been edging higher without Committee action, as inflation and inflation expectations appear to have abated For another, the flow of unexpectedly good inflation news has been extended, suggesting a changing environment or at least more uncertainty Despite these possibilities, the Committee at some point still may want to consider tightening on the basis of above-trend growth and before even pipeline pressures on prices or labor costs are clearly evident Growth that is accompanied by rising utilization rates is, by definition, unsustainable, even in a new era If there are no signs of moderation, the Committee may desire    9/30/97  some additional assurance that it is not accommodating a major build-up of inflation pressures and subsequent correction  In the staff forecast, above-trend growth going forward is supported by accommodative financial conditions, despite high real short-term interest rates This circumstance suggests another set of factors that might contribute to a decision to tighten--signs that financial conditions were becoming even easier Unless potential output can expand considerably faster than now seems likely, substantial further increases in equity prices, for example, or a drop in the dollar, or a further turn toward easier credit conditions would seem inconsistent with demand being damped by enough to prevent a further overrun of potential output The staff does expect most nominal interest rates to edge higher, even if the stance of policy remains unchanged in coming months But a particularly worrisome sign might be an increase in inflation expectations not coupled with an increase in real rates This combination could be read as signaling doubt about the Federal Reserve's resolve to limit any potential increase in inflation Thus far, we have been living with the virtuous part of the circle of inflation determination Damped inflation expectations have themselves helped to hold down inflation despite high resource utilization While the key expectations in this regard are those on Main Street, a deterioration on Wall Street that persisted could be an early warning that the circle might turn vicious  Money growth might be one element in assessing whether financial conditions have been too accommodative The expansion of both M2 and M3 has been much more rapid in recent months than the staff had anticipated In part, the overage seems to reflect asset and liability allocation decisions unrelated to current or future spending Demand for M2 assets picked up in the wake of the stock market weakness in August, and was reflected in particular in rapid growth of money market funds; M3 has been boosted by bank decisions to fund in US rather than Eurodollar deposit markets But rapid growth in M3 also is consistent with ample resources being available to the banking system to support continued aggressive lending And strength in M2 was broader than just money funds--nearly all major categories came in above our expectations In recent years, with M2 demand more stable and opportunity costs not varying much, quarterly variations in money growth have been roughly correlated with quarterly variations in the rate of expansion of nominal GDP In this context, the third-quarter pickup in M2 growth looked anomalous relative to the estimated slowing of nominal GDP, but some of the latter now appears to be in the process of being revised away We are predicting a relatively sharp slowing of M2 growth over the months of the fourth quarter to keep quarterly average growth from greatly exceeding predicted GDP Money running appreciably above our forecast might be    9/30/97  one indication that financial conditions were accommodating somewhat stronger spending than anticipated  At this point, a tightening would catch markets unawares, and could provoke a considerable reaction Such a market reaction would arise both because participants, at least those controlling the investments, do not believe that tightening is necessary, but because they also may feel that they have been encouraged in this belief by Federal Reserve statements To some extent market reactions, occasionally strong, are desirable because changes in interest and exchange rates and in equity prices are key links in the transmission channels for policy Strong reactions and surprises also are inevitable from time to time in an uncertain economic environment in which the Committee's assessment of the requirements of policy may not always match the markets' Moreover, a sense that the markets needed to be primed for every action could constrain the Committee undesirably, tying its hands to act or not at certain times depending on market preparation In these regards, market surprise is just the counterpart of macroeconomic uncertainty and flexibility in policymaking But surprise can also grow out of misunderstanding If markets are to have a chance to perform their stabilizing roles, they need to understand the concerns of the Committee and the risks it sees These can be clarified in the Minutes and elsewhere without pre-committing the Committee to particular policy actions or necessarily expecting that the markets will share the Committee's views and expectations   We have a modest deceleration in bank balance sheets in the fourth  quarter We do not have a major deceleration Let me start with the bank balance sheet picture  We do not find the relationship between those balance sheets and money growth to be very tight  Certainly, the relationship between M2 growth and bank balance sheets is not at all tight There are  just too many other sources of funds for banks besides M2 funds In fact, we have found that the  relationship of the balance sheets and M3 also has not been very tight One reason is that when  banks substitute domestic dollar borrowings for Eurodollar borrowings, that tends to boost M3  growth and vice-versa The other factor has to do with the institution-only money funds There has  been a trend for those money funds to compete aggressively for corporate cash management  business In effect, corporations are moving away from the management of their own liquidity by  putting it in the hands of the institution-only money funds We include the institution-only money  funds in M3; we do not include corporations' own direct holdings of commercial paper or Treasury  bills Therefore, that substitution also has tended to cut the link between M3 and bank credit We  look at that when we do our M3 projections We try to make sure the residual funding of bank  credit, other than that provided by the monetary aggregates, is sensible, but we do not force M2,  M3, and bank credit to conform to the same growth path We see a little slowing in bank credit  growth in the fourth quarter, but not much It has been very strong Business loan growth in  particular has been very robust, and we think that such growth will slow a little but still remain  quite high We have some further increase in business borrowing needs and some flattening out, to  a certain extent at least, in the growth of profits   We track M2 growth to the projected increases in nominal GDP The  slowing in the fourth quarter in M2 growth arises largely from our sense that there has been a lot of  M2 built up over the months of the third quarter There is enough to finance the nominal GDP that  is forecast for the fourth quarter In fact, there is almost more than enough because, even with our  projected slowing in M2 growth, we have a slight decline in velocity predicted for the fourth  quarter, which is an unusual event these days Basically, we are saying that there is enough  liquidity out there to finance the predicted nominal GDP with only moderate further M2 growth If  we saw much more rapid further growth, we would wonder why people are accumulating those M2  assets We would have to look carefully There could be an asset allocation situation that was not  related to spending, but it could also be that people were realizing more income and doing more  spending "
4759,1997-11-12," It is true that the indexed bond went down several basis points,  particularly on the day of the sharp market break So, I think there was a flight to both of the  securities It had been our interpretation as well, at least for a while, that if investors were going    11/12/97 15  to get into something liquid, they would choose nominal bonds But as markets settled over the  next few days--and they are still skittish and volatilities are still a bit higher than earlier--it struck  me that some of that effect would have played out The fact that this spread may be down 10  basis points on net--and I may be reading this a little too finely--suggests, if anything, that  inflation expectations have come down There is every reason to think that they might have All  the external events were playing in that direction, and certainly the tone of the discussions in the  press and in the market was that events were having a disinflationary or even deflationary effect  on the US economy   Both the Desk and the Board staff have been using the standard  deviation data for analytical purposes to see whether the character of the market is changing in  any way as reserve balances decline There is no reason why the market cannot have the same  data for analytical purposes "
4760,1997-11-12," I would only add that it is always hard to predict how markets are going  to react to a policy move, but if you do something unexpected in a skittish and nervous market, it  would seem to me that predicting the outcome is much more difficult in that case The chances  of outlier kinds of responses are somewhat higher   As I looked at this analysis in relation to the scenarios at the end of the  Greenbook, it seemed to me that the effects were somewhere between the baseline and the tighter  scenario in terms of GDP growth Remember that the tighter scenario in effect keeps inflation  from rising As I will say in my briefing later, it seems to me the ""worst"" case scenario still  leaves the tightening move an open question "
4761,1997-11-12," Thank you, Mr Chairman At your last meeting, many Committee members were concerned that financial conditions were too accommodative to prevent strength in aggregate demand from raising resource utilization from already elevated levels, and hence imparting--or perhaps accentuating--an upward trend to inflation in 1998 and 1999 Indeed, there was a sense that tightening would be needed soon, perhaps at this meeting, if the expansion in economic activity did not demonstrate signs of slowing to a more sustainable pace  In fact, the information becoming available since the meeting has shown economic growth continuing to exceed the growth of potential and utilization rates rising As a consequence, a number of market commentators have suggested that, in the absence of financial market turmoil, the Committee would have been highly likely to tighten at this meeting In my remarks, I will begin by examining some of the arguments behind this proposition, before turning to possible implications for policy of the turmoil itself    11/12/97  Strong growth and rising utilization rates would weigh on the side of policy firming Not only has the unemployment rate fallen, and to the lowest level in several decades, but manufacturing capacity utilization has risen to its highest level in 2-3/4 years Moreover, with final demand exceptionally robust, prospects are good that the expansion of output will continue to exceed the growth of potential, as indeed it does for a while in the staff forecast However uncertain the Committee might be about the NAIRU or the level of potential output, the chance that inflation will increase goes up with the level of resource utilization From this perspective, if the Committee were concerned about the stance of policy before, other things equal it ought to be more so when the unemployment rate falls and capacity utilization rises, especially since the movements in both variables were larger than anticipated As the Chairman has pointed out, a track for economic growth that continues to erode slack in available resources is, by definition, not sustainable It was concern about a similar set of circumstances that led to the policy tightening of last March, and a forecast that resource utilization would continue to rise would be the strongest argument for a near-term tightening of policy, even before early signs of cost and price pressures began to emerge  But, of course, other things have not been equal, and not only in worldwide financial markets On the economic side, inflation continues to decline by many measures, generally falling short of expectations One reason for this has been an uptick in productivity growth, which is holding down unit labor costs These developments have contributed to a marking down of the staff forecast for future inflation, and they provide some offset in several respects to the signal for higher rates coming from robust increases in output First, policy need not be as tight as it otherwise might be because lower inflation means the Committee is not as far above price stability--or any interim inflation objective--as it previously might have thought, both now and likely prospectively  Second, improved price and productivity performance has boosted estimates of the growth of the economy's potential and shaded down notions of the range of unemployment rates that might be associated with rising inflation As a consequence, at least in the Greenbook, the surprisingly strong expansion of real output and the decline in the unemployment rate so far this year have not resulted in as large an output gap as might have been expected from previous estimates of potential output Moreover, continuing surprises in the output-inflation nexus suggest that high levels of uncertainty about underlying relationships persist and may indicate added caution before    11/12/97  tightening in the absence of more concrete signs of oncoming cost or price pressures  Third, the recent inflation performance has probably fed through to lower inflation expectations It does appear that inflation expectations have been edging lower--at least judging from the behavior of nominal Treasury interest rates relative to rates on inflation-protected securities Decreases in inflation expectations, if prevalent among households and businesses as well as among bond investors, would themselves tend to hold down any incipient increase in inflation, at least for a time Moreover, declining inflation expectations have raised real short-term rates as the Committee has held the nominal funds rate unchanged  Thus, recent domestic macroeconomic developments by themselves-- encompassing the news on prices and productivity as well as on resource utilization--would not suggest that the case for a rise in the nominal federal funds rate had gotten overwhelmingly stronger, even in the absence of market turmoil  In the staff forecast, the current level of the nominal funds rate was too low to contain inflation in the September Greenbook, and it remains so in the projections for the current meeting An important reason for this is that financial conditions, broadly defined, do not appear restrictive or moving very much in that direction, even after recent market movements It is difficult to see evidence that higher short-term real rates are being reflected in most other financial variables in the transmission channel or are restraining interest-sensitive spending Intermediate- and longer-term real rates, for example, appear to be unchanged or even a little lower over recent months, judging either from the rates on inflation-protected securities or from real yields calculated by subtracting survey-based measures of inflation from nominal yields And funds continue to be available to businesses on favorable terms in equity and bond markets and at financial intermediaries In sum, there does not appear to have been any appreciable change in the interest rates or credit conditions that have fueled continued above-trend growth Moreover, without trying to put too fine a point on it, the recent behavior of money does not suggest that households or depositories are facing any greater constraints on their liquidity While money growth has been moderating in recent months, it has been doing so from unusually rapid rates earlier in the summer, and the deceleration is in line with expectations for M2 based on the Greenbook forecast, and somewhat less than expected for M3    11/12/97  The staff forecast does embody some effects on US economic performance from the recent worldwide market turmoil, but those effects are limited and they do not damp activity enough to forestall a rise in inflation Indeed, the need for eventual policy tightening would still be a close call in  the staff's ""worst case scenario""  If, in light of the risk of increasing inflation pressures, the Committee were inclined to tighten at an early date, global financial developments might still suggest reasons to postpone action, at least for a short time, to assess ongoing market conditions here and abroad and their economic implications The effects of recent developments abroad on the United States depend importantly on how political and economic systems in affected countries respond and to what degree skepticism about the prospects for emerging markets spreads to other countries, some of whom are important to us as financial and trading partners As Ted noted, the course of events abroad appears to present a greater risk of damping than of boosting economic growth relative to the Greenbook forecast  Right now, a firming would come as a complete surprise to market participants Partly, this reflects the fact that the FOMC's assessment of inflation risks is not generally shared by investors Not only do futures market rates indicate that markets do not expect tightening in the near term, but the flat yield curve can be read as expressing very low odds on rising interest rates for some time to come  Market participants also perceive the skittishness of markets themselves as another impediment to tightening at this meeting It is difficult to predict the response of nervous markets to an unanticipated policy action I suspect that interest rates would ratchet substantially higher across the yield curve, as investors reassessed not only their read on Federal Reserve intentions but also perhaps marked up their evaluation of the risk of inflation itself, given the Federal Reserve's evident concern The chance of outsized spillovers to markets abroad--with feedback perhaps to the United States--would seem to be magnified in the current situation, especially because such an action, coming on the heels of the Canadian, German, and British tightenings, might suggest to markets a general trend of rising rates in industrial countries  By themselves, skittish markets and unpredictable effects are not reasons to avoid firming policy if the Committee saw appreciable inflation pressures developing fairly soon, particularly as those pressures would only build if needed action were postponed In such a situation, a sizable correction in debt and equity markets would be an integral aspect of    11/12/97 90  monetary restraint Delaying action might only impose more disruptive adjustments later, especially if it were feared that delay would only feed the over-optimism of markets In that regard, one lesson from the turbulence of recent weeks is the resilience of US asset markets, undergirded by the apparently deep-seated optimism of investors The wild swings in financial prices and the front-page coverage they received would seem to have given investors reason enough to re-examine risks and risk-adjusted returns Yet the net change in equity prices and risk spreads in the United States has turned out to be quite small If the FOMC believes that financial conditions broadly defined are independently restraining demand, sufficiently less accommodative conditions are unlikely to evolve by themselves Still, if economic circumstances were not seen as indicating a pressing need for action in the near term, the Committee very well could favor waiting a bit Delay would give it the opportunity to see where and whether markets do settle down and to better assess spillover effects on the US economy "
4814,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Committee's decisions at this meeting, with respect both to its immediate posture in reserve markets and to the symmetry or asymmetry in its directive, entail weighing actual evidence of strong domestic economic activity against the prospective effects on the US economy of financial and economic developments abroad and the possible interaction of any Federal Reserve action with conditions in foreign markets  Incoming data have indicated on balance that the US economy has continued to grow at an unsustainable pace Labor markets have tightened further and give more suggestions of mounting pressure on wages While there are hints on the spending side of some slackening in demand, this    12/16/97  could well be another brief pause in inherently noisy statistics; judging from continuing low levels of initial claims, employers have not yet trimmed their hiring in response to actual or prospective softening of growth in sales Moreover, with the important exception of the dollar, financial market conditions remain at least as accommodative as those that have been associated with persistent rapid expansion this year In fact, bond yields are noticeably lower than they have been for some time--including rates on corporate bonds despite a slight rise in risk premia Although much of the decline in longer-term interest rates since earlier this year is probably accounted for by lower inflation expectations, real bond rates likely are no higher than they were over recent quarters, and they could be lower Equity prices remain near the much higher levels reached over the spring and summer, holding down the cost of capital and boosting wealth And we see no signs of additional caution by banks and other lenders in advancing credit The ample availability of credit and liquidity is reflected in robust growth of late in broad measures of money In the staff forecast, although the economy slows substantially, the level of output remains beyond its estimated long-run potential, and the resulting updrift in underlying inflation begins to emerge in the second half of next year Taken by themselves, these circumstances might suggest serious consideration be given to firming policy  But developments overseas provide the important counterweight to those at home The dollar is higher against a broad array of currencies, as Ted discussed Appreciation against the Asian currencies transmits a portion of the negative spending shocks those economies are experiencing to the United States Demands from Asia for our exports are further damped by lower incomes there and possibly by financing problems that will also constrain their ability to import until confidence in their financial systems returns And the dollar has risen against the currencies of industrial economies of Europe, putting even more downward pressure on demand and prices in the United States Lower oil prices will reduce near-term inflation, though they will also boost aggregate demand Changes in the level of the dollar and oil prices can leave a more lasting imprint on inflation by reducing inflation expectations a little Altogether, these influences will override any increases in underlying inflation pressures in the next few quarters and could well help to keep inflation relatively subdued over a longer period without policy tightening, as now embodied in the staff forecast  By the way the financial markets have shaken off incoming data, it appears that investors have placed much more weight on the potential effects of weakness abroad than on current pressures on resources at home Not only have long-term rates fallen half a percentage point since the    12/16/97  turmoil intensified in October, but commodity prices have dropped substantially in reaction to the stronger dollar and prospects for weaker global demand However, markets do not seem to be anticipating that problems abroad will on balance weaken US economic performance substantially The resilience of equity markets indicates that, aside from companies with high Asian exposures, investors do not see the foreign difficulties as exerting enough restraint on demand and prices in the United States to impair earnings prospects materially Some of the decline in long-term interest rates, probably impossible to quantify, is associated with a flight to quality Even allowing for such distortions, however, the flatness of the yield curve suggests that market participants expect short-term rates to remain near current levels well into the future, implying that they do not anticipate inflation pressures--or economic weakness--that would require much action on your part  Notwithstanding the assessment of the markets and the staff, the Committee still may view policy as somewhat more accommodative than desirable at this level of labor utilization It could be concerned that the staff and the markets have overestimated the impact of foreign difficulties on the United States Or the Committee could view as inconsistent with its own long-run goals the uptilt of inflation in the staff forecast or level of inflation expectations still embodied in long-term market interest rates Nonetheless, there would seem to be reasons to consider postponing a corresponding tightening action One reason would be the effect any tightening might have on global markets To be sure, several countries have tightened policy since the problems intensified in October, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Sweden But their combined GDPs do not approach that of the United States and, more importantly, their currencies do not play the lynch-pin role of the dollar, which is, among other things, the currency of denomination for many of the debts of troubled Asian countries By itself, a 25 basis point increase in short-term dollar rates would not add appreciably to the burdens of these borrowers, whose principal problems center around doubts they can roll over their debts But higher rates and the associated strengthening of the dollar would not make their task any easier And, unexpected tightening in tender markets does risk an outsized response, here and abroad, especially if markets extrapolate further policy action  In addition, the cost of waiting for economic and market conditions to become clearer could be viewed as rather small, even if foreign and US economies turn out to be stronger than the staff expects With inflation already low and declining and with inflation expectations, by some measures, still above actual inflation, these expectations are unlikely to turn around very quickly Moreover, some of the influences that will be    12/16/97  restraining prices in the near term should persist in any event The dollar is unlikely to roll back soon all of its recent increases, even if foreign markets begin to recover, because the level of demand overseas will remain depressed And oil prices should be held down for some time by greater OPEC production and smaller world demand, even if not by as much as the staff is forecasting It might be important to firm policy promptly if growth in the United States appeared to be continuing at a rapid enough pace to tighten labor markets further, but in the current circumstances it seems unlikely that the Committee would find itself seriously ""behind the curve,"" in the sense of chasing rising inflation expectations, if it waited until it had additional information on foreign markets and the domestic outlook  There is always a temptation to await more evidence on the state of the economy, and the inertia this can impart to policymaking can lead to policy errors that end up creating or accentuating business cycles However, the range of possible outcomes for the economy would appear especially large at this time, given conflicting signals from data and projections and the fluid state of foreign markets and economies Among those outcomes is the possibility that problems abroad could exert sufficient restraint on the US economy to warrant monetary policy easing This possibility is what led us to reintroduce an easing alternative in the Bluebook after a prolonged absence In that regard, some outside economists have marked down their forecasts for the United States by more than Board staff owing to these events And, even if the staff's baseline is the best modal forecast, the Committee might perceive some odds--albeit small--of an even worse market disruption that could spread further and feed back more forcefully on the US economy and financial markets In something like the ""worse case"" scenario presented by Ted, it would be important for you to ease to cushion the effects on the United States and other economies, as was assumed in that exercise And the worse case did not encompass a freeze up of markets and credit availability in affected countries, which could constrain their imports even more for a time  If the Committee, like the market and the staff, now sees a more balanced set of risks going forward, including the possibility of needing to ease, it might want to reconsider the asymmetry in its directive Retaining the current asymmetry could be justified on the grounds that in a fundamental sense the balance of risks remains tilted toward higher inflation Persistent strength in domestic demand is likely to keep the economy producing beyond most estimates of its potential for some time At some point, escalating labor costs should begin to pressure prices, and the sooner this situation is addressed, the less disruptive will be the correction Moreover, of course, the Committee could ease its policy stance from an asymmetric directive toward tightening if circumstances changed    12/16/97 66  enough But the Committee may view the odds on tightening over the intermediate term as having receded considerably, especially with price increases likely to be damped for a while And it might want to put some weight on the original purpose of the sentences in question--that is, possible policy actions over the intermeeting period--if it considers there to be some potential that a worsening situation would call for a prompt response If the Committee shares these perspectives, symmetry might better represent the contingencies it sees confronting policy "
4865,1998-02-03," I was going to comment that over the last couple of months in  particular the markets seem to have had a weaker picture of the outlook for economic  growth and inflation than many economists The markets seem to be building in a softer  path for short-term rates, even making the allowances that Peter mentioned, than have  most economists So, it is very hard to tell what would be a disappointment and what  would not The other point, just to reinforce what Mike said, is that expectations relating  to the economic outlook seem to have a lot to do with the timing of the Asian effects on  the US economy The question is not whether they will hit shortly but whether the  markets will see them coming The fact that growth in the first half of the year might  prove to be a little stronger than expected would not have much effect on markets if  market participants had some hints that the Asian effects were yet to come down the road  So, I think we have to look past the first half to see how markets would react    2/3-4/98   In a technical memo that was circulated some six months ago, we  put in stock and bond mutual funds, and we came away at that time with some sense that  when the growth of those funds was strong, M2 was weak So, that result gave us a little  confirmation of a tradeoff Recently, I saw a chart that suggested the two had become  more positively correlated For example, stock mutual fund flows were extremely strong  in the second half of last year; M2 also was strong But income growth likewise was  very strong, so the economy was generating a lot of savings that were allocated to both I  still think some of the evidence points to a bit of a tradeoff there, but we do not feel very  confident that we have pinned down the substitution between capital market mutual funds  and M2    2/3-4/98   The original equation of a year or so ago had income in it, so  income was being taken into account I don't know about the more recent modeling  experience As I noted, the chart that I saw suggested that the two recently had tended to  move together, but I don't know whether income was held constant in the model   It is a different form   When it was widened, Governor Gramlich, it was as a result of  some increasing uncertainty about what demand for M2 would be consistent with the  Committee's expectations for nominal GDP over the coming year, especially since M2  does retain considerable response to opportunity costs At the beginning of 1988, the  Committee did not know whether interest rates would be rising or falling The members  were a little uncertain about the position of the demand curve as well In order to have  the ranges reflect both uncertainties, interest rates and position of the demand curve, they  widened them to four percentage points   The law requires that you indicate your plans and objectives for the  growth of money and credit "
4866,1998-02-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will provide you with some more impalpable, intellectual product that you probably would pay me not to give you [Laughter] I will spend a few minutes discussing the long-run scenarios in the Bluebook and use them as a lead-in to a discussion of the stance of policy  The Bluebook simulations examine the implications of the staff Greenbook forecast beyond 1999 and look at a few of the forces that could cause the economy to deviate from that baseline In that risk assessment, we chose perturbations to the international and productivity assumptions underlying the staff forecast That is not only because those are the areas where everyone is most uncertain, but also because earlier changes on both these fronts have been important in the baseline forecast For that reason, the simulations can illuminate key characteristics of the baseline forecast  The alternative international developments were modeled as a prolonged Asian shock--that is, a recovery of the Asian economies that begins much later than assumed in the Greenbook--reflecting the risks that structural problems may be less tractable, or the political will to deal with them more ephemeral, than assumed Greater weakness in Asian economies in the out years is transmitted to us in part through a stronger dollar, in much the same manner as are the current Asian problems that are already built into the baseline In some respects, this simulation also mimics the effects on the US economy in the baseline of the substantial rise of the dollar before the Asian crisis hit, though that rise reflected strength at home as well as weakness abroad  Similarly, the productivity shock--one percentage point faster growth than in the baseline--may pinpoint some of the effects of the apparent pickup in productivity already being felt in the economy Last year, the staff raised its estimate of trend productivity by 1/4 percentage point, and some of you have voiced suspicions that the gains may be more  The ""shocks"" are alike in one important respect Both involve favorable supply developments that put downward pressure on prices at any level of output, through lower import prices in one case and lower unit labor costs in the other Consequently, in both cases, the unemployment rate can run below the NAIRU for a time without generating a pickup in inflation But the simulations provide the cautionary note that these favorable effects on inflation are temporary The lower unemployment rate may look like a reduced NAIRU, but inflation will begin to pick up if unemployment is held at that lower rate, even if the dollar remains at its elevated level or the trend in productivity is tilted up permanently    2/3-4/98  In the baseline scenario, mild underlying inflation pressures begin to emerge in 2000 as the effects of the higher dollar of recent years ebb, nominal compensation rises to reflect higher productivity, and other favorable supply developments wear off That situation is exacerbated by the swing to a declining real value of the dollar, which, by raising import prices faster than domestic prices, places upward pressure on inflation that must be offset by keeping the unemployment rate a little above the NAIRU In actuality, any decline in the dollar would not follow the smooth path of the baseline, but rather will occur in fits and starts, which will affect the dynamics of the adjustment of prices and output But the important point is that the dollar is more likely to fall than to rise over the long run, given what would otherwise be an unsustainable path of the current account Such a development will leave the Committee with less pleasant choices than has the dollar appreciation of recent years  In contrast to their effects on aggregate supply, the two shocks have very different implications for demand and, hence, for interest rates Weaker Asian economies reduce demand and require an easier policy relative to the baseline to keep the economy on track In the simulation, the added weakness of Asian economies effectively eliminates the need for the Committee to raise rates to contain inflation and calls for a modest easing at some point, leaving the funds rate about 75 basis points below the baseline for a time The additional shock is somewhat smaller than the staffs baseline estimate of the Asian difficulties about to hit our economy, which have been largely responsible for eliminating the 100 basis points of tightening that had been built into the Greenbook last summer  Despite the effects of weaker Asian economies, the relatively high level of real short-term interest rates that has developed over the last year or so persists in the baseline The productivity simulation may give some insight into the good performance of the economy even as the real funds rate remains well above its long-run experience A faster trend for productivity increases demand substantially, as the accelerator effects associated with attempts to keep capital growing in pace with the more rapid growth in output cause investment to jump, and as consumption rises with permanent income However, supply only picks up gradually, in line with faster productivity growth, and real interest rates must increase to forestall inflation  Indeed, strength in consumption and investment in recent years --driven in part by elevated profits and their effects on the stock market, as might be expected from a pickup in productivity--are an important reason why demand has remained robust despite high real interest rates Of course, possible productivity increases are not the only factor that have been buoying spending at high real interest rates Another important influence has been that in virtually all other respects financial conditions have been quite accommodative Greater appetite for risk or perhaps perceptions that risk is now lower have helped to raise equity prices and have made credit available at exceptionally narrow spreads And the level of    2/3-4/98  short-term rates does not seem to have materially impeded declines in nominal and perhaps real long-term interest rates last year, helping to bolster demand In the baseline, favorable credit and equity market conditions erode to a limited degree and real rates only edge lower before they need to rise once again for a time to counter the effects of dollar depreciation, remaining above their long-term values for some time  Interest rates should be above equilibrium when the economy is operating beyond its sustainable potential and inflation threatens to rise to levels the Committee does not find acceptable In large measure, the real short-term rate got to its current high level under such circumstances--though the methodology was a little unusual The Committee tightened last March, and many members found reassurance in the subsequent, so-called ""passive"" firming of the real funds rate over the rest of the year as inflation, and presumably inflation expectations, fell This firming occurred with other financial conditions accommodative, the output gap widening as the economy remained on a seemingly unsustainable track, and inflation projected to rise  But Asian developments and incoming data have altered circumstances and projections over recent months The central tendency of the Committee members' inflation forecast for 1998 has dropped 3/4 percentage point since July, while the members' expectations for the unemployment rate at the end of this year are only a touch lower In the past, for given levels of the output gap, the Committee has tended to move the nominal funds rate with the inflation rate--in fact by more, to ensure against getting ""behind the curve"" in countering either inflation or economic weakness  In light of the level of the real funds rate and the way it came about, the Committee may see it as imparting a downside risk to the outlook If so, the Committee might want to be especially alert to further increases through declining inflation expectations, and to signs that its high or rising level--or greater concern about risk by savers--was feeding through substantially to financial markets more generally and threatening to damp demand more than the Committee desired Prompt response to such signs or to unexpected weakness in demand, say because the Asian situation was having a bigger effect than expected, might be called for With trend inflation already at a low rate, the Committee might want to be cautious about taking the ""opportunity"" to let it drop substantially further Moreover, in the context of a yield curve that already has built in some easing, market perceptions that the Committee was unlikely to validate its expectations might temper the response of long-term rates to further adverse demand surprises We don't have much experience with the evolution of steeply downward sloping yield curves arrived at by declining long-term rates  So far, however, high real short-term interest rates do not seem to have greatly affected other financial conditions, except perhaps for the dollar Financial    2/3-4/98  markets are still accommodative overall, judging from the rise in equity prices, the drop in bond yields, the further narrowing of loan spreads at banks, and robust growth in the monetary and credit aggregates As a consequence, and perhaps because potential productivity gains and stock market advances continue to fuel spending, increases in real short-term rates and in exchange rates do not yet seem to have impinged substantially on demand Strength in hiring persists, judging from low initial claims Labor markets remain quite tight and wages may be on more of an uptrend than the staff has assumed In these circumstances, the risks may look balanced to the Committee Against the backdrop of the more robust economic projections of Committee members compared to those of the staff, whether the future drag on demand from the Asian crisis will be enough to stem potential inflationary pressures is uncertain  Moreover, the anomalous position of tight labor markets but damped inflation probably buys the Committee breathing room to await some clarification of developments in either direction before reacting, without risking a serious deterioration of economic performance If escalating compensation and narrowing profit margins suggest that inflation pressures are turning out stronger than expected, damped actual price increases as the higher dollar and lower oil prices feed through will keep inflation expectations down and add a little incremental restraint in the form of a higher real federal funds rate until the Committee responds A weaker-than-expected economy will only tend to bring forward in time what may be a required easing of pressure on labor markets now built into the staff forecast, and the Committee should have time to react before the economy overshoots on the downside In either circumstance, however, delay could easily become excessive, and a sluggish response awaiting unambiguous confirmation of the economy's direction could accentuate volatility in output and prices Thank you, Mr Chairman   I tried to indicate in my briefing that I do not place much confidence  in that measure at this point for the reasons you cited, President Jordan, and certainly that  notion is inherent in the staff forecast We have the real funds rate staying rather high It  edges off a little measured against backward-looking inflation indexes because inflation  edges up a little in the forecast Even so, it remains at a rather high level In the forecast,  that is perfectly consistent with moderate growth in output and essentially contained  inflation pressures though the latter increase a little by the end of the period So, I don't  think there is anything in the staff forecast that fundamentally contradicts what you are  saying I do think a lot of people are looking at this relatively high real short-term rate A  number of members mentioned it yesterday I think it introduces a bit of a cautionary  note here In fact, the real funds rate got to its current level because the Committee did  not change the nominal rate as inflation expectations came down Ordinarily, the  Committee does follow inflation expectations I think it had good reason not to do so last  summer, but the way you got into this situation is a bit unusual We do not have evidence  that the high real funds rate is somehow pulling up longer-term rates but that could  happen I was trying to convey the view that if I were in the members' position, I would  be looking for some evidence that the real rate was high and rising and beginning to affect  other financial conditions The way I was looking at it and the way I tried to voice it here    2/3-4/98  was as an element of caution It is something to look at but we do not see any evidence at  this point that it is feeding through to financial markets or certainly to demand   I see two aspects to that, President Hoenig The model is driving  the simulations In the model, there is a NAIRU and if we put pressure on the labor  markets, eventually that will show through in terms of rising labor compensation That in  turn will feed through to inflation if the unemployment rate stays below the NAIRU In  fact, we are very uncertain about the level of the NAIRU, and some of these supply  shocks could be affecting it in a more permanent way The cautionary note that I tried to  sound in this regard was that some of those shocks may look as if they are lowering the  NAIRU, and the productivity shock is a very good example That was a big shock, a one  percentage point shock It provided an example of a situation where you could keep the  unemployment rate low and have low inflation for a while Then you had a choice as to  how you wanted to take the effect ultimately, whether as permanently low inflation or an  extended stretch of low unemployment But I think it is possible for supply shocks to  fool us to some extent into thinking we have a lower NAIRU and that these favorable    2/3-4/98  price surprises--there is a choice between taking them in the form of inflation or in  output--are permanent In most analyses, they are not permanent We can have more  output for a while, but at some point the unemployment rate has to return to where it was,  and how much we take in output will determine whether we end up in a lower, the same,  or a higher inflation track   Absolutely   I'm not aware of any asymmetry in the modeling exercises, but I  think there is asymmetry in the normal course of raising and lowering rates One point  that I tried to convey and have the Committee begin to think about relates to situations  when inflation and nominal interest rates are down to very low levels, though we  certainly are not there We have a nominal funds rate of 5-1/2 percent right now But one    2/3-4/98  can imagine the economy running along at a 1 percent inflation rate and a 2 or 3 percent  nominal funds rate The economy then gets hit by a shock, and policymakers have that  zero constraint on the nominal funds rate that is bedeviling the Japanese right now So,  there are some asymmetries from that perspective There is no limit on how high a  nominal rate can go, but there is a downside limit at zero There is potential asymmetry  with regard to the zero level on nominal wages that others have talked about If inflation  is very low or has started to go down to very low levels, there might be more adverse  tradeoffs on inflation on the Phillips curve basis because people are reluctant to reduce  nominal wages We have seen no evidence of that, but that is something that people have  been concerned about in the past So, one thing that is being discussed now, and this is  perhaps relevant to what Governor Meyer was saying before, is that we have inflation  down so low or potentially getting so low, particularly if it falls short of current forecasts,  that it affects how we think about monetary policy President McTeer's rule of thumb  yesterday was to subtract a percentage point from the staff's inflation projection   You have a low rate of inflation and you might at least have in mind  some asymmetries in the context of low inflation, particularly if it turns out to be much  below 2 percent   If we are at a very low rate of inflation    2/3-4/98   Ideally, of course, you want to have good foresight and act in a  forward-looking way in both directions Because inflation has been above its long-run  target for a long time, the Committee may have a tendency to be a little more sluggish to  react to downside shocks After all, if inflation comes down another 1/4 or 1/2 percentage  point, that is a great result But at some point, you have to consider whether you need to  change that kind of response If you are more sluggish on the downside than on the  upside, for example, as is captured in some opportunistic kinds of scenarios, then you  need to think about changing that sort of reaction as the economy gets to lower levels of  inflation There is the Japanese risk, if I can label it as such   You can see that by looking at the two lines showing the rate of  unemployment We have a sacrifice ratio of 2-1/2 over 5 years So, in order to get the  inflation rate down by 1 percentage point relative to the baseline, you need to hold the  unemployment rate above the NAIRU for 21/2 point years, or 1 point for 2-1/2 years,  however you want to think of it That is the sacrifice ratio I can give you some--   Right In the price stability alternative, GDP in the years 2001,  2002, and 2003 is growing about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent less rapidly than in the baseline In  those years we have baseline GDP growing at rates of 2 to 2-1/2 percent So, we never get  a recession in this alternative strategy   It comes really close Growth has to be slow enough to raise the  unemployment rate above the NAIRU We already have in the staff forecast a growth in  output that is below potential and that has the effect of getting the unemployment rate up  You have to have a number of more years of that in the virtual price stability simulation "
4915,1998-03-31," I think the higher receipts in the New York forecast carry through the  end of the fiscal year In fact, I think New York has an even larger difference in its forecast of  the fiscal year surplus because there are some factors other than receipts affecting their surplus  estimates But you are correct, Mr Chairman The difference is not simply the result of a  displacement from quarter to quarter; New York has a much larger surplus    3/31/98   But wouldn't it also reflect, President Jordan, the expectation that,  unless there was a negative term premium, nominal short-term rates would fall at some point so  that the expected holding period yield from rolling over overnight instruments and two-year  instruments would be equal   Right, because inflation would come down and short-term rates would  move up    3/31/98 "
4916,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman Governor Phillips and a number of others mentioned money growth in their presentations, and I thought this might be one of those infrequent occasions when discussion of this subject would be helpful I will begin with some comments on the surprising strength in money growth and use that as a lead-in to issues involved in the Committee's current policy I will be using the chart that was distributed this morning 2 My remarks will focus on M2 because that aggregate has been the one most closely associated with spending since deposit rates were deregulated in the early 1980s and, consequently, the aggregate most closely followed by the Committee and the staff over that period  As can be seen in the upper left-hand panel, M2 growth has been accelerating over the last few quarters The pickup in growth in the second half of last year and the first quarter of 1998 does not appear to be a result of increasingly faster growth of nominal GDP, at least based on the Greenbook forecast of current-quarter GDP  Instead, as is evident in the upper right panel, velocity turned down in the second half of 1997 following several years in which a residual uptrend in velocity persisted, even after the major shifts of the early 1990s And that decline seems to have become faster in 1998 despite unchanged opportunity costs as conventionally measured  The middle panel lists a few hypotheses for why velocity may be declining First, some special factors have artificially boosted M2 growth relative to spending toward the end of last year and early in 1998 These have included continued strong overseas currency shipments, enlarged mortgage refinancings, which tend to be associated with temporary deposits in liquid accounts, the effects of accelerated tax refunds and, perhaps, the recent buildup of balances in anticipation of outsized tax bills Still, we believe that these special factors can account for only a small part of M2 growth in the fourth and first quarters and none of the surprise because we basically had anticipated them in January  A second influence that may be giving an unusual boost to M2 growth is the flat yield curve Savers sacrifice very little current return, reduce their exposure to capital loss, and gain liquidity when they de-emphasize longer-term fixed-rate investments in favor of liquid assets in M2 In fact,  2 A copy of the chart used by Mr Kohn is appended to the transcript (Appendix 2)    3/31/98  almost all the growth in M2 in the last two quarters has been in its liquid components--money market funds and savings deposits Moreover, we saw evidence of such a redirection of savings flows in accelerated runoffs of noncompetitive tenders at Treasury note and bill auctions late last year But in recent months those runoffs have slackened a bit, and flows into bond mutual funds have been fairly robust, so such shifts probably do not account for the further pickup in M2 growth this year  A third possibility is household efforts to rebalance asset portfolios Although the ratio of M2 to GDP has been rising in recent quarters, M2 is becoming a much smaller proportion of household wealth owing to the tremendous rise in the market value of equities In response, people could be diverting more current savings or the proceeds of securities sales to M2 to restore desired risk exposures While this explanation is plausible, one has to wonder why such shifts have begun in the last few quarters when equity prices have been skyrocketing for several years  Fourth, some scale variable other than GDP or wealth may be driving M2 demand, or current-quarter GDP may be underestimated Income has been growing faster than published or estimated GDP, and so, too, in most quarters including the first, has private domestic spending In the past, these alternative scale variables have been no better related to M2 over the long run than has nominal GDP But our standard model does use consumption spending to explain short-run movements in M2, and people may be accumulating relatively large amounts of M2 to support current and future private spending, whose growth, owing to a widening trade deficit and damped government outlays, is outstripping that of GDP And, as Mike Prell noted earlier, the rapid growth of employment in the current quarter may be telling us that GDP is stronger than estimated in the Greenbook  Lastly, the money demand relationship has always been fairly noisy--even in previous decades when, in hindsight, it seems to have been well-behaved Innovations over the past 20 years, which have made a broader menu of financial assets more readily and inexpensively available to households, should only have added to that noise We have never been able to identify all the factors affecting M2 demand, especially over periods as short as a few quarters, and undoubtedly my list misses some that are relevant now This uncertainty raises questions about the implications of unexpected variations in M2 growth over relatively short time frames for the Committee's objectives for spending or prices As a consequence, since the early 1980s the Committee has been unwilling to tie its behavior too closely to M2 or to any other monetary indicator  As you can see in the bottom panel, M2 growth over a year's time had a strong association with future spending in the 1960s and 1970s But that relationship has weakened considerably in the 1980s and 1990s, even    3/31/98  outside the velocity-shift years of the early 1990s The earlier leading indicator properties worked importantly through differential lags in the responses of money and spending to changes in interest rates If, for example, the Federal Reserve, seeing money and economic activity growing too rapidly, raised interest rates, financial portfolios would be reallocated fairly promptly out of money, whose rates tended to adjust sluggishly, into market instruments, but spending tended to be trimmed much more slowly Hence, money would weaken before the economy For money to be a leading indicator through this mechanism, the Federal Reserve needed to react to contemporaneous or lagging indicators of the economy and it needed to move short-term interest rates substantially to affect opportunity costs Since the early 1980s, the Federal Reserve has become increasingly more anticipatory, in effect changing short-term interest rates--and, implicitly, money stock growth--to head off swings in GDP, which were then more damped And, of course, in the last few years the Committee has not had to move short-term rates very much, leaving M2 largely to fluctuate passively with contemporaneous spending So it is not surprising that the reliability of M2 as a leading indicator has been considerably reduced  That does not mean the monetary surge in 1997 and early this year can be ignored, aside from the possible implication that contemporaneous GDP may be higher than the staff is forecasting The portfolio shift that has raised M2 relative to income results importantly from more accommodative conditions in key sectors of domestic financial markets over recent quarters The decline in nominal long-term rates, which has flattened the yield curve and spurred mortgage refinancing, and the rise in equity values, which has elevated tax obligations and increased asset portfolios, have boosted both M2 and spending And we haven't discussed M3, whose very rapid expansion is related in large measure to accelerating credit growth at depository institutions, which, in turn, is part of a broader pickup in the availability and use of credit The relationship between money and current or future spending may not be very tight, but from this perspective strong growth of money reinforces the message from other financial market indicators that financial conditions are quite supportive of domestic spending, once we look past the level of the real federal funds rate  It was those financial conditions, along with the lagged multiplier- accelerator effects of recent economic strength that led the staff to raise the level of spending throughout the forecast period To some extent, the staff projection may simply be catching up to the Committee, but the recent upward revisions do highlight the risks in the outlook Even in January, the forecasts of both the staff and FOMC members portrayed the economy as operating beyond most estimates of its sustainable potential, at least in the labor market Obviously, the revisions accentuate that tendency, and in the staff forecast underlying inflation has assumed a more discernible upward tilt Thus, the data on the economy and financial markets along with    3/31/98  forecast revisions would seem to argue for more serious consideration of a near-term firming of policy  But there remain reasons why the Committee may want to wait It was supply uncertainties--questions about whether the economy might be able to sustain faster expansion through faster productivity growth and a higher level of resource utilization than suggested by history--that deterred the Committee from tightening last fall, and those uncertainties have not been resolved Despite a low unemployment rate and anecdotes of strains in labor markets, wage and compensation inflation still seems to be moving up only slowly Price inflation remains largely quiescent, and a resumption of robust investment spending in the first quarter should keep industrial capacity ample On the other side, disappointing profits in fourth-quarter data and first-quarter estimates, perhaps associated in part with weaker productivity performance, may be early signs of emerging cost pressures  On the demand side of the economy, robust domestic spending has been expected to a considerable extent, and the questions have involved the coming offset from the foreign sector, which is just emerging in the data The size and timing of the offset remain very uncertain, given the still unfolding drama in Asia and the scarcity of precedents for gauging its effects on the US economy In a fundamental sense the situation has not changed that much over the long intermeeting period The Committee remains in the difficult position of waiting for a moderating influence of unknown dimensions, with the economy uncomfortably strong and ebullient financial markets feeding that strength--it's just that the economy is stronger and markets more ebullient than anticipated  On the positive side, developments in train to support growth and contain inflation mean that the ill effects of either too much or too little external sector restraint are likely to be muted for some time This may give the Committee some breathing room to gauge the economic situation, at least for a short time, without risking the need for substantially more disruptive policy action at a later date The unusually favorable economic performance of the last few years is generating its own momentum low and declining inflation already experienced will hold down inflation expectations, damping wage and price increases, even if economic expansion is strong and labor market pressures intensify And robust growth has bolstered confidence and equity markets, supporting domestic demand and growth even if external demand weakens more than expected The effects of this momentum are reinforced in the short run by the Asian crisis itself The rise in the dollar and drop in oil prices on balance since last fall will add to restraint on inflation for a while On the spending side, the drop in oil prices and the decline in intermediate- and long-term interest rates seem to be stimulating demand before the adverse effects of lower foreign income and higher dollar exchange rates are felt In effect, financial    3/31/98  and commodity markets have anticipated oncoming Asian effects on real GDP, providing some near-term stimulus to spending In this regard, the Committee is facing a combination of near-term stimulus and projected restraint similar to that associated with a fiscal policy tightening whose implementation is delayed but which has already reduced interest rates  If the Committee decides to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting, it still needs to consider the symmetry of the directive Moving to an asymmetrical directive toward tightening would reflect a judgment, ultimately conveyed to the public, that information and analysis becoming available since the symmetrical directive was adopted in December have tilted the risks enough to make tightening a clear possibility in the not-too-distant future Retaining a symmetrical directive would indicate that there remained enough uncertainty about the outlook at this point to cast significant doubt on this outcome  Of course, a symmetrical directive would not rule out a near-term action--at the next meeting or earlier--if warranted by new information Thank you, Mr Chairman   Excuse me, Norm On that first sentence of the directive, Mr  Chairman, one possibility would be to keep essentially the words that were used in the last  directive It would say, after changing a few words in that sentence ""The information reviewed  at this meeting suggests that economic activity continued to grow rapidly during the early  months of 1998"" "
4967,1998-05-19," In view of the hour and the fact that many of the members and staff  have crowded agendas for this afternoon, it has been proposed that we postpone discussion of the  agenda item on disclosure policy until the next meeting   We might be able to start that meeting a little earlier "
4968,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman When the Committee last met it was concerned about the risk of an upward trend to underlying inflation in the future, and in some respects that possibility seems in fact to have acquired more weight over the intermeeting period In particular, the economy looks as if it will be putting more strain on the labor markets  Perhaps accentuating concerns, the slowdown in economic growth to a more sustainable pace is still just a projection To date, despite the evident increases in real interest rates, financial markets show few signs of any erosion in the accommodative conditions that have been bolstering demand The stock market continues to defy the gravity of weaker earnings Banks are still easing terms and conditions for business loans, have begun to do the same on commercial real estate lending, and have about stopped tightening them on consumer loans Perceptions of reduced risk in financial markets--""complacency"" as the Chairman    5/19/98  has called it--probably owe in part to a sense that the Federal Reserve is on hold for the foreseeable future and likely would not act before warning the markets first On the price side, the steadiness of the dollar against an average of major currencies this year after last year's appreciation and the bottoming out of oil prices after earlier declines suggest that a couple of the factors that have helped to damp wage and price increases will fade over coming quarters  By themselves, these influences would seem to argue in favor of a small firming of money market conditions, as in alternative C In these respects, analogies could be drawn to the situation in March 1997, when the Committee chose to ""buy some insurance"" against the inflation risks associated at that time with strong aggregate demand, or last September, when tightening labor markets put the Committee on a path toward policy firming in early November, had not Asian events intervened  When a wider array of factors is considered, however, the shift in inflation risks may not be so clear cut In the staff forecast, inflation in 1999 is no higher than in the last Greenbook Once again, new information on and analysis of the supply side of the economy provide a counterweight to stronger demand and higher output Mike has discussed the key elements in the forecast Most importantly, as he noted, the rise in the level of output has been about matched by an increase in estimated potential, owing to faster trend productivity, that leaves the output gap about unchanged And that higher productivity also is manifest in a temporarily lower NAIRU as firms compete for more profitable business  As a result, the staff forecast suggests no greater urgency for firming policy than in March But, as was the case then, the outlook does embody a significant upward incline to underlying inflation at the current federal funds rate Several of you noted our concern that inflation might rise by more In the context of such forecasts, to remove the inflationary tendency and lock in something like the current low inflation rate probably would require an appreciable rise in the federal funds rate, and the sooner you get started, the easier the task  But even if the Committee finds the prospect of higher underlying inflation troubling, it still may see some reasons to consider holding off moving against the potential pickup, at least for a short time One is the instability plaguing much of Asia To be sure, a one-quarter point increase in the federal funds rate is not going to have much effect on the developments unfolding in Indonesia, which are being swept along on more fundamental political and economic tides But it could affect other Asian markets and economies, which are a bit more fragile owing both to the Indonesian situation and to the growing recognition that the required real adjustments are going to be painful And, in the last few days, turbulence in Asian markets seems to be spilling over outside the region The response of the emerging financial markets to the leak of the Committee's    5/19/98  bias suggests that interest rates on emerging market debt would rise by as much or more than dollar rates Small interest rate increases in those financial markets might not have much effect on the output of their economies, but one can not be sure Any effects on the real economy may be offset through further currency depreciation, though that may not be viewed as particularly helpful to financial stability Of course, from the US standpoint the corresponding rise in the dollar would be one channel through which your tightening would damp demand on US productive capacity  In addition, just how markets here and abroad would interpret a firming in US monetary policy is quite uncertain The effects could be significant if global markets took it as the first of several installments or thought that it presaged firming actions in other industrial countries where economies are strong, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and ""Euroland"" Even small weight given to the possibility that spreading instabilities threaten to adversely affect the US economy and financial markets, and that the turmoil itself might be exacerbated by a policy tightening, might incline the Committee toward setting a higher hurdle in terms of purely domestic concerns for taking action at this meeting That is not to say that such a hurdle could not be crossed, though If the Committee saw a distinct threat of an inflation emerging in the United States whose seriousness would be significantly exacerbated by waiting, a small firming now might be less destabilizing to US and global financial markets than larger increases later  A second consideration that may argue for no change at this meeting is uncertainty, especially about the supply side of the economy The members have noted continuing under-predictions of economic growth over recent years As well, the staff, Committee members, and other forecasters have persistently over-projected inflation over the last few years even as the economy was growing faster and operating at a higher level of labor force utilization than expected The forecast errors are partly attributable to one-time developments that could not easily be anticipated, such as the drop in oil prices But they are also indicative of the shifting relationships among labor, capital, wages, and prices lying behind the aggregate supply process, and these could persist The events of the past couple of years underscore how tenuous is our understanding of how much can be produced over time without adding to inflation pressures  This presents considerable difficulties for policymakers, and I'm not sure the current state of economic modeling is as much help as we might hope for One natural response to this uncertainty is to be less preemptive in your policy strategy It's hard to be forward-looking when you can't see the road ahead and are unsure about the accuracy of the map Of necessity, policy decisions end up being made more on the basis of incoming information about emerging inflation pressures and less on the basis of forecasts To a considerable extent, this is what the Committee has done over much of the last year Under current    5/19/98  circumstances, with even early warning signs of higher inflation difficult to spot, following this strategy might also weigh on the side of standing pat  The benefits to not tightening on forecasts accrue when such a firming turns out not to be needed and the economy has produced along a higher path in the interim And, the potential costs of risking an updrift in inflation may be lower now than a few years ago The resource distortions from a rise in inflation starting at a 2 percent rate may be smaller than those from a 3 percent base Moreover, the persistence of low inflation over recent years, by bringing down and anchoring inflation expectations, should mean that counteracting inflation pressures once they become evident is less disruptive than it would be in a more volatile inflation environment  While the costs of not acting as preemptively may be lower, they may not be negligible If a policy action turns out to be required, the longer it is postponed the larger the disequilibrium and the more wrenching the subsequent real adjustment to the economy To avoid embedding higher inflation and to minimize eventual economic instabilities, a more backward-looking policy is likely to require a prompt and vigorous response once problems emerge Bond markets anticipating such responses will still help to stabilize the economy But if uncertainty induces you to wait for the ""smoking gun"" of a string of higher inflation numbers, some of those costs of waiting are sure to be incurred  However, even a less forecast-based strategy, should the Committee follow it, does not imply that you would necessarily await a string of bad inflation numbers to firm policy Incoming data over the next weeks or months suggesting continued unsustainable growth and further tightening in labor markets, persistent ebullience in financial markets and in money and credit growth that was feeding into aggregate demand, and greater cost and profit margin pressures still could be sufficiently unambiguous signs of heightened inflation risks to trigger firming before inflation itself turns noticeably higher "
5027,1998-06-30," I will try to be brief, Mr Chairman My colleagues, David Reifschneider and David Small, who did much of the work on the paper are seated at the table Hopefully, they will answer your questions!  This study was prepared in response to a discussion at the February meeting of the Committee A number of you noted that for several decades the Committee had focused on reducing inflation from high levels that were clearly unacceptable The inflation rate was now low enough that it seemed appropriate to consider how much further it should go down and what trend rate would be most consistent with maximum economic growth That nominal interest rates cannot go below zero is one aspect of such a consideration This zero constraint comes into play when inflation is low because nominal interest rates also are low at the same time If in this situation the economy is hit with a downward shock and policy is eased and if the economy is then hit with another downward shock or policy eases too slowly, the Federal Open Market Committee could find itself constrained in    6/30-7/1/98  its ability to continue to support the economy and the economy could worsen further  Very briefly summarizing the results of the paper, one is that being caught at a zero bound nominal rate is probably a very rare event Policy errors are one reason the Committee could get caught there, and that is more likely, obviously, when the starting point is a low inflation rate Being caught at the zero nominal bound could have very serious consequences  There were two ways that the study approached this issue One was by looking at history The 1930s in the United States provide one example of monetary policy caught at the zero nominal bound, particularly from 1932 through most of the rest of the 1930s In the 1990s, the approach of the zero nominal bound in Japan seems to have constrained policy there  The other way the study looked at this was through model simulations There it was shown that hitting a model of the economy with shocks representing unexpected events, the zero nominal bound tended to present problems and tended to produce longer and more frequent occasions when the economy was producing below potential after starting from an inflation rate of 1 percent or lower  A second suggestion of the paper was that the Committee can structure monetary policy actions to reduce the odds of ending up at the zero nominal bound by being more aggressive in countering downside surprises when inflation is already low Now, this can be seen to some extent in the one place in the paper where the staff looked at an alternative to a Taylor Rule that had more aggressive coefficients so that the Federal Open Market Committee reacted more strongly to output and inflation gaps That is a symmetrical kind of reaction One can also imagine an asymmetrical reaction where the Committee reacts particularly strongly to the threat of deflation when inflation is already at a low rate But it is not easy to implement such a policy The Committee needs to identify the surprise, needs to be confident that inflation is moving down to dangerously low levels, and needs to be willing to take risks by moving aggressively against deflation or a potential deflationary shock The Committee needs to take the risk that if it is wrong, inflation might re-emerge and the Committee would then have to counter that--would have to reverse course So this asymmetric strategy requires a willingness to take risks  A third conclusion of the paper was that once the Committee finds itself at the lower bound, its options are limited Fiscal policy is probably the most effective way of stimulating the economy when monetary policy is trapped by the zero bound, but the central bank cannot count on the fiscal authorities, as we certainly are seeing in Japan today The monetary authorities have at their disposal some fiscal-type actions that they could    6/30-7/1/98  take, for example, making loans to private parties at a subsidized rate, which the paper did not consider on the thought that it was more a part of fiscal policy than monetary policy  Unorthodox monetary policy may work, but it obviously would have to be through channels other than reducing short-term interest rates since they are already at zero Those channels might include reducing expected short-term rates by tilting down long-term rates, or reducing term or risk premiums in long-term rates The latter also would tend to reduce long-term rates and exchange rates as well  Pumping up the monetary base by itself would be unlikely to be effective in doing either of these things, that is, reducing short-term rate expectations or term and risk premiums Such increases in the base would tend to go into excess reserves and there is no obvious reason why that would change expectations about future rates Tilting open market operations to a limited degree toward bonds or foreign exchange also is not likely to do much Studies show that modest changes in the supply of bonds, Operation Twist kinds of things, do not have much effect on bond yields Sterilized intervention, which is what in effect such foreign exchange buying would be, also does not do much However, massive purchases of bonds or massive intervention might The Federal Reserve did set the rate on government bonds during World War II If a central bank were willing to purchase all the supply of government bonds, it could set the bond rate again, and presumably this would feed through to corporate borrowing rates as well So, there are extreme policies involving massive purchases that should work in lowering term premiums and risk premiums  In considering how low inflation should go, the zero bound is only one part of the calculations There are a number of other potential costs and benefits On the benefits side, the paper did not deal at all with the extra growth, productivity, or efficiency that might result from an economy operating at very low or even zero rates of inflation Unfortunately, it is hard to quantify with confidence the gains from going to zero inflation or the costs of the zero bound  A final question is whether there are any implications of this analysis for the Committee's consideration over the next couple of years For one thing, there could be a practical policy issue at some point Right now, of course, the funds rate is at 5-1/2 percent and the risk, as a number of you already have noted, is for inflation to be rising A zero bound problem does not seem to be in the cards, but it is not impossible to imagine a situation involving lower inflation and lower nominal interest rates We have tended to overpredict inflation over the last few years I think one of the lessons from the United States in the 1930s and Japan in the 1990s is that problems have tended to follow sharp breaks in asset prices coupled with sluggish    6/30-7/1/98  monetary responses because the authorities were concerned about re-igniting asset price increases or inflation and with destabilizing fiscal policy because the fiscal authorities were focused on budget balance or long-term surplus Given the level of equity prices today in the United States, I don't think we are invulnerable to a sharp break in equity prices, the initiating step in this sequence And if it came on top of a situation somewhere down the road in which foreign economies were worsening and the dollar was appreciating, it is not beyond imagination to think that this kind of situation might be one where the Committee might consider whether it wanted some strong asymmetric responses to downward shocks to the economy  From a different perspective, the Committee might want to consider whether it has anything useful to communicate to the public about the long-run context of its policy decisions If the Committee had a sense that it would lean hard against inflation rates that tended to drop to very, very low levels or to zero, there might be some benefit from laying out the issues for the public It would allow markets to anticipate such actions and such anticipation might help to bring down long-term rates You will remember that one of the problems in Japan in the early 1990s and in the United States in the early 1930s was that it took long-term rates a long time to come down, presumably because markets were anticipating that the authorities would bring rates back up again If the Committee were not going to do that, it might be useful to inform people That also would promote a public debate, understanding, and accountability of how the Federal Reserve interpreted the price stability mandated in the Federal Reserve Act  Now may not be the best time Since the Committee is worried about inflation going up, there would be a risk of misinterpretation if it started to talk about a supposition that inflation might get too low But at some point in the future, I think a public discussion of these issues might be constructive for all concerned Thank you, Mr Chairman   I think, Mr Chairman, the staff does intend to try and re-dress the paper  and put pieces of it out, the model simulations in particular, as a working paper in the working  paper series here There is another paper on this general topic that has been presented at college  seminars by other Federal Reserve researchers There has been a publication of a paper by Brian  Madigan and Jeff Fuhrer on this issue I think we could take the paper out of the immediate policy  context so that people would not know that the Federal Open Market Committee had been working  on it, and we could get academic comment on it It has been done before   I feel less confident now than I did a few minutes ago! [Laughter]   I think a favorable productivity shock, even in the context of this paper,  would not present the Committee with a problem for the reasons that were discussed earlier in  this meeting Such a shock tends to raise the equilibrium real interest rate and it tends to boost  growth I think what becomes an issue in this paper is downward shocks to demand   I think the intention, President Minehan, was to concentrate on the  modeling part of the paper, not on the other part   Unfortunately, we did turn the best minds in the System loose on that  three or four years ago, and they could not reach a conclusion [Laughter] They could not show  that there were benefits from reducing the rate of inflation below 2 or 3 percent "
5028,1998-06-30," Because the markets will be closing at 200 pm-and the futures market  at 110 pm on Thursday, we will be releasing the minutes at noon on Thursday instead of 200  pm    6/30-7/1/98 "
5029,1998-06-30," I had more important things to do over the weekend, Mr Chairman My  son got married! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the meeting in March, several members suggested that the Committee consider whether some explanation should be given to the public after each meeting when no change is made in monetary policy Two proposals were put on the table at the March meeting One was to release the directive when the tilt was changed along with a brief explanation Another was to release a brief statement after every meeting whether or not the tilt was changed Dave Lindsey and I came up with a number of permutations and combinations of those proposals  The desire for more explanation comes from within the Committee There is no real outside pressure for more or earlier release of information Committee members from time to time have wanted to explain the basis for a ""no change"" decision, notably when markets expected a change that did not occur Some members also indicated that they thought an explanation was desirable when the Committee felt that underlying conditions were    6/30-7/1/98  shifting significantly though not enough to warrant a change in policy That was the case in March There also has been a desire at times to warn markets that a change might be forthcoming in order to reduce the odds on an overreaction because of the surprise when policy tightening or easing actually occurred It may also be that the felt need to issue a statement when no change is made is fed in part by the limited number of actual changes The Committee has few opportunities to comment on policy considerations outside the two Humphrey-Hawkins testimonies each year  The question of how much to announce and how often to do so has been addressed by the Committee on a number of occasions, most recently in February of 1995 At that time the Committee had a report from a subcommittee headed by Governor Blinder, with Governor Kelley, President Boehne, and President Melzer as members The subcommittee recommended and the Committee accepted what essentially is the current policy of announcing changes in the stance of policy That subcommittee recommendation included the possibility of an occasional explanation of a ""no change"" in policy if there was a good reason to provide such an explanation, but it was expected to be rare The possibility of an occasional public statement to explain a ""no change"" policy decision was announced to the public at the time The Committee has shied away from using that option partly on the ground that members felt it would be difficult to do so just once in a while Having done it, there would be pressures for and expectations of more frequent announcements  No one at the February 1995 meeting was in favor of making an announcement after every meeting, although I think Alan Blinder leaned in that direction More than three years have passed since then, and the Committee has had more experience with announcing changes, so it seems appropriate for the Committee to reconsider its policy  In its discussions of these issues in the past, the Committee has weighed two broad considerations Here I am drawing on the February 1995 discussion as well as Dave Lindsey's memo and other information that we have On the one hand, providing more rather than less information is viewed as generally better public policy It is the responsibility of a public agency to explain its activities in a democratic society, and it enhances accountability of that agency In addition, on average and over time, markets should work better if they understand what the Committee is thinking about and what its concerns are That is, changes in market prices should tend to stabilize the economy and help the Committee to achieve its goals I think there are two caveats here First, it is not always easy for the Committee to convey its intentions and concerns They are subject to misinterpretation, certainly an experience we all have had from time to time Second, volatility may increase if events do not validate expectations Moreover, Committee statements help to frame press reporting and press    6/30-7/1/98  coverage of policy and hopefully to educate the public in that way Committee statements or official releases give you, the members of the Committee, some guidance in your own statements over intermeeting periods Those are the positive aspects  On the other hand, the Committee has anticipated drawbacks to making additional announcements and releasing additional information, especially if those announcements and information feed back on the policy process itself, making it more difficult to reach the right decision In some of the discussions over the years, the market reaction itself was viewed as a potential problem as well as a benefit The reasoning was that if the Committee wanted to move interest rates, it would change policy The fact that it had not changed policy suggested that it did not think conditions were right for changing interest rates In 1995 in particular, several Committee members expressed concern that the announcement itself could lock in market expectations and reduce flexibility because it would set up situations in which the market expected some action and the Committee would then have to worry about disappointing those expectations  One question raised at the time was whether announcing a ""no change"" decision would make it more difficult to implement intermeeting changes, including delayed contingent changes In the past, the Committee has from time to time made decisions at meetings to change its policy stance in the next few days or weeks after the meetings if the data came in a certain way I can recall a decision like that in December 1991 The Committee did not want to announce a ""no change"" decision and then not be able to make a change within the next few weeks if the incoming data were of a certain kind That is why the current announcement after each meeting is phrased ""there is no further announcement"" rather than ""the Committee has not changed its policy""  The Committee also was concerned that announcing symmetries and asymmetries could be seen as a precommitment not only over the intermeeting period but for the next meeting as well If the directive were released, the symmetries and asymmetries would be much more consequential, partly because of market reactions That prospect could provoke more dissents and could lead to reduced use of the symmetries and asymmetries because members would be concerned about the market reactions Members commented at that time that the tilts had contributed to policy flexibility and consensus building, and they were concerned about doing something that would reduce the use of the tilts in the policy process  There also was concern about the wording of the press statement Members anticipated difficulties in reaching agreement or consensus, especially if statements were forward-looking or had implications for future action It was not clear what to do about dissents or contrary views in the    6/30-7/1/98  announcements These are problems that arise for statements made when the Committee actually changes its policy But some of the thinking was that with no action, there was nothing to take the focus off the words themselves, and the words might be more important for a statement about why the Committee did not take action, which would be examined more for what it implied for the future than for a statement that explained something the Committee had done At the March meeting, a number of you were concerned that the nuances of a ""no change"" directive with a tilt or change in the tilt could not be captured in a short statement  In addition to these pros and cons, there are a number of other issues that you could think about in the process of reaching this decision or that would need to be thought about if your disclosure policy were going to change One question is whether there are ways of accomplishing the objective of explaining a ""no change"" decision other than making an announcement after every meeting One possibility obviously would be to implement the February 1995 decision to issue the occasional rare statement  If the directive is released, should minutes be speeded up to help explain the directive? Even if they were speeded up, the minutes would still be released with a lag after the directive, but at least they would help to explain the Committee's decision with a shorter lag And should the directive wording be looked at again? The Committee did look at directive wording on the tilts in August of 1997, just about a year ago, and you were unable to reach a consensus on any changes Another issue is how to treat dissents and alternative views  A further concern might be whether these issues should be considered in the broader context of interactions of FOMC members and staff with the public and the press You have discussed what is appropriate and what is not appropriate to tell outsiders, but the guidelines remain informal The question is, should they be codified or at least discussed again?  Finally, if there is a change in procedures, how should this be announced to the public? If you were to change something today, the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony would be a natural possibility Thank you, Mr Chairman   No, I don't recall exactly I believe the Committee adopted a very strong  asymmetrical tilt I am thinking of December 1991 when the discount rate was cut by a full  percentage point and the federal funds rate was cut by 1/2 percentage point less than a week after  that December meeting The members left the meeting with a strong presumption that they  wanted to get a package of easing actions together that included both the discount rate and the  federal funds rate I think there was a strong tilt or presumption in that directive, but I don't  remember the exact language   If I have the consensus! "
5085,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman In opting to keep the stance of policy unchanged at recent meetings, the Committee has been balancing its expectation that policy most likely will need eventually to tighten to forestall an uptrend in inflation against the possibilities that developments in the global economy could make that tightening unnecessary and that any rise in the federal funds rate might worsen instabilities in foreign financial markets Living with the risk of rising inflation has been made easier by the low level of actual inflation and by the prospect that, despite tight labor markets, inflation will not turn up for some time Given that prospect, waiting to tighten--in order to be in a better position to judge the course of developments overseas and inflation dynamics in the United States--probably would not deprive the Committee of adequate time to head off a significant pickup in inflation that would be very disruptive to reverse, even allowing for policy lags  Developments since your last meeting would seem mostly to reinforce the arguments for standing pat The rise in volatility and in contagion across countries of movements in financial asset prices suggests that investors are more fearful and uncertain and that many markets remain quite vulnerable to a tightening of monetary policy in the United States, especially if the policy action were unanticipated and not clearly dictated by an obvious threat of higher US inflation And, the deteriorating situation overseas is reflected in a higher dollar and lower commodity prices and in downward revisions to the path of foreign economic activity, which will help to contain pressures on resources and prices in the United States  Moreover, the reactions of US financial markets of late to the deteriorating situation overseas on balance are reinforcing the restraint on aggregate demand This is in contrast to earlier when domestic markets were responding to foreign turmoil in ways that seemed to support more domestic spending, partly offsetting the damping of net exports To be sure, interest rates on Treasury obligations have dropped still further, but the adverse effects of the higher dollar and weaker foreign demand on profit prospects have contributed importantly to the recent decrease in equity prices and rise in credit risk spreads The cost of raising capital for US businesses probably has risen a bit in recent weeks, and previous gains in household wealth have been trimmed The key question is whether these recent market movements represent a more lasting reassessment of profits and risk or are simply another hiccup in investors' persistently optimistic view of business prospects If the staff profit forecast is in the right ballpark, such optimism should prove difficult to reestablish    8/18/98  In addition, much of the decline in Treasury interest rates in the last few weeks, and even in the last few months, may represent a fall in inflation expectations, rather than in real interest rates, limiting its stimulative effect on spending In the Michigan consumer survey, for example, partial data for August indicate a drop in expectations for inflation over both the next year and the next 5 to 10 years; expectations over both horizons have fallen a couple of tenths in the last two months, bringing the decline in median long-term expectations to half a percentage point this year Using these measures, rate declines in recent months or even since December entirely reflect longer inflation expectations This conclusion is supported by the slight upward creep in yields on inflation-indexed securities over this period It may be that the downward pressure on real interest rates stemming from  market perceptions of greater restraint coming from abroad are being about offset by upward pressure arising from increases in expected real short-term rates over the near term as inflation expectations fall relative to the forecast of an unchanged nominal funds rate  Of course, not all developments over the intermeeting period point to reduced inflation risks So far, private final demand remains quite strong, counterbalancing the restraint coming from the foreign sector and lower inventory investment by enough to keep income and employment growing at a good clip And, as a consequence, pressures on labor markets show few signs yet of becoming less intense  Moreover, financial conditions continue to be accommodative for spending Price-earnings ratios are still extraordinarily high, holding down the cost of capital, and consumption has not yet caught up to the previous run-up in wealth Even if real interest rates have not fallen, recent declines in nominal interest rates will boost mortgage borrowing and spending, particularly for those households who feel constrained by limits on available liquidity or cash flow And, according to our August survey of loan officers, more domestic banks still are easing terms on business loans than tightening them, though by a smaller margin than in the previous few surveys Lastly, although money growth has slowed somewhat in recent months, measured over the more relevant time frame of the last few quarters, the aggregates continue to expand rapidly--more rapidly, if they continue on these paths, than likely would be consistent over time with nominal income growth in line with the Committee's desire to keep inflation very low  Perhaps the immediate question for Committee consideration is whether, on balance, conditions have changed enough to warrant a return to a symmetrical directive The Greenbook forecast would seem consistent with such a move in that, at an unchanged federal funds rate, it sees inflation remaining quite damped In that forecast, the rise in inflation has become    8/18/98  even more gradual; indeed, no longer does the rate of increase in the core CPI drift higher in 1999--even after allowing for technical changes to the index Moreover, the Committee might be more confident now than at previous meetings that the slowing of domestic demand likely needed to contain inflation pressures is in train For the first time, the reduction in wealth critical to that moderation has actually happened, not just been projected To date, the restrictive effects of high real interest rates on aggregate demand have been offset importantly by the rise in equity prices But if those prices don't rebound, much less fall further as seems possible with the staff outlook for profits, the restraining effects of high real short-term rates holding up the real yield curve should begin to show through to spending that already is being restrained by the higher dollar and weak income abroad A policy stance that keeps real rates relatively high would seem appropriate when, as now, the economy appears to be beyond its sustainable level of production That rate setting helps to drag the economy back toward its potential--the result that is in the staff forecast  A symmetrical directive would not seem unreasonable or come as a great surprise to financial market participants The term structure of interest rates suggests that investors do not see the risks as tilted toward greater inflation and tighter policy, even making allowance for the effects on that structure of the flight to quality Indeed, a growing number of observers seem to be taking seriously the possibility that the next action may be toward ease  Finally, even if the Committee views inflation risks as still substantial, it may also see recent developments at least as having postponed the need for possible tightening, both because greater fragility in markets is likely to persist for a while and because price pressures should be quiescent for a longer period If tilts in the directive are interpreted as having a time dimension as well as connoting the likely direction of the next policy action, a symmetrical directive may better represent the Committee's intentions Until a few years ago, tilts applied to possible policy actions in the very near term--that is, over the intermeeting period While the Committee has not emphasized this interpretation in recent years, it still has seemed often to be using tilts to signal that risks were sufficiently skewed to make a policy adjustment in the indicated direction a distinct possibility over the next several meetings, and not just a statement of probabilities in the indefinite future  Still, Committee members have been projecting more inflation than has the staff, and the Committee may see the risks of higher inflation as large enough and immediate enough to justify retaining the asymmetric directive Declines in equity prices and greater foreign turmoil may have reduced your inflation concerns, but perhaps not by enough to change the directive The fundamental situation of the economy has not changed Economic activity    8/18/98  remains at a level well beyond most estimates of the economy's sustainable potential That overshoot continues to be reflected in the labor markets, where increases in compensation remain on an upward trend And, recent profit results may in part suggest that the reservoir of productivity-enhancing investments that could offset the effects of higher compensation on costs and prices is not bottomless  In addition, the moderation in the growth of domestic final demand so essential to relieve pressures on labor markets is still mainly a forecast Although markets don't see an eventual tightening of monetary policy as necessary for that moderation, on balance outside economists still do As recently as last week, the survey of economists of primary dealers showed that a considerable plurality expected your next action to be a firming rather than an easing And, as Mike discussed, private forecasters included in the Blue Chip survey on average continue to expect an appreciable pickup in inflation next year  The Committee thus would have reasons for retaining a view that inflation remains the principal threat over time to sustaining the economic expansion If so, before shifting its directive stance, the Committee may want to see further evidence that the risk of higher inflation has indeed receded--for example, data pointing more clearly to a slowing in domestic final demand In these circumstances, the Committee might be concerned that returning to symmetry and then perhaps needing to shift back to asymmetry a few meetings later could be interpreted as implying more sensitivity to very recent developments and less regard for the underlying fundamentals and long-run goals of policy than in fact characterizes the Committee's policy strategy "
5142,1998-09-29," I do think that the market has put a greater premium on holding liquid  assets in these very uncertain times We can see that in the spread between Treasury securities  and federal agency securities, even the benchmark agency securities, which are extraordinarily  liquid That spread has widened out by 15 basis points The on-the-run, off-the-run Treasury  spreads also have widened out    9/29/98   This is an extreme Peter Fisher and Bob Parry are right in the sense  that at least part of that decline in the spread between nominal and real rates and the  extraordinarily low level of the spread reflect not so much expected CPIs but the extra premium  on holding very liquid, nominal, on-the-run Treasury bonds That premium has driven those  rates below what would be sustainable levels in calmer markets, consistent with expected  inflation and expected real interest rates I do think it is sensible or potentially reasonable to  think that at least some of this decline in the spread--and it has been a fairly steep decline of  about 1/2 point or more since the middle of August--represents a bit of a markdown of inflation  expectations as economies all over the world have weakened and commodity prices have come  down In these circumstances, it would be sensible to have some shift in inflation expectations,  even if the whole level looks very low and may be distorted Our interpretation of this decline  was that it reflected the extra premium people were willing to pay for the liquid, nominal  Treasuries as well as some drop in inflation expectations It seems logical   It reads as follows ""The Federal Open Market Committee decided  today to ease the stance of monetary policy slightly, expecting the federal funds rate to decline 1/4  percentage point to around 5-1/4 percent The action was taken to cushion the effects on  prospective economic growth in the United States of increasing weakness in foreign economies  and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically The recent changes in the global  economy and adjustments in US financial markets mean that a slightly lower federal funds rate  should now be consistent with keeping inflation low and sustaining economic growth going  forward  The discount rate remains unchanged at 5 percent"" "
5143,1998-09-29," At your conference call last week, most of you seemed to favor easing policy at this meeting I will briefly review the case for an easing action before discussing the factors bearing on how large the cut in the federal funds rate should be  The case for easing does not rest on incoming data about the economy As many of you have noted, the information that has become available since your last meeting indicates that the economy continues to expand at a pace around the growth rate of its potential That has kept the unemployment rate flat at a very low level, and inflation has edged higher on a 12-month basis, at least as measured by the core CPI Thus, a standard, backward- looking Taylor rule that called for a 5-1/2 percent federal funds rate in August would continue to do so today  Rather, the case for easing relies on projections that have been marked down by developments overseas and in US financial markets Most significantly, the sea change in investors' perceptions of risk and their apparent heightened unwillingness to take those risks has continued to spread globally, hitting the Americas with greater intensity Financial conditions have become more restrictive throughout the hemisphere, especially in our important export markets in Latin America and Canada where the authorities have had to tighten monetary policy to defend their currencies    9/29/98  While Committee members may have had stronger economic forecasts than the staff, it is likely that most of your projections also have been reduced noticeably by these events In that case, if you considered the federal funds rate to be at an appropriate level in August, it probably should be lower now Even if Committee members had not marked down their forecasts of the most probable outcome for economic growth by very much--or only by enough to become more comfortable with the inflation outlook--the lower tail of the distribution undoubtedly has gotten a good bit fatter In that regard, the Committee might see these as the appropriate circumstances in which to take some risks on the side of trying to ensure that US economic growth comes close to being as robust as possible, consistent with continued low inflation Prolonged sluggish expansion in the United States would seriously undermine recovery prospects in the rest of the world and eventually feed back on our own economy  Much of the benefits of an easing move was realized for financial markets when expectations came to embody action today That process helped to level out risk spreads in some domestic markets and to reduce spreads on Brady and other dollar-denominated sovereign bonds on international capital markets It probably also has helped to halt the drop in equity prices after their sharp fall in August Failing to follow up by actually easing could undo much of that  To be sure, it is important not to be, or to be seen as, attempting to support particular values in capital markets A good part of the market adjustment, at least in the United States, probably has reflected appropriate reassessments of business risks and prospects And in some markets, such as that for US equities, the reappraisal may not be complete But the Federal Reserve can try to keep the real economy on an even keel as financial market adjustments are made, and the Committee may see that objective as now requiring some reduction in a real federal funds rate that had been kept at an unusually high level in part because of financial market exuberance  A cautious approach to easing, characterized by a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate, might be justified by the situation now prevailing in the economy With the unemployment rate well below most estimates of its sustainable level, the Committee has long been of the view that economic growth needed to slow substantially from the pace of the last few years--most likely to below trend--just to keep inflation from accelerating As yet, there are few signs that the economy already is slowing enough to begin to relieve labor market pressures, much less that it is decelerating so sharply as clearly to require monetary policy easing Inflation risks associated with the tight labor market are heightened by the possibility that some of the factors damping price increases in recent years may already be reversing--the dollar is falling against currencies of other industrial countries, health care costs are rising faster, and oil prices have    9/29/98  begun to firm Whether inflation expectations will remain subdued as these influences turn around is an important uncertainty in the outlook  Caution in not moving the federal funds rate by very much also may be seen as consistent with basing the action primarily on projections rather than actual data, particularly since it is difficult to be confident about the effects of a change in the federal funds rate in the current highly skittish financial market environment To be sure, a series of tightenings in 1994 was initiated largely on the basis of projections, but the Committee waited until it was sure the economy was strong, and much of the subsequent policy firmings occurred against the background of surprisingly robust growth and early signs of rising inflation pressures The analogous strategy at this time might be to begin with a small action and build on it should further developments in either the financial markets or the economy indicate that the shock to spending was in fact turning out to be substantial  Lastly, holding the action to 25 basis points may have some appeal if the Committee thought both that the act of easing in any amount would itself usefully reassure financial markets, households, and businesses that the Federal Reserve recognized and was responding to potential problems and that in total not much easing would ultimately be necessary to support adequate economic expansion In these circumstances, a relatively modest action now would be desirable so that one or more further easings could be undertaken in response to changing conditions without risking excessive stimulus to growth and a potential intensification of inflation pressures  Reducing the federal funds rate by 50 basis points might be appropriate if the Committee instead saw the situation as one that required, or was highly likely eventually to require, substantial policy easing In the staff forecast, a decrease in the federal funds rate of 75 basis points is needed to keep the economy from dropping below the level of its potential in the year 2000 Absent such policy easing, the added restraint on aggregate demand that emerged in the period between the August and the September Greenbook projections would reduce the growth of the economy by almost one percentage point next year  While the most likely outcome is that credit conditions will end up only moderately less accommodative, recent financial market developments suggest that the odds may have increased of a significant further tightening in credit availability with associated downside risks to the economy Questions about the financial soundness of a number of financial firms have intensified in the wake of the near failure of Long-Term Capital Management Were this process to continue, or the settling down in the market that the staff has anticipated fail to occur, the result could be greater disruptions than in the staff forecast in the access of households and businesses to credit, in part as intermediaries incurred higher costs and turned more cautious in their lending to conserve capital The longer    9/29/98  volatility and uncertainty persist in financial markets, perhaps the higher are the risks that they will feed back on business and household confidence and spending plans  An easing of 50 basis points, if accompanied by a sense that the Federal Reserve would then be on hold for a while, would reduce one source of volatility in markets for a short time--that is, guessing about immediate Federal Reserve action and parsing statements of Federal Reserve officials for the probabilities of such action Because markets would be somewhat surprised by a full 50 basis point reduction today, there might be an adverse initial reaction in the prices of riskier assets should participants infer that the Federal Reserve saw the situation as difficult enough to take a somewhat unusual action Over time, however, market participants could find reassuring your willingness to act forcefully  Because a 50 basis point easing at this meeting is not fully built into the structure of interest rates, it would provide some added help to emerging market economies running tight monetary policies to defend their currencies The associated drop in the exchange value of the dollar might even nudge the monetary authorities in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, and Canada to ease their policies It would be of no help to Japan--since the added demand in the United States for Japanese exports arising from higher income here would be offset by the effects of a higher yen--unless it induced the Bank of Japan to use the remaining 25 basis points between its policy rate and zero!  Presumably, an easing of 50 basis points would be associated with adoption of an unbiased directive A smaller decline of 25 basis points might be associated with either a symmetrical directive or one that was asymmetrical toward easing The latter would connote that the Committee wanted to remain especially sensitive to the potential need to ease further, perhaps because it still saw a relatively greater potential for surprises--in foreign economies and domestic financial markets and in the spending plans of businesses and households in reaction to ongoing developments--that would imply considerable further restraint on demand in the United States "
5271,1998-12-22," That process, Mr Chairman, would be approximately the same one  followed when there are policy changes now That is, you would read to the Committee a draft  of the proposed statement and ask for their comments   There is a burning bush on the table "
5272,1998-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman The announcement of your last easing suggested that, as a consequence, the federal funds rate might be positioned to sustain growth and keep inflation contained The incoming information since then could be seen as reinforcing that judgment, at least for now Economic activity has been stronger than expected and the unemployment rate lower But moderation in hourly earnings and steep declines in oil and other commodity prices suggest that, even if the economy operates a bit further beyond its long-run potential than anticipated at the last meeting, any increase in    12/22/98  pressures on prices that might develop is likely to be quite limited for a while Such a shallow upturn would probably offer the Committee sufficient leeway to react in a timely manner at a later date should evidence begin to emerge that a sustained upward movement in inflation might be coming In addition, changes in financial conditions since the last meeting, on balance, do not point unambiguously to either greater stimulus or greater restraint on spending Yield spreads show mixed movements over the intermeeting period And while many longer-term nominal interest rates are down somewhat, rates on indexed securities are unchanged, suggesting that at least a portion of that decline owes to decreases in inflation expectations rather than in the real cost of credit  While widespread easing of monetary policy in Europe and Asia should help to bolster demand, that easing was triggered in part by weaker economic prospects, at least in Europe In Latin America, Brazilian problems have made the situation, if anything, dicier over recent weeks The Greenbook forecast sees flat short-term interest rates here in the United States as consistent with moderate growth and only a limited uptick in inflation, attributable mainly to the projected turnaround in energy prices  Against this background, and with financial markets even less liquid and more volatile than usual ahead of this year-end, the Committee may wish to keep policy unchanged at this meeting There are, to be sure, substantial risks on both sides of the moderate growth and low inflation outcome, which the Committee will need to weigh as it considers the tilt in the directive and as it monitors incoming information over coming months  On the side of a need to be especially alert to having to ease policy, there are still ample reasons to worry about the same small-probability, high-cost events that occupied the Committee's discussion in November As Karen noted, the ability of Brazil to maintain its exchange rate regime has, if anything, become more problematic While the passage of time and slow erosion of confidence in that country's policies undoubtedly have allowed counterparties and interested bystanders to take anticipatory protective actions, serious contagion from a loss of confidence in Brazil is still a distinct possibility In domestic financial markets, the backup in risk and liquidity premiums over the second half of the intermeeting period highlights the continuing heightened sensitivity of these markets to shifts in sentiment Greater resiliency may develop after year-end, when participants should feel more willing to open their books to taking on risks Nonetheless, markets are likely to remain vulnerable and increased caution by lenders would be a natural reaction to the slower growth in income and lower profits expected in most forecasts  Another source of downside risk is the potential for inflation--or more precisely, inflation expectations--to drop further, perhaps inappropriately raising real interest rates But making that determination depends importantly on the source of the downward surprise in prices Lower inflation that resulted from    12/22/98  unexpected increases in productivity would be associated with higher equilibrium real interest rates because wealth would be higher and incentives for capital spending stronger Easing policy under those conditions as inflation fell would risk greater price pressures down the road Even declines in inflation from decreases in the price of oil and other imported commodities require careful judgment about whether real rates shouldn't be allowed to rise Such price declines can bolster real incomes and spending, especially if they are not the result of an appreciation of the dollar But inflation surprises from other sources--decreases in inflation expectations not associated with these factors or unexpectedly weak wage growth--could require the Committee to reduce the nominal funds rate to avoid undesirable increases in real interest rates  Finally, financial market participants and many Wall Street economists apparently see the risks to growth and inflation as tilted to the downside, in that they have built further Federal Reserve easing into the yield curve and into their economic forecasts Weakness in a number of the economists' projections comes from another potential source of shortfall in demand--a squeeze on profits In these forecasts, persistently weak profits lower equity prices, impinging on consumption; and low profits, together with developing capacity overhangs, depress business investment  But the risks are not all to one side Aggregate demand has been strong, and financial conditions now may be no tighter--and might even be a little easier--than those of last summer and before And presumably these are the conditions that have contributed to the recent robust economic growth, given the lags Investors in bond markets have come to discriminate more carefully among borrowers, but on average yields haven't changed much, with increases for below-investment grade credits balanced by decreases for many better credits As a consequence of policy easing, the costs of short-term credit to most businesses appear to have decreased despite higher spreads For households, mortgage rates, which are tied closely to Treasury yields, have fallen appreciably In foreign exchange markets, the dollar is lower than it was six months ago, potentially lessening some of the restraining effects of foreign competition And not only has the stock market recovered previous peaks, but its resilience in the face of earnings warnings suggests upside potential for equity prices, as Mike noted To be sure, current financial conditions may not be so accommodative as to keep real growth at 3-1/2 percent After all, it took continued outsized increases in equity prices over a number of years to produce this result Instead, the danger may be that these financial conditions will slow growth only to the rate of increase in potential, preserving the current tautness in labor markets As compared with the staff forecast, this would raise the odds on the emergence of greater price pressures when recovering economies abroad foster a turnaround in resource prices and a weakening dollar  Interpreting the rapid growth of money may also help to assess the degree of risk that policy may be too accommodative to contain inflationary pressures    12/22/98  Broad money growth, which has been strong all year, accelerated in the fourth quarter Growth in M2 far exceeds the likely rate of increase of nominal GDP, and the resulting decline in velocity is much larger than can be explained with standard money demand models This suggests a lack of stability in the underlying demand for money--one of the necessary conditions for money to be a reliable indicator Indeed, some of the very recent strength in money seems to owe to greater desires by households for safe and liquid assets, itself symptomatic of problems in financial markets that would damp aggregate demand Such an outward shift in the demand for money would indicate a need for a greater supply of money to support any given level of spending These sorts of considerations would argue against a close linking of money growth and current or future spending or inflation  Yet, in a very broad and imprecise sense, rapid money growth through this year may have been indicative that financial conditions at least were supportive of continued strength in aggregate demand Positive surprises in money growth have been associated with positive surprises in spending, even if the numerical relationship between them has not been close Moreover, some of the overage in money growth relative to the standard models this year may reflect household responses to rising levels of wealth and lower long-term interest rates--both important stimulants to spending Finally, even the implications of the surge in M2 and M3 growth late this year might not have been entirely negative for the future path of spending It did suggest the willingness and capacity of a well- capitalized banking system to absorb flows of funds diverted from markets, cushioning the potential impact of financial market disruptions on economic activity  The staff, again, is projecting a substantial slowing in money growth over the months ahead This forecast is predicated on the decelerating path of spending in the Greenbook and on some reversal of the flight to liquidity and safety of late summer and early fall M2 growth has moderated in November and, on a partially projected basis, in December as well If this slowing falters--if money growth remains very rapid--it may connote stronger than expected spending, but it will be important to examine closely the reasons for the overshoot  Whatever your decision on the symmetries or asymmetries of the policy stance in the operating paragraph of the directive, the Bluebook on pages 13 and 14 presented three alternatives for the associated language The first alternative is the existing language; the second is the alternative presented in November; and the third is a modification of that alternative incorporating the suggestions members made in November We offered alternative two again because over the intermeeting period one of you indicated a desire to consider retaining the separate sentence on intermeeting moves in order to keep it conceptually distinct from the likely path of policy over the intermediate run Also, in your discussion of what is now alternative three, several of you, including Governor    12/22/98  Kelley, President Broaddus and others, were of the view that the directive should only reference the intermeeting period and not include the reference to ""in coming months"" That remains an open issue  We have also included alternatives for the wording of the sentence on the prospective growth of the monetary aggregates, responding to the discussion initiated by President Poole at the last meeting That language already had a degree of flexibility, since it had been the Committee's practice to adapt it to fit the staff's forecast for money over coming months And, in fact, it has changed several times this year We can continue to offer alternative wording in the Bluebook for money growth expectations, as we have done for this meeting The Committee might have different projections than the staff and, even if it didn't, it might want the opportunity to describe the staff forecast in different words than we suggest  Another option would be to drop that sentence altogether from the operating paragraph--a suggestion made by President Guynn in September The sentence has evolved over time from one that included specific numerical ranges for growth, whose violation could trigger a policy response, to the current vague expectation That evolution has paralleled the Committee's de-emphasis of money in its policy deliberations The Committee now makes no attempt to tie its annual ranges for money to expected or desired economic performance over the year, and the growth of money relative to its ranges plays no special role in policy decisions, as you have repeatedly informed the Congress As a result, the Congress has displayed no interest in using the behavior of money to guide its assessment of the conduct of policy Consequently, while you are cleaning up directive language, you might want to consider deleting this sentence An earlier paragraph in the directive would continue to report the Committee's long-run ranges, consistent with the requirements of the Federal Reserve Act   It will be before the February meeting We will do the survey in the  middle of January with the results coming in during the week before the February meeting  Preliminary results are usually in the Greenbook and the final results in the Greenbook  Supplement So you will have the results on the Friday before your February meeting   We have only been discussing this for a year now I went to New  Zealand hoping that this issue would be settled before I returned! [Laughter] Dave Lindsey let  me down    12/22/98   We might just say ""The Committee then turned to the directive  language At the end of the discussion""   It's the next item on the agenda "
5330,1999-02-02," I think one could also argue that an entity that holds a huge   portfolio of Treasury securities and is not allowing them to be lent on the market in itself   creates potential distortions We are a very large part of the market Certainly, the   Federal Reserve has been concerned about price distortions in the Treasury securities   markets, dating most recently at least from the Salomon Brothers case There is the   potential for shortages in that market to distort and reduce liquidity over time This   proposal is in my view an attempt through the auction technique to keep the Fed out of   the price-setting process except when the shortages are quite acute and fairly large   overall I view it as a public policy objective to keep those shortages low and to   promote liquidity in the market in which we operate    I would like to clarify a few points, Mr Chairman, if I may     2/2-3/99 10    I was trying to respond to a series of issues that have arisen over   the last couple of years in the course of the investigations of leaks of confidential FOMC   information and in conversations with Committee members and staff In this proposal   we are trying to accomplish a couple of objectives One is to make clear that   confidential information extends beyond the physical or even electronic documents that   people possess into what one learns at FOMC meetings--the informational content of   meetings Our intent is to define better what is confidential   Secondly, we want to facilitate policy discussions among staff at the Reserve   Banks and here at the Board and between Committee members and the staff So we   recommend reclassifying the Bluebook to Class II to give it a wider circulation and   clarifying that Committee members and Board and Bank senior staff can have   conversations about research issues that arise at meetings with staff who do not have   Class I clearances Conversations like that can occur Those conversations would not   be about what happened at a meeting, or who said what, and would not be about the   results or the vote but about research issues that need to be pursued between meetings   Thirdly, we want to protect the confidentiality of the decisionmaking process and   the policy decision itself by continuing to classify the directive, the transcript, and the   draft minutes as Class I documents We would continue to limit the number of people at   each Reserve Bank who can see those documents to about 4 or 5--basically the people   who are authorized to attend meetings There is some confusion about this in the   document itself, and we will try to clear that up The new program also avoids a   confusion that apparently existed about the distinction between what is currently Class I   and who is authorized to see the directive So, we are shrinking the number of Class I   documents by taking the Bluebook out of that category We are making Class I more   clearly aimed at what goes on at FOMC meetings, the most confidential information that   people have   Finally, after reading through this and getting comments from several people   around the room, I recognize that some points still need to be clarified We weren’t as   clear as we could have been in every case  I would appreciate having comments either   at this meeting or after the meeting from Committee members and the staff around the     2/2-3/99 11   room I would suggest that the best way to proceed would be for us to incorporate your   comments, clean up the draft, and get back to the Committee in March with a cleaner   draft that says what we want it to say If you don’t vote on this today, the current   program will continue in effect for another seven weeks until the next meeting So, it’s   not as if we wouldn’t have something in effect That would be my recommendation, Mr   Chairman    If some people have comments, I’d be happy to hear them    There is already in these rules, Mr Chairman, the authority to   make exceptions for specific situations I think President Broaddus is raising a broader   issue about how many people normally have access to these documents    I think that second distinction would go away Its inclusion was an   error and is one of the things I would clean up The directive would be Class I, so the   distinction between Class I and directive access would go away The second   investigation by the Inspector General pointed to the limited access to the directive as   one of the rules that a lot of people were confused about I think that if we can correctly   set the number of people who should be given access to information about policy   discussions at meetings, that distinction would not be necessary and should be   eliminated    Obviously, it is up to the Committee whether it wants to give more   people access to information about what goes on at meetings Maybe that’s a choice we   could give the Committee at the next meeting How many people do you want to have   access to Class I information?  You know the risks on both sides We were trying to   make a distinction between knowing what went on at a meeting in the sense of what   issues arose and what staff work needed to be done versus knowing what went on in   terms of information that could cause a problem if leaked to the newspapers     2/2-3/99 13    I think that by 1991 we were beginning to get some sense of what   was going on--specifically, that banks were getting into the mutual fund business   Mutual funds in particular were much more freely available to households, and   households were diversifying their portfolios out of deposits That was encouraged at the   time by a steeply upward sloping yield curve which, to be sure, is reversing So there   were a lot of purchases-­   If you look back at our forecasting in 1990 and 1991, that   development caught us somewhat by surprise But toward the end of 1991 and in 1992   we were doing a better job of forecasting    Yes, because we knew that the world had changed, so the old   equations weren’t working Exactly     2/2-3/99 78    It’s up to you You need to do two things here One is to decide   whether to readopt the ranges you had on a provisional basis If people have views on   that, maybe while they are giving those views they can also comment on-­   I think you’ve done very well with what you have been doing No   one has really noticed this inconsistency [Laughter] Seven months ago I gave up on   this!    The preliminary range was 3 to 7 percent, and the projection is that   growth in debt will be right in the middle of that range    Brian Madigan has copies of Section 2A of the Federal Reserve   Act, which covers that Why don’t you pass them out, Brian    Right Obviously, the monetary aggregates ranges are in there, but   so is the requirement to take account of past and prospective developments in     2/2-3/99 83   employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity,   international trade, payments, and prices And there is the point about discussing the   relationship of all that with the goals in the President’s Economic Report    To a considerable extent we feel they are required The Act has   been amended over the years to include additional emphasis on international   developments In response to that, we have beefed up the international sections    I think this could be a two-stage process That is, you could make it   very clear on February 23 that the FOMC strongly supports the continuation of a   reporting regime of some sort embedded in law And you could say that we would be   more than happy to work with the Congress over time on designing a reporting regime   that meets their needs and that we think is reasonable So, I don’t know that we need to   reach a conclusion before February 23 about what we want in the legislation except that     2/2-3/99 86   we want the regime to continue and that we will be more than happy to work with   Congress on how that process will go    I’m not sure whether that title is something we put on the document   or--   It is our title, not what is in the law  So the next time we reprint the   Federal Reserve Act, we can change the title  "
5331,1999-02-02," In the Bluebook, Governor Gramlich, there is a simulation with a   4½ percent NAIRU, which does exactly what you said The economy is at equilibrium   Nominal and real rates are where they need to be and inflation ends up about ¾ of a   percentage point lower than in the baseline  "
5332,1999-02-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman   I will begin my briefing today with a discussion of the simulations  presented in the Bluebook, and I will be referencing the charts in the  Bluebook in the process These exercises were designed to shed light on  the economic and policy environment embedded in the staff’s Greenbook  forecast, and they may have implications for the Committee’s policy  strategy   The baseline scenario, shown on Chart 3 following page 8, extends  the Greenbook forecast It was designed to be consistent with the     2/2-3/99 88   underlying logic and economic trends of that forecast, and hence preview  what could be in store after 2000 The staff’s assessment is that the  economy is now in disequilibrium in that the unemployment rate is below  its sustainable level; moreover conditions are not in place to correct this  situation Real interest rates are lower than their natural levels and fall  further over the next two years as the nominal interest rate is held constant  while inflation and, by assumption, inflation expectations rise Decreasing  real rates do not produce an even greater intensification of inflation  pressures because some of the economic strength of 1998 is seen as  transitory and because the equilibrium real rate is falling Over the long  run, the wealth-to-income ratio declines as the stock market levels out,  government debt is paid down, and foreign indebtedness grows, raising  household saving and depressing the natural interest rate   This disequilibrium implies that policy must firm at some point and  that the economy must experience subpar economic growth to limit  inflation In the baseline, the policy response was assumed to be delayed  and the Committee satisfied with capping inflation at 2¾ percent To hold  inflation down by more, as in the price stability scenario, the Committee  must begin to tighten sooner and be willing to continue to firm policy even  as the unemployment rate rises   The disequilibrium in the baseline arises from a judgment that the  surprisingly favorable inflation performance of recent years has been the  product in part of transitory factors depressing prices and labor costs The  lower NAIRU scenario in the second set of simulations, shown on Chart 4  after page 9, considers the consequences if instead the disinflation is  assumed to have been a result of lasting changes in the structure of labor  and product markets If the NAIRU is as low as 4½ percent, the economy  is not in disequilibrium at present and nominal and real interest rates are  close to sustainable levels Under these conditions, keeping the federal  funds rate at 4¾ percent over the next several years will be associated with  a slight uptick in inflation as oil and import prices turn around, but only to  a steady state rate of 2 percent   As it happens, a 4½ percent NAIRU also would help to reconcile the  current stance of monetary policy with the results of Taylor-type rules  Governor Gramlich noted at the last meeting and Governor Meyer  yesterday that the versions of this rule the staff calculates all tend to show  that the federal funds rate is too low This undershoot results from the  existence of a large gap of actual over potential output, by standard  calculations  If the NAIRU is at the lower 4½ percent level, however, the  gap about disappears, and the current funds rate is more nearly consistent  with the Committee’s past pattern of reactions to actual and forecasted  levels of output and inflation and with Taylor’s rule Of course, it is  possible to look at the results from both types of experiments from another     2/2-3/99 89   perspective For the current level of the funds rate not to be too  accommodative over time, structural changes in labor and product markets  must be very substantial and persistent   The surprises over recent years have been in aggregate demand as  well as aggregate supply, and the simulations shown on Chart 5 after page  10 look at the implications of situations in which aggregate demand  deviates from the baseline We chose alternative paths for the demand for  producers’ durable equipment because that has been an important source  of unanticipated strength in aggregate demand in recent years and feeds  back on supply as well Greater capital spending does raise the  productivity of labor and the level of potential output over time, but its  more significant effect in the short run is on demand Thus, policy must  be appreciably firmer if demand surprises on the upside, even if it is  productivity-enhancing spending that constitutes the surprise The  simulation follows the Taylor rule to tighter policy; perhaps the more  general point is that with labor markets already stretched, policy needs to  respond promptly to unexpected overshoots in demand to hold down the  rise in inflation   Against this background, the decision at this meeting would seem to  rest in part on whether the Committee agrees with the basic message in the  staff forecast that existing and prospective pressures on resources and the  likely recovery in oil and import prices point toward higher inflation If  the Committee views the risks as strongly skewed in this direction, it  might want to consider a firming of policy, if not at this meeting, then in  the near future--as might be indicated by a tilt toward firming in the  directive   Growth has yet to slow from an unsustainable pace, and labor  resource utilization is higher than expected when you eased in November  From a somewhat longer perspective, over the past year both the  unemployment rate and the federal funds rate have been reduced  significantly Other things equal, policy interest rates and unemployment  rates ought to move in opposite directions, since the lower unemployment  rate generally raises inflation risks Of course other things haven’t been  equal For one thing, inflation and, to a lesser extent, inflation  expectations were falling in 1998, raising real short-term rates  But a good  portion of the decline in nominal short-term rates since last summer  probably has fed into real rates, offsetting much of the previous increase  In addition, inflation expectations may be less likely to fall going forward  to produce such a passive tightening with the nominal funds rate  unchanged Even if the staff has given too little weight to the possibility  that the economy is much less ""inflation prone,"" transitory factors surely  have played some role in holding down prices Absent additional serious  problems abroad that reduce commodity prices and put upward pressure     2/2-3/99 90   on the dollar, those factors will abate, giving underlying cost pressures  more of a chance to show through to prices and price expectations over  time   Another thing that wasn’t equal last year was the financial market  disruptions that led to a tightening of credit conditions for a time  However, the expansion of economic activity has been supported by  reasonably well functioning financial markets of late Growth of money  has been strong, and credit has been readily available in markets as well as  at banks While risk spreads remain high in some sectors of the markets,  they have stabilized for the most part; despite higher spreads, the cost of  credit for many borrowers has declined on balance since last summer,  owing in part to Federal Reserve easings And increases in equity prices  have boosted wealth and reduced the cost of equity capital Improved  conditions in credit markets have been signaled by their resilience to year- end pressures and to the difficulties of Brazil Indeed, to the extent your  easing last November was undertaken to protect against the possibility of  major financial disruptions from these particular events, that protection  might seem to be less needed now   Despite the ongoing risks of greater price pressures, however,  inflation has remained very well behaved Moreover, threats persist to  US economic performance from developments abroad In these  circumstances, the Committee may be inclined to leave policy unchanged  today, and also to consider the odds on tightening in the near future remote  enough to justify retaining a symmetrical directive   The benign inflation news, especially when coupled with a lack of  acceleration in nominal compensation, might suggest that the potential for  higher inflation has not yet been demonstrated Uncertainties about the  supply side of the economy make preemptive policymaking especially  difficult Although the Committee may not want to await the ""smoking  gun"" of a string of higher inflation numbers before it firms, it might want  more indicators that current levels of pressures on resources were raising  costs than it now has And in this price environment, it may have the  scope to wait for confirmation that growth remains above potential before  leaning against tightening labor markets   Moreover, our economic performance may be viewed as still subject  to downside risks from developments overseas A highly unsettled  Brazilian situation has the continuing potential for financial contagion to  other countries beyond that assumed in the staff forecast And industrial  economies aside from the United States appear to be weakening In Japan  and Europe, the risks to growth prospects may be tilted to the downside  partly as a consequence of constraints on monetary policy from the zero     2/2-3/99 91   bound in Japan and from the desire to gain credibility and impose  discipline on fiscal policy in the Euro zone   Financial markets looking at the information on the US and foreign  economies have taken out their previous expectations of ease, but they  have not built in any odds of a tightening in the foreseeable future With  inflation low and expected to remain contained for some time, and with  economic prospects around the globe still more likely to be dismal than  encouraging, the potential benefits of sitting tight may be seen as  outweighing the potential costs of risking a possible future buildup of  inflation pressures   As a reminder, the implementation of the new announcement policy is  slated to begin in March, after it has been published in the Minutes and  explained by the Chairman in his testimony Should the Committee  change the symmetry in the directive or otherwise feel that it has made a  significant change in its view of the risks, an announcement of that  without this preparation might provoke an especially sharp market  reaction and an expectation of imminent tightening In any event, the  Committee will have an opportunity to give a nuanced view of its  assessment of the economic and policy outlook in the monetary policy  report and testimony on February 23    I was using it as a synonym for the equilibrium real rate, as in the   “natural rate” of unemployment--the same thing    Let me address the first question first Why is the rate with the   lower NAIRU lower than the other two?    The reason is that the economy can produce at a substantially   higher level with a NAIRU that is one percentage point lower than assumed in the   baseline As a consequence, interest rates need to be lower to stimulate the demand to   use that additional production That is a level adjustment of production out into the   infinite future Production can be higher by a couple of percentage points than at the   higher NAIRU, and a lower interest rate is needed to stimulate the demand to use the   extra production that is now available at the lower NAIRU    As for the level of the natural rate, it is higher than it has been in   some of the past forecasts, although as I noted it drifts down over time as the wealth-to-  income ratio drifts down I think the height is a result of the fact that the wealth-to-  income ratio is a lot higher than we thought it was--or thought it was going to be a year or   two ago--given what has happened to the stock market Demand has been much stronger   In effect the experience, in terms of the level of the wealth-to-income ratio and the   strength of demand at previous interest rates, has led us to think that the natural or   equilibrium rate is a lot higher than we used to believe and a lot higher perhaps than it has   been in history If the strength of demand for producers’ durable equipment and so forth   persists, the saving rate, even if it is creeping up, is going to be lower than it has been   historically, and then the natural real rate will be high relative to history    Except for that price stability one, which does a little more than   lock them in, that’s right  But that is the underlying premise of the staff forecast that you   all talked about yesterday That the economy is producing a bit beyond its potential   How much beyond is unknown, but it’s somewhat beyond In the staff forecast the   assumption is that potential is at a level of unemployment nearly a percentage point   higher than where it is right now and that ultimately, over time, that is going to show   through in inflation If you believe that analysis, the simulations show you the   implications of that analysis and those assumptions And then in fact, yes, nominal and   real interest rates will have to rise from here    Right    I wondered whether that was a question or not! [Laughter]    The gentleman would agree A key element in interpreting what   has happened over the last few years is this To what extent has there been a fundamental   shift in the structure of labor and product markets that will persist?  And to what extent   do the favorable results of the last few years stem at least partly from factors that are not   fundamental to labor and product markets such as the very sharp appreciation of the   dollar through the middle of 1998 that lowered import prices, the collapse of economies   abroad, the collapse of commodity prices and similar developments? These factors not   only lowered inflation directly but helped keep inflation expectations down   In effect, the staff has chosen to assume it was a little of each  We used to have,   not that long ago, a NAIRU of 6 percent or perhaps a little more than 6 percent We have   interpreted the good inflation numbers as reflecting in part a lowering of the NAIRU by   ½ or ¾ percentage point, depending on what day we talk to people about it, and in part as   the product of some of these other factors But I totally agree that it is in large measure a   judgment call The reason we showed Chart 4 was to indicate that if you had the other   interpretation--that the favorable inflation results reflected almost entirely a change in   structure and that the declining oil prices and rising dollar really were not important   factors--then you would come out with the lower NAIRU path as shown in Chart 4   These two charts were an effort to give you a way of doing what you just did, which is to   compare across charts and make a judgment But the key judgment relates to what     2/2-3/99 95   accounts for the good price performance of the last three years and what is the mix   between a change in structure and one-time price effects    I mentioned it as a possibility That is, to the extent that you were   buying insurance against a hurricane and the hurricane season has passed and you don’t   expect another season, then you don’t need the insurance But in part the decision   involves a judgment, in terms of the risks, as to whether the hurricane season really has   passed, if I can stretch the metaphor beyond its breaking point [Laughter] Certainly   most of us were pleasantly surprised by how well the financial markets, not only in the   United States but in other Latin American countries, weathered the Brazilian crisis But   the crisis is not over yet, so that is still a potential issue   The other thing that has happened over the last couple of months is that we all   were probably once again surprised not only by the strength of the economy but by how   well behaved inflation has been excluding the tobacco price increases In particular, the   ECI and nominal wage compensation have exhibited very good performances That is   another factor you might think about going forward We’ve not only had positive   surprises on the real side, but we have some pleasant surprises still coming in on the price   side to balance the other concerns    If you thought that the capacity utilization equation was the more   accurate equation in terms of predicting PCE, then as you remarked yesterday, Governor   Gramlich, it would be very much like the lower NAIRU situation It would indicate that   the structure of the economy had changed and that capacity utilization was a better   measure than the unemployment rate Then you would be in the lower NAIRU world   rather than the unemployment rate world    We have not done that, though the baseline does do a little of that in   the sense that the NAIRU in the baseline is considerably lower than it would have been a   couple of years ago That’s part of what the Chairman was talking about But the   baseline does take some of the favorable price and output news as stemming from supply   shocks We have not done an interpolation with an assumption, say, that the NAIRU is 5   percent But we could easily do that One can do that visually by looking between the   two charts Then in fact the interest rate would be a little too low, but not a lot The   Committee would have to tighten at some point, but the urgency of a move would   perhaps be less than indicated in the baseline One can do an ocular regression and figure   out that we are somewhere in the middle of these two scenarios    I should note that we did the simulation showing the adverse price   shocks, the dotted lines in Chart 4, in part to illustrate the power of supply shocks Those   are not very big supply shocks relative to the baseline assumptions There is a $5   difference in the price of oil and a 1 percent faster growth in benefits costs, which   translates into only ¼ percent faster growth in compensation Those supply shocks   noticeably raise the inflation rate And with the Fed leaning against increasing inflation-­  not in a really aggressive way but at least by raising the funds rate right away--we get a   higher unemployment rate and a higher inflation rate simultaneously with these adverse     2/2-3/99 100   shocks Think about the flip side of that We have had a lot of favorable shocks over the   last couple of years, and that has given us both lower unemployment and lower inflation   than we would have expected The dotted line was put there in part to let the Committee   members think about that and about what might have been if we had not had the   favorable price shocks over the last few years These price shocks are very powerful in   shaping economic performance    Including most importantly the depreciation of the dollar    Right On Chart 3 there is a difference of about 2 percentage points   between the inflation rates, and you’re talking about a scenario that might result in an   inflation rate roughly one percentage point lower than the baseline So I would take   about half the difference between the real funds rates of the two simulations on Chart 3   and load it into Chart 4 to get the inflation rate for that scenario    Right Looking back at Chart 3, you would have to tighten by   about ½ percentage point, let’s say, in the near term, but run with a substantially higher   real funds rate over the next couple of years, though not as high as in the price stability   case    A hundred basis points sounds too--   Right, that’s the lower NAIRU scenario    If it involves a significant shift in the Committee’s consensus, that   would have to be considered Yes, the new regime would be in effect     2/2-3/99 125   SPEAKER(?) But we are not required to say anything?    We are not required    The regime is in effect  "
5388,1999-03-30," Peter, your staff provided me some information on that; let me   see if I can remember it The on-the-run bid/asked spreads are back to normal levels   [Laughter]    The on-the-run spreads are back to typical levels in all sectors of   the market--in bills and both short and long coupon issues The off-the-run spreads have     3/30/99 5   come down a lot, but they are not back to where they were before the Russian crisis   They are close, but not quite there They’re still a little wider  "
5389,1999-03-30," I will be referring to the table marked “Financial Conditions” 2/   Once again the Committee is faced with considering policy against  the backdrop of unexpected strength in output and weakness in inflation  Central to that consideration would seem to be the need to determine  whether financial conditions are consistent with economic growth slowing  to trend reasonably promptly, preventing substantial further tightening of  the labor market If they are, the case for continued “watchful waiting”  would be strengthened, though the question of whether the level of  production when growth finally slowed was too high to be sustained  without inflation pressures emerging would still be open   To help with judging the appropriateness of current financial  conditions, I have distributed a table showing information on key financial  returns, prices, and quantities I chose two time periods to compare with  current conditions The first is the average of June and July of last year,  which predates the Russian crisis and subsequent turmoil in financial  markets; and the second is mid-November, just before your last easing  action Other things equal--most importantly the underlying strength of  demand--over time, unchanged financial conditions in real terms should be  consistent with output growing around its long-term trend rate In the  context of the current situation, such financial conditions ought to  contribute to a slowing of the pace of economic expansion to around the  rate of growth of its potential, although the average level of output would  not necessarily line up with the level of the economy's potential   Looking across these periods, what is striking is how little effect  monetary policy easing has had on many of these measures Short-term  borrowing costs for businesses, lines one and two, have fallen, of course,  but tightening standards and non-price terms at banks over this interval  have probably offset the effect of some of the recorded drop in the average  bank loan rate Lower short-term rates have not shown through to the cost  of longer-term business credit, lines 3, 4, and 5, perhaps the more important  determinant of spending Investors have become much more  discriminating, and while the highest quality borrowers have experienced a  decline in the cost of bond finance, lower-grade issuers are paying more  On average, it would appear that the nominal cost of long-term credit to   2 / A copy of the material used by Mr Kohn is appended to the transcript (Appendix 2)     3/30/99 50   businesses has changed little on balance since November and has increased  a bit since early last summer With longer-term inflation expectations  dropping since then, as shown by the survey results on lines 16 and 17 at  the bottom of the table, real long-term borrowing costs most likely have  risen   In the household sector, nominal interest rates are about unchanged on  fixed-rate mortgages, line 7, but have declined on consumer credit, here  represented by auto loans at banks, line 8 Trend growth in the monetary  assets of households and others, shown by M2, line 11, remains quite rapid  However, expansion in broad money has slowed more sharply in March  than had been expected, suggesting that more of the spurt of last autumn  might have been attributable to market turmoil than we had estimated and  that a slower growth trend may be emerging The foreign exchange value  of the dollar, lines 12 and 13, has fallen modestly on balance since last June  and July, but has appreciated since November In fact, after the recent  firming of interest and exchange rates, markets have already taken out  many of the effects of the third easing last November, and they have done  so without building in expectations of an imminent tightening on your part   The notable exception to this pattern of generally moderate and mixed  changes in financial conditions, of course, is the stock market The cost of  equity capital for business, line 6, apparently has dropped considerably  further and the impetus to spending from outsized increases in household  wealth remains substantial The longer-run moving average of equity price  increases, line 10, is weighted to capture the lagged effects of stock market  wealth on consumption; it suggests that the contribution of equity  appreciation to growth above trend has eased only modestly since last  summer In the staff forecast, equity prices decrease slightly and interest  and exchange rates remain near current levels so that financial conditions  are roughly unchanged for some time This stability stands in sharp  contrast to the substantial declines in long-term interest rates and increases  in equity prices in the year leading up to last June and July, which  undoubtedly contributed to above-trend growth Stable conditions should,  other things equal, tend to slow economic growth to a rate more in line  with the economy's trend rate of growth   Of course other things in addition to the changes in financial markets  captured in the table have not been equal over the last nine months  Importantly, prospective foreign demand has been revised down  considerably as the emerging market crisis has spread to Latin America and  the Japanese and European economies have weakened At the same time,  domestic demand has been more resilient than anticipated However, Mike  has discussed a number of stock-flow or accelerator-type relationships that     3/30/99 51   work in the staff forecast to reinforce the tendency for the economy to slow  at the stable financial conditions assumed in that forecast   As noted, reasonable prospects that such a slowing will occur before  very long would seem to be an important factor behind a decision to keep  policy unchanged in the near term Halting the intensification of strains on  labor resources at some point is a necessary condition for keeping inflation  in check It may not be sufficient Inflation pressures still may build, as  they do in the staff forecast, even around current levels of labor utilization  In that case, the funds rate will eventually need to be raised to contain  inflation pressures But in light of the considerable uncertainty about the  relationship of labor market tightness to inflation, if the economy is  expected to slow, the Committee may opt to await firmer evidence that  costs and prices are likely to accelerate The recent downturns in 12-month  averages of inflation in core CPI and nominal wages serve to underline  these uncertainties and also should help to keep inflation expectations in  check as the Committee sorts through the incoming data for early signs of  building inflation   In contrast, expectations that growth will continue to exceed its  longer-run trend for some time might warrant consideration of near-term  policy firming, even without hard evidence in hand of an upturn in price  inflation A significantly delayed economic slowing could leave labor  markets noticeably tighter and potential inflation pressures more intense  than today The subsequent tightening of policy and induced weakness in  economic activity needed to correct those imbalances would tend to be  larger and hence more disruptive Moreover, the possible downside risks  to the forecast that the Committee was in part insuring against in its easing  moves last fall have diminished in recent months Emerging market  economies generally have weathered the effects of Brazilian problems and  shown increasing signs that investors are regaining confidence In  domestic financial markets, liquidity has improved substantially, and risk  appetites and assessments look more reasonable   Markets would be surprised by a near-term tightening of policy and  hence would react strongly In a situation that called for policy firming  such a reaction might be seen as a necessary aspect of imparting restraint  on demand, provided it were orderly and did not precipitate a renewal of  exaggerated flights to quality and liquidity In that regard, the improving  trends in domestic and foreign financial markets have not been hindered by  the appreciable backup in intermediate- and long-term interest rates in the  United States over the intermeeting period To be sure, the effect on  markets of building in expectations of a policy firming in the next year is  not likely to be the same as the effects of experiencing such a firming     3/30/99 52   today But the reaction of markets may indicate at least that the chances of  disruption from a policy tightening today are considerably smaller even  than they were from not easing a short time ago   If the Committee saw the probability of a turnaround in inflation as  having risen, and as now more sizable than the probability of undue  softness in activity, but not by enough to tighten policy at this meeting, it  might want to consider adoption of an asymmetrical directive Such a  directive has meant different things to different people at different times  But based on past experience, an initial shift to asymmetry might connote  that, in light of those risks, the Committee saw its next move as more likely  to be a firming than an easing and that such an action probably was more  than a theoretical possibility in the distant future   The Committee has reaffirmed its option to announce immediately  such a shift in its outlook As a reminder, the Minutes and the Chairman’s  testimony noted that not every change in tilt would be published  immediately and that those that were would meet a couple of criteria They  would represent a significant change in the Committee’s thinking, one that  was not appreciated by the public or the markets, and one in which that  lack of understanding or knowledge could seriously mislead the public and  markets   At this time, markets have built in expectations that your next move is  more likely to be a tightening than an easing, but not any time soon  Market reaction to publication of a shift to asymmetry is difficult to  predict, and could be shaped to a degree by the accompanying  announcement We did, unfortunately, have one recent test--the leak of the  March 1998 shift to asymmetry In reaction to that story, federal funds  futures markets moved up their implied probability of firming at the next  meeting to 30 percent, and intermediate- and long-term rates backed up 10  basis points even though markets already had built in a 10 percent chance  of firming A case could be made for a more muted response today on the  grounds that markets would take into account the fact that after March  1997 the many asymmetrical directives toward tightening were not reliable  predictors of subsequent Committee action But the Committee did say  that it was reserving announcements for significant shifts that it wanted to  alert the markets to; and with no near-term policy firming now built into  the yield curve, an even larger reaction than a year ago is a distinct  possibility Markets might build in substantial odds on tightening in May  or June, and ratchet up expectations of short-term rate levels for the rest of  1999 and 2000 as well Moreover, with the Committee having alerted the  market to its readiness to act, market participants are likely to scrutinize  incoming data especially hard for their implications for the next meeting     3/30/99 53   If the Committee sees firming action over its next few meetings as  considerably more probable than is now built into the markets, it might  want to consider publication as well as adoption of an asymmetrical  directive Presumably, the Committee would be contemplating such a  possibility because it was concerned about the strength of demand and its  implications for inflation In this circumstance, the market reaction would  be helpful, putting in place some probably needed restraint more quickly  than if the Committee had simply waited and then tightened   If, on the other hand, the adoption of an asymmetrical directive was  seen as a more marginal shift, reflecting a changing balance of risks but not  necessarily significantly higher odds of tightening at upcoming meetings,  then the extent of market misunderstanding is relatively less, as is the need  for immediate restraint Indeed, encouraging the market to build in a  significant chance of tightening would itself be misleading In this case,  the Committee could allow the asymmetry to be published in the Minutes  of this meeting to be released in May, explaining why it did not choose to  publish it immediately  "

5433,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman At your last meeting, many  of you remarked that you were concerned that inflation would eventually  turn up and you therefore saw monetary policy as more likely to firm than  to ease, though you weren't sure when such action would be appropriate  The question for today's meeting would seem to be whether the time has  drawn closer--perhaps even close enough to tighten or, at least, to shift to  an asymmetric directive and let the public know right away that the  Committee’s concerns about inflation had increased significantly   Many of you may view the period ahead as an especially important  one for the inflation outlook As Mike noted, some of the one-time price  declines that have played a role in damping inflation are expected to be  ebbing or reversing Among them, energy prices have already risen  substantially, the prices of other important commodities have turned  around lately, and declines in other import prices should come to an end as  the effects of a more stable dollar since last summer and strengthening in  foreign economies are felt How domestic inflation responds to these  developments may help to resolve questions about the causes of the recent  inflation performance And the decision you make could be important in  determining the degree to which these price level changes become  embedded in inflation expectations, thereby affecting longer-run inflation  trends   However, judging the need for a change in the stance of policy has  been complicated by uncertainties about the supply side of the economy  and the associated lack of confidence in forecasts of inflation Preemptive  actions that turn out to be unwarranted would tend to create unnecessary  variations in economic activity and increase uncertainty, impeding  planning by businesses and households and impinging on economic  growth At the same time, however, waiting for compelling evidence of  an actual upturn in inflation before changing policy also would lead to  sizable adjustments in financial conditions and economic output In the  circumstances, the Committee presumably will want to be as forward- looking as possible, searching for early signs of changes in inflation  prospects and acting, perhaps forcefully, when it detects tendencies that  could reasonably be expected to impair economic performance over time     5/18/99 52   Since the last FOMC meeting, developments on the demand side of  the economy would seem to weigh on the side of greater concern about  future inflation Demand has been strong and economic growth has  continued at a pace in excess both of prevailing expectations and of most  estimates of the long-run expansion of potential Moreover, indicators of  a prospective moderation in spending are still quite tentative  Unless  productivity is even stronger than the upward revised estimates of the staff  forecast, growth will have to slow appreciably from the pace of the last  few quarters, if labor markets are not to come under increasing pressure   Changes in financial conditions over the last six weeks probably have  not materially added to the restraint on demand needed to moderate  expansion Rather, the run-up in yields on Treasury securities in recent  weeks seems to owe in part to the rolling back of the earlier flight to  quality as investors appear to have reduced their concerns about risk and  increased their appetite for assuming it As a result, the nominal cost of  business credit has remained about flat on average over the intermeeting  period And equity prices have climbed further, boosting wealth and  spurring consumption   More troubling, the movements in Treasury interest rates likely also  evidence some deterioration in inflation expectations, as yields on indexed  debt have edged lower and the foreign exchange value of the dollar has  slipped off some even as the interest advantage of US nominal  instruments has widened Of course, some caution in interpreting this  deterioration seems warranted To some extent, you may only be looking  in a mirror and merely seeing the market’s perceptions of the Federal  Reserve’s concerns, rather than an independent assessment of emerging  price pressures In addition, inflation fears may not have penetrated Main  Street, where the spending decisions are made, judging from the lack of  movement in price expectations in the Michigan survey But those  judgments are difficult, given the inertia in household decisionmaking and  the lags in surveying   Lastly, developments in international markets may also suggest the  increased potential for greater inflation pressures At a minimum, the  resilience of foreign markets and economies suggests that the  asymmetrical downside risks that concerned the Committee last fall have  greatly diminished As already noted, the dollar has edged off recent  highs in the exchange market; a persistence of this trend would put upward  pressure on prices and demand in the United States, reversing the  stabilizing role that the strong dollar and deteriorating trade balance have  played over the last several years For now, the relatively flat dollar  means that productive resources in the United States will not be shielded  from the additional demand brought about by policy easings and returning     5/18/99 53   confidence abroad As a consequence, the staff forecast now embodies a  sustained growth in exports   But, the economy has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to absorb  demand without generating cost and price pressures Four percent growth  in output over the last four quarters has barely nudged down the  unemployment rate Moreover, some broad measures of nominal wage  and price increases fell further through the first quarter The extraordinary  increase in productivity that has enabled demand to be met without  appreciably lowering unemployment has also helped to keep cost  pressures subdued Unit labor costs show no sign of picking up, despite  an unemployment rate at or below 4½ percent over the last year  Moreover, except for energy we have seen only small and very recent  increase in the prices of commodities and intermediate goods in the  pipeline   If, in light of this mixed evidence, the FOMC does not wish to tighten  policy at this time but still sees the inflation risks as having risen, the  Committee should consider whether to adopt an asymmetrical directive  toward tightening and whether such a directive should be announced   It is difficult to predict how markets would react to an announcement  that has no precedent And details will matter in that the response will  depend in part on the wording of the associated announcement The  market’s reaction will be influenced by the height of the hurdle the  Committee set for itself when it reaffirmed its disclosure policy The  Committee said it would reserve such announcements for significant shifts  in its thinking, especially where the absence of an announcement risked  seriously misleading the public and the markets With the bar set at that  relatively high level, the market is likely to build in substantial odds on  tightening at the June or the August meeting if the Committee announces a  tilt, perhaps on the order of 50-50 Friday’s data moved market  participants in the direction of expecting an announcement of a tilt today  and raised their assessment of the chances of policy firming in coming  months But market prices do not yet incorporate 50-50 odds of a  tightening until the fall The Committee may well be in a situation in  which, because of its announcement policy, it cannot leave markets  unaffected by its decision today, even if it follows the strong market  consensus and makes no change in the stance of policy Announcing the  Committee’s heightened concern about inflation is likely to raise rates;  omitting such an announcement is likely to lower them   If in fact the Committee is now more concerned about inflation and  hence more likely to give serious consideration to tightening at the next  few meetings, it might consider adopting and publishing an asymmetric  directive In the context of greater inflation risks, the resulting further     5/18/99 54   back-up of yields and restraint on equity prices would tend to contribute to  economic stability; a reversal of recent rate increases and equity price  declines would be counterproductive  Indeed, not publishing a tilted  directive might be seen as misleading markets in that it would lead to a  structure of market interest rates that inadequately reflected the  Committee's assessment of the economic situation A tilt would be taken  as indicating that the Committee might be especially sensitive to  information suggesting that price pressures were likely to build With the  markets on notice that policy action was under consideration, responses to  incoming data are likely to be relatively intense and markets volatile But,  to the extent participants understood your concerns and hence could  anticipate your actions reasonably well, the resulting price movements  should be constructive and stabilizing, on balance   If, on the other hand, the Committee were not so sure inflation risks  had risen appreciably, it might choose to retain the symmetrical directive  The Committee might be hesitant to act before it had more concrete  information that prices were likely to accelerate Such evidence could  come from data on costs and prices or from added pressures on resources-­ that is, a further decline in the unemployment rate Because neither of  these sets of indicators has moved much of late, the Committee might  believe that it was unlikely to get definitive enough evidence in the next  few months on these pressures to take action If this were the  Committee’s view, then publishing a tilted directive and encouraging the  market to build in expectations of tightening could ultimately be  misleading and could lessen the power of asymmetry to convey  information over time Indeed, some rally in credit markets, which would  be expected to accompany no announcement, might well accord with such  a less concerned view of the inflation outlook, particularly if the  Committee saw the sharp reaction to Friday’s data as overdone    The Committee has discussed at length whether it should change   the wording in the directive to be less specific about the intermeeting period and has had     5/18/99 55   trouble finding a consensus about how to make that change since everybody seemed to   have a different interpretation of the meaning of asymmetry I think that problem could   be handled in the announcement that accompanies a shift to asymmetry if that’s the way   you choose to go First, I wouldn’t mention the words “over the intermeeting period” in   the announcement; secondly, I might put in wording about looking at information “over   the coming months” If the announcement is clear, I doubt that people will care about the   specific wording in the directive    Well, as my answer to President Hoenig suggested, I think you   could go ahead with the present wording of the directive It strikes me that people may   not want to change the wording on the fly but would prefer to have a chance to think   about the pros and cons before reaching a decision So the Committee may want to retain   the current wording for now as long as the press statement makes the intent clear     5/18/99 69  "
5492,1999-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman The long-run strategies section of the  Bluebook highlighted two potential imbalances shaping the US economic  outlook One, the domestic saving/investment imbalance and the related current  account deficit, has been a continuing concern to policymakers Although the  contrasting cyclical circumstances between the United States and the rest of the  world have exacerbated the current account deficit in recent years, the deficit and  the saving/investment imbalance importantly also reflect the pickup in  productivity growth here That pickup has boosted wealth and permanent income,     6/29-30/99 68   encouraging our residents to cut sharply their saving out of current income;  foreigners are willing to supply the added saving needed to fund domestic  investment because that investment has such high rates of return The process is  not sustainable In the United States, saving is so low that the wealth-to-income  ratio will begin to decline once capital gains abate; abroad, portfolios are  becoming increasingly weighted toward dollar assets There is little monetary  policy can do to speed the adjustment Tightening policy, for example, would  damp income but appreciate the dollar so as to have modest net effects on the  current account   The issue for policymakers is what price changes will be put in motion as  this imbalance begins to correct itself Once productivity growth levels out,  current income will begin to catch up to permanent income; and domestic saving  out of that current income will increase, reducing the equilibrium real interest rate  in the United States and the dollar’s real exchange rate The latter would help to  sustain demand in the United States and to contain the current account deficit  The role of monetary policy, if all goes smoothly, would be to lower the short- term interest rate, following the equilibrium rate down However, events do not  always go smoothly There may be scope for alternative policies, depending on  the way the dollar falls and how foreign investors react and on cyclical  circumstances in the United States and foreign countries Portfolio shifts away  from dollar assets, for example, would call for a firmer monetary policy, as would  downward pressure on the dollar from unexpected strength in foreign economies  and their interest rates   The second imbalance highlighted in this section of the Bluebook has  more immediate monetary policy relevance--and that is the possible imbalance in  the labor markets Behind the staff forecast and baseline extension is a judgment  that the unemployment rate is now about a percentage point below its sustainable  level and that the real federal funds rate is more than a half percentage point  below its equilibrium level Structural productivity growth is projected to remain  at its recently elevated level of 2¼ percent However, because productivity  growth does not accelerate further, the effects of the overstretched labor market  will begin to be felt The rise in the nominal federal funds rate assumed for the  second half of 1999 only prevents the real funds rate from declining over the  forecast horizon As a consequence, the imbalance in labor markets persists, and  inflation continues to accelerate in 2001   The two long-run strategies presented in the Bluebook both deal with  the economic and policy disequilibrium by raising the nominal federal funds rate  1½ percentage points If the increase is rapid, before inflation has a chance to  pick up much, the real funds rate rises quickly and by enough to put significant  slack in the economy, which counteracts the inflation pressures now in train and  ultimately produces price stability If the increase in the nominal funds rate is  spread over three years, as in the baseline strategy, the pickup in inflation over  this period implies that the real funds rate rises more slowly and only by enough     6/29-30/99 69   to return the unemployment rate to the NAIRU, capping PCE inflation at the 2½  percent level   Revisions to the assumed NAIRU and to potential GDP growth have been  unusually large in recent years, responding in part to overprojections of inflation  This experience suggests that uncertainty about the specifications of the supply  side of the economy in the staff forecast and its extension might be quite sizable  The studies you received by Orphanides and by Orphanides, Porter, Reifschneider  and Tetlow highlighted the extent to which estimates of potential, and hence the  gap between actual and potential output, have been revised over the years They  also addressed the influence on appropriate monetary policy of uncertainty about  the measurement of potential They concluded that, because reacting appreciably  to mismeasured output gaps will tend to add to variations in both output and in  inflation, faced with such uncertainty you should reduce your response to  estimated output gaps, with the reduction increasing more than in proportion to  the degree of uncertainty As the authors note, the Committee in fact appears to  have been doing this in the past two years Except when you are extraordinarily  uncertain, however, the estimated gap should receive some weight in your policy  deliberations One alternative in response to uncertainty is not giving the level of  the gap any weight in your policy reactions and instead paying attention only to  the growth rate of nominal GDP relative to a targeted growth rate, which reflects  a change in the output gap and inflation This is a risk-averse strategy--very  similar to monetary targeting when velocity is well behaved--which may be less  than optimal, but would avoid large mistakes if the output gap turns out to be  substantially different than perceived when policy decisions are being made   This research suggests that in a situation where the Committee is rather  uncertain about the true level of labor resource utilization, it might attach the  highest priority to seeking growth in the economy that would maintain the  prevailing level of labor utilization unless evidence begins to accumulate that this  level of utilization is inappropriate To put this in practice in the current situation,  the Committee would want to set its policy stance to provide some assurance that  labor markets will not become tauter, but not necessarily to seek some easing of  labor market pressures Under this cautious approach, however, if the Committee  began to see signs that cost and price pressures were emerging, tending to confirm  suspicions that the economy was producing beyond its potential, it would want to  react promptly and decisively   The Committee would need to make the determination of how much  tightening is needed to bring the growth of aggregate demand back down in line  with the expansion of aggregate supply In this regard, is taking back the 75 basis  points cumulative easing of last fall necessarily a good benchmark for policy  going forward?  To be sure, the market disruptions and tightening credit  conditions that the easier policy was designed to offset have largely abated, and  the real funds rate remains lower than it was last summer despite only modest net  changes in unemployment and inflation rates since then Moreover, when the     6/29-30/99 70   Committee eased, it was motivated in part not by the most likely economic  forecast, but rather by the perception that the risks to that forecast were seriously  skewed toward the possibility of major disruptions in global financial markets and  foreign economies The evening out of the distribution of those risks, without any  other change in the forecast, would argue for some firming of policy Finally, a  reluctance to reverse course now, when market conditions have improved and  labor market imbalances threaten, might make the Committee more hesitant in  responding to rapidly deteriorating economic or financial conditions in the future   So, changing circumstances since the Committee last eased do provide a  rationale for tightening, other things equal But much has changed since last  summer, with complex implications for the inflation outlook Notably, even more  rapid productivity growth has held inflation down despite a robust economy, and  in financial markets credit conditions and bond yields are higher, while on the  other side equity prices have risen as well Moreover, the real funds rate last  summer was not necessarily at its optimal level Just as in 1988, the degree of any  eventual firming should not be keyed to the size of the previous easing, but  presumably would depend on the economic situation and the Committee’s  objectives--and could be more or less than 75 basis points   In the staff forecast, a fairly modest firming of the federal funds rate--50  basis points over the second half of the year--is sufficient to slow growth to a bit  below the rate of growth in potential output, at least for a while If it turns out  that growth in potential output is higher because productivity continues to  accelerate, real GDP need not moderate so much to stabilize labor utilization But  that more vigorous productivity performance will also likely induce stronger  demand growth than projected by the staff as profits and equity prices are  boosted In that circumstance, some further policy firming may still be necessary  to keep labor markets from tightening   Data becoming available since the last meeting do not suggest an economy  or inflation process gathering the sort of steam that would require a sizable  backup in rates to contain In fact, economic expansion is estimated to have  slowed in the second quarter to around the pace of its potential Though  compensation trends may be a bit less favorable than expected, 12-month changes  in average hourly earnings remain damped and CPI inflation is probably a little  lower than many on the Committee had feared at the last meeting Financial  flows also do not suggest an accelerating pace of spending Money growth seems  to be on a slightly slower track in recent months, even after allowing for the give- back of the surge of late last year, and credit growth continues to average in the  neighborhood of 6 percent Moreover, the recent growth rates of aggregate  demand and of money and credit do not reflect the backup in interest rates of the  last two months, which is too recent to have had much effect yet   Still, the signs of slowing are tentative, and, if labor markets are in the  process of tightening further, the longer the slowing is delayed, the more cost and     6/29-30/99 71   price pressures will build Under these circumstances, the substantial easing of  financial conditions that would follow a decision not to validate at least the first  policy-firming step already built into markets could be counterproductive Hence,  even a cautious approach to preemptive policy might suggest a 25 basis point  increase in the federal funds rate to assure better that aggregate demand will rise  no faster than aggregate supply   In addition to its decision about the stance of policy immediately after the  meeting, the Committee also needs to consider its posture going forward Such  deliberations have always played a role at your meetings, but their importance has  been heightened by the Committee’s policy of giving a public rationale for its  action and by the option to announce changes in the tilt of the directive Beyond  the action you choose today, there are three mechanisms available to convey your  message to financial markets the wording of the accompanying announcement,  the tilt to the directive, and the tone of Chairman Greenspan’s Humphrey- Hawkins testimony in three weeks How you mix and match from these  possibilities will importantly shape how markets react to your direct action and to  the data releases and other events in the weeks that follow   If the Committee were concerned that a cautious approach to policy  firming posed unnecessary risks that inflation would end up higher than was  consistent with the good performance of the economy, it might see, and want to  indicate, the possibility of an appreciable increase in the federal funds rate An  example is the price stability alternative and the incorporated 150 basis points of  tightening in relatively short order Even if the Committee were not intent on  conducting policy over coming quarters to achieve literal price stability, it might  have doubts that a less aggressive policy, as in the baseline, would serve even to  cap the rise in inflation at a reasonable rate These concerns would be heightened  if the Committee were skeptical that the growth of aggregate demand would slow  as in the staff forecast because, for example, such a slowdown depends on a  leveling out of equity prices Furthermore, the Committee may have sufficient  confidence that a 4¼ percent unemployment rate is unsustainably low that it  wishes to take strong, prompt actions to ease pressures in the labor markets before  inflation begins to pick up   In these circumstances, the Committee might want to consider a 50 basis  point increase in the intended federal funds rate, or a 25 basis point rise today  with the strong presumption of a like rise within a few months Such sentiments  would be accurately reflected in an asymmetrical directive and perhaps in  heightened inflation concerns expressed in the associated announcement and  testimony Any backup in rates this combination would cause would contribute to  achieving the Committee’s objective, given its view of the need for forceful  action to contain inflation   The choice of the tilt in the directive is less clear-cut if the Committee  were to take a more measured approach to preemptive action in light of aggregate     6/29-30/99 72   supply uncertainties The Committee might still suspect that another tightening  will be needed this year just to align the growth of demand with that of supply, as  in the staff forecast A reasonably strong presumption in this direction, and a  sense that such a tightening is a real possibility in the next few months might lead  the Committee to adopt an asymmetrical directive The asymmetry would not  come as a surprise to market participants, who would examine the announcement  especially carefully for indications of whether your asymmetry extended beyond  the next firming   But if the Committee saw that next action as somewhat uncertain--quite  dependent on incoming data and not a precursor to a more extended series of  firmings absent more concrete evidence of stronger oncoming inflation--it might  want to adopt an untilted directive Such a directive might also have some appeal  because, by reducing the sense that action was imminent, it might help to forestall  a market dynamic that risked building in stronger expectations of near-term  firming than the Committee found comfortable It would not preclude the  Committee’s giving its views that it continued to need to be especially wary of the  potential for increasing inflation And the expression of such concerns in the  announcement and reinforced in the Chairman’s testimony would help to limit  any market rally that tended to emerge from moving to a balanced directive    I think it’s all part of the same phenomenon The wealth-to-income   ratio declines for a couple of reasons One is that equity prices don’t rise so rapidly   relative to current income There is a projected flattening out in the next two years, as   you know, and very modest increases thereafter in the equity wealth-to-income ratio But   it’s more than that because it’s not only the behavior of the stock market, it’s the fact that     6/29-30/99 73   people are not saving enough out of current income We, the residents of the United   States, are not buying enough of this wealth that’s being created to keep our wealth-to-  income ratio from falling at the current saving rate So I think what happens here is that   in a sense the growth in productivity levels out and this helps to level out the stock   market because we don’t have the continued capital gains and rise in profitability   It also brings current income up to permanent income All those things work   together to raise current saving out of income So, the flattening of the stock market, the   leveling out of the growth rate of permanent income, the catch-up of the growth rate of   current income, and the increase in the saving rate are all a part of the same phenomenon,   which is basically the leveling out in the growth of productivity I think one could look at   it either way That the wealth-to-income ratio is falling and that’s why people save more,   or that the wealth-to-income ratio is falling in part because people save so little and that   induces them to increase their saving    Right    Well, when all is said and done, it ought to be at a higher rate than   it was four years ago    But it ought to be at a lower rate than it is currently given the low   rate of saving out of income and a very rapid rate of investment As productivity growth   levels out, investment tends also to level out So the equilibrium interest rate should be   lower later than it is now and on a downtrend as saving picks up, but at a level that’s   higher than it might have been 5 or 10 years ago    If you were confident that you needed to move 50 basis points and   it wasn’t really dependent on the incoming data over the next couple of months, I don’t   think there would be anything gained by doing 25 now and waiting to do 25 later So, in   the case where you were confident that you needed to do 50 and didn’t want to see more   data, then you ought to do 50 and announce symmetry I think initially the market would   be very surprised and there would be a reaction Depending on the announcement, the   market might tend to build in a lot more tightening later You would have to be very   clear in the announcement that this is it for a while, as the ECB tried to do I think those   announcements are tricky You don’t ever want to tie your hands for very long after   you’ve made a move You don’t know what’s coming next   The sort of in-between situation is the one where you’re fairly confident you need   to do 25 now and you’re not that confident about the next 25 If you’re reasonably   confident about the next 25 and see its likelihood as pretty high--it would take some   unusual data to dissuade you and you’re planning on doing the additional 25 at the next   meeting or the meeting after that--I think asymmetry would accurately represent your   views The market would get wound up and build that tightening in, at least after its   experience during the last intermeeting period, especially if its expectations were   confirmed at this meeting And that would be okay because in this in-between situation   you actually do intend to do that next 25 But if you were less certain--if you thought the   next 25 might be necessary but you weren’t sure when, and if it were highly dependent     6/29-30/99 75   on the information you’d be getting over the next couple of months--then you might be   concerned that doing 25 plus putting in the asymmetry would end up creating   expectations of a further move You would come to the August or October meeting with   these high expectations embedded in the market but you might not want to move and   you’d have given the market a false signal The other option I tried to put on the table is   that of going to symmetry and trying to calm things down a little--not creating strong   expectations of a move at the next meeting But in addition you could indicate in the   announcement and in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that your major concern was   still on the side that inflation pressures might be building and you might need to move   You just weren’t so sure about that and, therefore, you didn’t put in the asymmetry    Let me take the second one first We have built in a market   learning process in the price stability alternative The public, not just the markets but   businesses and households, learn about this over about two years So in some sense the   actual goal is phased in and then the markets’ learning about it is phased in We smooth   that through, but it is there So whatever the Committee is targeting, markets and   households do perceive it It just gets built in gradually The gradual adjustment of the     6/29-30/99 76   funds rate differs from an even sharper increase in the funds rate in the near term that   would be indicated by the Taylor rule So there is total credibility here It happens over a   couple of years, but it’s built into the forecast Unlike the old MPS model, which was   totally backward-looking, this has forward-looking expectations and the credibility   effects get built in    It obviously includes effects on exchange rates and the stock market   and that sort of thing But what it doesn’t include is some nonlinearity, shall we say It   doesn’t take into account some unusual reactions that might occur because foreign   economies, say, or even domestic financial markets are unusually nervous or unsettled at   this point and might be more subject than they have been historically to a very sharp,   sudden move in Federal Reserve policy Basically this builds in how all these markets   have reacted on average over time We did not deviate from that We did not in our   simulations take account of the fact that the current state of the world may not be equal to   the average over history and that reactions might be very much stronger in certain   situations    This is similar, in my mind, to what Karen was showing in the   Chart Show yesterday--that is, the possibility of a portfolio shift in which dollar assets   become less attractive relative to foreign assets, not because dollar assets are less   attractive but because foreign assets are more attractive From your perspective on the   Committee, this might tend to accentuate any decline in the dollar It would look like a   portfolio shift against the dollar In fact, it would be a shift in favor of foreign assets, but   it would be a relative portfolio shift It would put downward pressure on the dollar And   perhaps even in this very benign scenario of rising saving and downward pressure on   equilibrium interest rates in the United States it would mean that you would need to have   a less marked easing of policy as things corrected, or even a tightening of policy   Obviously from a global perspective this would be a positive development for the   world But it would mean that the United States would stand out less from the rest of the   world than it has over the last few years And I think portfolio preferences would shift as   a consequence, and that would have an implication on our forecast--perhaps, as I say,   accelerating the downward movement of the dollar    President Moskow, I don’t think I am concerned if your concerns   and your outlook are accurately expressed in the announcement and the Chairman’s   testimony That is, you could move to symmetry but still express the view that the major   development you’re most concerned about that would threaten the good performance of   the US economy would be a pickup in inflation You would indicate that you will be   especially alert for that, but you don’t have enough confidence that such a pickup is   coming along to be able to say there’s a high probability of moving at the next meeting or   the meeting thereafter, which retaining asymmetry might imply So I don’t see a   credibility problem with going to symmetry, provided the accompanying explanations   express your concerns There’s nothing about symmetry that means you can’t move if   the information that comes in suggests that you need to move The Committee has   frequently taken policy actions from symmetrical directives If the markets are surprised,   so be it The most important thing you do, obviously, is to make monetary policy That   you can prepare the markets and be accurate forecasters and tell them where the risks are   coming from is a nice bonus If you’re right, that will help markets react in a stabilizing   way consistent with your concerns It’s quite possible that you will expect one thing and   something else will happen, but you could still react I don’t see symmetry and then   action from symmetry as doing anything to the Federal Reserve’s credibility, assuming   the Committee gave an honest and full explanation of its assessment of the risks And   perhaps the nuances involved in that assessment could be conveyed better in that way   than through the symmetry/asymmetry on/off switch    My concern actually would be the other way After you announced   your tilted directive, a lot of observers noted that it had had very little meaning in the   past--that only a small proportion of such directives had actually led to a tightening But   somehow that tilt put the spotlight on the Federal Reserve And the interaction of that   asymmetry and the statements coming from the Federal Reserve built in a much stronger     6/29-30/99 79   presumption of tightening than I think most of the Committee members had in mind   when you made that move in May So in some sense your concern might be that   announcing an asymmetrical directive would provoke a market reaction that would not be   consistent with how you plan to approach your next couple of meetings I think an   announcement of asymmetry has a problem also in terms of potentially misleading the   markets about how you view your policy stance    My view is that you can give a sense that the risks are not balanced,   but they’re just not so unbalanced that you see a high probability of action at the next   meeting Yes, we’re slicing the baloney very thin here! [Laughter] I think the   Committee is in a very difficult position The attention on its statements has become very   intense; each word is examined It’s very, very hard to convey accurately the subtleties   of a position where future actions are highly data-dependent Yes, you think the next   action is more likely to be a tightening than an easing, but you’re not sure when That’s   the information the markets are looking for and that’s the sort of thing that used to be   conveyed in the minutes and the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony That is now conveyed in   the announcements and the publication of the symmetries, but you have less opportunity   to explain the nuances--to say on the one hand or on the other hand So the Committee is   in a difficult position It is a position, I guess, in which you might argue that neither   symmetry nor asymmetry, as the markets potentially see it, accurately represents your   perspective Given the potential reactions to the announcements, the question is how to   walk through that minefield, how to least mislead market participants    I know that we went to symmetry after each move I’m not sure of   the subsequent moves because they weren’t at every meeting Sometimes we skipped a   meeting I don’t know Norm Bernard, do you know whether the subsequent moves   were from a symmetric directive? I know that every tightening was accompanied by a   shift to symmetry but I’m not sure whether there was a shift to asymmetry in the interim    I guess not! [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?) That’s a good answer    I’d say they would view a change from a symmetrical to an   asymmetrical directive as being a strong forecast of the next move I guess one concern   would be that they might come to interpret it as a stronger forecast than the Committee   intended Now, this may come out of the Committee’s attempt to retain as a policy   choice the option of asymmetry that wouldn’t necessarily be published In the process of   explaining the Committee’s policy on announcing tilts in the directive, we said the   Committee would only publish strong asymmetries  The markets perhaps reacted to that,   which may have made it worse Peter Fisher’s chart yesterday I thought was revealing   Bond rates actually went down in the week after the asymmetry was published So the   publication of the asymmetry per se didn’t build in this tightening I don’t have a fed   funds futures table in front of me, but my memory is that those futures moved a couple of   basis points--3, 4, or 5 basis points on the publication--but didn’t do much thereafter, or   may even have come off a little I think the publication of the asymmetry interacted with   subsequent events to build this tightening in; it put more attention on the statements of   the Chairman and other Committee members and then that built in the tightening   Now, what we don’t know is what the markets will read from this last   intermeeting period if, in fact, the Committee tightens today We don’t know whether   they’ll say “See, we were right; you published asymmetry and then you tightened” If     6/29-30/99 81   there were a couple of instances where you went to asymmetric directives, published   those asymmetric directives and didn’t tighten, I think the market over time would learn   that asymmetry isn’t necessarily a serious indication of an imminent policy move But   you would have to be willing to live with markets building in something, then taking it   out, which isn’t awful if you want to retain the asymmetry as a softer indication of the   balance of risks But I think it would involve a learning process for the markets    I think the more general point, President Broaddus, is that what the   world is really interested in is the Committee’s views of where it is going from here   They have the 25 basis points built in Now they want whatever clues they can get about   where you are going; the symmetry/asymmetry is a clue but it may not be the only one  "
5550,1999-08-24," It is paragraphs four and five that are giving him difficulty I think   keeping the first two paragraphs and suspending the rest would be fine That would   accomplish the objective    This would be a more formal way of doing that    Right    Credit unions    That’s so they can meet their obligations very early in the year if people   have trouble getting cash to them They want to be certain they will have plenty of cash to   meet their needs    We don’t see any reason to think that the Federal Reserve won’t have   many times the amount of currency that will be demanded in the fourth quarter That’s not   an issue I think the issue is how much will be outstanding in the hands of the public and,   therefore, how many assets the Federal Reserve will need to hold to offset that    No We’ve done some analysis of the surveys that have been done of   households Interestingly, they tend to cluster around the $500 per household level--if we   make some assumptions and drop out the extremes--that we used for our planning purposes   Now, even that may be high But, as best we can ascertain, the intentions of households and   of banks to get currency are all roughly consistent with the estimates we used in the   planning that we were doing some time ago    President Parry, I think Peter’s goal is to achieve the FOMC’s objectives   for keeping the federal funds rate in a range around its target The very high likelihood is   that if people wanted to exercise the options because rates were high, that would be a day on   which Peter would be doing lots and lots of RPs  So, in effect, I don’t think this presents a   risk to us It may actually help to limit the risk that he wouldn’t be able to meet his   objective of calming markets down So, if anything, it reduces the risks relative to his   objective Secondly, there are issues having to do with where the RP rate is relative to the   federal funds rate But the very high likelihood is that if the RP rate is very high--so that   people want to do these RPs with us--the federal funds rate would be very high And that   would be a day on which the Desk would be adding a lot of reserves, and the exercise of   these options would be only the first step in what would likely be a long list of reserve-  supplying operations that day On the other side, in the case of a reserve-absorbing   operation--if the rates are so low that they’re in effect doing the matched sales with us--we’d   probably be doing matched sales that day also So, if anything, these market instruments   reduce the risk that Peter won’t be able to hit his objective, which is obviously very different   from the profit and loss risk that a commercial bank would face     8/24/99 24    Along that line, one good outcome might be that the dealers would   simply pass these options through to their customers That is, if they took the options and in   turn entered into the same contract with their customers--customers who don’t have access   to the Federal Reserve either through the primary dealer network or because they’re not   commercial banks or other depository institutions--that would afford those customers some   degree of confidence They would know that they could put the securities back to the   dealer, who would in turn put them back to the Fed or they could borrow from the dealer on   a collateralized basis, and the dealer in turn could borrow from the Desk collateralized So,   having these pass through the primary dealer system to the other market participants I think   would potentially be a very positive development    With a limit they will bid up the price, depending on how they think   they can turn this onto their customers  That will tend to reduce the subsidy  "
5551,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman   Judging from the remarks of policymakers, a further small increase in  the federal funds rate would seem to be in the works at this meeting  Private domestic demand is expected to remain strong, at a time when the  restraining effects of fiscal policy and of developments overseas will be  diminishing Deepening problems abroad and their spillover to the US  economy and financial markets have played an important role in  justifying holding policy steady from late 1997 through last summer and  then easing last fall In effect, the Committee has allowed relatively  accommodative financial conditions to boost domestic demand in order to  offset the depressing effect on domestic production of lower exports and  higher imports--and the FOMC has had additional scope to do so while  keeping inflation contained as foreign developments damped import  prices The easings last fall in particular were designed to protect not  only against the anticipated effects of global financial market turmoil, but  to take account of heightened downside risks as well In large measure  because of these policies, the United States not only remained an “oasis     8/24/99 70   of prosperity” but--to stretch the metaphor to the breaking point-­ provided water to the rest of the world in the form of strong demand for  its goods and services   But now domestic demand abroad is strengthening and import price  declines are coming to an end As Karen noted, recovery seems to have  taken hold in a number of emerging market economies, and, while the  vigor of the European and Japanese economies may be in question, at  least the downside risks in those economies appear to have greatly  diminished Under these circumstances it becomes increasingly  important to trim the strength of domestic demand here if we are to avoid  putting additional pressures on US resources The turnaround abroad is  occurring when the level of labor resource utilization here at home is  extraordinarily high The unemployment rate is as low as it has been on a  sustained basis since the late 1960s, and some recent data on labor costs  at least hint at the possibility that it might be too low to be consistent with  containing inflation Even if the Committee is not yet ready to judge  these recent data as the beginning of an uptrend in unit labor cost  increases, as in the staff forecast, it may still see the current  unemployment rate as low enough to justify tilting policy on the side of  forestalling any further declines in the unemployment rate   The slowing of domestic demand needed to keep the unemployment  rate from falling is likely to depend, as Mike noted, on retaining the  greater degree of restraint in financial markets that evolved over recent  months as private long-term interest rates rose 75 basis points and stock  prices leveled off That restraint, in turn, owed importantly to growing  expectations that the Federal Reserve would tighten policy A firming at  this meeting, together with the action taken in June, would validate those  expectations and should tend to keep interest rates and equity prices near  current levels   If the Committee decides to raise its target for the federal funds rate  by ¼ percentage point, as in alternative C in the Bluebook, you will also  need to decide what your view is of the balance of risks going forward  and how to convey that view to the public   An inflation outlook similar to that in the staff forecast would offer a  rationale for adopting and announcing an asymmetric directive In that  forecast, the unemployment rate is judged currently to be appreciably  below its sustainable level and financial conditions not yet restrictive  enough to damp demand sufficiently to raise that rate Consequently,  inflation is on an upward trend in 2000 and beyond, even with the  assumption of a near-term firming of policy and another tightening next  spring An alternative model simulation in the Greenbook indicates that  something like 150 basis points of tightening would be needed by mid-    8/24/99 71   2000 to cap inflation at a little over recent rates With actual or  anticipated century date change disruptions in markets possibly  constraining policy increasingly over the fourth quarter, if the Committee  thought it might want to raise rates by a substantial amount by next  spring, it might want to give serious consideration to tightening again in  October In this case, an asymmetric directive would give due warning  that the Committee saw the inflation risks as remaining serious and was  determined to take action in the near term to forestall a prolonged  acceleration in prices Tightening in October ought to be far enough in  advance of year-end to avoid aggravating market dislocations stemming  from last-minute century date change preparations   An asymmetrical directive after a 25 basis point rate increase would  come as a surprise to market participants, and their responses would help  to impose added restraint the Committee would find helpful if it were still  quite concerned about inflation risks Interest rates would rise somewhat  and markets would remain volatile, pressuring spreads, which have  retreated in recent days when benign price data seemed to reduce the  odds on a policy tightening in the fourth quarter Judging from the  response to the May tilt announcement and the July testimony, with a tilt  toward tightening markets would be likely to react more strongly to  incoming data that tended to confirm intensifying price pressures than to  information that did not point in that direction, and there is a high  probability that they would build in a further rate increase in October  unless the data were consistently to the weak side   If, on the other hand, the Committee saw the inflation risks as having  been reduced enough by its two tightenings to allow it to observe  incoming data for a while without the presumption of a near-term  tightening, it might want to adopt and announce a symmetrical directive  After 50 basis points of federal funds rate increases this year and little  apparent change in inflation expectations, the Committee will already  have raised real interest rates appreciably in the last few months Those  increases, as they came to be expected, were largely responsible for  pushing many private long-term rates up to their highest levels since the  end of the 1994-95 series of tightenings, and they have contributed to  sustaining a slower growth trend for money and credit Recent data on  several components of final sales already suggest a moderating trend,  with these readings taken even before most of the effects of the rise in  interest rates and flattening of equity prices have been felt As a  consequence, the Committee may see the risks around the forecast of  slowing growth as much better balanced than they have been for some  time   Uncertainties about the growth in productivity, the level of the  NAIRU, and the supply side of the economy more generally also may     8/24/99 72   support the case for a spell of watchful waiting Such uncertainties make  preemptive policy more difficult, and may argue, as noted in the papers  sent to the Committee before its last meeting, for tempering the response  to estimated output gaps relative to that on incoming inflation data In  these circumstances, with core inflation still quite subdued, if the  economy looked like it was slowing to the growth rate of its potential, the  Committee might want somewhat more evidence that labor costs were on  a sustained upward trend relative to the growth of productivity--and that  therefore the unemployment rate was too low--before deciding that it  needed to tighten further   Finally, financial markets remain unusually skittish and sensitive  After the crisis of last summer, participants are less willing and less able  to arbitrage spreads back down once they have begun to widen  Moreover, widening spreads on Brady bonds and weakening equity  markets in a number of emerging market economies in recent weeks  suggest that confidence is fragile and that downside risks persist in these  economies and are perceived to be heightened by increases in interest  rates in the United States Even at home, reduced liquidity has made  markets more vulnerable to shocks, such as positioning in advance of the  century date change and shifting perceptions of monetary policy  intentions A symmetrical directive would reduce one source of  uncertainty and volatility, perhaps leaving markets better able to cope  with other problems, such as century date change preparations   A symmetrical directive would not rule out a near-term policy action  should developments take a significant unexpected turn But such a  directive could convey the Committee’s feeling that in the near term,  absent such an eventuality, it would be content to evaluate the data and  the effects of actions already taken If this were the Committee’s  intention, care would be needed to ensure that this came through in the  announcement, so that market participants did not interpret the symmetry  as merely a repeat of the symmetry in June, which they have been told  was more fundamentally asymmetric than they first perceived  "
5599,1999-10-05," I would just add that I think one important reason the swap spread came   down and stayed down was the announcement effects on the mortgage-backed securities market in   particular, which is closely related to the swap market But another reason was that the flood of   issuance that had been anticipated for September really did not happen And one of the things   we’re hearing is that issuers are a little more relaxed about the possibility of coming to market in   October and November So, we are hearing less of those stories about people believing they had to   get all their financing done before September was over or at least before October was over At the   very least one could say that the frenzy hasn’t gotten any worse Things may have calmed down a   little But the spreads that you cited suggest that people are still being very, very cautious about   extending credit--particularly unsecured short-term credit over the turn of the year That is where   the risks are    One reminder, Mr Chairman The Committee in its mail-in ballot, voted-­   including the nonvoting Presidents the vote was 10 to 3, I think--to change the order of the lead-in   paragraph in the directive so that the inflation sentence is first    So we’ll go with the old one?  "
5600,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman     10/5/99 42   Committee decisions at this meeting would seem to be complicated not only  by continuing uncertainty about the sources of the unusually good economic  performance of the United States and how best to sustain it, but also by the possible  effects on policy strategy over the near term of the coming century date change  Mike and Karen have described the forces in the staff forecast that give a distinct  upward tilt to projected inflation over the next few years, even with a moderate  amount of policy tightening next year Of course, the Committee may not share the  staff’s concerns, in which case many of these complications recede Broad  measures of prices and wages behaved remarkably favorably over the intermeeting  period--more so than before the August meeting These data, along with the  sideways movement of the unemployment rate this year, suggest that to date  aggregate supply has been sufficient to satisfy aggregate demand, even with the  economy operating at a high level and demand expanding rapidly If the Committee  believes that this balance has a good chance of continuing--or wanted to wait a  while to see whether it did--it may see preemptive tightening as inappropriate at this  time, especially after two preemptive actions at the last two meetings, and hold  policy unchanged Moreover, in this environment, the Committee may be  sufficiently uncertain that inflation is headed higher to have no priors about the  predominant weight of information that will be coming in for a time, making an  unbiased directive a good description of its policy inclinations over the next few  months   While market participants generally do not expect a change in the stance of  policy at this meeting, a growing number have come to anticipate that the  Committee will adopt and announce a biased directive Moreover, markets have  priced in significant odds on a tightening in November If a symmetric directive is  taken as a sign that the chances are good that the Committee will be on hold until  next year, prices in financial markets could rise some To the extent the  Committee’s choices were seen as driven more by Y2K concerns than a  downplaying of inflation risks, firming actions for next year should continue to be  built into the yield curve, limiting the extent of the rally Still, a more substantial  upward turn in bond and stock prices cannot be ruled out   Even a limited rally might be counterproductive to the Committee’s goals,  especially so if the inflation risks were viewed as substantial enough to raise the  possibility of policy adjustments over the next few months The misimpression that  policy was on hold might make it more difficult for the Committee to act later in the  year or make market adjustments more wrenching when it did so And a rally would  lessen any check on spending currently being imparted in financial markets This  would be especially serious if the Committee felt that domestic demand might not  slow sufficiently to offset the pickup in worldwide growth that is already raising  commodity prices and exerting pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar  As Mike noted, incoming data over the intermeeting period also showed surprisingly  persistent strength in various elements of domestic spending   The Committee’s strategy for dealing with such developments might depend  on its assessment both of the degree of inflation risks and of whether Y2K     10/5/99 43   considerations might constrain its actions at its next meeting in November  Considerable information will become available between now and then that could be  of particular help in shedding some light on the various uncertainties the Committee  faces On the demand side, signs should be more evident about how domestic  spending is responding to the tightening of policy and the more general increases in  interest rates and leveling out of stock prices of recent months On the supply side,  substantial new data on labor costs--including an ECI and two readings on average  hourly earnings--should aid in getting a better fix on whether pressures on costs and  prices are likely to be mounting And the two employment reports also will provide  considerable new information on the balance of supply and demand   But at the same time, those incoming data will commingle the effects of  precautionary Y2K purchases and the more fundamental strength in demand The  picture in financial markets will likely be even more obscure Markets are likely to  be thinner than usual in mid-November, as many borrowers will already have  satisfied their borrowing needs and extended the maturity of their obligations to  avoid the year-end Yield spreads, particularly for short-term credits, should be  wide as lenders draw back from taking risks, and are unlikely to provide reliable  readings on assessments of borrower risk and credit conditions beyond the century  rollover period Moreover, the reactions to policy changes will be harder to predict,  especially if the change is unexpected   If the Committee thought Y2K-related distortions to data and effects on the  fragility of market conditions would be a substantial barrier to raising rates before  next February or to publishing an asymmetric directive at this or coming meetings,  and also saw the inflation risks as quite substantial and likely to intensify over the  coming few quarters, it might be more inclined to tighten at this meeting A delay  of several months under these circumstances would tend to accentuate the  overshooting of the economy and require considerably more disruptive adjustments  down the road, especially if perceptions that the Committee was on hold sparked a  substantial rally in financial markets Indeed, if the Committee thought there was a  considerable likelihood that tightening would be called for in the near term, taking  that action at this meeting and indicating that another move was unlikely for a while  might remove one element of uncertainty from markets--clearing the decks, so to  speak, for participants to deal with Y2K To be effective, however, such a statement  would need to be credible Reference to completing the retrenchment from the 75  basis points of easing last fall might be helpful But, tightening at this meeting  would follow a “truly symmetrical” announcement in August, possibly making  market participants difficult to convince that this time you truly were on hold   Nonetheless, the greater likelihood is that Y2K effects will not rule out action  in November While markets may be thin, spreads may not be much different than  they are now if many people succeed in getting their financing done early And the  backup mechanisms put in place for the discount window and open market  operations should provide the Committee with some assurance of protection against  some of the adverse consequences of even more intense flights to liquidity and  safety As noted, those who should be most sensitive to these considerations,     10/5/99 44   market participants themselves, in their commentary and their asset pricing have not  ruled out a November tightening And, not all incoming information will be equally  muddied by any precautionary stockpiling for the century date change For  example, such activity is likely to have a greater distorting effect on spending data  than on broad measures of prices and costs, given the normal inertia of the latter,  except in commodity markets Adverse information on labor costs or inflation could  cause markets to build in expectations of Federal Reserve action Failing to meet  those expectations, without a good economic rationale, might itself raise questions  about the Federal Reserve’s lack of confidence in the functioning of markets  through the century date rollover period   If the Committee believes it should be able to tighten in November if  necessary, it might want to keep policy unchanged but consider whether to adopt  and publish an asymmetrical directive The market’s response to an asymmetric  directive would be conditioned in part by recent history Given the Committee’s  evident reluctance to announce an asymmetrical directive in June, markets might  interpret such a directive at this time as indicating that the Federal Reserve was  seriously considering near-term policy action The Committee might be able to  temper this response with the wording of the announcement Still, market  participants could price in a little higher odds on a firming in November than they  now have, with an associated backing up of interest rates Such a reaction would  not be a problem if, in fact, the Committee was concerned about inflation risks,  because any firming of financial conditions would impart some restraint sooner  Notice that the Federal Reserve was poised to act would tend to increase the  response of financial asset prices to incoming information and to policymaker  statements over the intermeeting period The risk, of course, is that the markets  might build in a considerably greater likelihood of tightening than is consistent with  the Committee’s assessment of the economic situation, complicating your choices in  November   If the Committee were uncomfortable with this risk, but also uncomfortable  with the potential interpretation and market response to the announcement of an  unbiased directive, it could try to find a middle way The experience in June  suggests that this will be difficult to pull off effectively In that instance, markets  were surprised to find out well after the announcement that some bias toward  tightening was embedded in a symmetric directive One approach to this apparent  inconsistency would be to suspend voting on the sentence containing the bias by  removing it from the operating paragraph until the Committee has a chance to  consider the working group’s recommendations next spring, but to convey in an  announcement the Committee’s assessment of the balance of risks to economic  performance By focusing on what many members of the Committee already saw as  the important information it had to impart to markets, this alternative might have  some attractive features both as a near-term stop-gap measure and as a longer-term  solution to excessive weight being placed on the Committee’s choice of very few  standardized words about future policy And, it could well have the desired effect  relative to asymmetry of damping market responses to any announcement today and  to subsequent information Its possible drawbacks include the potential for adding     10/5/99 45   to market uncertainties about your attitude toward policy biases and their meaning,  and the risk that the precedent it set would narrow the Committee’s options when  the subcommittee reports back next spring Finally, the Committee could vote for  an asymmetric directive    I think one can differentiate between where we’ve been and where we’re   projected to go in that regard I absolutely agree with your characterization of the forecast It is not   a balanced forecast Aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply There are upward pressures on   inflation And implicitly in the forecast the unemployment rate needs to rise by a significant   amount before demand is brought down Growth needs to slow and the unemployment rate needs   to rise before demand and supply are brought into balance    Looking back, one could say that aggregate supply and demand have been in   balance, at least in total, as evidenced by what has been happening to prices But there are   elements of imbalance within that total We’ve talked about this before, certainly, and one such   element is the current account deficit and the trade balance Another that people often cite is the   level of asset prices--particularly the level of stock market prices, which seem out of balance with   reasonable expectations of earnings and reasonable discount factors for risky assets I think how     10/5/99 46   that international imbalance is corrected is very key Governor Gramlich brought up a couple of   possibilities One possibility that we modeled in a previous Bluebook--that would have been in   July, I think--was that of a rise in US saving rates That was a relatively benign possibility The   stock market levels out and starts heading down in part because other places appear to be better   places to invest than the United States US saving rates begin to rise as wealth-to-income ratios   fall We cut back consumption, and exports begin to replace that consumption In that example we   actually had a fairly easy restoration of balance within the aggregate demand sector and kept the   balance between aggregate supply and demand as well   It’s very hard to tell what will happen Certainly the risks, as Karen Johnson and others   have pointed out, would be that before saving increases in the United States, the willingness of   others to ship their savings to us to accumulate more dollar assets declines And we’d have what   looks like an exogenous shift in the demand for dollars, putting downward pressure on the dollar   So there is a risk involved that would add to inflation pressures as well as to demand on the United   States But I think it is very crucial how that correction occurs and what is happening to domestic   demand at the time it occurs Rather than focusing on just that piece by itself, the context in which   these developments occur has to be taken into account as well    You read “cost increases significantly” rather than “costs to increase”?     10/5/99 72    Then “in a manner” doesn’t work   "
5650,1999-11-16," Money stock currency has been growing at 9, 10, 11 percent    It is in line with the rate at which it has been growing all year and it is   comparable to the rate of growth last year So there does not seem to be much, if anything, going   on there  "
5651,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman   Based on the information received since your last meeting, most market  observers have characterized your decision today on whether to raise rates or  leave them unchanged as a “close call” And in the interest rate futures market  the odds on a 25 basis point policy firming at this meeting are not far from 50-50   On one side, data related to costs and prices generally have continued to be  favorable Despite tautness in labor markets, nominal wage and compensation  increases by most measures remained more moderate than many had anticipated  and betrayed few signs of a pickup Moreover, revised NIPA data have bolstered     11/16/99 42   the case for accelerating productivity that could keep inflation pressures contained  for a while Taken together, this information has led the staff to flatten slightly  the trajectory of price acceleration in the Greenbook forecast An alternative  simulation in the Greenbook suggests that even with an unchanged federal funds  rate for the next two years, total CPI inflation would remain relatively damped by  historic standards, probably at a little under 3 percent in 2001   Committee members have often noted the difficulty of making preemptive  policy changes when they are unsure about the underlying relationships of the  forecast By leaving open the possibility that the NAIRU could be a lot lower  than the staff has allowed for or that productivity is picking up faster, the  information becoming available since the last meeting might be seen as only  accentuating uncertainty about key supply relationships Either development  could allow the economy to operate at or below the current unemployment rate  for some time without inflation rising In such circumstances, tightening policy  could well prove to be unnecessary or at least premature and could incur costs for  the US economy in the form of fewer jobs and lower income and wealth for a  time than it was capable of producing   If this were a serious concern, the Committee might well want to await  further information about likely developments in costs and prices, and stand pat  on policy, choosing alternative B Judging from surveys of households and  economists and from the gap between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds,  expectations that inflation will remain contained are firmly entrenched Survey  measures of long-term inflation expectations haven’t changed in several years  despite wide variations in headline consumer inflation and occasional bond  market jitters And, with overall inflation remaining muted in the staff forecast,  inflation expectations seem unlikely to increase much in the near term in a way  that would make the subsequent disinflationary effort especially painful should it  turn out that tightening policy at this meeting was in fact an appropriate step   On the other side, however, incoming information on economic activity and  demand also continues to indicate that the economy is growing at an  unsustainable pace, in excess of the expansion of supply, as Mike discussed,  further drawing down the pool of available workers In the Greenbook forecast,  financial conditions already in place are, in effect, sufficiently restrictive to bring  the growth rates of supply and demand roughly into alignment And they stay in  approximate alignment over the next two years with only some gentle nudging on  the funds rate next year to counteract the effects of the upward drift of core  inflation on real interest rates and the strengthening of foreign economies   However, not only has this balancing of growth rates failed to occur yet, but  the Committee may see significant risks that it will not materialize and labor  markets will tighten further in the absence of a near-term firming of policy Mike  and Karen have mentioned several possible factors that might boost demand I’d  like to highlight in addition what appears to be a global shift toward more     11/16/99 43   accommodative financial conditions, despite recent actions by a number of central  banks   In the United States, most credit spreads are down somewhat over recent  months A portion of this decline may reflect reduced concerns about potential  problems over the century date change, in which case it is only bringing forward  by two months an anticipated shift that would have occurred next January But  some of the narrowing seems also to be related to greater optimism about long- run prospects for businesses and the economy This same optimism is reflected in  the more ebullient investor attitudes in equity markets and the associated run-up  in stock prices in recent weeks   The shift appears to be even more pronounced for many foreign economies,  judging from sharp increases in their stock prices and declines in emerging market  debt spreads to levels predating the Russian debt default The interplay between  improved economic performance and reduced financial headwinds may produce  stronger global growth than allowed for in our forecast If so, pressures on prices  in the United States could come not only from accompanying greater resource  utilization, but also from a sharper decline in the dollar as foreign prospects come  to seem relatively more favorable and foreign demands on the world pool of  savings strengthen   The sense that financial restraint on spending in the United States is easing  might be one reason why the Committee would favor a tightening of policy by 25  basis points, as in alternative C Such a firming, by reducing the odds on more  accommodative financial conditions developing, would provide the Committee  with better assurance that at least the growth of demand will come into better  balance with that of supply, though leaving the unemployment rate at an  unusually low level In the past few years, the Committee often has been willing  to live with the risk and the fact of tightening US labor markets But it may see  the situation as somewhat different at this juncture The unemployment rate is  already lower than it has been since the late 1960s Decisions to remain  asymmetric but not to tighten over extended periods in 1997 and 1998 were made  against the background of continuing moderation in inflation Today, growth in  most broad price indexes has risen, while the rate of increase in core measures has  been flat, with the notable exception of declining core CPI inflation And,  declines in oil and import prices are no longer holding down inflation, but instead  are contributing to a pickup in pipeline price pressures   The cost of not tightening at this time if a firming turns out to have been  needed could be a further overshooting of the economy beyond its long-run  potential, and hence a larger or more prolonged and possibly more disruptive  adjustment later Equity prices may be a particular risk in this regard The staff  forecast has equity prices remaining near current levels with no near-term change  in policy, but if an absence of tightening is read as suggesting a significantly  lower path of interest rates going forward, equity prices could strengthen     11/16/99 44   significantly, boosting consumption and investment If such an increase pushed  the economy further beyond its sustainable potential and equity prices further  above their long-term levels, it would distort resource allocation and pose a  greater threat of macroeconomic and financial instability when markets and the  economy eventually adjusted   Century date change concerns should not prove a barrier to tightening policy  at this meeting, if the Committee wished to take this step To be sure, markets are  still somewhat skittish and illiquid, so their response to a tightening may be a bit  more volatile and unpredictable than usual, especially because it is not fully  anticipated In addition, deteriorating conditions between now and year-end  remain a threat should lender caution intensify or household demands for  currency build by even more than depositories have allowed for But it is hard to  see why a flight to safety and liquidity would be triggered by a 25 basis point  increase in the federal funds rate, particularly since it would be seen as the last for  the year--or why the effects of any such flight would be much accentuated if it  occurred against the backdrop of a slightly higher federal funds rate   With regard to the symmetry or asymmetry of the directive, the Bluebook  assumed that under alternative B you would retain the existing asymmetry While  the Committee might not see the incoming evidence as justifying tighter policy,  the further rise in labor utilization presumably would suggest continuing risks of  future inflation and the potential need to tighten policy before too long If the  Committee were concerned that a biased directive--under either alternative B or  C--would add to volatility in financial markets in the weeks leading up to the  century date change, the announcement could also indicate that the Committee  was likely to postpone consideration of action until next year, given the special  situation in the markets through year-end   Under alternative C, the Committee’s choice of directive bias would depend  importantly on whether you think that after tightening the risks were still pointed  significantly toward higher inflation--enough so to make added firming in the  early part of next year a realistic possibility The Greenbook forecast might be  seen as supporting a case for keeping a tightening bias under alternative C,  especially if the Committee were intent on acting preemptively to truncate the rise  in inflation in that projection Indeed, the tighter policy alternative in the  Greenbook suggests that 100 basis points of tightening by the end of next year  may not be sufficient to cap inflation   But, as noted, the Greenbook forecast depends importantly on the judgment  that an unemployment rate in the 4 to 4½ percent range is decidedly not consistent  with stable inflation over time If the Committee had reason to question this  judgment, or to believe it did not pose a pressing argument for substantial firming  because of the possibility that productivity might continue to accelerate by more  than in the staff forecast, it might view its strategy as having two stages First,  stabilize resource utilization Second, evaluate incoming data for building     11/16/99 45   inflation pressures at the existing resource utilization levels before tightening  further   In this case, the Committee might be more agnostic about the amount and  timing of additional tightening actions, justifying a symmetric directive By  reducing uncertainty and sending a signal that the Federal Reserve was a bit less  concerned about inflation risks, the symmetric directive would offset some of the  effects on financial markets of the partly unexpected tightening But markets  should not be greatly surprised by a symmetrical directive, which could be read as  implying that the Federal Reserve did not necessarily see itself as most likely in  the middle of a substantial upward movement in the federal funds rate The yield  curve and futures markets have a total of only around 50 basis points of tightening  built in At the same time, the spread between nominal and indexed bonds is in  the neighborhood of only 2 percentage points  Taken together, these suggest that  investors do not see the same potential for rising inflation as the staff has forecast  and anticipate that relatively modest tightening will be needed to keep inflation  well contained  "
5713,1999-12-21," In the past, Governor Ferguson, we haven’t actually had formal   Committee votes on matters such as these But, obviously, you might want to see a show of   hands to make sure that people could “live with” the decisions Among other things, the   Committee has often wanted to include everybody, even nonvoting members, on these kinds   of decisions since they have to live with the consequences  "
5714,1999-12-21," The discussion in the Bluebook assumed that you would  rule out a tightening at this meeting While you might be troubled about  the inflation outlook, a firming would come as a complete surprise to  market participants In the unusually illiquid conditions leading up to the  century date change, such a surprise could have unintended consequences,  including market disruptions Moreover, any inflation threat would not  seem so pressing that waiting six weeks to address it would make the  problem materially worse Neither surveys nor TIPS-nominal yield  spreads indicate an upcreep in long-run inflation expectations; and these  results suggest that economists, households, and market participants  remain confident that the Federal Reserve will contain any emerging  inflation pressures   If the Committee agrees with this judgment about the inadvisability of  tightening at this meeting, what remains on the table is how to assess the  risks to the economy going forward and their implications for future  policy, and how to convey that assessment to the markets   Economic data over the last month followed the now-familiar pattern  Upward revisions to estimates and projections of economic growth in the  second half of 1999 have been accompanied by mostly favorable  indicators of cost and price pressures  In the latter category, CPI increases  in the fourth quarter have been in line with staff expectations, and  estimates of unit labor cost increases in the second half have been reduced  noticeably, accentuating the deceleration in this measure from the first half  of the year The downward revision to unit labor cost increases, which  occurred despite a small upward revision to the growth of compensation,  owed to productivity gains that, again, seem to be coming in above  projections Faster productivity growth has helped to explain the limited  drop in the unemployment rate this year; the unemployment rate and the  pool of available workers cited in recent announcements were essentially  unchanged last month despite the unexpected strength in the expansion of  economic activity   If stable labor utilization over the last month along with continuing  uncertainties about the level and growth of aggregate supply implied by  recent cost and price data make the Committee no more convinced than it  was at its last meeting that it will need to firm policy in the near term, it  might want to consider retaining a symmetric directive With broad  measures of core inflation still subdued, the Committee may wish to see  more and firmer indicators that price pressures are likely to intensify  before it gives serious consideration to raising rates further   But one rationale for the symmetric directive at the last meeting was  to allow the Committee time to gauge whether the cumulative tightening  this year would begin to damp the expansion of the economy Such a     12/21/99 41   slowing is needed because, despite rapid productivity increases, a  widening output gap and falling unemployment rate in the second half of  1999 clearly indicate that the economy has been expanding at a rate in  excess of the growth of its potential However, in that regard, the  incoming data on the real economy have not been encouraging  Moreover, the Greenbook forecast has growth remaining a little above  trend in the first half of next year abstracting from Y2K effects, and Mike  noted the upward risks to the outlook beyond that from the impetus to  consumption from rising wealth While one might guess that the  increasingly narrow base and speculative character of the stock market  advance carries the seeds of its own correction, the assumption of such a  correction would seem to be a risky basis for making monetary policy   Even if the Committee is agnostic for now about whether an  unemployment rate in its recent range of 4 to 4¼ percent can be sustained  without rising inflation, it may be particularly concerned about a potential  further decline in that rate If temporary factors played any role in  damping core inflation in 1999 while the unemployment rate held in this  range, the NAIRU is more likely to be higher than lower than the current  unemployment rate In that case, failing to resist a possible further  tightening in labor markets runs a considerable risk of building in the need  for larger and more disruptive adjustments later   The persistent strength of domestic demand suggests that avoiding a  further decline in the unemployment rate may well require at least the  current degree of restraint in long-term interest rates Forward-looking  financial markets have built in expectations of substantial policy  tightening in 2000, without any pickup in inflation Although supply-side  uncertainties complicate the conduct of policy, markets are presuming that  the Committee will be preemptive, at least when it comes to inflation risks  that might arise from possible further increases in labor resource  utilization Any signal that the Committee was significantly less  concerned about potential inflation than the market perceived it to be  would probably produce a considerable decrease in interest rates and rise  in stock prices Hence, if the Committee did see the risks as significantly  tilted toward higher inflation, it would be important to convey that view to  the markets   An announcement that the Committee was asymmetrical in its  outlook for the economy and policy next year would be unlikely to have a  major effect on interest rates Market prices have already built in a near  certainty of a tightening at the next meeting--much higher odds than have  normally followed the announcement of an asymmetric directive And  when surveyed, two-thirds of primary dealer economists indicated that  they expect such a directive But concerns about the sensitivity of thin and  illiquid markets around the century date change may complicate how the     12/21/99 42   Committee communicates its assessment Presumably, the Committee  would not want to add unnecessarily to market volatility at this time by  leaving open the possibility that an intermeeting tightening was on the  table Moreover, it especially might not want to convey the impression  that it might be sluggish in responding to a market disruption that looked  like more than a transitory event   This suggests that the Committee might have three straightforward  messages to convey to markets at 215 today First, that it did not change  the stance of policy; second, that it was concerned about inflation risks  and would be giving serious consideration to the extent of the risks and the  appropriate policy response at its next meeting; but third, that owing to  uncertain market conditions around year-end it did not intend to respond  to those risks before the next meeting and would be flexible over the  century date change period   Unfortunately, the choice of bias in the directive to associate with  those messages is much less straightforward than the messages  themselves Simply stated, there is a disconnect between the language the  Committee votes on in its directive, which specifically references the  intermeeting period only, and the meaning that has come to be attached to  that language That meaning is that the bias applies less to the  intermeeting period than to the period encompassing the next few FOMC  meetings   All of the options the Committee has to deal with this problem have  more than a bit of improvisation in them, in that you would be skirting  between what the words literally mean and the market conventions that  have settled around them For example, the Committee could couple an  unbiased, that is symmetric, directive with a biased announcement that  made it clear that the symmetry applied only to the intermeeting period  The Committee would count on the wording of the announcement to  express its concerns about inflation risks and its intention to consider at its  next meeting how to deal with those risks A problem with this approach  is that it could foster further confusion about the Committee’s  interpretation of the current directive But so long as the announcement  was clear about the Committee’s present intentions and judgments, such  confusion would not matter much since this is likely the last meeting that  the current directive wording will be used   The second option would be to adopt an asymmetric, that is biased,  directive based on the meaning it has come to have with respect to future  meetings, but to use the announcement to clarify that in light of the  century date change the Committee did not intend to tighten over the  intermeeting period and recognized the need to be ready to respond  flexibly to any developments in coming weeks While this approach     12/21/99 43   would be more consistent with recent uses of asymmetries, it would have  the disadvantage that the Committee would be adopting words in the  directive about the intermeeting period that it did not mean literally And  thus the media and markets might focus more on the choice of asymmetry  than on the caveats in the announcement In that sense transparency about  your choice of bias might mislead markets about your very near-term  intentions   Thank you, Mr Chairman That concludes my briefing    That’s an option we talked about a bit in the Bluebook The issue in   my mind was whether the Committee was really intent on keeping the current degree of   tightening in the markets There would be a risk if you did what you propose, it seems to   me, though it very well might work The markets might say the FOMC is symmetric, or   unbiased, and it’s because of Y2K They are not telling us anything else, so we will assume   that that is the only reason they are unbiased But I think you can’t rule out the possibility,   however small, that the market would say the FOMC is unbiased because of Y2K and,   because they didn’t tell us anything about their expectations for the future, maybe they are   not quite as worried about inflation as we thought they were With two-thirds of market   economists expecting an asymmetric directive and with about 80 or 90 percent tightening   built in, that’s a dilemma The Committee’s objective might be to leave the markets at 230   today where they were before our announcement at 215 It’s just very hard to craft the set   of statements and votes that will do that I’m not sure that a terse announcement would do   it It’s possible that it would, but there is a risk that it wouldn’t    I think either approach is likely to work symmetry, but we’re really   asymmetric for the next meeting; or asymmetry, but we’re really symmetric until the next   meeting It’s a question of weighing, if you’ll pardon the expression, the balance of risks-­  [laughter]--not with respect to the economy but with respect to the market reaction I was   trying to point out that I think there is a risk, perhaps a small risk, that the initial headline   will be “Fed goes asymmetric” rather than “Fed goes asymmetric but with a number of   caveats” An unqualified headline could provoke a little market reaction There is no   perfect way to do this The risk on the other side is that the headline will be “Fed goes   symmetric,” and the market doesn’t read the announcement and begins to rally I think   probably after a day, after people have had a chance to read the announcement and   newspapers have printed it, we would probably be in roughly the same place either way It   is just a question of what best represents what you intend and the clearest way to get that   across The other thing that bothers me a little about asymmetry is that the words in the   directive literally say “over the intermeeting period,” and the announcement would literally   have to say “but we don’t mean it”    I think either way would work, or at least I hope so Either way would   be intended to produce the same result    Right    As I indicated in answer to Governor Meyer, I think the risk of   publishing asymmetry is that it could produce a little more volatility The risk of publishing     12/21/99 45   symmetry is that the markets might rally a bit Maybe the 230 comparison isn’t the right   one; maybe it’s really where the markets are by close of business the next day    I think you could make that clear under either approach It depends on   the announcement and where you want to put the emphasis If your emphasis is on the fact   that you will be providing liquidity and you will be flexible over the intermeeting period-­  and that’s the near-term focus--then maybe symmetry is better If your emphasis is more on   the fact that there is a good chance that you’ll be giving serious consideration to tightening   at the next meeting, then asymmetry may be better, with less focus on the intermeeting   period  "
5772,2000-02-01,"  Mr Chairman, I think President Broaddus--     Of a permanent nature, certainly  If productivity growth shifted down,   as in 1973, in order to achieve the Federal Reserve’s goals of stable prices and maximum   employment, the FOMC at that time--though those were not the goals set forth in the Federal   Reserve Act at the time--should have shifted its targeted M2 growth rates down  The question is   what is a steady state nominal GDP growth?  And when you have a steady change in the rate of   growth of productivity that is expected to persist for a while rather than be a one-time change,   consistent with what Bill said--     Not until very late, right  I think to a certain extent you can observe   what is going on  You can see things like oil shocks, dollar appreciation or depreciation, excise   taxes, or whatever that might change a price level more than you can see an ongoing change in   productivity, which I agree takes some time to recognize  This Committee has been struggling   with that for the last several years  But it has been four years since it appears in retrospect that   productivity growth changed  And I think it is true that by changing these ranges you would be   saying that your best guess is, as Bill said, that there is a permanent component to this change in   productivity and that you will have to reevaluate that on an annual basis       That’s the way the ranges have been constructed for the last five years--   that is, with the same reasoning and arithmetic in mind  The Committee might want to think   about whether it wants to change that  But we were just being consistent with what the   Committee has been doing      That was trend potential output growth when the Committee first set   these targets          92 "
5773,2000-02-01,"  It is a different time period  Our sacrifice ratio in the Bluebook is   calculated over a full ten years when all the lags work out  It might be very different in the short   run than over the long run     It is a little higher than we've had in the past, but not much  It is   consistent with the model looking out over the longer run  It is a fairly high sacrifice ratio, I   think, compared to some other models, but it is not out of the bounds  The baseline simulation   over the next two years has a 1 percent plus NAIRU gap and only a very small upward creep in   inflation  That implies a pretty high sacrifice ratio  That’s great when the unemployment rate is   below NAIRU because it doesn’t result in much upward creep in inflation  Obviously, if you   want to lower inflation, you have to be a lot above NAIRU for a long time to get inflation to          42  come down  So, this sacrifice ratio was intended to be consistent with the basic story in the   Greenbook in terms of how fast inflation would accelerate over the next few years given the   assumed output gap  It’s important to recognize that there are a lot of things going on in the   Greenbook scenario that have to do with price shocks, oil prices moving, and so forth  But this   analysis tries to abstract from that and get at the underlying slope of the Phillips curve    "
5774,2000-02-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I shall first discuss the  simulations in the long-run scenarios section of the Bluebook, and then  consider the choices at this meeting about the stance of policy and balance  of risks to announce  The results in the first set of scenarios on Chart 3  following page 8 extending the Greenbook forecast and looking at policies  to reach alternative inflation rates depend critically on the staff assessment          105  of the current state of the economy  The FOMC has, in effect, taken the  positive supply shocks stemming from the acceleration of productivity and  from the decline in oil and import prices of a few years ago importantly in  the form of added output and lower unemployment  But in the staff view,  this has left the economy operating well above the level of its long-run  potential, and now, with price shocks reversing and productivity growth  seen as accelerating only a little further, inflation is about to pick up   Moreover, the policy tightening implemented last year is not viewed as  sufficient to eliminate that tendency  Indeed, current financial conditions  are seen as sufficiently stimulative that inflation pressures are likely to  intensify if the federal funds rate is not raised further  The effects on  demand of the rise in equity markets last year and the ongoing resurgence in  foreign economies mean that the equilibrium funds rate is expected to  continue to increase into this year  And the Greenbook baseline forecast  sees a 125 basis point tightening as necessary just to hold the unemployment  rate flat      All three scenarios see substantial additional tightening beyond that   125 basis points as needed to keep inflation from continuing to rise  That  need arises from the judgment in the Greenbook forecast that at the end of  2001 both the unemployment rate and the real funds rate will be appreciably  below their natural or equilibrium levels  To say the least, such judgments  about the level and growth of potential supply and equilibrium interest rates  have been especially difficult to make in recent years, and a number of you  have wondered whether policy shouldn’t scale back its reliance on such  assessments  To address this question, the Bluebook also showed several  sets of simulations that compared the behavior of the economy under a  policy rule that looked only at current and past inflation with rules that also  took into account perceived output gaps  Moreover, the realized-inflation  policy-setting rule was one that determined the change in the nominal funds  rate--not its level--so that policymakers need not form a judgment about  equilibrium real interest rates     Of course, it will always be advantageous to employ all the accurate   information you have when forming policy  But using less than what you  have in hand might work to your advantage if some of it turns out to be  wrong  [Laughter]  In fact, as can be seen in Charts 4, 5 and 6, the realized-  inflation rule does tolerably well in stabilizing the inflation rate and  producing reasonably good economic performance under some  circumstances  In particular, Charts 5 and 6 show that when the supply side  of the economy behaves in unexpected ways that you learn about only  slowly, the inflation rule does much better at stabilizing inflation than  basing policy on misperceptions about the trend of the growth of potential   The rule allows supply-side surprises to show through mostly in variations  in output, which is especially advantageous for favorable supply shocks          106  when inflation is already low  It can be successful in these circumstances  because it is very aggressive in leaning against actual changes in inflation,  while at the same time also paying attention to the level of inflation relative  to the Committee’s objective  However, as can be seen in Chart 7, one risk  of such a strategy is the slow response it has to an aggregate demand shock,  producing greater fluctuations in inflation and output than a rule that also  looks at realized output gaps, even when the output gap may be  misperceived     In December, you expressed concern about the strength in aggregate   demand and the potential inflationary consequences of its tendency to  outrun increases in the economy’s long-run potential over time  With  demand and output showing few signs of moderating since then, and with  recent data on costs and prices raising questions about how long the good  news on inflation will last, the Committee’s choices about policy at this  meeting would seem to be about how much, not whether, to firm  How you  assess the uncertainties about supply and demand, and how much weight  you wish to place on estimated levels of potential output relative to  incoming inflation data, may help to shape your decision today on exactly  how much to tighten     A 25 basis point firming accompanied by a balance of risks sentence   that suggested persisting concern about potential inflation is currently  expected by the market  That combination is the unanimous projection of  primary dealer economists  And it is roughly consistent with rates in federal  funds futures markets, where there is certainty of a 25 basis point firming at  this meeting, a small probability of a 50 basis point action, and a certainty of  at least 50 basis points of tightening by the end of your next meeting in  March  The Bluebook discussion presumed that, in light of recent data and   forecasts, you would still assess the risks to be unbalanced toward inflation  pressures if you firmed by 25 basis points   Any “relief rally” that might be  sparked by a 25 basis point firming should be limited by the balance of risk  statement and by any associated increase in the discount rate  As a  consequence, this combination should have no appreciable long-lasting  effect on longer-term interest rates and asset prices     Judging from the yield curve, those longer-term rates now embody a   total of 1-1/4 percentage points of tightening by the end of this year, but  little further thereafter  As I already noted, in the staff forecast this path for  policy is consistent with stabilizing the unemployment rate, but not the  inflation rate   Still, the current configuration of market rates may be  acceptable to the Committee, at least until the extent of inflation risks  becomes clearer  The Committee might be uncertain enough about the  judgment that the NAIRU is substantially above the projected level of the  unemployment rate, to want to down weight its importance in its plans  At          107  the same time, even with the fourth-quarter NIPA price data, longer-term  trends in inflation and costs would not yet seem to confirm the hypothesis  that the economy is operating well beyond its potential  Four-quarter  averages of most core inflation rates remain relatively stable, and the effects  of strengthening compensation on unit costs have been offset by faster  productivity     Even if the Committee is convinced that you will need to tighten more   than 25 basis points eventually, so long as you do not see the restraint built  into the yield curve as clearly inadequate, the costs of a gradual approach to  the contemplated policy actions would seem to be small, and gradualism  would seem to have some advantages  It gives you more opportunity to  adjust the trajectory of your actions over time, based on new information  about the economy and financial markets  This flexibility might be seen as  especially valuable when there is so much uncertainty about prospective  aggregate supply, and when financial markets are volatile and their reaction  to policy difficult to predict  In the past, the Committee has deviated from  this approach primarily when expectations and psychology have moved  adversely, working against the Committee’s objectives  In the current  circumstances, long-term inflation expectations seem to remain reasonably  well anchored at moderate inflation rates  The nominal/real yield spread on  Treasuries, for example, still embodies 10-year average CPI inflation of      2-1/2 percent or less--within its range since last June although up a lot from  a year ago, as Governor Gramlich noted--with only a percentage point or so  of tightening in the yield curve  And a firm dollar on foreign exchange  markets, where the demand for dollar assets seems to match the burgeoning  supply from our current account deficit, suggests an absence of concern  among global investors about adequate policy responses to developing  inflation problems      However, if the Committee sees the inflation risks as greater than do   the financial markets--perhaps because the Committee is putting weight on  the possibility that the sustainable unemployment rate is well above the  current rate--and believes it will need to tighten considerably more or faster  than is now built into the yield curve, it might want to raise its target federal  funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting  The Committee would be  surprising markets with that action, and would most likely prompt increases  in interest and exchange rates and a drop in equity prices  Such reactions  would not be unwanted in that they are an integral aspect of the less  accommodative financial conditions you saw as necessary to restrain real  growth and contain inflation       The public’s interpretation and market reaction would depend   importantly on the associated balance of risks statement  A statement that  risks were balanced would suggest that the Committee saw financial          108  conditions after the firming as equally likely to produce rising as stable or  falling inflation  Such an announcement would tend to limit any increase in  rates; indeed, one could not rule out a rally in capital markets--especially the  equity markets--if the symmetry were seen as an expression by the FOMC  of substantially less concern about longer-term inflation pressures than the  market now perceives     More likely, given the strength of demand and the firmness of labor   markets, the Committee would still view the risks as unbalanced toward  higher inflation, even after a 50 basis point tightening  The response of  interest rates and asset prices to this combination could be considerable, and  markets would remain on alert, attempting to discern whether additional  tightening might be forthcoming at your next meeting  Both the response  and the volatility might be muted to some extent if the Committee also tried  to indicate in its statement that it was not necessarily contemplating another  firming at its next meeting--that is, emphasized that the timing of its next  action was highly dependent on incoming data  The Committee’s new  disclosure policy contemplated that announcements might provide such  indications, now that the official language is focused on the longer-run  economic environment instead of on the possibility of near-term policy  action           The Bluebook is the extension of the Greenbook forecast, and Chart 3,   immediately after page 8, is essentially saying that  It is saying in the stable inflation case--the          109  middle line with dots and dashes--that the funds rate gets up to 7-1/2 percent in the next two   years  And over that period inflation rates are rising, so it’s not 2 percentage points of real   tightening, but it is about 1-1/2 percentage points of real tightening  So I think the message of   the Greenbook, which is reflected in these alternative strategies, is that policy clearly is not now   positioned to keep inflation from rising  In fact, it is not now positioned to keep inflation   pressures from intensifying in the sense that with an unchanged funds rate the unemployment   rate would likely fall further     As I was trying to say in my briefing, that depends importantly on the   weight you put on the NAIRU calculation  What you do at each meeting is important obviously,   but what the market perceives you are going to do may be even more important in terms of the   effects on economic activity  And it’s the intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that have   the most effect  So I think what is important is the trajectory that the market perceives you to be   on  That is what is going to be reflected in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates, where   we see most, though not all, of the effect on economic activity  That has effects on the dollar and   presumably on equity prices if the discount rate matters at all for equity prices these days  So,   the point here is that the market has built in approximately 125 basis points of tightening over the   next year or so, which is what the Greenbook has built in     That’s right  And I think that is what the balance of risks sentence is   designed to do  And my judgment was that a combination of a 25 basis point increase and an   unbalanced risk sentence, plus potentially a discount rate change, would tend to communicate   that  One can never be certain about how the markets are going to react     If you went 50 basis points and had an unbalanced risks sentence, I   think that would communicate a greater sense of concern on the Committee’s part than the   market now perceives       I agree  And what I think that would tend to communicate is that you   are putting weight on an estimate that the economy is operating well beyond potential and that   the unemployment rate needs to rise appreciably to stem inflation  The question is whether you   want to do that now or wait for some evidence that that in fact is the case  In a sense it’s a   strategy issue--whether you want to surprise the markets now with that assessment or wait until   you get some evidence     There is a lot of uncertainty about the supply side of the economy and I   would try to communicate that  We ran a number of other simulations and presented them in the          111  Bluebook to underscore that point  But I think the staff has been catching up with this very   quickly; we might even be ahead on productivity but certainly we have been catching up very   quickly on the growth of productivity  We have modified our wage/price assessments, which in   effect is what several people were remarking on yesterday about the sacrifice ratio  That is now   higher because we see the economy in effect as a little less inflation prone in the sense that, even   taking account of supply side effects, the rate of inflation seems to be less sensitive to output   gaps than it might have been before  So I think we are moving as quickly as the data will allow   toward our best assessment of what those supply side effects are  But you are right; that   assessment is embodied in these simulations  I tried to emphasize that the results, particularly   the extent of the firming, are crucially dependent on those assessments and that there is a lot of   uncertainty about them  The Committee may want to think carefully about how much weight it   puts on them     I don’t know  That’s an income side thing and the simulations, I   believe, are basically done on the product side     I think that is a fair message, and it is illustrated in Chart 4 to a certain   extent  I’m not sure about the gradualism part, but it certainly relates to the policy success that   you can have  Chart 4 looks at that realized-inflation rule against one that is the same as the   price-stability rule  Now, that price-stability scenario in Chart 3 is derived from the model  It   assumes that households and businesses and the Federal Reserve have at least a pretty good idea   about what is going on  They form their expectations  The Federal Reserve is assumed to have a   very good idea what is going to happen in the future as it changes the funds rate  So in a sense   this is about as well as we can do  The alternative is the case where we are not sure about what   is going to happen in the future  The inflation-rule was used there to illustrate how, if you wait   until you see inflation because you are not sure, it may not be such a bad rule to follow, provided   there are certain kind of shocks occurring in the economy--that is, the favorable supply shocks    Secondly, as you noted President Jordan, once you see inflation--these are four quarter changes,   so it’s not just one quarter’s worth of inflation--you do need to respond fairly robustly, twice as   robustly as the Taylor rule would have you respond  If you do that in circumstances when you   are uncertain about the supply side of the economy and you’re experiencing favorable supply   shocks, the outcomes are not bad  And they are certainly better than if you act on incorrect   information  So, the basic message you took was approximately correct  That you can run a   successful policy responding ex post under certain circumstances  You have to be careful; that’s   not the case under all circumstances  It’s good to be preemptive where you know some   information  But if your policy response is more reactive, you have to get more aggressive        The structure basically assumes credibility  That is, unless the Federal   Reserve changes, the structure assumes that if you have a 2 percent target, the public knows you   have a 2 percent target  And as long as you are following the policy actions that flow from   having that target--so that you are confirming period by period the public’s perception of your   target--then those expectations are firmly anchored  What happens, and this partly follows          118  through on my response to President Stern yesterday about sacrifice ratios, is that if the Fed   deviates from the actions the public expects with, say, a 2 percent target, then the public begins   to change its expectations  And that gives you different sacrifice ratios in the short run  It gives   you different effects in the short run  But the public would slowly learn that you had a 3 percent   target instead of a 2 percent target over 2001  I think part of the difference here is that while the   nominal rates aren’t that different, that’s not the case for the real rates  Because the tightening in   2001 gets a bit ahead of the rise in inflation, real rates are considerably higher in 2001, and that   is to a large extent what builds in the extra restraint     Right  So, there’s almost a percentage point of extra restraint by the end   of 2001 and that persists for the next year or so  That is a significant amount of extra restraint       You can see from Chart 6 that a positive productivity shock does not   tend to lower inflation rates in the short run unless you are targeting the inflation rate very hard    I think one needs to differentiate between very short-run effects and longer-run effects  Let’s say   in the short run that you have the productivity shock, which is consistent with Dave Stockton’s   charts yesterday  Inflation would tend to go down as profit margins are swelled, and competition   would drive prices down  Over time, however, the demand feeds back  That lowers the   unemployment rate, wages begin to catch up with the higher productivity, and we end up with a   higher equilibrium interest rate approximately equal to the size of the productivity shock  It   depends on the model, obviously  There is a short-run effect, but if we let it run on too long, we   will find ourselves in that situation     That mechanism is in the model  Now, whether it’s sufficiently   captured in the model is a question  But the effect of the extra earnings on stock prices feeding   back on consumption--though you may think all of it has not been captured in the last couple of   years--is in the model     If it were a price shock--a change in the price level of the old oil shock   variety that we used to study--then a nominal income rule is a way of taking part of that in          120  inflation and part of it in output  In that regard it’s much the same as a Taylor rule  There might   be a different dynamic path, but I don’t think it would differ very much  But in some ways it’s a   bit like the discussion you folks were having a little while ago  If you had a nominal income rule   and you tilted up the productivity growth and kept the old nominal income, you’d start building   deflation into the economy if the starting point was price stability  So I think the kind of supply   shock that occurs matters a lot     Yes  "
5833,2000-03-21,"  Mr Chairman, I think Peter’s and my view was that it could only be   resolved from the Federal Reserve's perspective in the context of what are we going to do with   our balance sheet  We felt we needed to look at all the alternatives since we can't rely on   Treasury issues      We were going to meet after this meeting and formulate them  For my   part, I have asked Dave Lindsey to play a major role in coordinating the study here at the Board    But beyond that, we do not have specific plans  "
5834,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman The information becoming  available since your last meeting has once again indicated somewhat  stronger growth of both aggregate demand and potential aggregate  supply than had been anticipated  The behavior of the unemployment  rate--essentially flat for five months now--does not suggest that  underlying labor market pressures have intensified  But, absent a  continuation of the almost astonishing productivity gains of the second  half of last year, there is a clear risk that those pressures will mount in  coming months  On that basis, there would seem to be little to deflect  the Committee from carrying through on the intention that many of you  expressed at the last meeting to raise the federal funds rate again today     Financial markets continue to incorporate an extended period of   gradual firming, with 25 basis points expected at this meeting, and  another 50 to 75 basis points by early next year  The level and behavior  of longer-term interest rates and the yield curve--even after allowance  for Treasury supply distortions--suggest that markets see this degree of  firming as consistent with keeping inflation pressures contained   Indeed, over the intermeeting period, market participants have marked  down a little their expectations of the ultimate extent of Federal  Reserve tightening  This revision appeared to have reflected market  participants’ take on incoming information bearing on the economy--a  sense of greater vulnerability in equity markets despite their reaching  new highs, larger expected government budget surpluses, and good  news on productivity and core inflation     The key issue for the Committee today would seem to be whether   the restraint now built into financial markets has a reasonable chance of  being sufficient to accomplish your objectives for restraining inflation   If it does, you can validate prevailing expectations by tightening by 25  basis points  If it does not--if the risks have shifted significantly further  toward higher inflation--you might consider surprising the market with  50 basis points of firming     In principle, the escalating price of oil may be one important   change in economic conditions over recent months that has a bearing on  this issue  As you know, a rise in oil prices tends to produce effects  with contradictory implications for the stance of monetary policy, at  least when that stance is expressed in terms of the real federal funds              - 76 -     rate  Leaning on the side of higher real interest rates is the potential  effect of an increase in oil prices on underlying inflation rates  The rise  in energy prices tends to get propagated into core price measures, in  part through the efforts of businesses and households to raise prices and  wages to protect real earnings  The strength of these efforts and the  ultimate pressures on ongoing inflation are influenced importantly by  the behavior of inflation expectations  On the side of lower real interest  rates is an increase in economic slack as more domestic income is sent  abroad to pay for imported oil, which, however, helps to hold down the  overall price increases  Whether real interest rates should be raised or  lowered in response to an increase in oil prices depends in large  measure on the relative size of these two effects and the relative weight  the Committee puts on short-run deviations of output and inflation from  their long-run values     In fact, the effect of the changed outlook for oil prices since your   last meeting may not be enough by itself to cause you to alter your  plans for real interest rates materially  The upward revision to the  expected path of oil prices in the Greenbook and in futures markets has  been limited by the forecast that they will return to a lower level  before very long  Moreover, the role of oil in the economy has  diminished considerably over time  Still, the analysis does suggest  some important risks to the outlook that you might need to weigh now  or in the future, especially if oil prices do not look as if they will  follow their predicted downward track  On the one hand, evidence  that higher energy prices were beginning to undermine consumer or  business confidence or equity prices might suggest that less policy  tightening was now necessary to align aggregate demand and supply   On the other, signs that oil price increases were becoming embedded  in faster increases in compensation or in higher longer-term inflation  expectations would indicate that more policy firming and weaker  output would be needed to contain inflation  In any event, should  short-term inflation expectations rise, a higher nominal federal funds  rate would be required at some point just to hold the real funds rate on  course and prevent a destabilizing stimulus to output and prices     In the current circumstances, these considerations might suggest   that the rise in the price of oil has, on balance, increased inflation risks  at least a little  Short-term inflation expectations have already moved  higher in recent quarters, evidently in reflection of higher oil prices,  and a further increase is a distinct possibility unless oil prices soon  begin to reverse  Moreover, the Committee might be concerned that,  with labor markets already tight and equity markets and consumer  confidence ebullient, the effects of higher oil prices are more likely to              - 77 -     be weighted toward raising inflation expectations than toward  weakening demand     Some other developments over the intermeeting period may also   be seen as pointing toward the possibility of higher inflation  In  particular, the further increase in the broadest measure of equity  wealth will add to aggregate demand at a time when strength in  demand is already threatening to lead to tighter labor markets  And, a  slightly lower expected path for policy tightening has reduced  intermediate-term borrowing costs a bit, contributing to the greater  disparity between the market’s expectations of what tightening will be  required to stem inflation and those of the staff      An important source of that disparity seems to be a judgment on   whether the economy is now operating in level terms above its long- term potential  The long-term interest rates in the market, even if high  enough to bring the growth of demand into alignment with the growth  of supply, seem much less likely to be restrictive enough to raise the  unemployment rate  If the Committee believes the economy is now  beyond its sustainable potential, an appreciable tightening in financial  conditions would seem to be needed to slow growth enough to keep  core inflation from trending higher over the next few years     Hence, oil price increases may be adding to the risks that can   stem from pursuing a gradualist strategy--in particular, that tightening  would be too sluggish  If such a policy allows an economy that may  already be operating beyond its sustainable level to increase resource  utilization further, or allows longer-term inflation expectations to  begin to deteriorate, control of inflation ultimately will require a larger  or more prolonged damping of output below its potential  If the  Committee saw a substantial risk that the prevailing restraint in  financial markets--premised on several more 25 basis points tightening  moves--has become inadequate to forestall these outcomes, it might  consider undertaking a larger move of 50 basis points  Such an  unexpected action should help to bring about a configuration of real  interest rates, exchange rates, and equity prices more suited to  damping stronger price pressures     However, the Committee may see these recent developments as   confirming that the balance of risks after a 25 basis point increase will  remain tilted toward higher inflation, rather than as pressing enough to  warrant a 50 basis point firming at this meeting  In that case, you  could opt to continue on the gradual path of tightening, at least for a  time  If oil prices reverse as markets expect, short-term inflation  expectations also should come down, leaving core inflation and long-             - 78 -     term expectations largely unaffected by the most recent run-up in oil  prices  Moreover, the path of firming in markets may well turn out to  be sufficient to restrain the growth of aggregate demand to that of  sustainable supply, given that the full restraining effects of the  Committee’s previous tightening actions and the appreciable rise in  long-term interest rates over the last few quarters have not completely  played themselves out  So long as underlying cost and price data  remain favorable, the Committee’s most immediate objective might be  to balance the growth rates of aggregate supply and demand, reserving  judgment about whether it needs to raise interest rates enough to  elevate the unemployment rate  In light of uncertainties about the  course of demand and the level and growth rate of potential supply, the  Committee might want to see firmer evidence that market participants  had underestimated the required degree of tightening before taking  actions to change these estimates and expectations       Moreover, as Mike noted, recent data have led the staff to raise its   estimate of structural productivity growth, which, if valid, should help  to contain cost pressures for a while  Indeed, the possibility that  productivity may continue to accelerate also may weigh on the side of  caution in tightening  Eventually, higher productivity growth probably  must be balanced with higher real interest rates  In the near term,  though, the implications for policy action are not so clear  Financial  markets may already have incorporated expectations of a further  pickup in productivity growth into the unusually elevated long-term  real rates now prevailing, so that all the Committee need do is validate  those expectations  Even if real private long-term rates still have more  to rise, the acceleration in productivity--so long as it continued to keep  pace with any pickup in the rate of increase in nominal compensation-- would keep inflation damped for some time at prevailing interest rates,  even if the unemployment rate fell a bit further  By forgoing more  rapid tightening for a while in the face of accelerating productivity, the  Committee in effect would continue the strategy of recent years that  allowed the economy to realize an extra benefit of unanticipated  productivity increases in temporarily higher output instead of lower  inflation     In sum, so long as underlying inflation pressures remain damped   and financial market expectations are not clearly out of line with  continued containment of price pressures over time, the Committee  may prefer to continue its gradual pace of tightening  This would  allow the Committee to calibrate its firming action as new information  accumulates about the responses of aggregate demand and financial  markets to past increases in interest rates and about the evolution of  potential supply  A precondition for the success of this strategy is that              - 79 -     the markets understand your concerns and intentions, so they can react  appropriately as new information becomes available  In this regard,  the ongoing strength in demand and tautness of the labor markets,  along with the inflation threat from higher oil prices, suggest that the  Committee would probably want to associate an increase of either 25  or 50 basis points in the federal funds rate with language indicating  that it views the risks to the outlook as unbalanced toward higher  inflation     "
5930,2000-06-27,"  No, there is no reason we couldn't do that  I actually thought we   wouldn’t change the format of these meetings significantly since the Committee has been   spending at most a half-hour or so on the monetary aggregates  Just in terms of preparation for   your Congressional testimony twice a year, I thought the Committee might want to take a bit   longer view--as Dave, Karen, and Larry helped to do yesterday--and look a little more deeply   below the forecast  I thought the Committee would want to continue to do that           84    Yes, there’s absolutely no reason     I think Lynn Fox has the statement       Yes, we're going to circulate it  Why don't we just let people read it  "
5931,2000-06-27,"  I think there are two sources of upward pressure on prices in this low   NAIRU case, aside from the fact that the current unemployment rate is a tiny bit below even the   low NAIRU  One is the depreciation of the dollar  The assumed depreciation of the dollar is a   pretty powerful inflationary force in these simulations partly because it just continues on and on   and on  It's powerful enough to raise the NAIRU by 1/4 point and probably a little more; we           31  rounded down to get that 1/4 point  So that's one thing that produces upward pressure on prices    I suspect another thing is that there is some cumulated pent-up pressure here in the sense that   real wages in the past haven't quite caught up with the increase in productivity  So, workers   haven't realized all the gains of the productivity increase and as a consequence if productivity   stopped growing or stopped accelerating and the NAIRU were lower, the labor force would end   up getting a little more in real wages  And that, at least for a while, would put some upward   pressure on prices  So I think we have some pent-up real wage increases and also some further   depreciation of the dollar in here producing this uptick in inflation     Actually, I think it could occur if we put the third derivative negative    That is, productivity could still be accelerating but if it were accelerating more slowly over   time, the same mechanism would work slowly       I did have a simulation run this morning with the optimistic   assumptions on the supply side--a low NAIRU and accelerating productivity--and no   depreciating dollar  And that is enough to stop inflation from rising, at least for a number of   years  But we need all three to stop the inflation rate from rising here  "
5932,2000-06-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman   As background for your discussion today, you received a  paper by Flint Brayton and Dave Reifschneider that used the  FRB/US model to examine the economic performance of the US  economy in recent years  Not surprisingly, their work suggested  that a continuing pickup in productivity provided the major  impetus to the extraordinary run of noninflationary growth  But it  was not the only influence  The model results also emphasized  the role of growing federal surpluses and an appreciating dollar in  holding down interest rates and inflation, even as the labor  markets tightened     The study was undertaken in large part because we wanted   to see whether the model could shed some light on imbalances in  the US economy that have become such a prominent element in  discussions of the outlook and policy, particularly internationally   In fact, the performance of recent years has left the economy with  some potentially troublesome imbalances--most notably, from the  perspective of the staff model, the imbalance between the levels  of aggregate demand and sustainable supply  But it has also  produced other, subsidiary, imbalances between elements of  spending and income, including a large current account deficit  with its resulting buildup in net foreign indebtedness, and a low  rate of private saving that has been associated with a sizable  accumulation of debt by households and businesses  The latter  two imbalances have been stoked by a rise in the dollar on foreign  exchange markets and a rise in equity prices to levels well in  excess of those likely to be sustainable over time       In the Brayton-Reifschneider study these asset price and   balance sheet imbalances are the natural consequence of the  forces that have shaped the economy  Under reasonable  assumptions on how those forces will evolve, the imbalances tend  to work themselves out, or at least to stop getting worse, without  major dislocations when you, the FOMC, concentrate on the           95  overall macroeconomic task of setting aggregate demand equal to  potential aggregate supply  But in real life, the adjustment is not  likely to be so smooth  The risk is that the balance sheet  overhangs and elevated asset values leave the economy more  susceptible to sharp corrections that could produce considerable  economic instability      Concern about this possibility has led some observers to   advocate that US monetary policy not look solely at overall  macroeconomic balance but also pay special attention to asset  prices or to savings-investment flows perceived to be in serious  and potentially destabilizing disequilibrium  In concept, shaping  policy in part to address these issues directly, while incurring a bit  of extra economic cost in the form of different unemployment and  inflation rates than would otherwise prevail over the short run,  might avert larger costs and more difficult situations later      With respect to asset prices, central banks have usually   argued that they should not take account of such prices beyond  factoring them into their assessment of the overall balance of  aggregate supply and demand  Central banks are not confident  they can identify dangerous asset price disequilibriums, or that  they could calibrate policy actions to forestall further problems  without adding unduly to economic instabilities  Many of the  same sorts of arguments about the difficulties of identification and  gauging the appropriate response could be applied to policies to  address saving imbalances and debt buildups Moreover, in the  case of some of these imbalances, it’s not obvious what role  monetary policy could play, even if it wanted to  In particular,  raising interest rates is likely to have little effect on the current  account deficit  Although tighter policy would reduce imports by  damping domestic demand, it also would tend to appreciate the  dollar, raising the cost of US goods and services and shifting  demand away from US producers  So, while the sanguine  outcomes of Brayton-Reifschneider might seem implausible, there  may be little the Committee can do in advance about potential  problems  Instead, your best posture might be to concentrate on  fostering overall macroeconomic balance, and to stand ready to  react to sharp movements in asset prices or other spillovers from  balance sheet corrections when they occur      Nonetheless, the Committee’s policy choices cannot be   divorced entirely from consideration of the possible effects of  asset price and balance sheet disequilibriums  Assumptions about  how they will evolve are an inescapable aspect of projecting the  economy and can be an important influence on the outlook With           96  respect to both equity prices and the dollar, the staff has adopted a  middle ground in the Greenbook and its extension in the  Bluebook  We have built in declines in wealth-to-income ratios  and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, but we have not  made the full adjustments to what might look like more  sustainable levels  The fall in wealth relative to income helps to  raise private saving, but the declining dollar is a significant source  of demand and inflation pressure over the forecast horizon     The baseline simulation traces out the implications of the   Greenbook forecast  Several key judgments about the supply side  of the economy are important in that forecast  One is that the  unemployment rate is now substantially below its sustainable  level  Second, that productivity growth is picking up further this  year, but that thereafter growth will level out at this higher rate   The labor market imbalance, which persists under the impetus  from strong aggregate demand, together with the depreciation of  the dollar and the catch-up of real wages to previous increases in  productivity, produces an upward trend in inflation in the baseline  unless the Committee tightens policy substantially      Moreover, several of the alternative simulations built off   the baseline suggest that even more optimistic views of the level  and growth rate of potential supply may not remove the risk that  inflation will head higher under the Greenbook policy  assumption  A lower NAIRU than the staff’s estimate of 5-1/4 or  5-1/2 percent and additional pickups in structural productivity  growth do help to contain inflation over the next few years at  current low unemployment rates, but pressures still build  The  staff forecast does not embody the tightening of fiscal policy and  appreciating dollar that Brayton and Reifschneider identified as so  important to holding down demand and price pressures from 1995  on  The low NAIRU does not cancel the need for real wages to  rise enough to capture the full effects of the previous increases in  productivity  The cost-raising implications of this catch-up will  be postponed if productivity growth is headed still higher quickly  enough, but ultimately will show through as productivity growth  levels out  Moreover, higher productivity growth implies even  higher equilibrium real interest rates and the need for policy to  tighten by more than in the baseline to keep the resulting increase  in demand from outrunning the pace of potential supply and  adding to inflation pressures       Even with a more favorable path for potential supply,   then, the Committee might be concerned that it will need to  tighten further to stop inflation from rising--and before very long           97  if it is intent on keeping inflation near current levels rather than  having it drift higher  Skepticism about either the lower NAIRU  or additional upward speed in trend productivity would tend to  add to perceptions of inflation risks, strengthening the case for  action at this meeting, as in alternative C  In circumstances in  which labor resource utilization was already unusually high and  inflation by some measures had already picked up, the Committee  might not want to take the risk that aggregate demand could  rebound You might desire greater assurance that financial  conditions had firmed enough to keep the economy on a slower  growth track, especially in light of the easing of financial  conditions in many market sectors since your last meeting  Markets would be surprised by a tightening at this meeting  Such  a strong signal that you did not share their optimism on inflation  would not only raise interest rates immediately, but would set the  stage for more sober reactions to incoming information than were  in evidence over the recent intermeeting period  If the Committee  were sufficiently worried about inflation to raise rates at this  meeting, it likely would view the resulting path of asset prices as  more consistent with a sustainable expansion of aggregate  demand     However, as noted, the staff forecast rests on a view of   continuing strength in aggregate demand, supply side constraints,  and dollar depreciation  You may see the incoming data as at  least creating added uncertainty about these assessments  If you  are not very confident of oncoming inflation risks, there are  reasons to pause in your tightening, at least at this meeting       In many of your internal discussions and public speeches   you have signaled that you would like to follow something akin to  a two-stage strategy to determine how much tightening you may  need to undertake  Stage one is damping aggregate demand  growth enough to bring it into line with the growth of potential  supply so as to ensure that pressures on labor resources do not  intensify  When the clear and present inflationary danger of  worsening resource pressures seems less worrisome, in stage two  the Committee would then assess whether the resulting level of  resource utilization was too high to be sustainable  Given  uncertainties about NAIRU, you may not be willing to enforce a  specific view of the appropriate level of resource utilization  without supporting evidence in hand     The evidence of slowing in the economy, along with the   likelihood that a portion of the financial restraint put in place  since year-end has yet to be fully felt, raises the possibility that           98  you may be close to accomplishing stage one  At a minimum, the  incoming data have increased uncertainty about the path of the  economy and its response to policy actions  An appropriate  reaction to such an increase in uncertainty is to move policy more  gradually; in these circumstances, getting a better handle on how  the economy is evolving should reduce the odds on overdoing  policy restraint  Especially in light of the size of your action in  May, that might suggest a pause at this meeting     To be sure, such a pause probably would not be   appropriate if there were reasonably clear evidence that current  levels of resource utilization were unsustainable, or that inflation  expectations were rising  Recent data have tended to show core  prices rising faster than they did a year ago  But, a good deal of  the pickup in core inflation may be attributable to the secondary  effects of the rise in energy prices, rather than to excessive  tightness in labor markets; at least the verdict is still very  ambiguous  The only new data on labor compensation over the  intermeeting period--average hourly earnings--did not suggest a  rising trend that might confirm a sizable output gap  And, longer- term inflation expectations have not responded to short-term  swings in published inflation, suggesting that even if incoming  data on prices were to be adverse, the economy likely would not  incur an especially high cost if the Committee decided not to act  at this meeting  You will have an unusually full slate of new  information by the time of your next meeting to make judgments  on the strength of the economy and price pressures--essentially  two months of new data, including an update on the ECI     Whether the Committee raises rates or leaves them   unchanged at this meeting, it might still want to indicate that the  risks to good economic performance remained unbalanced toward  higher inflation over the foreseeable future  As noted, a wide  variety of simulations have suggested that this is indeed the case   More practically, the unusually high level of labor utilization,  along with the increase in core inflation and rise in energy prices  that could feed through to inflation expectations, would seem to  reinforce the notion that tendencies toward higher inflation still  are most likely to be your major problem going forward  If, for  some reason, policy inaction nonetheless were taken  inappropriately by the markets as a sign that you believed the risk  of inflation pressures had subsided, the Chairman has an  opportunity in his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy in  three weeks to align market expectations better with your sense of  the balance of risks               99    I agree with the first part of what you said in terms of describing what   is going on here  Basically the initial returns from the innovation in productivity accrue to the   owners of capital, to the businesses who wake up one morning and realize that there are   efficiency-generating capital investments and changes in production processes they can make    The first thing that happens is that they enhance their profits by making those innovations, by   buying that capital investment and trying to expand their operations  And as they compete with   each other, prices initially are held down  Over time, their efforts to expand their operations   increase the demand for labor, but that occurs with a bit of a lag  So we can depend on the labor   demand catching up slowly with the increasing profitability of businesses, as businesses   compete against each other first in the goods markets and later in the labor markets  Prices in   the goods market are less sticky than prices in the labor market  So initially the added demand   doesn't drive up the price of labor as much as it otherwise would  But ultimately that demand   feeds through  Workers realize that they’re more productive, and both the supply and demand   of labor will adjust to the higher productivity  You are right in concluding that that type of   lagged process, a staged process, is what is built into the models  And it’s what we think helps   to explain why the productivity surge first seems to have damped inflation and why we then   expect rising real wages to catch up over time   As for the second part of your comment, I’m not sure that the effects would be what   you suggested  It is true that it is workers who ultimately own capital in one form or another,   but the distribution of human capital and the ownership of physical capital are very, very   different So very different people are benefiting from the increasing profits  That’s one thing    Secondly, I think economic efficiency--in terms of the appropriate use of labor and capital--  would suggest that over time their prices better adjust to the productivity of capital and the           101  productivity of labor if we are going to have the optimum combination of utilization of labor   and capital  So despite the distribution of human capital and of physical capital--even if owned   by exactly the same people--I think their prices would still have to change in order to give the   appropriate signals to businesses and to labor on the proper mix  They need to know how much   labor to supply to the markets and how to mix capital and labor in the production process in   order to end up on the production possibility frontier  So I think those prices still have to adjust   to enhance economic efficiency     I think we perceived that worker insecurity, at least initially in this   productivity pickup, was another reason why wages tended to lag, aside from the stickiness of   wages relative to prices  But one would think that that insecurity has been overcome, in light of           102  an extraordinarily low unemployment rate and very tight labor markets, and has dissipated   mostly if not entirely  And that should begin to show through; we should begin to see the   process of the catch-up of real wages to productivity     It is a significant factor and I tried to indicate that in my briefing  I   don't have a simulation that has everything else the same and holds the dollar constant  But as I   mentioned to the Committee yesterday, I had asked our modelers to run what they call the “rosy   scenario” simulation, which had both a lower NAIRU and faster productivity growth with a   constant dollar  Interestingly, the lower NAIRU/faster productivity growth simulation does not   obviate the rise in nominal and real federal funds rates in order to hold inflation to, say, around   2 to 2-1/2 percent  It does lessen the amount of the increase  And if we add the constant dollar   to that, having all three of those things meant that the nominal funds rate could stay around the   current level over the next two years and we would still get inflation coming in at about 2   percent  So it does make a big difference  In our judgment, a difference of about a percentage   point on the nominal funds rate after a couple of years would be needed to accomplish the same   inflation objective  I think Karen Johnson would like to speak to this           103 "
5981,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of you have remarked,  incoming data since your last meeting have tended to reinforce the sense that  the growth rates of final demand and the economy’s ability to meet that demand  are much more closely aligned and are likely to stay that way, at least for a  while  On the demand side, consumption is growing at a slower pace and       66  homebuilding is declining, even before the full effects have been felt of earlier  tightening in financial conditions, including the leveling out of broad measures  of equity prices this year  On the supply side of the economy, a higher  estimated growth rate of potential means that demand need not decelerate as  much to achieve that alignment  From this evidence, it would appear that the  cumulative effects of your prior actions may well have tightened financial  conditions enough to keep the unemployment rate from falling further, even  taking account of the partial erosion of restraint from the recent rally in  domestic financial markets     At the same time, the new information on prices and costs, on balance, has   not indicated any further intensification of underlying inflation pressures  While  these data may make you a little more comfortable with the determination that  unemployment rates near 4 percent can persist for a while longer without serious  adverse consequences, they have not helped greatly in knowing whether such  rates are sustainable over the longer run  Labor compensation has run to the  strong side of expectations, but so too has productivity, so that faster increases in  real compensation have not put added pressure on unit costs and prices  Price  data have tended to confirm that core inflation rates are a little higher than a year  ago, though by less than anticipated by the staff, at least in the case of the PCE  chain price index  Moreover, the pickup in core inflation is small enough to  leave ambiguous the judgment as to whether it is attributable to the indirect  effects of energy price increases or labor market disequilibrium  And long-run  inflation expectations continue to be stable, or, on market-based measures, have  even declined a bit  With inflation and inflation expectations not worsening, and  growth in demand near that of potential supply, the Committee might see little  potential cost to keeping policy unchanged at this meeting  And waiting would  yield benefits, as new information accrued to help assess the underlying forces,  especially those working on the course of prices      Such a decision would still leave open the question of the risks going   forward to be characterized in your press release  Most market commentators  expect you to stay with the bias toward inflation risks  But that may be partly  because they are assuming you would want to avoid the attention and market  reaction that a shift might bring  The flat yield curve and pattern of futures rates  imply that the buyers and sellers of securities see at least as much chance that  your next policy action will be an easing in rates as a tightening  With inflation  compensation in the real-nominal Treasury yield spread below current increases  in the CPI--even below those in core CPI prices--investors would not seem to be  anticipating that keeping policy on hold would pose an inflation risk  And, high  levels of equity prices and expected earnings growth and a low implied equity  premium would suggest that investors do not anticipate that a much softer  economy and appreciable rise in the unemployment rate will be necessary to  achieve that outcome              67   If the Committee, like the markets, saw the recent data as supporting  judgments that the current unemployment rate might well be sustainable--and  was now likely to persist without further policy tightening--it might want to  consider shifting to a statement indicating that the risks to satisfactory economic  performance were now balanced  The staff forecast suggests economic  expansion is likely to proceed a bit below the now-higher growth of the  economy’s potential for some time even with the federal funds rate at its present  level over the rest of the year  And the Committee might see the recent  information on labor costs as consistent with little pressure on inflation “in the  foreseeable future,” especially if energy prices retrace a portion of their runup  and the dollar remains strong as investments in the United States retain their  attractiveness in an environment of strengthening productivity  But you may  also want to consider that a statement that the risks were balanced would  certainly surprise the commentators and likely boost prices in capital markets, at  least a little  Although no policy firmings are built into those prices, a statement  of balanced risks still would be taken as reducing the probability of further  increases in interest rates       With demand still quite strong in a number of sectors, the Committee might   not want to take the chance that its announcement would further fuel the recent  runup in stock and bond prices  Moreover, there are a number of reasons to  believe that the risks going forward still point toward higher inflation  In the  staff forecast, of course, taken as a whole, they do  Inflation picks up a little next  year in that forecast by some measures; and even with an additional 75 basis  points of tightening, conditions at the end of the period point to still further  acceleration of prices  Even if the Committee did not agree with the staff  assessment that unemployment rates needed to rise appreciably, its actions this  year to slow the growth of demand indicate that it sees unemployment rates in  the low 4s as near the lower end of possible equilibrium levels, and the risks of  rising inflation as especially unbalanced at the prevailing degree of labor  resource utilization  In addition, the current rate of core consumer inflation may  now be closer to the upper end of what the Committee considers to be  compatible with its price stability objective  In that case, the Committee might  be inclined to consider the cost of any further increase to be particularly high   To be sure, the standard balance of risks statement addresses the direction of  future inflation, not its level  But a higher level might suggest more weight on  any possibility of further increases, even if such a possibility were relatively  small       As Dave Stockton explained, in the staff forecast the trajectory of price   acceleration has been marked down, largely based on a reassessment of  productivity growth  However, the nature of the change may imply that the risks  to inflation around this revision are not symmetric  On the supply side, the  further pickup in productivity damps price increases through the forecast period  by offsetting much of the effects on business costs of worker efforts to catch up  to previous productivity increases and pressures from tight labor markets  On          68   the demand side, though, households and businesses are assumed to have already  built the productivity acceleration into expected growth of earnings and income   As a consequence, they have also incorporated the associated rise in the  equilibrium real interest rate into bond yields, and the Federal Reserve has  validated that increase with its monetary policy  Hence, in the forecast the  feedthrough of higher potential output to demand is less than it otherwise would  have been  The drop in real interest rates and relatively small size of the rebound  in equity prices since mid-May supports the notion that it is the economists, not  the markets, that are getting positive surprises on productivity  Of late, earnings  warnings from firms have contributed to lower profit projections by analysts for  the balance of this year and 2001, though to be sure, their long-term forecasts  continue to edge higher     Thus, the new staff assessment embodies two risks that both point in the   direction of the possibility of higher inflation than in the forecast  First, if  additional productivity growth gains are not forthcoming, cost pressures from the  catch-up in real wages and tight labor markets would raise costs faster and  squeeze profits  Second, if not all of the higher productivity growth rate is  currently built into market interest rates and earnings expectations, then more  increases in equity prices may be in store, working to strengthen demand and  tighten labor markets  There are other upside risks as well, even apart from the  level of the NAIRU and the effects of productivity gains  For example, a  stubbornly high price of oil could begin to affect inflation expectations      The new press statement language is about longer-term risks to meeting the   FOMC’s objectives  The former language involving asymmetries concerned the  probabilities of near-term action--over the intermeeting period and at the next  meeting or so  Even if the Committee were of the view that it was unlikely to get  enough new information about inflation prospects to justify a policy action in the  next few months, it should still adopt the biased statement language if it believes  that over time rising inflation poses a greater peril to economic performance than  weakness in economic activity       The 3-month rates that went up were 3-month Treasury bill rates  Three-  month commercial paper and CD rates went down  And I think the Treasury bill market, with a   reduced supply, is subject these days to very idiosyncratic changes  Much of the specific reaction   relates to likely or possible changes in supply, as liquidity has been impaired  And in fact this   increase reverses a decrease that was difficult to understand and explain over the previous   intermeeting period  So I wouldn’t put any weight on a change in the 3-month Treasury bill rate   given the state of that market right now  I think every other interest rate that we look at, private   interest rates and even longer-term government interest rates, suggests that expectations about Fed   tightening have certainly come down, and that is probably partly some decline in real rates and partly   some reduction in inflation expectations      I think the markets are looking at both their assessment of the underlying   supply and demand for goods and services and the Fed’s reaction  I personally don’t sense a sea   change in our credibility  I think our credibility has been building gradually for the last 20 years,   sometimes faster, sometimes slower  Over repeated episodes of the Committee keeping its eye on the   longer-run price stability goal and acting successfully and preemptively to achieve that, we have built   credibility  I would think that some more credibility has accrued to the Committee over the last year   because of its actions  But I also believe that the markets don’t see the underlying inflation risk  If   there were increased credibility but they saw an inflation risk or a strong growth risk, they might   assume that inflation would be low but that the Committee would be tightening interest rates a lot in   order to achieve that low inflation  But in fact they don’t have a tightening of interest rates--real   interest rates--built in at all  So it’s not just that they see inflation low; they see it low without any   FOMC action  Drawing on the recent experience of the last several years in which there hasn’t been   any rise in inflation at very low unemployment rates, and where productivity growth has continued to   hold down costs, they’ve basically projected a continuation of that experience out ahead  They don’t   see a need to tighten policy  So I don’t think it’s just credibility  Between the Greenbook and the   markets--in fact, between many economists and the markets--the underlying analysis is different  The          71   markets are putting a lot of weight on their experience of the last few years, whereas the economists   are trying to sort through the shocks that might have produced that experience and are seeing some   risks that the markets don’t see    "
6027,2000-10-03,"  Do you want to look at the announcement first?     Yes, the second page of the handout shows the changes from last time      86    We don't have anything as part of this project to look at ways to diminish   the growth of currency  And I wonder as a policy issue, do we want to diminish the growth of this   noninterest-earning debt out there?       We have always responded passively to demands for currency     For the holders  "
6028,2000-10-03,"  Mr Chairman, at its last two meetings, the Committee kept the   stance of policy unchanged, but expressed concern that the risks going forward  were tilted toward higher inflation  The information you’ve received since  August would seem to support a judgment that those risks remain contained,  and that policy can again be left on hold  As a number of you remarked,  incoming data have tended to confirm that the growth of aggregate demand has  slowed to, or even a bit below, the rate of growth of the economy’s potential   Moreover, developments in financial markets have been consistent with a  projection of relatively moderate growth going forward  While long-term rates  have declined on net since May, the full effects of the leveling out of equity  prices this year have yet to be felt, and the dollar has continued to appreciate   Increasing caution by lenders, especially toward marginal credits, should  reinforce the restraining effects of the rise in interest rates over the last 18  months  And in part because equity investors appear to have become more  cautious as well, stock prices have been held down even as long-term interest  rates have backed off  Growth of M2 has picked up very recently, but that  followed two months of very sluggish expansion and on average in the third  quarter M2 decelerated noticeably from earlier in the year  In credit markets,  lower long-term interest rates have encouraged a shift in financing out on the  yield curve, but private debt growth appears to have slowed appreciably in the  third quarter       There has been less news over the intermeeting period about costs and  prices than about economic activity, but the information becoming available in  this area has not suggested that the prevailing degree of tightness in labor  markets is a greater problem than the Committee perceived it to be in August   Core PCE inflation has ticked higher over the last year, but some of that small  price acceleration likely represents the passthrough effects of higher energy  prices  And longer-term inflation expectations, whether measured in securities  markets or through surveys, have not deteriorated  In addition, high and  volatile oil prices have added an element of uncertainty to the outlook for  aggregate demand, potential supply, and underlying inflation--with possibly  conflicting implications for the stance of policy  Under the circumstances, there  would seem little to be lost and potentially much to be gained by keeping policy  unchanged at this meeting and awaiting clearer signals about the evolution of  economic activity and prices               72  Indeed, the Committee might see the developments over the last  intermeeting period as suggesting that the chances of inflation moving higher  have receded--perhaps by enough to bring the risks to achieving your  macroeconomic objectives into balance for the foreseeable future  The  financial markets adopted a view that the risks were balanced some time ago   Indeed, more recently, market participants would appear to be placing greater  odds that the Committee will need to lower interest rates to cushion a softening  in activity than that it will be required to raise rates to contain emerging  inflation pressures       An important reason for the Committee’s perception that inflation  threatened to intensify has been a concern that the growth of demand might  outpace that of potential supply, further tightening already strained labor  markets  The moderation in growth that already has occurred, however, along  with the additional restraint still in the pipeline from previous tightenings,  soggy equity markets, and a stronger dollar, might make you now much more  confident that aggregate demand will grow no faster than potential output  In  the staff forecast, at an unchanged federal funds rate over the next year,  pressures on resources gradually abate  Decreases in long-term interest rates  since this spring, along with profits warnings and equity price declines of late,  tend to support the judgment expressed in the August Greenbook that to a  considerable extent faster productivity growth had already been built into  interest rates and expected profits  In that case, the economy would not be  about to experience another round of the demand-augmenting effects of greater  growth in potential supply  If the Committee therefore saw unemployment rates  at or a little over 4 percent as likely to persist, and you also saw such rates as  reasonably likely to be consistent for some time with stable inflation, you might  now judge the risks to achieving your objectives as balanced      However, even if the Committee were fairly confident that pressures on   resources would not intensify, you might still find that the balance of risks  remained weighted toward higher inflation  Such a view is implied by the staff  forecast, in which even with a gradual uptrend in the unemployment rate and  further increases in productivity growth, labor markets are tighter than can be  sustained without inflation picking up  While the Committee might not be  prepared to sign on to this assessment of labor market disequilibrium, you could  still view the inflation risks around unemployment rates in the low 4s as  unbalanced  Giving some weight to history might suggest that if NAIRU is not  in this neighborhood, it is more likely to be above than below it, especially once  increases in productivity growth begin to abate  Some measures of core  inflation have picked up more than the PCE index as unemployment rates have  stayed around 4 percent over the last year, perhaps reinforcing a sense of  unbalanced risks around prevailing levels of labor resource utilization  And  with levels of core inflation now possibly near, or even beyond, the limit that  the Committee might find acceptable in the very long run, you might see any      73  further acceleration of prices as adverse to economic performance over time,  and a situation requiring an especially robust reaction      Energy price developments also might contribute to a perception that risks  remain skewed toward higher inflation  Staff models tend to show that oil price  shocks push both inflation and output away from long-run desirable levels    Over recent quarters, any tendency for higher oil prices to damp demand has not  reduced actual output below potential, however, but rather has helped to bring  about better balance between the growth of demand and potential supply  In the  context of still robust final demand and high resource utilization, any  deterioration in inflation expectations as a consequence of persistently higher  energy prices would be troublesome  And in the event inflation expectations  rise, cushioning the effects of higher oil prices on labor and product markets by  holding nominal rates unchanged and allowing real rates to fall would risk  setting in motion an upward trend to the inflation rate, rather than just an  adjustment in the price level  The uncomfortable reality is that a rise in oil  prices requires a decline in domestic real income to validate the transfer of  purchasing power abroad and decrease in economic efficiency  Some added  slack in labor markets may be necessary to prevent worker attempts to protect  the purchasing power of their wages from resulting in an acceleration of costs  and prices     Keeping policy unchanged, whatever the bias in your announcement,   leaves open the question of your strategy going forward  The FOMC could find  it difficult to tighten in a timely manner in the event that the staff is right that  underlying inflation is on a very gradual uptrend with output growth at or below  the growth of potential supply  Operating for a time with a prediction that  inflation at a later date will be above your desired level is not necessarily a  problem, provided you act at some point to forestall or reverse that  development  Uncertainty about key interactions in the economy is a good  reason to wait  However, with little conviction on NAIRU and its empirical  relationship to productivity acceleration over the intermediate and longer runs,  it becomes hard, if not impossible, to act preemptively to prevent inflation from  rising if indeed labor resources turn out to be stretched too tight  At the same  time, you need to be careful not to fall into the trap of accepting a gradual  updrift in inflation because the few tenths each year could be noise and not  unambiguous evidence that the economy is operating at too high a level, and so  do not seem to pose a clear danger to satisfactory economic performance   Those few tenths will cumulate over time     In the past, the Committee has tended to wait for convincing evidence that   policy tightening was needed and then to act forcefully, but still well before  actual inflation intensified  This was the pattern in 1993-1994 and again over  the last year and a half  This strategy has carried with it a number of potential  pitfalls  The Committee could wait too long and hence need to do considerably  more tightening than otherwise, leading to greater variations in output,      74  employment, and inflation than desirable  On the other end, aggressive policy  actions once you begin to tighten could easily lead to overshooting  Despite  these pitfalls, the strategy has been successful for a number of reasons   Foremost, as in 1994 and again most recently, the Committee has acted at an  early stage of the inflation process, in that it leaned against unsustainable  growth in demand long before a pickup in inflation got going  It has also been  helpful that markets have been able to anticipate your actions, so the exact  timing of your tightenings was not important  Finally, you have been flexible  enough to stop tightening and even to roll back some of the actions promptly  when overshooting looked likely     The current situation, if inflation pressures do intensify gradually, may not   be as well suited to the strategy of waiting for great conviction and then moving  forcefully  The risks you are now looking at are further along the transmission  channel to inflation than the demand questions you faced before  Given the  uncertainties, a number of you have remarked that in the current situation you  will need to be more reactive than anticipatory when it comes to judgments  about the sustainability of a particular level of unemployment  Finally, you  may not get the anticipatory behavior from markets you’ve benefited from in  the past  At this point, markets do not see the risk you see  If inflation  pressures intensify gradually, markets may take longer than you would be  comfortable with to recognize the problem and your need to address it     The difficulties of making stabilizing monetary policy in the presence of   supply-side uncertainties once growth rate risk abates do not lend themselves to  ready solutions  Some economic theories indicate you should take your best  guess on some of these key values and act on those guesses, but this may not be  appealing when the interactions are complex and the best guesses so diffuse  You may still be able to be preemptive, albeit to a much lesser degree, for  example by paying close attention to business cost structures for hints that price  pressures are about to emerge  And you may end up having to be more willing  to surprise financial markets if you see pressures building and markets fail to  heed your warnings  Finally, you may need to care about the level of inflation  as well as its change  The evidence that a few tenths increase in inflation is part  of a continuing trend may not need to be quite as convincing when those tenths  take core PCE inflation from 2 to 2-1/4 percent as when they raised the same  measure from 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent        It will be hard to write the minutes!  "
6073,2000-11-15,"  I would only add, Mr Chairman, that if the Committee wanted to ease   interest rates quite considerably, I think the extra reserves we would have to add would be very,   very small, given the very low level of required reserves and the inelastic demand for reserves    Actually, we would have to buy very few extra securities in order to effect an easing      It’s just not that much     We also have a sense, Mr Chairman, that the spreads on marginal   investment grade yields have widened, even aside from the special effects  I agree with Peter--I   think he probably put his finger on what’s going on between the swaps and the agencies--that   marginal investment grade yields probably have risen relative to risk-free rates, adjusted for       10  everything  So, the concerns about risk extend beyond the junk bond market into the lower end   of the investment grade market  And that might be affecting these spreads     Do you want Lynn Fox to pass out the draft statement?  You   already have read most of the statement  "
6074,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman The information on hand since  your last meeting indicates that growth has slowed more definitively to a pace  below that of the economy’s potential  And tighter financial conditions along  with greater uncertainty about the profitability of new investment going forward  should provide greater assurance that the pace of economic expansion will not  surge again any time soon  At the same time, however, labor markets remain  tight, and incoming data continue to point to some upward pressures on costs and  underlying price inflation  As Dave detailed, the staff has responded by marking  down its forecasts of growth in aggregate demand by a little more than potential  supply, while retaining the projected upcreep in core inflation over the next two  years  On balance, the new information would not appear to be sufficiently at  odds with your expectations or your desires to cause you to alter the stance of  policy at this meeting  Instead, the question for the Committee would seem to be  whether that information and changes in the outlook provide a basis for shifting  from an assessment that the balance of risks going forward is weighted toward  increased inflation pressures to one that risks are now balanced        The judgment that risks are balanced does not have to wait until the point  where you are no longer concerned about inflation pressures   Rather, the balance  of risks statement envisions weighing the risks to economic performance relative  to both of the Committee’s long-term goals--price stability and sustainable  economic growth, the latter being a translation into growth rates of the legislated  objective of maximum employment  Because the statement is concerned with the               74      possibility of developments that might move the economy away from those goals,  it is formulated in first differences--intensifying inflation pressures and economic  weakness  In this context, economic weakness refers to output growth below that  of the economy’s potential--in other words, declining resource utilization        In the circumstances in which the economy finds itself at this time, you can   readily experience both intensifying inflation pressures and economic weakness,  and be concerned about their extent in the future, in effect balancing the relative  strengths of these two adverse outcomes  Such a configuration of economic  developments is typically associated with an adverse supply shock, like the  increase in the price of oil, which raises prices and depresses demand Rising  inflation and weak growth also would be characteristic of a situation like that  embodied in the staff forecast in which the economy had overshot the level of its  long-run potential so that prices were accelerating, but policy already had become  sufficiently restrictive to return resource utilization to its sustainable level  In  both cases, crosscurrents are playing on the appropriate stance of policy  The rise  in the inflation rate by itself would tend to suggest that the federal funds rate  might need to increase over time  But the shortfall in growth relative to the  economy’s potential would tend to call for the federal funds rate to decrease as  resource utilization fell  For example, a policy that was restraining an economy  operating with excess demand should become less restrictive as the level of the  economy’s long-run potential is reached         A balance of risks statement requires your judgment about whether one of   these tendencies is likely to override the other in determining economic  performance and affecting policy in the future  If the two tendencies were  thought most likely to have roughly offsetting effects on policy, the risks still  might not be balanced if you saw the possible outcomes around the modal  forecast as skewed  In making these determinations, you need to be thinking not  only about possible outcomes for prices and economic activity, but also about  how much weight in your policy strategy you would place on each type of  deviation from your objectives     In the current situation, the state of the labor market would seem to support a    judgment that considerable risks of rising inflation persist  The unemployment  rate has stayed at a level that at best you may consider to be around the lower end  of the range of plausible values for a sustainable rate in the near term  Most of the  recent compensation and price data have been broadly consistent with a mildly  accelerating trend, like the one anticipated by a staff forecast that embeds a  NAIRU above the current unemployment rate  Moreover, if productivity growth  is leveling out as in the staff forecast, the economy is entering a period when unit  labor costs will begin to come under added upward pressure as workers catch up                   75      to previous increases in producitivity  And the longer energy prices  remain elevated, the more they threaten to boost inflation expectations and  foster added wage demands to offset the associated erosion of real income  gains         The question then is whether these inflation risks have now become   balanced by risks to sustainable economic growth  Several of you noted at  the Committee’s last meeting that you found the choice between  unbalanced and balanced risks a close call, and the evidence since that  time would suggest that the risks of economic weakness have increased   Actual growth has come in a bit below staff expectations, with the  shortfalls occurring in final demand, not inventory accumulation   Moreover, the decline in stock prices, firming in exchange rates,  ratcheting up of terms and standards on bank credit to businesses, and rise  in bond yields on marginal credits indicate an appreciable tightening of  financial conditions at the existing federal funds rate, which will have  restraining effects on demand  The staff response to these developments  has been to reduce the assumed tightening and to postpone it until 2002-- perhaps beyond the “foreseeable future” of the Committee’s statement   Over the next year, the gradual uptrend in both inflation and  unemployment rates in the staff forecast would seem to have about  offsetting effects on the desired funds rate, suggesting balanced risks over  this period, unless you were placing much greater weight on containing  inflation than on damping variability in output       Moreover, developments in recent months might also be read as   suggesting that the risks of a shortfall in economic growth from the staff  forecast have increased  One source of asymmetric risks might be  financial markets, where investor skittishness and concerns about credit  quality and earnings seem more likely to intensify than to ease, especially  if the staff outlook for earnings turns out to be on target  Indeed, banks  have already told us that they intend to firm loan terms and standards in  the future  Growing financial market caution, by making credit less  available and more expensive, would increase the odds on other downside  possibilities identified in the Greenbook--a shortfall in investment  spending and problems abroad  We may again be in a period in which the  standard linear relationships in our models do not capture the likely  market developments and their feedback to economic activity  To the  extent weakness already evident in stock and bond markets reflects  expectations of lower profitability or perceptions of increased risk for  investment projects, the equilibrium real interest rate would be reduced   That would provide another reason why the current federal funds rate  might be more restraining than it appeared to be only a few months ago  If  the actual funds rate is above the equilibrium rate, conditions are in place  to contain inflation before long, even if the economy is now producing  beyond the level of its potential And the case for balanced risks would be               76      stronger if the Committee saw better odds than the staff that an  unemployment rate close to recent levels is sustainable, implying a smaller  probability of an updrift in inflation than in the staff forecast       Finally, given the skittishness of financial markets with possible   restraining effects on the economy, the Committee might be more  comfortable being positioned at balanced risks going forward  In the  event of a major identifiable downward shock, like a bond or equity  market collapse, you could ease from any position, including a position of  unbalanced risks toward rising inflation, and markets would not feel they  had been misled  But easing from a position of unbalanced risks in  response to more incremental changes in the outlook--say, a further  firming of credit conditions--could be trickier  And the issue may not be  easing per se, but moving to unbalanced risks toward economic weakness,  which also might be more readily accomplished if the Committee already  were at balanced risks  In short, the Committee might see a posture of  balanced risks as providing a calming influence on markets and opening  up a wider array of possible actions or announcements in December, in the  event of further softening in demand or adverse market developments        Nonetheless, the Committee may still have sufficient doubts about the   extent and persistence of the downshift in aggregate demand to justify a  judgment that inflation risks continue to be the dominant threat to  economic performance  To date, job growth has slowed only to the pace  that would keep labor markets tight, not relieve pressure appreciably   Strong consumer confidence and continued high long-term returns on  business capital investment should support solid growth going forward   Although the real federal funds rate is elevated, so too is trend  productivity growth and the equilibrium real rate  The staff forecast sees  real short-term interest rates now at levels that would tend to cap inflation  and return the economy to potential, but this process is gradual, taking  several years, suggesting that real rates may be only mildly restrictive   And, in that forecast, nominal rates need to rise to maintain the level of  real rates as inflation itself picks up  So, as you know, the Greenbook  anticipates that your next action--admittedly a long way off--is more likely  to be a firming than an easing of policy, just to hold core inflation at a rate  somewhat above recent experience  Moreover, after its uptick of recent  years, the rate of core inflation might already be high enough that you  would want to continue to put considerably more policy weight on  possible increases in inflation than on potential shortfalls in economic  growth      Finally, concerns about the effects on financial markets of moving to   balanced risks might also weigh in favor of staying with your current  assessment, at least for a while  Market participants are likely to take a  change in this assessment as indicating that the Committee was no longer               77      keeping the door closed to near-term policy easing   The size of the  resulting rally in financial markets is hard to predict  It might not be large;  the Committee would be announcing balanced risks--not a dominant  concern about economic weakness--so the Committee would still be  lagging the market’s assessment of its likely behavior going forward  And  an increasing number of observers--albeit still a minority--expect you to  announce balanced risks after this meeting  Nonetheless, there is a chance  that the reaction would be strong, and that against the background of the  Committee’s shift, the markets would seize on weaker elements in  inherently noisy data over the coming intermeeting period to build in  considerably higher odds on near-term action than the Committee would  find comfortable  By themselves, such reactions might turn a situation of  barely balanced risks into one that returned to an imbalance toward  heightened inflation pressures  And you might worry whether possibly  being perceived as getting ready once again to cushion a downdraft in  financial markets wouldn’t reduce incentives to reassess credit and  earnings risks, truncating an ultimately healthy process before it had run  its course and building in future over-confidence       Holding the current assessment at this meeting would allow you to get   additional evidence to judge whether--after taking account of any market  reaction--the growth of demand was likely to be enough below the growth  of the economy’s potential over time to relieve pressures on resource  markets and counterbalance inflation risks  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Right               78        The sustainable growth is intended, I think, to be consistent with   changes in resource utilization  I agree that we can start, as perhaps we are now, with   over-utilized resources  But suppose you already have in effect a restraining policy to   bring resource utilization down  If you start from a position where you have adjusted to   that situation--you have already tightened policy to bring resource utilization back down   to its potential level--as resource utilization gets to that potential you'd better be easing   that federal funds rate, other things equal, or you will overshoot the potential     If you think of the “foreseeable future” as about a year, and you   crank this through the staff forecast, I think you will find that inflation is creeping up and   so is the unemployment rate  It depends on the weights you put on those two measures    But if you put roughly equal weight on them, taking account of the real funds rate, I think   you'd find that they approximately offset going forward over the next year  I was trying   to explain the situation where you had already tightened  Let’s say you were already   somewhat restrictive in order to get resource utilization down to where it needs to be--and   growth below the rate of growth of potential would be doing that--that slower growth just   by itself, ignoring inflation, should be moving you to lowering interest rates  Now,   inflation concerns may get you to raise the funds rate and unemployment to lower   inflation, and then you would--                 79        Suppose you started from the premise that the Committee had   already acted over the past year and a half to tighten monetary policy, consistent with an   outlook that the economy is operating beyond its potential and inflation is likely to go up    If that were the case, you might judge that the Committee had already put monetary   policy in a restrictive stance  If you thought that the Committee had not tightened   enough, I agree that easing in response to recent developments might not be appropriate,   and you would be more comfortable with further tightening as resource utilization rose                80      But I was starting from the premise that you probably thought you had done just about   enough--maybe you had a little doubt--or you would have done more  So I was taking   your actions as being indicative of a view that you weren't that far from where you   thought you wanted to be  The real rate must be somewhere in the neighborhood of the   natural rate, if not a little higher, or we wouldn't have a rising unemployment rate in the   staff forecast  So you might judge that it's already restrictive  The other point in my   briefing was this  That even if you had the view last time that policy might not be   restrictive enough, certainly you would hold that view less strongly today, given what has   happened over the intermeeting period--whether you wanted to move to a balanced risk   statement or not  "
6123,2000-12-19,  The announcement?      84    I don't know whether slowing activity actually means a decline  
6124,2000-12-19,"  In support of your perceptions, Mr Chairman, there actually was an attempt   by some senators to embody an explicit price stability goal in the legislation  And others who were   involved at the committee level objected to that and did not want to go to that point  "
6125,2000-12-19,"  The information becoming available in the few weeks  since your last meeting has reinforced the perception that the economy  has entered a period of adjustment of uncertain dynamics and  dimensions  The Committee tightened policy from mid-1999 to mid- 2000 in order to slow economic expansion to a more sustainable pace   This downshifting probably could never have been as smooth a process  as some had hoped for, as the inventory cycle now taking place in autos  and elsewhere attests  But, in addition, the macroeconomic downshift  has interacted with and has been amplified by other developments that  appear to be sapping aggregate demand by considerably more than was  anticipated a few months ago  One of these developments is the  persistence of high energy prices, restraining household spending and  business profits  Another is the emergence of credit problems for  marginal business borrowers even before economic growth moderated,  leading banks and other lenders to have become more cautious already   A final factor has been an apparent reassessment of the returns, at least  in the near term, from producing, owning, and operating high-tech  equipment  This reassessment is not only damping business and  household spending on such equipment, but, through its effects on  equity prices, it is curbing demand more broadly  Significantly, as  Karen noted, many of the factors damping demand in the United States  also appear to be at work in other countries; this has kept the dollar from  depreciating much and will constrain the lift to net exports that might  ordinarily accompany a weakening in domestic demand     In many respects, as Dave noted, there would seem to be some   countervailing positive pressures that provide natural limits on the extent  to which many of these factors will tend to reduce the growth of  aggregate demand  Continuing underlying strength in structural  productivity growth should support capital investment, income, and  consumption; a number of the credit problems are the residue of lax  lending standards in effect before the fall of 1998 that have since been  firmed; and energy prices probably will move lower  Moreover, fiscal  policy seems highly likely to move in a stimulative direction over  coming years  However, these supportive elements are working against  the interactions of slower growth, increasing risk aversion, declining      64  equity prices, and eroding consumer and business confidence that could  well weaken demand more than called for by an orderly adjustment to a  more sustainable supply and demand balance     The strength of the forces restraining demand clearly has increased   since your last meeting  As a consequence, the Committee’s assessment  of the balance of risks would seem likely to have shifted since that  meeting, when you still saw inflation as the more important threat to  achieving your long-term objectives, albeit by a smaller margin than at  your previous meetings this year  The issues the Committee faces are by  how much these risks have changed and what is the appropriate  response     Announcing that the risks were balanced would suggest a relatively   modest change in the Committee’s perceptions of economic  developments--slightly greater prospects for slower economic growth,  and partly as a consequence, a little less inflation risk  This is what most  market commentators expected you to do before the unfortunate Wall  Street Journal article on Monday, and balanced risks are roughly  consistent with the staff forecast  In that forecast a steady federal funds  rate produces a gradual approach to the staff’s estimate of a sustainable  level of labor utilization, with core inflation holding at about current  rates, helped by declining energy prices  Ordinarily, one might expect  the real federal funds rate to decline as the unemployment rate rises  toward its NAIRU in order to minimize overshooting  But in the staff  forecast, the real funds rate implicitly is seen as not particularly high  relative to its neutral level, and some continuing policy restraint is  needed to damp the effects on demand of falling energy prices, a  declining dollar, and more stimulative fiscal policy     Still, the Committee may see downside risks to the staff outlook for   both inflation and output that it may want to take account of in its  announcement or its action  Two key factors adding to pressures on  prices and producing the rough balance in the staff forecast are the level  of the NAIRU and the decline in the foreign exchange value of the  dollar  If you judge the NAIRU as likely to be lower than does the staff,  inflation would tend to diminish, despite the expected fall in the dollar,  if economic activity does indeed expand more slowly than the growth of  potential as projected by the staff  And, while you may believe that the  dollar is more likely to fall than to rise over time given the current  account deficit, the timing of any decline is unknowable  A steady  dollar, as shown in the Greenbook simulation with the staff’s NAIRU,  produces noticeably less inflation and slower growth in 2002 than in the  staff forecast         65  Moreover, in a situation apparently characterized by large and rapid  shifts in business and consumer sentiment, in lender perceptions of risk,  in financial asset prices, and in the interactions of financial markets and  the real economy, judging the relationship of policy interest rates to  economic outcomes is even more difficult than usual  In such an  environment, the weak tone to some of the very recent evidence on  economic developments, including the appreciable downward revisions  to businesses’ sales and earnings expectations, together with the  decreases in equity prices and the rise in risk premiums that have  characterized financial market responses to this information, may  suggest that the current stance of policy entails a significant risk that the  economy will be weaker than you will find acceptable  This seems to be  the view implicit in financial market prices, which have built in  expectations of more than a full percentage point of policy easing next  year, beginning at the January meeting      If you were reasonably confident that policy would need to be eased   before long, you might want to get started at this meeting  The  tightening through last May was necessary in part to counter the effects  of optimistic earnings expectations on investment and equity prices  The  fading of this optimism and the projected edging lower of productivity  growth may suggest that rates can now be reduced  The market value of  equity prices has fallen nearly 10 percent since your May meeting   Though interest rates on mortgages and investment-grade debt have  decreased since May, those on high-yield debt have risen and the dollar  has appreciated a bit  With long-term inflation expectations perhaps  dropping significantly, judging from the Treasury bond market, even  those households and businesses facing lower nominal rates may be  seeing little decline in real borrowing costs, if they have declined at all   Evidence on shorter-term inflation expectations is harder to extract from  the markets  If such expectations also fall--a not unreasonable response  to a weakening economy--the federal funds rate would need to be  reduced at some point just to forestall a firming in policy in real terms   And, the spread of credit concerns increasingly into the investment- grade area may suggest a risk that credit restraint could become less  selective and more pervasive  Lastly, if you believe the economy can, in  fact, operate on a sustained basis at a lower rate of unemployment than  in the staff forecast--even if that rate is a bit above the current level--a  prompt easing could help to forestall an unnecessarily large rise in the  unemployment rate     At the same time, flat or declining inflation expectations and   softening labor markets should alleviate concerns about inflation   Against this background, the Committee may see little to be gained by  waiting if it saw high odds that the growth of aggregate demand was still  weakening      66    Circumstances that had become serious enough in a short time to   require immediate action might also be serious enough to warrant an  assessment that the risks going forward were weighted toward economic  weakness even after policy was eased  The market reaction to a cut in  rates coupled with unbalanced risks would be substantial, as market  participants built in more and more rapid easing than they have to date   Previously, they may have been held back in their forecasts of the path  of short-term rates by perceptions that the Federal Reserve would be  constrained by its concerns about inflation and its assessment that the  economic slowdown was not excessive     A more measured approach, even if the Committee were worried   about the possibility of slower growth than in the staff forecast, would  be to keep rates unchanged but announce that you now saw the risks as  weighted toward economic weakness  One reason for adopting this  approach is the starting point for the economy  It still is operating with  very tight labor markets, near the lower end of plausible estimates of  sustainable values, if not below  And by many measures, core inflation  has edged higher, perhaps close to the upper end of the range of some  Committee members’ objective for inflation over time  In addition, if  productivity growth is leveling out, cost pressures could mount in tight  labor markets  In these circumstances, the Committee might want to  proceed more deliberately in easing policy in order to gain greater  assurance that labor market pressures would abate and inflation would  be contained, even if it suspected that the NAIRU might not be far above  the current level of the unemployment rate  The nature of the recent  information might also counsel caution  A number of the more negative  readings are from volatile, high frequency series; are qualitative, in the  sense of being anecdotal or about confidence; or concern earnings and  sales shortfalls that may be measured against expectations that may well  have been unreachable in an economy growing at a sustainable pace   Indeed, many of the spending and employment data are consistent with  continued reasonable economic expansion, albeit at a much slower rate  than in the first half of the year and below potential  In the transition to  a slower-growth economy, which the Committee had sought, it is likely  to be especially difficult to sort out whether the new information  represents excessive weakness or is mostly a by-product of the desired  downshift  Lastly, financial markets continue to function reasonably  well they are by no means “seized up”  Better investment-grade firms  have been able to access large volumes of credit at lower interest rates  and have issued new equity  And, in contrast to the circumstances in  1990, financial intermediaries themselves remain sound, limiting the  potential for concerns about their health to lead to general restrictions on  credit availability         67  In these circumstances, you might want greater confirmation that  the economy is slowing by more than you would find acceptable before  lowering interest rates   Announcing a balance of risks toward economic  weakness would itself help to buoy values in financial markets and thus,  spending  Equity and bond prices should hold yesterday’s gains and  might rally further with the confirmation that the Committee recognized  the greater potential for weak growth and, implicitly, was prepared to  take action to deal with it  In this regard, if the Committee were  concerned about downside risks to the economy, through this  announcement it would realize a portion of the effects from an easing,  without making the immediate commitment  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Dave might want to speak to this as well, but in the Greenbook forecast the       6-1/2 percent funds rate is slightly restrictive  It is consistent with the economy growing below the   rate of potential, so the unemployment rate is rising  It is not greatly restrictive, but I think it's   slightly restrictive  And as I noted in my remarks, the relatively high level of the nominal funds rate   and the real funds rate is made necessary by the judgment that underlying structural productivity   growth will remain relatively strong so that the equilibrium interest rate is relatively high  And there   are forces, like more expansive fiscal policy--and in particular the assumption of a depreciating   dollar, which puts upward pressure on prices and helps to cushion weakness in the United States--  that require a slightly restrictive stance of monetary policy     If you were absolutely certain about the course the economy was going to   take and there was no uncertainty about the NAIRU or about the strength of demand--if you keyed in   on these point forecasts as what you expected to happen--then I think that rationale would carry   through  In other words, it would carry through if you just accepted everything in the Greenbook   forecast  But there are a lot of uncertainties here  A major issue that was raised in the Bluebook was   the degree of uncertainty and the extent to which it's very hard to interpret the incoming information    So in this circumstance, and with labor markets a little to the tight side--even if you didn't think the   unemployment rate needed to go to 5 percent but you wanted a little daylight there to ease inflation      69  pressures a bit--you might want to proceed with any easing a little cautiously  Even if you didn't   intend to get the unemployment rate to 5 percent, waiting six weeks to reduce the federal funds rate   until you had more confirmation about the evolving situation wouldn't make very much difference     And if the NAIRU were perceived to be 5 percent  Then that assessment   probably would be more likely  "
6177,2001-01-30,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Peter and I thought it  best to begin with a discussion of the basic longer-run approaches to  this question of how to reconfigure the System’s assets as the  Treasury debt is paid down  Then subsequently and separately we  will go on to consideration of specific choices the Committee must     1/30-31/01 3  make at this meeting concerning the management of the System’s  portfolio for the period immediately ahead     As background for the first round of discussion, I will   summarize what I take to be the main issues in the background  papers you received, leading to the questions Peter and I posed for  the Committee at the end of our cover memo  After your discussion  of these issues, Peter will address short-run strategies     As you can tell from both the physical and intellectual heft of   the studies, these were major undertakings that required considerable  work and imagination  Owing to space constraints we could fit only  one of the team leaders from each paper at the table, but the others  are sitting behind me  Peter and I want to thank the team leaders, as  well as all the others from around the Federal Reserve System who  were on the teams that prepared these papers, for their considerable  contributions  The team leaders are available to answer your  questions after my presentation and before you’ve had a general  discussion of the longer-run issues     I think the first important point to highlight, evident in the   paper you saw last fall from the team led by Tom Simpson, is that  the issue cannot be put off for much longer  Under a wide variety of  assumptions about the growth of the economy and the political  process, Treasury debt will be repaid over coming years  Even if the  entire on-budget surplus is used in tax cuts and new spending, debt  will be close to extinguished in 10 years under a fairly conservative  assumption of 3-1/2 percent trend economic growth  Meanwhile, the  Treasury market will become increasingly illiquid, ultimately for RP  as well as outright transactions, especially considering that many of  these securities are held by investors who will be loathe to give them  up even at elevated price premiums     As the debt dwindles, the System will probably want to be   gradually reducing its reliance on it  This course will be necessary  to insure that some of our portfolio is in other more liquid assets and  to be helpful to the Treasury in managing the paydown of debt and  maintaining liquid market segments as long as possible  Indeed, if  there is a public good aspect to the existence of a Treasury market,  the System would be performing a public service by running its  portfolio down faster than the Treasury was repaying debt   Depending in part on your short-run decisions, the need to make  major changes in the System’s assets does not come immediately, as  Peter will be discussing  But under most probable scenarios it arises  soon enough to suggest the necessity of continuing the process of  examining longer-run alternatives     1/30-31/01 4    A second point apparent in all the papers is that there are no   easy, obvious solutions to the problem of what assets to hold under  this circumstance  All options seemed to have significant  drawbacks  Some people have proposed continuing to rely on  Treasury securities, even as the debt is paid down, by acquiring them  through special arrangements with the Treasury or the Social  Security Trust Fund  While the System would be able to continue to  hold risk-free government assets, such plans themselves do raise a  number of questions  They would transfer the problem of possibly  accumulating private assets to another part of the government that  may not be as well equipped to deal with it  They would leave the  Federal Reserve with a portfolio of illiquid assets as the Treasury  market disappears, and they would make the central bank dependent  on agreements with the rest of the government for its assets     Of course, the alternative of taking on private obligations raises   other issues, including those involved with potential effects on  private credit allocation and the management of risk and liquidity in  the System’s portfolio that were outlined in the paper on principles  by Chris Cumming and Jack Beebe  The important point raised in  that paper and emphasized in the note from Peter and me was the  impossibility of satisfying all the System's goals at once, and hence  the inevitability of making tradeoffs along a number of dimensions  of portfolio management  A key tradeoff would be between  minimizing the effects of System portfolio choices on relative asset  prices on the one hand, and minimizing risk and maximizing  liquidity on the other  A broadly diversified portfolio, which  included credit to financial intermediaries holding nonmarketable  assets, would have the greatest chance of exerting as little influence  as possible on private credit decisions  With such a portfolio, the  System would have a low profile in each market and it would not be  favoring one type of asset over another  But the System would be  acquiring riskier and less liquid assets, and it would be assuming the  responsibility to manage those assets  As the paper on open market  assets by Sandy Krieger and Brian Madigan makes clear, venturing  into new markets and assets will entail a number of management  challenges in addition to those involved with credit risk  These  include dealing with new clearing and settlement procedures and  with new counterparties  At the other end of the spectrum, if the  Committee chose to concentrate operations in a small subset of  markets that promised the least credit risk and the greatest liquidity-- for example those for GSE securities or A1/P1 commercial paper--it  would increase the odds on eventually affecting relative asset prices         1/30-31/01 5  The management of liquidity itself will offer a number of  choices and complexities  The System needs a portfolio that can be  adjusted at the margin without affecting market prices, but not all  assets in our portfolio need the same degree of liquidity  Some of  the assets must be capable of being increased or decreased in size on  a given day or over just a few days to meet regular daily reserve  needs and the rare requirement to add or drain substantial volumes of  reserves on an emergency basis  But a large portion of the portfolio  need never be adjusted on short notice and can be rolled over or  added to slowly without ever being run off or sold and hence can  consist of very illiquid assets  And there are various degrees of  required adjustability in between these two extremes--for example,  to meet seasonal currency flows  Liquidity can be obtained by  holding assets with active secondary markets, but some degree of  liquidity will also flow from having frequent maturities of otherwise  illiquid assets coupled with means of expanding or contracting  holdings as needed upon maturity as, for example, in RP transactions  or discount window credit auctions     The open market asset paper and the discount window paper by   Craig Hakkio and Rick Lang looked at alternative assets and  techniques to help to find opportunities and tradeoffs as the System  moves beyond Treasury securities  As both papers brought out, no  one market or direction the System can go probably is of sufficient  size or liquidity to replace Treasury securities entirely without  having an important effect on relative asset prices  Both papers  identified some approaches the Committee might want to explore  further as elements in an overall strategy  Taken together these  papers raised some issues that we listed in the form of questions at  the end of the Fisher/Kohn paper, and I will repeat those questions  here in somewhat expanded and modified form     Several questions revolve around diversification  Should the   System try to identify individual asset markets in which it could  operate with low risk, high liquidity, and relatively muted effects on  asset prices or should it move as a matter of strategy toward a fully  diversified portfolio?  There are individual markets that would allow  you considerable scope to substitute for Treasury securities while  maintaining many of the aspects of your current portfolio   Diversification on the other hand would make clear that you place  high weight on not favoring one market or borrower over another  If  the System moves toward diversification, should it attempt to get  there soon and directly, say through the use of mutual funds, or  should it adopt an incremental approach operating first in the most  accessible markets with the most easily adapted techniques?  As the  System diversifies, to what extent should it rely on its own risk     1/30-31/01 6  management and to what extent can it outsource risk management  under the overall guidance of the Committee?      Whether you choose a fully diversified portfolio or not, another   question is, what should be the relative roles of temporary operations  and permanent additions to the portfolio?  Outright operations will  tend to have a more direct impact on asset prices and could involve  the System in difficult choices about which assets or markets to  operate in  Temporary operations have a number of attractive  attributes  They work through intermediaries and to some extent the  credit allocation decision can be left to the intermediary rather than  the central bank  Risk is reduced because the central bank looks first  to the intermediary for repayment, can adjust haircuts, and in the  event of default can fall back on the final borrower whose paper has  been used as collateral for a discount window loan or purchased in  an RP  And the liquidity of temporary transactions can be tailored to  System needs by having them mature frequently  But exclusive or  very heavy reliance on RPs or discount window loans may also  distort the financial system by favoring those intermediaries with  access, by potentially affecting the liability structure of the  intermediaries, and by indirectly distorting credit allocation by  helping those borrowers that rely on the favored intermediary     If you decide to utilize a large volume of temporary   transactions, a further question is, what proportion should be RPs  transacted in open markets and what proportion should be loans  made at the discount window?  RP markets outside those already  used by the Federal Reserve are for the most part rudimentary,  though they are likely to develop more if the Federal Reserve begins  to use them  Discount window loans could be made in size, but  especially heavy use would require more System resources to be  devoted to collateral management  And it might raise some issues at  the intersection of lending and supervision in addition to the  potential for skewing credit allocation toward depositories and their  customers     So how do you view the discount window alternatives and   what additional information do you require to evaluate them?  More  broadly, are there any particular avenues or procedures that look  more promising than others and how should you proceed to explore  them?  Finally, the Committee might want to address the question of  how to involve the public in the ongoing consideration of these  issues  The minutes of this meeting along with the Chairman's  upcoming testimony will cover this subject in one form or another   And the outcome of your short-run decision may very well also  entail public discussion and comment  Does the Committee see     1/30-31/01 7  other steps that should be taken to advance the public’s  understanding?  That concludes my introductory remarks, Mr  Chairman     As I noted earlier, the study’s authors are beside me and behind   me--I'm surrounded by them!  We'd be happy to take questions about  any of the individual studies or the overall summary       Who would that be?     Back in the ’70s and ’80s there were problems in the RP market--  such as people pledging the same securities several times--but none involved the Federal   Reserve  A few laws were changed and people went to jail      Right     That was one reason why we suggested that this simply be   explored, to test a bit and see what the reaction might be and whether we could explain it   in a way that would be fully understood     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think there are a couple of avenues   on which to proceed forward from here   For the very short run, of course, you have   authorized Peter and me to explore with appropriate individuals in the political process    and financial markets the possibilities of doing RPs against foreign sovereign and eligible   tax-exempt securities  So, obviously, we will begin that process   Also, a couple of you raised the issue of whether we couldn’t buy some   GNMAs, and the Desk will take a look at that question  As the Krieger-Madigan paper   made clear, there are complications with having them on our balance sheet because of the   prepayment risk  But we need to explore that avenue to see whether it can buy us a little   more time with an obligation that carries the full faith and credit of the United States   Government  We would not undertake any of these endeavors, particularly initiating   discussions with anyone outside the System, before we begin the dialogue with the public   in an official way  As an initial step we would plan to include at least a brief summary of   this morning’s discussion--or the points and questions raised--in the Chairman’s   upcoming testimony on February 13th  That would be one way of getting the issues out   on the table publicly  And, of course, the minutes for this meeting will come out in about   seven weeks and they presumably would have a somewhat more complete summary of     1/30-31/01 80  the issues you have discussed  So those two vehicles will be an official way of getting   this subject out in the public domain   We will also take a look at the papers with a view to whether they can be   published, perhaps with a little cleaning up here and there  We would have to look   carefully at them  Peter and I deliberately did not suggest editorial changes or review   them from the perspective that they would be published because we felt everything   needed to be on the table for the Committee  So, we would need to go back over them to   see what might be sensitive  It will take a little while, but I think we can get the papers--  or something that resembles these papers--published, and that will also further the   dialogue  So, for the short run one of the primary issues is the public dialogue, which we   can work on in several dimensions--with academia, with the Street, and with the political   process  That was a rather clear instruction from the Committee   There was also some coalescence of views about a few other avenues to   pursue  Many of you found the ACF worth further exploration, so I think we need to   continue that work  We have to figure out how it could be implemented in a practical   way  We also need to look carefully at the objections or concerns that were listed in the   paper and at some that President McDonough noted with respect to the intersection of the   lending and the supervisory functions       The study pointed out that to a certain extent the ACF would   replace Home Loan Bank advances--not an entirely bad consequence      I do believe that there may be lessons to be learned from the   experience of the Home Loan Banks     Yes, the effects of that free money on the behavior of the   depository institutions receiving it would give us some insights into the issues that   President McDonough raised in that regard     Yes  So the ACF ought to get a very careful look both in terms   of lessons to be learned and also practicality  If we were to go forward with it, we would   have to address the point that Peter raised about organizing an auction and the concerns   that several of you raised about risk management issues and controlling the collateral    Another issue that many of you talked about was the expansion of the range of   collateral eligible in RP operations  Of course, the short-run expedient that Peter and I   have proposed would do that to a small extent  Anything else would require a change in   the law  But I believe there was enough support around the table for expanding the pool   of acceptable RP collateral that, even with the caveat that it would require a change in     1/30-31/01 82  law, it ought to be one of the first areas we explore  We would do that concurrently with   the study of the ACF and some of these other options  If a change in the law is   necessary, we ought to know what we want to do and how we want to do it in case we   decide to seek legislation    We should also review the transcript of this morning’s discussion to learn more   about the longer-term visions a number of you articulated--where you thought we should   end up in five or ten years  We ought to be doing our other more practical studies   relating to possible adjustments in the shorter term in the context of where you think we   need to go in the longer run  So, on a separate track, I’d like to winnow through this   morning’s commentary to see whether we can narrow down our longer-run goals to   perhaps three or four alternatives  And in that regard, I think Al Broaddus’s suggestion   warrants a closer look  Clearly, everybody is uncomfortable with moving System assets   into non-Treasury obligations  If there is a way we could stay in Treasury securities   where the costs do not outweigh the benefits, we ought to make sure we’ve explored that   opportunity  Marvin Goodfriend is certain that he can convince me over a couple of   beers that this is a good idea, so I’ll probably take him up on that  I don’t know how   many beers it will take!  [Laughter]   So, I think that’s where we are, Mr Chairman  To sum up, we will pursue a   few avenues immediately, including the initiation of the public dialogue, the possibilities   of doing RPs against foreign sovereign and municipal securities, and the GNMA   question  In the short run we also will look at the practical operational considerations   relating to the ACF and the expansion of RP collateral  And we will continue to work on     1/30-31/01 83  the longer-run vision of where the Committee may want to go in the timeframe of the   next five to ten years     Well, we would expect to move forward on some of this work   over the next six months--having the public dialogue and assessing the foreign sovereign   and municipal securities options  Starting that dialogue in and of itself will spark a lot of   debate, so that will be a useful step in the right direction  In our memo we indicated, and   Peter reiterated in his comments today, that we can go along for several years, even   without increasing our reliance on GSEs--particularly if purchases of foreign sovereigns   in some volume turn out to be a feasible alternative--before we’d be absolutely forced to   do something  But, of course, well before that several years, we probably would want to   be proposing legislative remedies to Congress, given the lags between going to Congress   and getting legislation enacted  Also, we’re going to be looking very carefully at   implementing the ACF  But as a first guess, I think we’ve got another year or so--  probably more--before we would have to start implementing any of these alternatives or   go to Congress for enabling legislation, so long as these interim steps work out for us  Is   that a fair assessment of the timeframe, Peter?       Right  That’s one reason why exploring the ACF and the RP   collateral issue has a lot of appeal     But I think the ACF is key to a different problem  The Lombard   is conceptually separate and it might even confuse matters to tie it with the ACF     I think there’s a potential problem of overloading the system by   trying to do too many things at the same time  One issue we’ve been tackling involved   trying to pay interest on reserves      We’ve been unsuccessful in doing that and I don’t think we’re   likely to be successful  We can take a look at this idea to see if perhaps something on   that side is worth exploring  But I would hesitate to commit to a major study about   reserve requirements and the clearing balances system when we’re trying to work on   these other projects at the same time  However, if the Committee and the Board think   there are issues to be explored there, we should find the resources to do it       ACF     That was my understanding, yes     Right Certainly on the short-run issues we would have to come   back to you and we will provide an update on where we are on these longer-term efforts   as well  It needs to be fewer than eight months before the Committee is next apprised of   what the staff is doing in this area  In addition, we will keep you informed about our   plans as we winnow them down and we will come back to consult on where you think we   ought to be going       The semiannual Monetary Policy Report     Do you want to vote first?  You haven’t taken the vote yet  "
6230,2001-03-20,  I don’t know  
6231,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming data, while  mixed, have indicated that the economy has been growing at best at  a sluggish pace  Moreover, a number of signs suggest weakness  ahead; downward revisions to sales and earnings forecasts of many  firms point to continued restraint on investment spending, and the  associated decreases in equity prices along with lower consumer  confidence will also be damping consumption demand  Against  this background, outside commentators see you debating between a  50 and a 75 basis point reduction in the target federal funds rate at  this meeting  Primary dealer economists are split close to 50/50 on  which you will choose, and market interest rates now seem to have  built in similar odds as well  I thought I would concentrate my  remarks this morning on this choice          Although the staff forecast assumes a 50 basis point reduction   in the funds rate at this meeting, elements of that forecast provide  good support for the more aggressive action To be sure, most  interest rates--both long- and short-term--already are a percentage  point or more below their average levels in December, before you  started easing, but equity prices have dropped 16 percent since then     3/20/01 80  and the foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen 2 percent  As  a consequence, the amount of financial stimulus in the pipeline to  bolster a rebound in the growth of aggregate demand is much  smaller than might otherwise be expected  Moreover, because  markets are placing some weight on a 75 basis point move, a further  50 basis point reduction in the funds rate at this meeting is unlikely  to boost the stock market, depreciate the dollar, or lower bond  yields     With limited follow-through in financial markets from policy   easing, as Dave has explained, economic growth remains below the  growth of potential in the staff forecast and the unemployment rate  rises rapidly  Although some relief of the labor market pressures of  last spring may not be an entirely unwelcome development, the rise  in the unemployment rate in the staff forecast may be too rapid and  the level too high for you to find desirable  The rate moves above  the NAIRU built into the staff forecast, giving a downward tilt to  core consumer inflation in 2002 and presumably thereafter   Moreover, the Committee may see high odds on even less inflation  pressure than implicit in the staff forecast if it suspects that the  NAIRU may be lower than the staff judges it to be and may prefer  to conduct policy on that working hypothesis until evidence more  strongly suggests otherwise  If you accept the staff’s assessment of  the strength of aggregate demand but do not put a priority at this  time on reducing inflation next year, you might consider the larger,  75 basis point reduction in the funds rate at this meeting to be  appropriate     The argument for such a reduction could be reinforced if the   Committee saw the risks around the staff’s outlook for aggregate  demand to be substantial and asymmetrical toward lower growth   Although the staff forecast incorporates considerable weakness in  high-tech investment, the extent of the shortfalls in sales of such  equipment and the associated earnings revisions and stock price  declines could be indicative of a larger overhang of this capital than  in the staff forecast  Moreover, as pessimism about the earnings  outlook seemed to spread last week beyond the high-tech sector, it  was accompanied by a whiff of a generalized increase in both  perceptions of risk and aversion to taking on risk  If that sentiment  intensified, credit conditions could tighten substantially for many  more US borrowers  Greater risk aversion, and an associated  tendency for contagion from one market to another, might also have  a marked effect internationally, raising risk premiums and reducing  credit availability to governments and private borrowers in  countries in which the fundamental outlook is already being called  into question  This possibility would tend to accentuate the     3/20/01 81  downside risks in the global economy, a source of concern that  Karen has already highlighted      It has been unusual for the Committee to give considerable   weight to the balance of risks, rather than the most likely forecast,  when deciding on its policy stance  In part, that’s because such  skews don’t usually appear large enough to raise significant  concerns relative to the already difficult issues presented by  determining the central tendency of the economic forecast and  settling on an appropriate policy response  Even when the risks are  large, the Committee may recognize that buying protection against  potential developments can have significant and continuing costs in  that such actions foster less desirable outcomes in terms of real  activity or inflation if those potential developments never occur      Finally, there is another approach, albeit not quite as pre-  emptive, that can minimize some of the potential costs when you  see outsized risks on one side  That is to be prepared to respond  rapidly should you get early evidence that the developments that  concern you are in fact materializing  In the current circumstances,  such an approach might argue in favor of a 50 basis point easing but  a willingness to act promptly--even before the next meeting, if  necessary--should, for example, demand show signs of weakening  further or financial markets tighten substantially      In addition, a good bit of the recent evidence on demand and   economic activity may be read as weighing in favor of the less  aggressive 50 basis point alternative  In particular, spending and  employment have held up better than anticipated by the staff in the  January forecast  By themselves, these data indicate stronger  growth than the Greenbook estimate for the first quarter, suggesting  the possibility that the risks may not be all on one side--that  underlying demands may be stronger than in the staff forecast or the  market’s perception and the inventory correction closer to being  completed  Moreover, January data on core consumer prices  highlighted a pattern of acceleration over the last year that could  prove troublesome if the economic rebound were significantly  stronger or faster than in the staff forecast     In financial markets, your easing moves may well be having   more constructive and supportive effects than is apparent by just  focusing on changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and equity  prices  Credit markets have accommodated a large volume of  borrowing, and decreases in bond and mortgage interest rates have  encouraged a considerable lengthening in liability structures, which  will leave both businesses and households less exposed to short-run     3/20/01 82  variations in credit availability  The fact that risk spreads did not  widen much--and not at all until very late in the intermeeting  period--despite ongoing downward revisions to earnings  expectations, may in part be a reflection of declines in long-term  interest rates holding down debt-service burdens and hence  perceptions of borrower risk  Moreover, money growth has been  quite rapid  Some of this growth may be the result of greater  demands for liquidity in an uncertain economy  But, in contrast to  the early 1990s, depositories seem willing to accommodate this  demand and provide credit to borrowers, albeit at somewhat wider  spreads  The opposite outcome--low money growth after decreases  in interest rates--would have been a worrisome sign that income and  spending were falling short of expectations or that depositories were  less willing to carry out their intermediary functions     Finally, the interplay of your actions and market expectations   may also argue on the side of holding the easing action to 50 basis  points  Market participants see a 75 basis point reduction in the  federal funds rate as an alternative partly because, by your actions  in January, you raised the bar for what is considered forceful action   The most important aspect of the market’s expectations is the  overall trajectory of policy actions built into intermediate- and long- term interest rates  If, for now, you are satisfied with the  expectations that are likely to be built into the yield curve after you  move 50 basis points, you can proceed gradually, even if you  suspect that more easing may well be needed at some point  At this  time, markets have priced in a decline in the federal funds rate to  below 4-1/4 percent by the end of the year  Easing by 50 instead of  75 basis points is likely to raise this expected path some, but it is  not likely to change the basic shape  If you think that a decline in  the funds rate of this dimension implies low enough intermediate-  and long-term interest rates to promote sustainable growth, the less  aggressive adjustment should not be a problem     You do need to consider this assessment in light of the drop in   equity prices that likely would follow a 50 basis point easing   Depending in part on the wording of your announcement, it could  be substantial inasmuch as equity market participants seem to be  counting on you to stop the slide  But you also need to consider  how successful an extra 25 basis points is likely to be in that regard   The downward movement in equity prices is primarily a  consequence of disappointing earnings and a better appreciation of  risk, especially in the high-tech sectors  And it is likely to continue  until that disappointment comes to an end, whatever the discount  factors used to value earnings streams  If the drop in equity prices  is substantial after a 50 basis point move, markets will prevent it     3/20/01 83  from tightening overall financial conditions to its full extent,  because they will also price in more ease later          Right     3/20/01 104    I don’t think I have the--  "
6274,2001-05-15,"  I think there has been an interesting disparity over the intermeeting   period between the views of the markets and the views of economists  The markets seem to have   become more optimistic about where the economy is going and its potential for recovery,   whereas the economists--not just the economists in this building, but those on Wall Street as   well--have become a little less optimistic  The market has built in a bottom for the federal funds   rate of somewhere between 375 and 4 percent  The market participants are not even sure that   you’ll need to do the extra 25 basis points and move to 375 percent, should you do 50 basis   points today  But if one looks at the forecasts of economists, many of them have the funds rate   going down to at least 375 percent; very few see the FOMC stopping at 4 percent  There are   many at 375, many at 350, and some as low as 3 percent  I think this difference between   market participants and economists has opened up quite a bit over the intermeeting period  I   believe the market view has been encouraged to a certain extent by the earnings reports of   businesses, which at least were not worse than the downward revised expectations they already   had built in  They’ve reacted a little, as you saw last Friday, to what they viewed as positive   news on sales and consumer confidence  So they seem to be looking for the plus side of the   news for a change instead of the minus side, and they’ve raised their estimate of the low for the   funds rate  I think the rise in rates reflects both real factors and inflation expectations, and that   would be perfectly consistent if the economy is going to be stronger  Particularly if you look at   the TIPS spreads, markets had built in a decline in inflation when they were especially gloomy   about economic prospects, and they’ve taken that decline out  I’m not sure they really are   expecting inflation to rise from here, but I think they’ve taken out what they previously saw as   good odds on a decline     5/15/01     6     Right     Right, but that’s part of that disparity we’re talking about     We have one more issue to consider--currency swaps  "
6275,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman By some measures, the  Committee’s cumulative easing of 200 basis points this year has already  made monetary policy accommodative  The Bluebook highlighted one way  to calibrate that judgment--the level of the real federal funds rate relative to  an estimate of its equilibrium value  The real funds rate is as low as it has  been since mid-1994, and it is at the lower end of a range of plausible  estimates of its equilibrium level  But it has only very recently dipped into  or toward that accommodative zone  The funds rate was restrictive late last  year, and a portion of its subsequent decline was needed to keep up with     5/15/01     73   decreases in the equilibrium rate owing to lower productivity growth and  higher equity premiums          The easing of policy is showing up in other ways in financial markets    Although nominal yields on longer-term Treasury notes and bonds have  risen a bit this year, longer-term borrowing costs for many private borrowers  have dropped appreciably as credit spreads have narrowed; and these costs  have fallen sharply in real terms if inflation expectations have increased by  anything like the amount suggested by the widening spread between  nominal and real yields in the Treasury market  Favorable conditions in  bond markets have stimulated a large volume of issuance, providing  alternative sources of funds for those businesses facing constraints on the  availability of credit in the commercial paper market and, more broadly,  facilitating a strengthening of corporate balance sheets  And the shift  toward policy accommodation has been associated with a considerable  buildup in liquidity on household balance sheets, judging from the sustained  surge in the growth of M2           But these financial conditions do embed expectations of a further   easing of policy  Moreover, the movements of some asset prices, in  particular the decline in equity prices of 6 percent this year and the rise in  the dollar of around 4 percent, have offset a portion of the effects of  monetary easing, reducing the amount of financial stimulus in the pipeline   And, the Greenbook and Dave’s briefing identified a number of forces that  are quite likely to be damping the expansion of aggregate demand relative to  the growth of the economy’s potential, working against the natural tendency  for the economy to respond to relatively easy monetary policy          If the Committee, like the staff, sees a high probability that these   adverse forces will not be dissipating very quickly, then a somewhat more  accommodative policy might well be called for to bolster demand several  quarters out--the time frame in which policy can have an effect  Against  this background, the question for the Committee today would seem to be  how much further policy needs to adjust to take account of declines in the  equilibrium real rate and to become accommodative enough relative to that  rate to foster satisfactory economic performance over time           Several factors might be seen as arguing for implementing a more   cautious approach to further easing at this meeting, by lowering the funds  rate 25 basis points  If productivity growth and equilibrium real rates  remain fairly high, policy is already to the accommodative side  In that  environment, the impulse from previous declines in interest rates, along with  the support to income and profits from continuing technical change, should  bolster the rate of expansion of consumption and investment over time   Moreover, the recent upticks in a number of measures of core inflation may  tend to support the hypothesis that an unemployment rate around 4 percent     5/15/01     74   was perhaps too low to be sustained once productivity growth leveled out   Judging from market measures of inflation compensation, investors do not  see the higher unemployment rates that have come about this year as likely  to produce any decrease in price pressures  In these circumstances it would  be important that the economy not snap back so strongly that labor and  product markets begin to tighten again; indeed, they may need to slacken  further, as in the staff forecast, to avoid a persisting intensification of price  pressures           That markets have built in considerable odds of a further 50 basis   points of easing today and some chance of another 25 basis point decline in  the funds rate by year-end may be more a comment on perceptions of your  policy strategy than on what participants see as desirable to achieve  satisfactory economic outcomes  Markets also have built in a percentage  point of policy tightening in 2002, apparently reflecting optimism about the  resiliency of the economy  Indeed, judging by the rise in equity prices and  bond yields all around the industrial world over the intermeeting period, the  pessimism that has been restraining spending plans may be starting to  dissipate, which would give a further boost to demand  A 25 basis point  easing at this meeting likely would change expectations about policy in the  near term and would raise interest rates along the yield curve somewhat   But in addition, by altering perceptions of the trajectory of your easing, it  could help to damp market reactions to incoming data and reduce the risk  that markets will build in more ease than you would find appropriate  Even  if you suspect that ultimately you will need to ease by a full 50 points but  are far from certain, the smaller action would enable you to accumulate  more evidence about the strength of demand and the response to earlier  easings          If, however, you believe that the forces holding down demand could   well be strong enough to require a more definitively accommodative policy  for a while, you might go ahead with a 50 basis point reduction in the funds  rate at this meeting  The staff forecast would seem to support such an action  as it sees the unemployment rate rising another percentage point even after a  50 basis point easing today  In that forecast, a relatively easy monetary  policy is needed to counter the effects of an adjustment of household and  business spending to the downshift in wealth, income growth, and the  perceived profitability of capital investment--and that adjustment is  expected to be exerting noticeable restraint over some time  Moreover, if  the Committee harbored suspicions that the unemployment rate did not need  to rise so high to contain inflation, 50 basis points would seem justified even  if you see aggregate demand not quite as weak as in the staff forecast          The Committee may be especially inclined to 50 basis points of ease if   it believes that the new-found optimism in markets and the uptick in  consumer confidence could be fragile  With weakness in employment     5/15/01     75   hitting households, and with the full dimensions of the softness in the  demand for certain high-tech equipment still being incorporated into  attitudes and spending plans, the Committee may prefer the potential  stimulus of a small further rally in markets in response to a 50 basis point  reduction to the possible restraint of a backup in interest rates owing to  disappointment with a 25 basis point action  Preferences in this regard  would seem to be consistent with a view that, even after a 50 basis point  easing move, the risks still would be weighted toward economic weakness   Although the 50 basis point action would put policy more definitely into the  accommodative zone, there is little concrete evidence that demand is yet  responding appreciably to previous easings  With sluggish growth likely to  be reducing pressures in labor and product markets in the period just ahead,  inflation should be damped and economic growth below the growth rate of  potential could still be seen as the main risk to satisfactory economic  performance  Judging from the path of expected funds rates built into  markets--encompassing only a moderate further ease and substantial  tightening next year--your aggressive policy actions seem mostly to have  affected very short-term expectations and they have not short-circuited the  potential for financial markets to stabilize the economy as they react to  incoming information  Hence, if you think 50 basis points of ease is quite  likely to be required, there might be little gain to adjusting the tilt of your  actions to a more gradual slope just to affect financial market expectations                    Policy action at this meeting, particularly if you reduce the funds  rate 50 basis points, implies that you will have put in place a very  accommodative policy stance relatively quickly, raising the risk of  policy overshooting  You have, in effect, engaged in somewhat  forward-looking policymaking  Although you waited for definitive  signs of weakness before you began to ease, you have responded to  those signs quite strongly, relying more on forecasts that the forces at  work will persist than on actual output and inflation data to key the  cumulative size of your moves  And, you have continued to ease  before seeing how the economy was responding to your previous  actions  Front-loading actions--either tightening or easing--should help  to stabilize the economy, provided the shifts in demand or supply occur  as you anticipate, or at least policy reacts “promptly and forcefully”  when circumstances change  It will be especially important to continue  to be forward-looking as policy becomes more accommodative  You  may well need to stop easing even as the economy continues to  demonstrate signs of softness, and you may need to tighten promptly  once growth shows more definite indications of picking up  This would  be a different pattern than policy has often followed in the past, but it  would be consistent with your actions to date and with the arguments  you have made for a less gradual policy strategy  Thank you, Mr  Chairman            5/15/01     76     I happen to have something handy, just in case!  This one modifies the   end of that sentence at the bottom of page 1  It says  “Although measured productivity growth   stalled in the first quarter, the impressive underlying rate of increase that developed in recent   years appears to be largely intact, which together with the effects of lower interest rates this year   should support economic growth over time”     May or June  "
6325,2001-06-26," The data I remember seeing through April--I don’t know that we have   shipments data through May--from several large banks that specialize in this kind of activity did   not show any pickup in net shipments to any of these countries  We looked specifically for that    Now it’s very early before the launch of the euro currency, and the anecdotal stories are already   starting Nevertheless, we couldn’t really see any evidence of that in the shipments data      In some of the papers you’ve received over the years, and in the   Bluebook this time, I think there are some hints of that  The model’s estimates of the effect of   trend productivity growth on r*, the real federal funds rate, are more than one-for-one because of   the big effects on demand  The supply effects on equity prices, on expected income, and   expected earnings have a significant impact on demand for consumption and investment  So in   the model, unless it’s changed of late, a 1 percentage point increase in trend productivity growth   gives us an r* that is about 13 or 14 percentage points higher, and obviously vice versa for a   reduction in productivity growth This is reflected to a certain extent in Charts 6 and 7 of the              6/26-27/01 30   Bluebook Those charts simulate higher and lower productivity growth  They don’t extend long   enough in time to give us a true trend  But if you look, for example, at the surge in structural   labor productivity chart, the real funds rate levels out at  4-1/2 percent in “the perfect foresight”   case--the dotted red line The difference between these is about 1-1/2 percentage points, I guess,   but it doesn’t go to equilibrium  But you can see there that even in a few years the perfect   foresight model takes the real rate up to about 4-1/2 percent whereas the productivity slump case   has the rate at about 4 percent, and I think it would continue to come down  That’s not as much   as the 1 point change, but it gives you some sense of what’s going on  A productivity change   certainly does feed through into effects on r*    Do you want me to say a few words about the statement?    In response to the discussion at the last meeting, Chairman Greenspan    thought it might be wise to make a few changes with regard to the statement released after   Committee meetings  One is to have a little more structured discussion by having me introduce   the statement and the thinking behind its wording Second, we wanted to give all of you a little   more time to read it and react  Third, in response to your request at the last meeting, it has been   shortened substantially  We did so primarily by referring to a continuation of recent patterns,   which meant that we didn't have to refer to all the pieces of those patterns, just the main parts    That was our thinking behind the second full paragraph  The statement does refer to the 275   basis points of easing to date, which was intended to send the message that the Committee     6/26-27/01 154   recognizes that it has eased a great deal so far  There is no reference to “monitoring carefully,”   wording some market participants are looking for as a signal that over this eight-week   intermeeting period the Committee will be on high alert to respond to incoming data  So, that is   not in there  And finally, we tied the productivity trends and their implications for the longer-run   outlook to the statement about the balance of risks in the foreseeable future  So there is a bit of a   contrast between the longer-term prospects for productivity growth in the economy and the   shorter-term risks for the foreseeable future    I’m not so bold as to make that interpretation    Let me remind you that any revisions to your individual forecasts should   be submitted to Dave Stockton by July 6     6/26-27/01 156  "
6326,2001-06-26," I would say that the unified budget surplus forecasts in the Greenbook   suggest that on a not seasonally adjusted basis the third quarter is about in balance and the fourth   quarter is a slight surplus But the seasonal pattern this year isn’t significantly different from   other years, aside from the $38 billion outflow  Last year, almost the entire surplus occurred in   the second quarter, of course, because that's when the personal tax receipts come in  So, the basic   pattern isn't that different this year, aside from the $38 billion going out in rebates in the third   quarter     6/26-27/01 69  "
6327,2001-06-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts  in the “Longer-Term Strategies” section of the Bluebook  In the current  circumstances, the question of what the Committee should do today may  seem more tightly linked than usual to some of the issues discussed in that  section The Committee has eased substantially in a relatively short period  of time, leaving the stance of policy by some measures at its most  accommodative since the early 1990s, when the unemployment rate was  much higher And financial market participants believe your most likely  policy going forward will entail further reductions in interest rates followed  not long after by a reversal of a substantial portion of your easing--not a  common pattern of market expectations for policy        The baseline simulation, shown on chart 4 following page 6, highlights  several important implications of the staff forecast for policy strategy  First,  given the staff’s assessment of the longer-run attributes of the economy, the  stance of policy is now accommodative, in the sense that if the real and  nominal federal funds rates are held indefinitely at current levels the  economy will eventually produce beyond its potential and inflation will rise   As a consequence, although there is slack in the economy at the end of the  Greenbook forecast horizon, it would disappear quickly, and policy would  have to be tightened at some point, on the order of 1-1/2 percentage points,  to avoid having prices accelerate The temporary forces restraining demand  in the near term, though, are so strong and persistent that the tightening can  be delayed for some time without resulting in inflation rising from recent  levels        As you can see from chart 5 after page 7, the properties of the economy  embedded in the staff forecast and model are such that, to hold PCE inflation  around its recent rates, a path similar in contour to the baseline is delivered  both by simple policy rules, such as the Taylor rule plotted in blue, and by a  more complicated process, such as what we have dubbed “perfect foresight,”  shown by the dotted red line That latter policy is constructed on the  assumption that the policymaker has full information about prospective  economic tendencies, as given in the Greenbook and its extension, and full  knowledge of the dynamics of the economy  Given the current forecast, the  policymaker responds actively and forcefully to near-term economic     6/26-27/01 129   weakness, even in the knowledge that the funds rate is being reduced to well  below equilibrium values and will need to be raised substantially in the  future In the context of this simulation, lowering and then raising that rate  in a short period isn’t “overshooting”  It’s a rational response to the  circumstances--a response that takes full account of the forecast and, on the  assumption that the forecast embodies a correct evaluation of the economy,  will work better than other policies to stabilize economic activity while  keeping inflation low This policy both rationalizes the prompt action we  have already seen and produces a substantial reversal beginning next year,  although nowhere near as pronounced as currently anticipated in financial  market prices        Of course, these implications are sensitive to a number of judgments that  form the basis for the staff forecast  Charts 6 and 7 focus on a key judgment  related to your discussion yesterday--the rate of growth of structural  productivity Chart 6, following page 8, examines the consequences of a  prompt return to the rate of structural productivity growth of the last few  years--in effect assuming that the recent slowdown is quite temporary   Interestingly, such an assumption produces results for interest rates that look  closer to those embedded in financial markets than does the staff forecast,  particularly so with the “perfect foresight” policy  With aggregate demand  boosted by the more rapid expansion of earnings and income, the rise in  interest rates needs to begin sooner and to be larger than in the baseline to  avoid longer-run inflationary instabilities, even though inflation would be  restrained in the short term by better-behaved unit labor costs than in the  baseline        In the experiment run for chart 7, structural productivity growth falls  another 3/4 percentage point, leading to growth in potential output at a rate  only modestly above its average of the 1970s and ’80s  This is the reverse  of the experience of the late 1990s and is accompanied not only by slower  growth, but also by a much more unfavorable short-run relationship between  the unemployment rate and inflation  The Taylor rule and the perfect  foresight policies, putting some weight on both output and inflation  stabilization, allow unemployment to run above its long-run NAIRU and  inflation above its implicit target  Just as real and nominal federal funds  rates had to rise in the higher productivity growth scenario, with lower  productivity growth they have to fall to achieve a short-run balance between  these adverse outcomes        As these simulations illustrate, your decision about the funds rate today  will depend on your assessments of the underlying trends in the economy,  the extent of the shocks causing the economy to deviate from those trends,  and the strength of the countervailing force of expansionary monetary and  fiscal policies     6/26-27/01 130        Suppose you see underlying productivity trends as likely to be quite  strong but not accelerating and the unemployment rate therefore as needing  to rise appreciably to get to a more sustainable level  If in addition you see  the restraining effects of inventory, capital stock, and household saving rate  adjustments as leveling out soon and beginning to dissipate on balance  before long and you view policy as already sufficiently accommodative to  counteract the effects of these restraints on demand, you might want to  consider holding the stance of policy steady at this meeting  In the staff’s  forecast, at the present federal funds rate, the economic adjustments in train  result in a rise in the unemployment rate that neutralizes the intensifying cost  pressures inherent in the cessation of productivity acceleration  Core PCE  inflation is capped, though at a level in 2002 that is a bit above its average  from 1997 through 2000  With expected inflation perhaps already near the  upper bound of what many members might consider acceptable, and policy  needing to be tightened at some point to keep it from rising further, the  Committee might see additional easing as tipping the balance away from  risks of near-term weakness toward longer-term inflation  Concerns on this  score might be accentuated if the Committee felt that reversing policy  direction in an environment of moderate growth and higher unemployment  rates would not turn out to be nearly as frictionless as in the statistical rules  and models        However, keeping policy unchanged would seem to require a degree of  confidence that interest rates are low enough to foster an adequate rebound  in economic growth before very long, or at least that the risks around such  an outcome are reasonably balanced  In that regard, the experience of the  recent intermeeting period of disappointing data on demand and downward  revisions to forecasts may suggest that the risks to these forecasts are still  substantially weighted to the downside  Soft economic data and reductions  in expected corporate earnings also have eroded the market optimism that  seemed to be taking hold over the previous intermeeting period, resulting in  declines in equity prices and bond yields  And the downward revisions in  expectations and their effects on asset prices have not been confined to the  United States, raising the possibility that a weakening global outlook will  impinge on US exports, especially with dollar strength persisting  Against  this background, the considerable surprise that would result in markets were  the Committee to leave policy unchanged could have quite a negative effect  on attitudes and asset prices, damping the rebound in economic activity        The revisions in economic forecasts and market expectations may imply  that, in effect, policy is not as stimulative or the forces restraining spending  are somewhat stronger than you--and financial market participants--had  anticipated at your last meeting  The gap between the actual real federal  funds rate and the range of equilibrium real rates shown in the Bluebook  may overstate the degree of accommodation now implied by the stance of  policy For one, if the NAIRU is lower than embedded in the staff forecast,     6/26-27/01 131   the equilibrium rate will also be lower, and the economy will be able to  accommodate a stronger rebound to a high level of production without  generating inflation In the staff model, the effects of alternative NAIRU  assumptions are not trivial--about 1/2 percentage point on r* for every  percentage point on NAIRU For another, the federal funds rate in this  exercise serves as a proxy for a broad array of interest rates and asset prices  along the transmission channels  In fact, in this episode the dollar has  firmed and stock prices have declined appreciably since last fall  With some  of the traditional financial transmission channels blocked, the real funds rate  may be overstating the amount of monetary stimulus “in the pipeline”        In addition, many bond rates, while dropping substantially last fall in  anticipation of policy easing, have risen slightly on balance since late  March The behavior of these rates appears to stem largely from the  market’s view that the economy is poised to snap back sufficiently strongly  to require a firming of policy next year  While you may want to give some  weight in your decision to the possibility that these expectations are correct,  the potential for a backup in bond yields should you ease does not imply that  reducing the federal funds rate would be ineffective or counter-productive  and should not deter you from taking an action you otherwise thought  necessary For one, a failure to ease would probably produce substantial  declines in equity prices and increases in interest rates, tightening financial  conditions considerably In addition, were the economy to turn out to be  much less robust than market participants seem to expect, long-term rates  would ultimately adjust to the easier stance of policy  In these  circumstances, waiting until economic weakness showed through into lower  long-term rates and created apparently more receptive market conditions for  policy ease would only accentuate the economic weakness your easing  would be designed to address        If you thought that resource utilization was likely to be on a considerably  lower track than needed to contain inflation, you might consider a 50 basis  point reduction in the target federal funds rate at this meeting  Such a  judgment might follow from perceptions of downside risks to the staff  forecast of demand, arising for example from the possibility of a substantial  decline in equity prices, as earnings disappoint further  Or that judgment  might follow from a sense that the staff has underestimated the contribution  of added flexibility in labor markets to reducing the long-run NAIRU and  containing cost pressure A 50 basis point reduction would be a little more  than is now incorporated in financial market prices  The best bet is that  equity prices would rise, but the reaction of long-term interest rates is harder  to predict Even if they should increase, the net effect on financial  conditions of your action is likely to be stimulative Any rise in real long- term rates would probably be a response to an outsized gain in equity prices   If the economy turned out as weak and price pressures as damped as the  expectations that led the Committee to choose this option, any increase in     6/26-27/01 132   long-term nominal rates from higher inflation expectations should be short- lived         If, however, you thought that after your previous actions this year the  risks on economic growth and inflation were not so one-sided and you  suspected that policy was already close to sufficiently accommodative to  foster an adequate pickup in growth, a 25 basis point easing would be more  appropriate In light of the uncertainties, such an action would give you  greater assurance that financial conditions were supportive of a satisfactory  strengthening in demand late this year and early 2002  Even if you thought  more easing might well be needed at some point, with real interest rates  already relatively low, the Committee might see substantial gains from  shifting to a more gradual pace to allow more time to calibrate policy to the  emerging effects of earlier monetary and fiscal actions, as well as the  evolution of demands for capital goods and pressures on costs and prices  A  25 basis point easing would be less than the markets are anticipating   Declines in stock prices and increases in bond rates are likely, but such  movements would be limited to the extent that market participants did not  see you making major shifts in your reactions and intentions, but only  changing the trajectory of easing and becoming a bit more cautious  If the  action and its accompanying announcement, however, is seen as signaling  your intent to end the easing cycle at this time and to respond considerably  less forcefully to unexpected economic weakness in the future, the decline in  asset prices could be substantial        Whatever your policy choice for the federal funds rate, market reactions  will be affected also by your choice of balance of risks language in the  announcement  At your last meeting, several of you remarked that this  meeting might be time to consider shifting that language to indicate the risks  were balanced In the Bluebook, however, we assumed that you would  retain language indicating that the balance of risks was weighted toward  economic weakness  With incoming information still quite soft and  suggesting that economic growth stalled in recent months, and with forecasts  inside and outside the Federal Reserve being revised down, the balance of  risks seems to us still to be weighted in that direction  In those  circumstances, short-term risks of weakness may still seem to be a  potentially more important influence on policy, at least for now, than longer- term concerns about inflation    I think there would be a considerable reaction for the following reasons    Markets, although they have an eventual upturn in rates built in, also have 50 or more basis   points of further ease built in Assuming you accompany that statement with, say, a 25 basis   point cut, they would be taking out that other 25 plus basis points of ease  And I think they   would also see you as tying your hands to a certain extent--as indeed it would be your intent to   do--in terms of your response to incoming data  You would be saying that the data could be   weak and you might not respond to that--that you intend to be less active in your responses  In   my view, that would affect not only asset prices, bond yields, and equity prices, but expectations   as new data came in  How markets will respond to new data on employment and sales and output   would be affected because they would see you as responding less to those data  So I think there   would be some immediate effect as well as a continuing effect over time    The balance of risk statement toward weakness would help take away   from the reaction I described to a certain extent You've raised a complicated thought in terms of   how the Committee might want to try to nuance its posture to the markets  To make the markets   understand that you are changing your posture is going to be very, very difficult to convey in the   press statement, particularly one that we've attempted to shorten this time in response to the     6/26-27/01 134   Committee’s request last time  This is something that perhaps the Chairman might address in his   testimony, but I think it would be very hard to do in today’s announcement  I believe the   immediate market reaction would be fairly strong to a statement that rather explicitly indicates   that you thought you’ve done all the easing you needed to do    Right    Well, yes, though it depends on how much you would lower the natural   rate They wouldn't offset entirely  If I may, I’d like to amend my remarks to President   Broaddus yesterday, when I said that the tradeoff might be a little more than one-for-one  In   checking with the modeling folks this morning, they said it was about one-for-one in terms of a        6/26-27/01 135   percentage point of productivity growth and a percentage point on r* over a longer term--five to   ten years--from where r* is now  So it depends on how you mix and match this  And, as I just   noted, in terms of the NAIRU it's about one-half point for one point  The long-run NAIRU   embedded in these forecasts is 5-1/2 percent So if you thought the NAIRU was 5 percent, you   could take 1/4 point off the equilibrium real rate, and that would offset to a certain extent the 3/4   point increase that we have in productivity growth  But you would have to have a rather low   NAIRU--I haven’t done the exact arithmetic, but a NAIRU of about 4 percent, I guess--to offset   entirely the effects of the higher productivity growth    The money and credit aggregates tell me that we are not facing   blockages in the financial markets  As President Poole noted, credit is freely available to   creditworthy corporations Now the spreads, certainly on junk bonds and on marginally   investment-grade credits, are very, very high by historical standards  So money is available, but   it's costly  The cost of capital has been raised for those borrowers, but the money is there  And I   think the Committee's easing this year has certainly facilitated a restructuring of balance sheets    The volume of bond issuance has been huge  Corporations that can access the markets have   been able to strengthen their balance sheets, and that's obviously a positive element going   forward     6/26-27/01 136   On the money side, money growth has been very, very strong  Some of it we can   explain just by the usual responses to declines in interest rates, the usual fluctuations in velocity   as opportunity costs change But money growth is much stronger than that  In our analysis we   thought some special factors were at work, such as mortgage refinancing and a few things like   that In addition, our view is that the volatility and less favorable performance of the equity   markets has probably led households to shift away a bit from equity investments and into M2  So   there has been a shift in the demand for money  That shift by itself wouldn't suggest strength   going forward; it's a shift in the demand curve  But once again, like the credit flows, I think it   suggests that there is ample liquidity out there, so financial concerns and liquidity concerns   shouldn't be holding the economy back  Whether there will be a stimulus going forward more   than is indicated by the interest rates, I don’t know  I have some questions about whether   demand for money is stable enough to draw that conclusion  But I think it's supportive; it's   helpful for sure    Right    Whether they're seeing inflationary pressure or real pressure I think is a   very difficult question As some of you have remarked and as we noted in our briefing yesterday,   it’s very hard to parse the recent rise in rates between inflation and real rates  Although the TIPS   market tends to suggest that on balance since the end of March there has been a bit of a rise in   inflation expectations, there’s very little corroborating evidence of that  Governor Gramlich   himself noted that there’s no such evidence in commodity prices, surveys, or in the behavior of   the dollar After all, if there were an increase in inflation expectations, one would think that   would not be a favorable environment for dollar assets  That should be causing some pulling   back from investments into the United States But the continued strength in the dollar--though   that’s relative to the really poor performance in other countries perhaps--does suggest that people   haven’t lost confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to keep inflation contained at   reasonable levels despite what the TIPS spreads might be doing    So, the markets may well be expecting a little more inflation--a bit more than they   were anticipating a few months ago when they expected it to decline--but they probably reflect   more a sense that activity is going to bounce back and that real rates will be rising  And I think   markets do expect the Federal Reserve to respond promptly  You’ve responded very promptly-­  and “forcefully” as you like to say--with a decline in rates  And, gratifyingly, they’ve built in a   certain symmetry to that  Obviously, as a number of you remarked, they seem to have a more   optimistic view of the situation than economists do both inside and outside this building  But I   do believe they expect you to begin to tighten and cut off inflationary impulses pretty quickly     6/26-27/01 138  "
6382,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of you remarked at the  Committee’s June meeting and again today, the special characteristics  of the current slowdown are shaping the appropriate course of monetary  policy and its likely effects     8/21/01 60   In particular, the major driver in this slowdown seems to have been  a re-evaluation of the profitability of new capital equipment--especially  high-tech equipment  In these circumstances, lower interest rates are  likely to cushion the resulting decline in investment demand only very  partially Importantly, though, policy easing works through the  household sector, with lower interest rates bolstering asset prices and  wealth and giving more direct incentives to spend by reducing the cost  of acquiring houses and household durable goods  Policy action may  also help to maintain consumer confidence  Judging from the prices of  houses and from activity in housing markets, and from the well  maintained pace of consumer durable purchases, in this regard to date  your easing actions are indeed having much of their predicted and  intended effects And lower interest rates undoubtedly are keeping  equity prices from falling much more as earnings disappoint  By  bolstering household spending, policy is laying the foundation for a  recovery in capital and inventory investment, working indirectly  through multiplier and accelerator mechanisms     But some of the characteristics of the current episode do suggest  that the 275 basis points of policy easing so far may not produce the  same degree of strengthening in aggregate demand, at least for a time,  as a movement of similar size might have in the past  It is not that  policy has been ineffective--that you are “pushing on a string”  Rather,  declines in interest rates have been operating against some powerful  and unusual forces of restraint The re-evaluation of capital  profitability seems to be producing a larger and more persistent  decrease in investment spending than in most business cycles  And the  large revisions to expected profits are reducing equity prices despite  lower interest rates Moreover, because high-tech production is spread  widely around the world, so too has been the drop-off in demand,  output, and equity wealth With other economies also threatened, the  dollar has not depreciated in response to policy easing so that foreign  economies have not absorbed any of the weakening in demand in the  United States through the exchange rate channel  Finally, because  household spending was never substantially depressed, stocks of houses  and consumer durables probably have not dropped below desired  levels This implies that the recovery in spending once the economy  starts to firm may be less ebullient than usual, since it will lack the  extra push from the so-called pent-up demand from households often  seen in the past   In these circumstances, the federal funds rate may need to be lower  for longer than you might have anticipated to produce a return to  sustainable growth at around the economy’s potential   These unusual restraining forces are partly impounded in our     8/21/01 61   measures of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, which as a result  have declined appreciably over the last year  Hence, a portion of the  decrease in the federal funds rate has been necessary just to keep policy  from tightening relative to this yardstick  But our measures of r* in  general do not reflect the full extent of these restraints on spending   The equilibrium rate we have been estimating is a medium-term  concept--the real federal funds rate at which the economy eventually  will produce at its potential after temporary shocks have worn off  Thus, temporary shocks, such as atypical asset price movements or  weak investment relative to its longer-term trend, tend not to be  embodied in some or all of the measures we use  If those shocks are  large or persistent, as they seem to be at this time, real rates will need to  be held appreciably below the range of estimated equilibrium rates for a  while to foster satisfactory economic performance  Moreover, you may  have reason to believe that the true range for r* is lower than that given  in the Bluebook Most of those estimates rely on the staff’s judgment  about the NAIRU  If unemployment rates appreciably below 5-1/4  percent are sufficient to contain inflation, the equilibrium rate will be  lower and the gap between it and the current real funds rate  correspondingly smaller   A policy that eases substantially and leaves the funds rate well  below the estimated equilibrium is not without potential risks and  drawbacks that a number of you also noted at the last meeting  Some of  you regretted the degree and frequency of variation in the federal funds  rate adjustments You were concerned, in part, that wide swings in the  policy instrument would themselves create uncertainty and unsettle  markets  But, appropriately calibrated, changes in the funds rate act as  shock absorbers, cushioning the effects of real-side disturbances on  aggregate output and prices And the larger the shocks, the larger the  necessary movements in your policy instrument  To be sure, policy can  be excessively activist, accentuating business cycles by reacting to  perceived shocks that in practice ebb quickly or by being insufficiently  forward looking But the most serious problems have occurred when  policy has been too sluggish--destabilizing the economy and financial  markets by allowing inflationary or deflationary tendencies to cumulate  because the central bank acted too little  This is a major lesson that  your predecessors took from their experience in the 1970s and that  many observers have drawn from the tepid response of the Bank of  Japan in the early 1990s to the bursting of the asset bubble   A potentially more troublesome concern raised by having the real  federal funds rate well below its equilibrium level is whether policy can  be tightened in a timely enough manner to forestall the emergence of  higher inflation In the current circumstances, inflation pressures that  might be difficult to head off could arise were demand to strengthen     8/21/01 62   very considerably before long or costs begin to push up prices even in a  relatively weak economy Other things equal, the wider the federal  funds rate gap, the greater this risk would seem to be  And balancing  this possibility against the possibility that the weakness in the economy  could be deeper or more prolonged than anticipated or than needed to  keep inflation in check would seem to be at the nub of your decision  today   The staff forecast could be seen as describing a rough balance  between these two possibilities, at an unchanged stance of policy  In  that forecast, policy is accommodative enough to get growth in GDP  back to the rate of increase in its potential by next year, with the help of  fiscal stimulus, lower energy prices, and the inherent tendency of  aggregate demand to expand at its longer-term growth rate  As Dave  Wilcox emphasized, though projected growth of actual output has been  revised down appreciably in the forecast, so too has been the growth of  potential, leaving the output gap and the inflation outlook not much  different than in the June Greenbook While the result is a small  margin of excess capacity in the labor markets in the second half of  next year, with unit labor costs already having picked up, some slack  may be needed insurance to counter the price pressures associated with  the more rapid trend in compensation, the recent slowing of structural  productivity growth, and the consequent narrowing of profit margins   Core PCE inflation is held about constant in the staff forecast, at a rate  a little above that of 1998 and 1999  In your own forecasts last month  for the semiannual monetary policy report, Committee members saw  much stronger growth and lower unemployment rates than did the staff  Especially if that differential continues to prevail, the Committee may  see further easing as incurring enough additional risk of building  inflation pressures toward the end of 2002 to offset the added assurance  it would give of a reasonable rebound in growth earlier next year    However, keeping rates unchanged may require more confidence  in the forecast--your own or the staff’s--than the Committee has at this  point You eased at your last meeting, partly on the assessment that  more weight should be put on the reality of near-term weakness than on  the projection of longer-term strength  Continuing and persistent  shortfalls in actual growth, even relative to downward-revised  forecasts, may have reinforced that assessment, arguing for another 25  basis points of easing at this meeting  In effect, the anticipated pickup  in the economy is starting from a lower base  Moreover, a number of  elements in the current situation could be seen as suggesting that the  risks of further shortfalls in economic activity in the next few quarters  are greater than the risks of higher inflation later next year  Data and  anecdotes on capital spending have yet to indicate any abatement in the  pace of weakening in this sector or to allow a confident projection of     8/21/01 63   just how far the decline in investment will go  As Vince pointed out,  revisions to growth in foreign economies, like those for the United  States, have been one-sided And consumption is threatened by the  effects of softening job prospects on confidence and by the possibility  of a further drop in equity prices if earnings expectations continue to be  pared Indeed, late last week, announcements of disappointing earnings  and sales caused a further appreciable decline in equity prices and a  widening of risk spreads in credit markets   In light of near-term weakness, the Committee may see any  potential inflation pressures as sufficiently far into the future to allow it  to detect early signs that growth was accelerating or prices picking up  and take timely steps, even after further easing  This seems consistent  with market assessments of your likely actions and their outcome   Market participants have built further near-term easing into the  structure of interest rates but also tightening next year  That turnaround  apparently is seen as occurring soon enough to keep inflation low,  judging from the results of surveys of inflation expectations or from the  relatively modest level of longer-term inflation expectations derived  from Treasury securities, which in fact have been declining of late  In  that regard, both market participants and economic forecasters appear  to have marked down their outlooks for growth and inflation in the last  month, largely in response to the unexpected weakness in demand and  more moderate inflation  The resulting drop in interest rates and the  exchange rate should help to cushion the effect of lower equity prices  on economic activity  Keeping the stance of policy unchanged at this  meeting would tend to lower equity prices further and raise bond  yields--a result the Committee might not want to see unless it were of  the view that market participants had reacted inappropriately to the  developing economic situation   Given the tenor of the incoming information, with economic  activity falling short of expectations and projections of growth revised  downward, the Bluebook writers assumed that you would judge the  balance of risks as still tilted toward economic weakness, even if you  left policy unchanged at this meeting  At some point in the future,  when the Committee sees the risk of near-term weakness as balanced  by the risk of higher inflation over the longer term, it would presumably  want to shift its balance of risk statement and explain its reasoning in  the announcement  One path to that point would be a final easing that  was perceived to put policy in a sufficiently accommodative posture to  throw the risks into balance  Alternatively, the Committee might retain  its assessment of unbalanced risks for a little while even after it stopped  easing because it was not yet confident that threats of added weakness  had abated sufficiently  This latter sequence would be consistent with  your behavior in 2000 when you were concerned about inflation  In     8/21/01 64   effect, by the summer of last year, you still saw the risks as pointing to  higher inflation, but not by enough to warrant changing the stance of  policy Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6429,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As noted in the  Committee’s announcement of two weeks ago, the terrorist attacks   subjected an already weak economy to a further downward shock    Just before September 11th aggregate demand apparently was still   being impeded by an ongoing downdraft in investment, as firms   corrected a previous over-expansion of capital equipment, and the   resulting decline in employment and equity prices threatened to sap   consumer spending  As noted in the Greenbook, firm evidence that   the downdraft was beginning to abate had not emerged and the   economic forecast probably would again have been marked down and   the anticipated strengthening pushed further into the future The   attacks themselves disrupted business transactions for a time and   apparently have heightened concerns about the future, likely   restraining spending even more and further delaying the resumption   of solid growth    A significant easing of financial conditions would seem to be   called for to counter the effects of the unexpected weakness in   demand from these various sources  While such an easing might have   little effect on the near-term performance of the economy, it would   appropriately give added impetus to an eventual return to full   resource utilization When the economy ultimately strengthens, it   seems inevitable that it will resume growth from a base of an  appreciably lower level of resource utilization than today or than you   might have expected at your August meeting        Yet financial conditions have not eased appreciably since late   August The pullback of investors in the face of perceptions of higher   risk and weaker spending prospects apparently has offset the effects   of the 50 basis points of easing you put in place two weeks ago and   the further federal funds rate reductions now built into financial   market prices  Broad measures of equity prices have fallen 10 to 20   percent since the August FOMC meeting and risk spreads have   widened for all but the highest-rated businesses  Indeed, bond rates   for many businesses are unchanged or even up considerably  In   addition, the average value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets   has appreciated slightly    With markets strongly anticipating a further decrease in your   federal funds rate target at this meeting, holding policy unchanged      10/2/01 76   likely would tighten financial conditions substantially  Thus, the  question facing you today would seem to be not whether to ease  further, but by how much  Market observers believe that your debate  will be between 25 and 50 basis point reductions in the funds rate   The choice between these two would seem to depend not only on the  most likely outcome for the economy under the two alternatives, but  the risks around that modal outcome and the costs of missing to one  side or the other   The choice of a 25 basis point easing would be justified by  concern that a larger action at this time could lead to policy becoming  so accommodative over coming months that the rebound in demand  beginning next year would be sharp enough to add to inflation  pressures before a policy reversal could contain them effectively  A  major uncertainty in the outlook is the stance of fiscal policy  Unless  signs surface very quickly that near-term economic distress is abating,  a process of political compromise by inclusion could well produce a  substantially more expansive policy than is built into the staff  forecast When the resulting stimulus will hit the economy depends,  of course, on the nature of the programs that are enacted  As next  year goes on, however, aggregate demand could well be boosted by  the effects of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies just as the  internal dynamics of strengthening private demand take hold  following the working down of inventory and investment goods  overhangs   Private demand also may be subject to upside as well as to the  numerous downside risks  One possibility is that a good part of the  cutback in spending in the last few weeks will turn out to be  transitory  As the nature of the countermeasures against terrorism  becomes clearer and more focused, as some successes are registered  and security in the air and elsewhere is improved, uncertainty will  narrow and some of the initial fears and perceptions of risk will  decrease, fostering a return toward less distorted economic  interactions and decisions The rise in equity prices and decline in  risk premiums over the last week may already have reflected some  movement in this direction  Should activity rebound fairly strongly  next year, upward pressures on wages and prices are likely to emerge  at considerably lower levels of resource utilization than in the second  half of the 1990s The slower growth of structural productivity that  seems to be in train would tend to boost unit labor costs at a time  when profit margins have already been squeezed  Slimmer margins  provide considerable inducement for businesses to pass labor costs  through into prices and are likely to mute the competitive forces that  make such a pass-through difficult, especially if, at the same time,     10/2/01 77   higher real interest rates induced by expansive fiscal policy militate  against cost-saving capital deepening   Although markets would be somewhat disappointed by a 25 basis  point reduction in the federal funds rate target, the backup in other  interest rates and the decline in equity prices likely would be limited  by a sense that the FOMC was simply waiting for more definitive  evidence of the dimensions of the response of demand to the attacks  and was prepared to ease further, even within the intermeeting period,  should the emerging information warrant  The total amount of  additional ease built into the structure of market interest rates---now  between 75 and 100 basis points--probably would be trimmed only a  little You may see these expectations as a reasonable assessment of  the amount of ease needed to promote a satisfactory strengthening of  the economy in 2002 and 2003  You may also see the resulting  expectations as representing a highly likely policy outcome as well  after a 25 basis point reduction at this meeting, given the possibility  of further Committee actions as employment and production decline  over the next several months    But given the shocks to the economy and the absence of any  apparent easing in financial conditions noted at the beginning of my  discussion, the Committee may prefer a more aggressive policy action  and want to lower the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this  meeting The potential for inflation pressures to mount as the  economy rebounds must be weighed against the likelihood of a  prolonged period of weakness that opens up a sizable output gap  Indeed, the baseline forecast in the Greenbook describes the latter  outcome  While that forecast assumes 50 basis points of easing over  the fourth quarter, its assessment of likely demand and resource  pressures would seem to suggest that an immediate reduction in the  federal funds rate of 50 basis points would run minimal risk of higher  inflation emerging before countervailing policy action had a chance  to be felt And, as shown in an alternative Greenbook simulation,  stronger fiscal stimulus does not materially deflect the economy from  the disinflationary track of the baseline projection     If the headwinds facing the economy for a time are on the order of  magnitude of those embodied in the staff forecast, a federal funds rate  that is 50 basis points lower would not be all that accommodative  In  real terms, such a rate would still be positive by many measures and  above its level in previous periods of economic weakness--for example  the early 1990s With limited net financial stimulus in the pipeline  even under this easier alternative, recovery importantly depends on the  resiliency of the private economy as excesses are worked down and  underlying investment incentives remain in place, with an extra push     10/2/01 78   from fiscal policy  Easier monetary policy itself can’t address the  underlying uncertainties and overhangs weighing on demand, but it  can help to buoy asset prices and lower the cost of credit at least a little  relative to a smaller easing move     Moreover, in an uncertain environment, the larger action avoids  the potential for especially adverse effects on confidence and risk- taking were the Committee seen to be less aggressive than  anticipated For this and other reasons, you may judge the probability  that insufficiently accommodative policy would accentuate a process  of progressive economic weakening that would be difficult to reverse  as appreciably larger in the current circumstances than the probability  that too stimulative a policy would intensify inflation pressures    Saving policy “ammunition” for later could create a situation in  which much more easing is required before long to counter  cumulating weakness  Of course, anticipatory and aggressive policy  can lead to overshooting, but, by heading off worsening situations, it  also is likely to require smaller total action than does policy that  moves more gradually   Market participants are likely to build in only a little, if any,  more easing going forward should you lower the funds rate by 50  basis points at this meeting, given the high odds they have already put  on this action And their expectations of such a sizable move at this  meeting have not led them to anticipate a number of further such  declines in the future  The yield curve incorporates an additional 25  to 50 basis points of rate reductions by early next year followed by a  subsequent rise in rates  Financial market participants evidently  believe that you can ease aggressively and then stop and reverse in a  timely fashion  Judging from the decline in TIPS spreads in recent  weeks, the stickiness of long-term rates has been a response to more  expansive fiscal policy rather than a reflection of rising inflation  expectations as the path of the funds rate has been marked down    Although a cut in the federal funds rate target at this meeting  would bring the cumulative change in this rate to 100 or 125 basis  points since late August, you may well see the risks to your objectives  in the foreseeable future as still tilted toward economic weakness   Economic activity is almost certain to be quite soft in the near term,  and the Committee would probably want evidence on the likely extent  of the cutback in private demand and the impetus from fiscal policy  before it could judge that this weakness was likely to be balanced by  a strong rebound a few quarters hence    I think the range is particularly wide because the staff forecast is   dragging down the lower end of that range  The calculated equilibrium rates that tended   to bring the range down are the ones that include the staff estimates of the restraining   effects of both the pre-September 11th and post-September 11th shocks to demand  If you   think the staff forecast is a reasonable estimate of where the economy will go--or at least   a reasonable mode of that estimate--then something toward the lower end of that range   probably is where you would think the rate is  Also, having the third-quarter inflation-   indexed security at a 38 percent real rate doesn’t reflect the most recent declines in that   rate That rate has declined some over the third quarter and I don’t know what the   forward rate derived from that would look like if we did it today  My guess is that it   would be at least a number of tenths lower than shown in this chart  The TIPS rate   reflects people’s expectations about fiscal policy  That’s a rate derived from going out on   the yield curve, so it embodies the effects of the more expansionary fiscal policy as that        10/2/01 80   policy kicks in later next year and in future years  The elevated level is a reflection of   that steep upward slope of the yield curve, partly supply induced and partly I think   macroeconomically induced in the sense of the effects of fiscal policy over coming   quarters But probably somewhere out later next year and in following years the   calculation would have interest rates being pushed up as a reflection of the expected   turnaround in monetary policy    I think right now it’s moderate and I--well, I won’t give a policy   recommendation!  [Laughter]  "
6474,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The policy easing you have  already undertaken--and in particular the 100 basis point reduction in the federal  funds rate in the three weeks after September 11--anticipated a substantial  downdraft in economic activity  Nonetheless, with the incoming data indicating  that the economy is even weaker than expected, and by a considerable margin,  the question you would seem to be facing again today is not whether to ease  further but rather by how much    To be sure, your answer is not likely to have an appreciable effect on  the near-term trajectory of the economy, but it will alter interest rate  expectations and asset prices now and in the future and, in so doing, will help  to shape the eventual recovery The extent of the contraction is important to  your policy decision The larger the output gap created as the economy goes  through this current period of weakness, the stronger the rebound that can be  accommodated consistent with satisfactory inflation performance over the  longer run     11/6/01 70   Market participants expect you to lower the funds rate today, and they  have put a little more weight on a decline of 50 basis points than one of 25   The cumulative easing they have built into the yield curve stands at close to  75 basis points by early next year Although whatever you decide is likely to  have some effect on interest rates and asset prices, the changes may not be  large--at least immediately  Much of the initial adjustment is likely to be in  the expected timing of further ease--when markets see the funds rate hitting  bottom, rather than in the level of the rate at that point  But the cumulative  size of the anticipated easing will be affected, at least a little, and possibly  more so over time, as the markets factor in their perceptions of your concerns  and responses when reacting to future information  An important aspect of  the decision today, then, is how you would like to nudge those expectations  and asset prices in light of your assessment of the outlook, the risks around  that outlook, and the costs of the economy deviating to one side or the other of  its most likely path   In the staff Greenbook forecast, only 25 basis points of further easing,  along with greater fiscal stimulus than assumed in the last forecast round,  helps to promote a rebound in activity after a relatively shallow contraction   Indeed, the added monetary and fiscal policy actions about compensate for the  greater-than-expected near-term weakness, leaving the level of output at the  end of the projection period close to where it was predicted to be in the last  forecast round     In a couple of respects, financial market prices suggest that  participants in these markets foresee a stronger revival in economic activity  than does the staff  Markets are anticipating a little more easing than the staff  has assumed, but also a quicker and more substantial increase in the federal  funds rate thereafter, presumably in response to a more rapid pickup in  growth The rise in equity prices and the substantial narrowing of risk  premiums on junk bonds over the intermeeting period are particularly  noteworthy in the face of downward revisions to near-term economic and  interest rate expectations This more favorable attitude toward risk suggests  that financial market participants have become less fearful about future  prospects and are expecting better earnings performance than is the staff   Giving some weight to the stronger tenor of market expectations would lend  support to a decision to limit the easing at this meeting to 25 basis points   Moreover, the Committee may prefer to reduce the federal funds rate  only 25 basis points at this meeting even if it sees a high probability that  further easing will eventually be needed  Moving gradually, rather than front- loading the additional ease, might have a number of advantages  Importantly,  it could help you to calibrate the extent of your easing better  Additional time  should give you more information about the economy’s developing response  to your earlier actions, which include some unusually large easings very  recently  In addition, the nature of the fiscal response to September 11 could     11/6/01 71   well become clearer in the next month or so, and you will have more data to  help sort out the more persistent effects of the attacks on consumer and  business behavior Moreover, the Committee may want to take account of the  possibility that over the next several months the interaction of market  expectations and fragile public confidence will weigh heavily on the side of  further easing as the economy continues to contract  If the stance of policy is  set now to fully anticipate that oncoming weakness, you could be faced with  weighing the risks of disappointing the markets and the public on the one  hand, or easing policy excessively on the other  If financial markets have  done a reasonably good job in reading your intentions and building the policy  actions you anticipate into current asset prices, little of the stabilization power  of policy would be sacrificed by moving in more measured steps  In the  present situation, market participants are likely to continue to anticipate at  least another 25 basis points of easing after a 25 basis point move at this  meeting  And that might be roughly consistent with your own estimate of  what will be needed, though, as noted, the structure of market rates also  incorporates a substantial policy tightening beginning later next year         However, the risk in a gradual approach to policy implementation is  that policy actions may turn out to be insufficient to forestall a cumulating,  self-reinforcing, movement in the economy because the forces bearing on  demand or prices prove to be stronger than the central bank or the markets  anticipate, or because the economy is hit with another shock in the same  direction In the current circumstances, with incoming data and the near-term  outlook considerably weaker than anticipated at your last meeting, and with  the rebound still only a forecast, the Committee may see a more aggressive  policy easing of 50 basis points as better calibrated to the prevailing profiles  of the economic risks and the costs and benefits of potential alternative  outcomes     The recent data may indeed be consistent with a short period of  weakness in which adjustments are compressed and the stage is set for a fairly  prompt and robust turnaround, as the financial markets seem to believe  But  they also may be symptomatic of a deeper and more prolonged contraction  The latter could occur as both households and businesses engage in a mutually  reinforcing withdrawal to safer balance sheet and spending patterns in the face  of the heightened level of uncertainty and concern about the future     The forecast of a reasonably shallow downturn and robust recovery  depends not only on a measured response of households to high levels of job  losses, but importantly also on stimulative fiscal actions that have not yet been  agreed by Congress and the Administration  Were such an agreement to be  delayed significantly or structured in such a way as to be less effective than  has been assumed, easier monetary policy would be needed to carry more of  the load in stimulating the economy  And, a substantial shortfall in fiscal  stimulus could require appreciable further monetary accommodation  The     11/6/01 72   decline in stock prices and the strength of the dollar this year have  counteracted much of the effect of your previous easings, raising questions  about how much stimulus from monetary policy alone is now in train to  counter more persistent forces of restraint on private spending behavior over  the next few quarters  Moreover, the downturn is unusually synchronous and  interactive around the world, but global demand may not get much of a boost  from monetary policy elsewhere--at least from policy in the other two main  currency areas The Bank of Japan is constrained by a lack of effective  alternatives, and the ECB seems hamstrung from vigorous action by a desire  to build consensus amid concerns about establishing price stability credentials  in its initial years   If the standard forecast is correct, were the Committee to ease by 50  basis points at this meeting and perhaps by smaller amounts in coming  months, you would find yourselves next spring with a strengthening economy  and monetary policy in a very stimulative position  But, unless the  contraction is a lot shallower than most expect, you will also be facing an  economy with a considerable margin of excess labor and capital that will be  exerting downward pressure on inflation  In these circumstances, the FOMC  should have ample time to begin to firm policy to forestall the onset of  inflation pressures If, on the other hand, the recent data signal that the  economy is in a steeper contraction, you will want to have eased aggressively  to cushion the fall and to foster a more rapid rebound   If the Committee sees inflation as most likely to be moving down as  slack accumulates in labor and product markets, it may perceive little benefit  from risking a further shortfall from the expected path of the economy and see  reasons to lean a little harder against that possibility  The cost of such a  shortfall could be unusually large  Not only is there the potential for  cumulating downward movements in output for a time, but that spiral could be  prolonged under circumstances in which the nominal federal funds rate is  already low and the forces of restraint turn out to be large and persistent  In  these circumstances, economic slack could reduce inflation and inflation  expectations so far that it became impossible for the Federal Reserve to drive  real interest rates far enough into negative territory to counteract continuing  weakness If this is seen as a possibility, acting gradually--that is, “keeping  the powder dry”--risks finding yourselves in that very situation  Therefore, it  would be especially important to act preemptively to bolster the economy,  limit disinflation, and forestall being “pinned to the zero bound,” as the  Bluebook put it   Taken together, these aspects of the current situation may be seen as  arguing for leaning on the side of another 50 basis point easing at this time,  rather than 25 The larger action is likely to lower somewhat market  expectations of the funds rate over the next few months, but the effects of  such revisions in reducing interest rates further out the yield curve and in     11/6/01 73   supporting equity prices may be seen as providing a desirable extra margin of   financial accommodation in the face of the downside risks and costs      Whatever you do, the tenor of the incoming data on both output and  prices and the downward revision to near-term forecasts would suggest that  economic weakness continues to be more of a concern than rising inflation   At some point, near-term weakness will be balanced by the prospects of an  expansion in the future that could give rise to inflation pressures, but for now  and into the foreseeable future, the risks to achieving your objective for  sustainable growth would seem to outweigh those to longer-run price stability   Thank you, Mr Chairman    I think it depends on where you see the central tendency of your forecast  I   believe the central tendency among Committee members is for something like the Greenbook   forecast--some additional weakness followed by an upturn next year  We’re talking about the risks   around that central tendency One could view 50 basis points of ease not so much as a response to   the central tendency forecast, if that appears to be a reasonable forecast, but rather to the risks   around that central tendency By risks I mean not only the risk that the economy could turn out to be   weaker and the rebound weaker, perhaps because the fiscal stimulus doesn’t come through, but also   the costs of falling short We could end up with a very severe disinflationary pressure that policy   would have trouble catching up to--being behind the curve, as Committee members sometimes like     11/6/01 74   to say Getting behind the curve on the downside might be particularly costly at this time  If you   had a very weak central tendency forecast, then I would agree that you should be considering a   larger cut But with a central tendency about like the staff forecast, I think we’re really talking about   the risk around that forecast    I think a move of 50 basis points will have a relatively small effect on   market expectations  After all, markets have already built in about a two-thirds probability of a 50   basis point cut I don’t put too much weight on the precise measurement of that probability, but you   would not be greatly surprising them with such a cut  I would expect something along the lines of   what happened after your last meeting when the markets were debating between a reduction of 25 or   50 basis points You did 50, and the markets revised down the out-year Eurodollar contracts by 7 to   9 basis points And I think that kind of response would not be an unreasonable one  So I would   anticipate some downward revision, but not a big one in the immediate expectations      I think that’s partly a function of how I structured the briefing, in terms of   trying to give all the arguments for doing 25 basis points and then all the arguments for doing 50   basis points It’s clearly a matter of considerable judgment  And there are arguments on the 25 basis   points side This may be one of those unusual situations--President Jordan said he thought this   might have happened over the last few weeks--where we really do get some information over the   intermeeting period  As he remarked, we’ve been disappointed by that information  As many of   you commented, the gridlock on fiscal policy may well persist past December 11th, the date of your   next meeting  So I think there’s that argument  The markets have built in more ease  You’re only   reducing expectations by a little  We could be getting a rebound next year  It’s really more a   question of where you want to take the risk I don’t think the differences between the two choices I   described are as stark as you suggested, but there are differences in emphasis, differences in   message, and differences in what might happen    Well, you do have 250 basis points before you get down to where the   Japanese rates are So you have a ways to go And I agree with you that our financial system--our     11/6/01 76   private economy and our financial markets--is much stronger than the Japanese system, which is   really what is holding them back    On the other hand, our economy is subject to some unusual shocks and we   just don’t know how businesses and households will be responding to unfolding developments  And   there are downside risks Some in the market see a bottom to the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 percent    So, the rate is approaching that level  It may be a little premature to have boxes in the Bluebook and   a discussion around this table of the zero bound, but it’s not that premature  One could construct a   scenario in which there is a major loss in confidence, as in the alternative scenario in the Greenbook,   or scenarios in which business activity and foreign economies are much weaker  I think we could all   sit here and write down about three or four developments that would seriously weaken this economy    They would all have to occur at the same time--a number of very bad things happening at once--  including the possibility of another terrorist attack  It’s not impossible to imagine that six months   from now the Committee could be dealing with some very, very low interest rates     How about “necessary reallocation of resources”?  I think that was   somebody’s suggestion  That sounds a little better    Mr Chairman, may I suggest that the Committee reconsider using the word   “necessary” to describe the reallocation of resources rather than “appropriate”?  Several people   suggested “necessary” during the course of the discussion and I think it may be a little better there  "
6521,2001-12-11," I certainly agree with what Dave said  And the fact that long-term inflation   expectations haven’t changed very much would lead one to discount this survey result a bit  The   question would be whether the implied rise in real short-term rates is exerting upward pressure on   intermediate- and long-term rates  But I think we can explain--more or less as President Minehan and   Dino have tried to do--why those long-term rates have risen through just the general optimism plus the   volatility I don’t think, as yet anyhow, that a rise in real short-term rates is putting upward pressure   on real long-term rates  But if inflation expectations were to continue to edge lower, that would be   something you would need to take account of in assessing the stance of policy    The longer-term inflation expectations embedded in the yield curve dipped   right after the September attacks, hit a low point at the end of October, and have come back up again    But on balance they haven’t changed appreciably since last summer  So they’re not showing the   same--  "
6522,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of you have remarked,  perhaps the most striking--and certainly welcome--aspect of this intermeeting  period has been the mixed character of the incoming economic data  For the first  time in many months, data have not pointed to further downward revisions to  current and prospective economic activity  Importantly, although measures of  aggregate employment and output show the economy overall continuing to  contract appreciably, key elements of private final demand have firmed, and by  somewhat more than expected  This latter development would seem to provide  the first concrete indication that further contraction in the economy could well be  limited, and some tentative support for the projected turnaround beginning early  next year The key issue for you today would seem to be whether, with the  economic outlook perhaps stabilizing, the monetary stimulus already in place is  sufficient to foster an adequate rebound, thus arguing for keeping policy  unchanged at this meeting, or whether the persisting softness in activity and  prices, along with the possibility that you are seeing a false dawn and the  recovery may be damped, justifies a further slight easing of policy of 25 basis  points   In practical terms, the differential effects of either standing pat or easing by  1/4 point may not be that great  Because both represent a step-down from the  recent pace of easing, either will reinforce perceptions in the market that the  FOMC believes that the end of the easing cycle is near With such an  expectation already largely embedded in the term structure of interest rates, long- term interest rates should not change much under either alternative  Still, the  choice will matter to some degree  In addition to its effect on the cost of short- term finance, it could have some small influence on longer-term rate  expectations, especially if you do not ease as markets anticipate  Perhaps more  importantly, the inferences market participants draw about your own economic  outlook and your weighing of risks and costs in policy decisions will help them  to shape how asset prices respond to new information going forward   A decision to leave rates unchanged at this meeting would seem to rest  mainly on the combination of a more stable outlook and the extent of previous  policy easing Policy has eased more rapidly than in most economic downturns,  in part reflecting your efforts to take account of the implications of new  information not only for the current situation but also for the path of the  economy into the future  In this regard, you may see the degree of stimulus in  the stance of policy at the end of your last meeting as already based on  expectations of further weakening in the economy and as sufficient to foster a  satisfactory recovery beginning next year from the lower level of resource  utilization in train Indeed, to some extent, the aggressiveness of policy easing  may have reflected your attempt to protect against downside risks, as well as to  address the central tendency of the outlook  This seemed especially the case at  your last meeting when several of you remarked that the choice between 25 and  50 basis points was a close call If you thought you had policy positioned about  right at the end of your previous meeting for the forecast and the balance of risks     12/11/01 69    you saw at that time, the information you have received since then--which  suggests smaller downside risks and no more contraction than expected--could  be seen as supporting a decision to keep policy unchanged   In addition, if you believe that the staff has been relatively conservative in  its interpretation of the recent news in its assessment of final demand, you may  see some greater upside risks to the staff forecast than perceived earlier  Judging  from the rise in bond yields and equity prices, the private sector has become  considerably more optimistic about the prospective pickup in the economy-- accentuating the disparity with most economic forecasts that has existed for  some time  The persistence of the steep upward slope of the yield curve for so  long may mean that optimism extends beyond bond traders and financial  intermediaries to savers and spenders  One piece of evidence in support of this  possibility has been the surprising resilience of consumer confidence in the  Michigan survey--notably in expectations about the future  Even if the staff has  the fundamentals right, they could be trumped by animal spirits for some time as  the economy turns around, bolstering equity prices and spending for a while   Moreover, as a number of you remarked, some of the important downside  risks to the staff forecast may not readily lend themselves to being incorporated  as an influence on the current stance of policy  Stock price misvaluations could  last a long time, and in the interim policy that adjusted out of concern about the  effects of a future sharp drop in prices will have been promoting suboptimal  economic outcomes  And, in the case of equity prices, easing a little now to  protect against a future major decline might only feed the current perceived  disequilibrium The possible effect of a second major downside risk--another  terrorist attack--would also be equally difficult to build into policy today, given  the wide range of possibilities Altogether, the Committee may see the practical  policy risks around a central tendency forecast as much more balanced than at  your previous several meetings, supporting the argument to hold rates unchanged  at this meeting   However, although the outlook seems to have stabilized and the risks around  the forecast seem to have become better balanced, the recent data are preliminary  and tentative And, as yet, they are inconclusive as to whether a reasonably  strong and prompt rebound is in process or the economy is likely to remain weak  for some time and the recovery delayed and tepid  Economic activity continues  to contract, and, while the current stance of policy means that the Committee will  need to stop easing well before growth picks up substantially, you might want  some greater assurance that a turnaround is in process before pausing  If so, you  should consider easing policy slightly further at this meeting   Moreover, the Greenbook forecast, itself, may not point to an entirely  satisfactory economic outcome  In that forecast, with the federal funds rate at its  current level through 2002, growth is not strong enough next year or the year  after to cut very substantially into the excess margin of underutilized resources     12/11/01 70    that is coming to prevail  Persisting excess production capacity and relatively  modest profit growth hold back the upswing in investment and repress  consumption growth by weighing on equity prices  These forces of restraint  erode only gradually, and to promote recovery they must be countered by  maintaining an accommodative stance of policy for some time  The perfect  foresight simulation in the Bluebook showed that, with inflation already low and  likely to decline further in the staff forecast, policy can be eased even further to  promote a more vigorous recovery, without sacrificing the Committee’s longer- run price stability objective And, as Dave pointed out, the staff forecast is not  without its major downside risks, in addition to those posed by a sharp correction  in equity markets and another terrorist incident--notably the potential influence  of increases in unemployment on consumer confidence and spending and the  possibility that fiscal stimulus could be considerably smaller than assumed   Easing policy today by 1/4 point might have little immediate effect on financial  asset prices, as it is fully anticipated by the markets  But it would encourage and  give greater scope for a later downward adjustment of long-term interest rates  and, hence, support for asset prices and spending, as investors confront the  disappointing reality embodied in the staff forecast--or something even weaker     Even if you suspect that the staff may be unduly pessimistic about demand  and activity next year, you might still favor an easing at this meeting  Such an  action could be seen as providing greater protection against the possibility that  the economy could remain weak for a while or that the upturn could turn out to  be insufficient, without incurring much inflationary risk  To be sure, the more  you ease, the sooner and by more you may have to tighten, and that reversal  could need to begin next year, especially if the economy does turn out to be more  vigorous than in the staff forecast  Such a pattern was another feature of the  “perfect foresight” model, and it is built into market expectations  But, if the  Committee is willing to stop easing when a turnaround is seen as more  definitive, and to tighten preemptively as strength becomes evident, the level of  resource utilization that seems likely to prevail, even under more optimistic  outlooks, should keep downward pressure on inflation for long enough to allow  such a policy reversal to forestall inflation pressures from emerging    Financial market participants seem confident that you will carry it off,  judging from the combination of low inflation compensation and a sharp  turnaround in expected short-term interest rates after further easing today that is  built into the structure of interest rates  Such market confidence, itself, provides  a safety margin for the Committee, because it keeps inflation expectations  damped and raises real longer-term interest rates promptly in response to  surprisingly strong economic news  In effect, a further easing could be seen as  taking advantage of the credibility growing out of your past actions and good  inflation outcomes to provide a margin of protection against the possibility that,  at the current stance of policy, the economy will turn out to be weaker than is  consistent with fostering the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment  and stable prices     12/11/01 71    Whichever policy you chose at this meeting, you might still see the risks to  achieving those long-term goals as tilted toward economic weakness for the  foreseeable future Even if you thought that the economy might be stronger than  in the staff forecast, output is likely to grow more slowly than the rate of growth  of potential for a while and inflation should be moving lower  At some point, the  prospect of higher output gaps in the short run could be balanced by expectations  that growth will pick up sufficiently over a longer period to raise questions about  inflation pressures at the prevailing policy setting  But given the very tentative  nature of the indications of future economic recovery, that point would not seem  to have been reached yet    If you didn’t have it there you would have some much sharper declines in   interest rates  It’s a tradeoff  By putting in that constraint you are deviating from the optimum   possible economic performance    For one thing, if that constraint weren’t there we would be dealing with a zero   bound situation, given the staff forecast  That’s not a reason not to show it     12/11/01 72     The model used for this is the same model used in the alternative simulations   in the Greenbook    So you do get a sense of how sensitive the economic outcomes are to different   policy assumptions For example, the fiscal policy assumption that Governor Gramlich mentioned   produces a somewhat different outcome for the economy, and that would feed back through the policy   path And importantly, because this is a perfect foresight model, even if you anticipate something   happening or not happening, say, out a year or two, that feeds back into your current policy stance    The Committee is assumed to choose a whole path for the federal funds rate   that minimizes the squared deviations of the output and inflation gaps at every point in time, taking   account of all the information you have way out into the future    It’s from several surveys that show a universal expectation among economists   and market observers about the balance of risks  You can’t infer anything about the balance of risks   from financial prices per se  So it is survey based    I think the immediate reaction to our move was that the Eurodollar futures   rates went down by 10 to 15 basis points    And then there was the new information--    I think if you move down and then up, in some definitional sense that   increases the volatility of interest rates over the period of time  But I don’t think it necessarily would   increase the volatility of interest rates in the short run because moving down now is exactly what the   market expects  In some sense not moving would increase the short-run volatility of rates because you   would be doing something unexpected  That’s not necessarily good or bad  You ought to do what you     12/11/01 77    think is the right thing to do But I don’t see that an easing today would have a material effect on the   volatility of interest rates other than in the definitional sense that at some point next year or the year   after you’ll have to raise them again in order to further--     More than you otherwise would  "
6578,2002-01-29," Wow!    That’s only the first time, though, isn’t it?  "
6579,2002-01-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Increasing signs of stability in demand and  production lend credibility to a forecast that the economy is in the process of turning up,  potentially leading to a resumption of sustained economic growth  The better news of the  last few months suggests that the major forces that have been depressing final demand over  the last year or so are abating and their further effects will be limited, even though they have  not yet completely played themselves out  For example, although previous declines in equity  prices will continue to restrain consumption, the net rebound of equity markets in recent  months, if not reversed, should limit the extent of the negative wealth effect  In the business  sector, the firming in orders for capital goods helps to support an assessment of good  progress in working down the overhang, and the persistence of productivity gains suggests  strong incentives for capital investment going forward  The terrorist attacks have left little  lasting imprint on consumer confidence And overseas, economies also show some signs of  stabilizing and have been resilient to contagion from Argentina   But while this evidence on demand and asset prices provides some comfort that the  recession will be shallow and end soon, it leaves considerable margin of doubt about the  strength of the recovery The forecast of the staff and FOMC members for 2002 is that the  pickup will be moderate, consistent with some further slackening in resource utilization in  the near term In the staff forecast, the output gap closes slowly in the second half of 2002  and in 2003 As suggested by the staff memo on monetary policy effectiveness, the nature of  the shocks of the past year—by lowering expected profits, raising risk premiums, and  affecting economies overseas—has led to asset price movements that imply that the gap  between the funds rate and its equilibrium level significantly overstates the degree of demand  stimulus embedded in financial markets  That is, owing to a higher cost of equity capital,           January 29-30, 2002 Page 112 of 194  lower wealth, a stronger dollar, and elevated risk premiums in credit markets, the monetary  policy pipeline is not as full as might be supposed  And these more adverse financial  conditions may unwind only gradually in the recovery  Pressures on profits and cash flow in  coming quarters could well damp increases in equity prices and reductions in risk premiums,  as well as hold down growth in investment more directly  Moreover, as Dave Wilcox  pointed out yesterday, because household spending has been so well maintained, the release  of pent-up demand for durables and a rally in residential construction that historically have  accounted for some of the vigor of recovery are not likely to be present this time around  As  could be seen in the extended baseline in the Bluebook, the continuing restraints on demand  in the staff forecast mean that the degree of ease in the stance of policy must be reversed only  gradually to permit the economy to return to its potential   In fact, an outlook like that in the staff forecast could be seen as providing support for  another modest policy easing  With the federal funds rate held at its current level through  most of this year, substantial output gaps persist over the next two years, and inflation comes  down appreciably further Easing policy another notch would promote growth while  allowing some, more limited, further decline in inflation  Indeed, the rate of inflation  forecasted in the Greenbook for 2003 is quite low—in the zone the Reifschneider-Williams  briefing yesterday identified as elevating the odds on policy being constrained by the zero  nominal bound  If the economy were to be hit with major downward shocks over the next  few years, the scope for achieving negative real interest rates to counter the effects of those  shocks would be narrow Since it’s not difficult to conjure up a number of candidates for  such adverse developments, the Committee might feel more comfortable if the economy  were stronger and inflation a little higher over the period in which those shocks might occur  so that real short-term rates could be lower in the future, if necessary  In this context, a  further reduction in rates today could be seen as “insurance,” though against the possibility of  a future adverse surprise requiring a substantial monetary policy response rather than against  a possible near-term shortfall in the economy stemming from recent developments     But the recent more upbeat data also make it more likely that policy may already be  positioned to support a sufficiently robust expansion to provide a margin of safety against  adverse shocks And these data increase the odds that a further ease would risk policy  overshooting—of fostering a rebound in demand that could be difficult to contain  Keeping  policy unchanged at this meeting would allow the Committee to assess better the likely  strength of demand and its response to its previous easing actions, a considerable portion of  which was undertaken in the last few months Those actions were taken partly in anticipation  of a period of further weakness in economic activity and decline in resource utilization and  were influenced as well by an assessment of substantial downside risks in the forecast  In the  event, the outcome perhaps has been a little better than many of you probably expected after  the terrorist attacks, and the odds on even more adverse outcomes from the forces that have  been bearing down on the economy have diminished considerably  Indeed, the positive cast  to the data may suggest increased chances that the economy could continue to come in  stronger than forecast, better balancing the considerable remaining downside risks  If firms  have been calibrating their reductions in inventories, investment spending, and labor force to  the possibility of very weak outcomes, the persistent strength in consumption could spark a  reasonably robust rebound in business spending                          January 29-30, 2002 Page 113 of 194  Moreover, the current very easy stance of policy as measured by short-term interest rates  itself provides some cushion against downside economic risks  The gap between market and  economist evaluations of the most likely strength of the recovery has narrowed over the  intermeeting period, but it remains wide, and the yield curve retains a steep upward slope   Should incoming data point to a weaker recovery than is implicit in current market prices, a  funds rate of 1¾ percent leaves considerable scope for intermediate-term and long-term  market interest rates to work lower, which could lend support to the economy while the  Committee evaluated the need for further policy action   Although the Committee may see the risks around the type of rebound in the staff  forecast as now better balanced, they may still be weighted to the downside, and the forecast  itself suggests unbalanced outcomes, at least for a time  With growth in output remaining  below that of potential for a while and inflation on a downward trajectory through the  forecast interval, your goal of maximum sustainable growth would seem to continue to be at  greater risk than your objective of keeping inflation low  The decline in inflation, by itself,  will tend to increase the real federal funds rate  The message of an announcement of  unbalanced risks and an unchanged funds rate target would be that on balance you were still  more concerned about subpar growth than about rising inflation but your concerns had  diminished considerably   In the current circumstances, with inflation likely to be falling, a judgment that the risks  were balanced would seem to require some confidence that final demands were strengthening  enough, and the recovery had taken hold sufficiently, to promise sustained growth above the  trend of potential at the current stance of policy  Such growth is needed to reduce the output  gap and eventually put a floor on the rate of inflation  Financial market participants  apparently expect the economy to be sufficiently strong to put high odds on substantial  tightening beginning this summer If you share their outlook, you probably should adopt an  assessment of balanced risks at this meeting  Under conditions of the staff forecast, however,  it is not until late this year that the Committee needs to begin moving the federal funds rate  more actively back toward a neutral stance in order to forestall the economy later  overshooting the level of its potential  You may consider even that delayed tightening as  premature if you are concerned about low rates of inflation and resource utilization in 2003    Despite the expectations embedded in interest rates, most market observers anticipate that  you will retain the current balance of risks assessment at this meeting, perhaps on the way to  balanced risks at the next meeting or so, and market reaction to such an announcement  should be minimal  Your implied doubts about the strength of the recovery might lower  long-term rates a little further, but if the stance of policy is kept unchanged at this meeting,  markets are unlikely to build in expectations of additional near-term policy easing unless the  information becoming available over coming weeks turns unexpectedly weak    I would characterize that as markets believing that the current nominal   funds rate is quite stimulative and likely to result in fairly vigorous growth before too long and,   therefore, they expect the funds rate to have to rise  To me that would indicate that markets are   optimistic, as reflected in the yield curve and as reflected in the equity markets  It says that   financial market participants are more optimistic than the Board staff—or I think than many of   you, judging from your forecasts submitted for this meeting  I don’t know that it indicates                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 115 of 194  relative to your own forecast that policy is stimulative  I think it indicates that the markets   believe policy is stimulative, however    I think it would be coming down over subsequent years  As we get to 2005   and 2006, the real federal funds rate is about at its equilibrium  When it’s at its equilibrium, the   economy should come to its equilibrium  So, convergence to the NAIRU would be occurring    It’s just a question of how fast it would happen  The dynamics of this are such that, in order to   make it happen faster, you could have a somewhat lower real federal funds rate, obviously, for a   time and then come up to the equilibrium later  But the way this model is constructed,   convergence will happen gradually as the economy comes to its equilibrium     Yes    I think an interesting, almost extraordinary point here is that this   Committee faces a problem that no FOMC has faced in years  What is it, nearly forty years?   Many of you—and some people who aren’t here and departed recently—used to say that it   would take just one recession to get back to price stability  We had that recession plus a nice   burst of productivity growth, and inflation is in the neighborhood of price stability  The   Committee for the last twenty years really has not worried about how low inflation should go    But now you have something new to factor into your thinking about monetary policy  That   doesn’t necessarily mean that you need to vote on what that number is and publish the number    But it does mean, as you’re thinking about your policy choices, that you need to keep in mind   that it is possible for inflation to go too low  Actually, I think it’s a compliment to the   Committee that you’ve gotten to that point over the last twenty years    Yes, something like that    "
6640,2002-03-19," Yes, I just want to bring the Committee up to date on other work under   way We have a study being done on the auction credit facility (ACF), which would be a   discount window facility Rick Lang from the Philadelphia Fed is heading that up and is   following up on the various issues Committee members raised when this subject was discussed   about a year ago There are issues dealing with supervisory matters, risk management and asset   management for the Federal Reserve System, and auction design  Those are at least three of the   main topics being studied  That work actually has been given a little extra impetus by   contingency planning follow-up from September 11  An ACF-like facility could function in an   emergency as a backup for open market operations  As a consequence of Governor Ferguson’s   and Vice Chairman McDonough’s work on contingency planning and backup facilities for the   System, we have given that ACF study a little more urgency  Rick and his group are to have   something done on that by June  If they can’t get a complete study done on all aspects of the   ACF, they are at least going to have finished by June the work on the use of a discount auction   facility as a contingency backup for open market operations  But Rick is going to try to move   along all the tracks so that we can have everything regarding the ACF ready for consideration at   that time   A second project is the review of the SOMA studies that you looked at a year ago  Each   one has been reviewed by legal staff both here and at the New York Fed, I believe  For the most   part, they have also been through the economic editing process to get them ready for publication,   and the authors themselves have reviewed that work  I think it’s fair to say that the urgency   behind this project has toned down a bit  But we are moving forward to get those studies in   publishable form and to get them out to the public as staff studies, not as Committee documents        March 19, 2002 Page 12 of 117   I think there are a couple of issues involved, if I can dredge them up from   my memory of our previous discussion  Part of the question was what the Treasury would do   with the other part of its balance sheet In effect, we’d be pushing the problem on to them  That   may be where it belongs, but I think it would require a change in their law  As for us, we have to   buy our securities in the open market  So this is a question of the Treasury’s issuing more   securities into the open market to accommodate our needs and then doing something with the   cash that they raise They would need to figure out how to invest the extra cash that they’re   raising in order to sell the securities in the open market or we, in addition to the Treasury, would   need to go to the Congress to seek a change in the law    Mr Chairman, working with Al and his people, we can certainly produce a   short paper on this topic Marvin Goodfriend and I had a debate about it at the Cleveland Fed        March 19, 2002 Page 15 of 117  last fall We can convert our debate to a paper to bring to the Committee in a couple of months if   that would be helpful    We take Fannies and Freddies in RPs  This option would involve outright   purchases of GNMAs, so we would be treating them differently  I think we would explain the   difference as a full faith and credit issue  Part of the idea for moving to GNMA was that the   Committee seemed not to want to increase its reliance on Fannie and Freddie  And one of the   instructions to the staff was to look for other alternatives that are legal under the current Federal   Reserve Act That’s how these alternatives came up  So I think the signal you’re seeing is an   accurate representation of where the Committee wanted to go   If I could make one more point, going back to the question you asked about currency   growth, Mr Chairman  Currency has been growing about 8 percent a year; this year it’s been   running more like 10, 11, 12 percent  The deficit would have to be $250 billion or $300 billion   for us not to be taking an increasing portion of the securities outstanding  So even without the   adverse deficit kinds of scenarios that people see, if currency growth doesn’t decelerate soon, the   Fed will start to own a rising proportion of the Treasury securities outstanding in a market where           March 19, 2002 Page 16 of 117  in certain sectors the liquidity issue is already surfacing  We can obviously do a lot more study   on this But even under the most likely scenarios of deficits persisting at a relatively low level   for some time, I think the Committee is going to face a problem where its operations are   impinging on the liquidity of the market before too long    We already do repos in Ginnies    Mr Chairman, I’ve asked people to submit suggestions for discussion   topics at the June meeting  I’ve gotten returns from about half the Reserve Bank presidents and   Board members  I’ll take any suggestions through the end of this week if the rest of you want to   submit something or if any of you want to amend your previous submission     END OF MEETING      "
6693,2002-05-07," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the time of your March meeting, you   had just received a string of surprisingly strong readings on demand and activity  The   tone of that information motivated the decision to shift the balance of risks statement   to neutral, and many of you expressed concern that the momentum of economic   expansion would begin to erode margins of unutilized capital and labor resources   before long That prospect suggested that you soon would need to consider starting   the process of moving to a more sustainable policy stance     However, the data received over the intermeeting period suggest appreciable   moderation in the pace of expansion, leaving open the question of when demand will   be strong enough to generate increases in output capable of reducing those excess   resource margins  In the staff forecast, little progress is made on reducing the   unemployment rate over coming months, and capacity utilization just edges higher, as   growth is restrained by continuing declines in net exports and by only a gradual   recovery of investment  As Karen discussed, it appears that foreign economies,   although picking up, are still on the receiving end of impetus from the US economy,   rather than a net source of strength to the United States Moreover, the dollar’s fall   over the intermeeting period seems at least partly a response to disappointment in the   vigor of the US expansion, limiting the extent to which it will be a net plus for the   pace of growth here      For business, capital spending, orders data, persistently downbeat business   attitudes, and the ongoing drag from excess capacity all suggest that the strengthening   of investment is likely to be damped for a time  One indication of the weaker near­                           May 7, 2002 61 of 81  term outlook for capital spending is the appreciable decline in equity prices over the  intermeeting period, which was triggered in part by pessimistic assessments of sales  prospects by technology firms, indicating that sellers of high-tech equipment and  software are not seeing an imminent revival of demand    Measures of underlying price and labor cost increases becoming available over  the intermeeting period dropped further from already low levels  In the staff forecast,  inflation remains quite damped—and slightly lower than in the previous forecast,  reflecting a reassessment of potential output, as Dave explained  The higher current  level of potential output now seen in the wake of the upward revisions to estimates of  structural productivity growth in recent years means that the shortfall of actual output  relative to its potential now is larger than previously thought  This larger gap thereby  exerts greater downward pressure on compensation and price increases  The greater  growth of structural productivity going forward keeps the unemployment rate from  falling as fast and damps cost increases     By itself, an upward revision in the productivity growth rate would tend to boost  the equilibrium real interest rate  However, the staff assumes that higher structural  productivity growth is not news to financial market participants and the earnings  implications of faster growth have already been incorporated into equity prices,  cutting off one channel through which stronger productivity raises interest rates   Moreover, with the upward revision to the level of potential output in the past, in  retrospect a lower interest rate now appears to have been needed all along to spur  spending enough to keep the economy producing at this elevated potential  This  resulting downward revision in the level of the equilibrium rate carried forward from  history more than offsets any remaining tendency for higher growth in structural  productivity to raise the equilibrium rate  Thus, r* was revised down, moving closer  to the current real funds rate But the narrowing of the estimated interest rate gap  occurs just as you might otherwise desire to widen the spread of r below r* to counter  the larger perceived shortfall of actual output from its potential  This reduced degree  of effective policy stimulus relative to the output gap means that, as in the staff  forecast, the federal funds rate can remain at its current level for longer without an  increase in inflationary pressures     With the strength of economic activity still in doubt and inflation headed down  and with the output gap perhaps larger and policy not quite as accommodative as you  had thought, the Committee would seem to have a strong rationale for leaving policy  unchanged at this meeting  Even if you suspect that the expansion will be stronger  and price pressures less damped than in the staff forecast, slack in resource utilization  should still be sufficient to hold inflation in check for some time, suggesting little  potential cost to waiting before beginning your tightening until some of the current  uncertainties about final demand begin to be resolved  Moreover, the potential  benefit from postponing action could be considerable should the firming of demand,  in fact, turn out to be more gradual than you expect                        May 7, 2002 62 of 81  These uncertainties and revisions supporting the current stance of policy,  however, do not alter the basic policy issue you are likely to face later this year—that  is, the timing and trajectory of a rise in the funds rate from its current unsustainably  low level A related issue you face today is how to communicate your intentions to  the public to foster realistic and constructive expectations  These are complex issues,  and I’ll offer comments on only two aspects this morning—the use of benchmarks to  measure and discuss progress toward a more sustainable policy stance and the balance  of risks assessment for this meeting   One such benchmark cited by some Committee members at recent meetings—and  even more frequently by financial market commentators—is taking back the so-called  insurance cuts made after the September 11 attacks as a first set of steps in the  tightening process  Whether this construction will be helpful to guide your actions or  market expectations is questionable in my view  It is impossible to know what the  funds rate would have been absent the attacks  Conditions in the weeks leading up to  September 11 arguably were already developing in such a way as to call for more  policy easing, and much has changed or been learned about the economy in the eight  months since then that ought to influence policy  As a consequence, the pace of  tightening and the desirability of a pause at some point probably will need to be  decided at each meeting by evaluating the existing stance of policy relative to your  goals and expectations for the economy and prices, regardless of how that policy  stance was arrived at     A second benchmark, cited for the ultimate level of the federal funds rate, is its  estimated equilibrium value  This too needs to be used with caution  This is an  abstract construct, which like its close relative, the level of potential output, can never  be observed but only inferred imprecisely from the behavior of other variables and  estimated relationships  This movable target can be expected to vary over time with  anticipated changes in underlying economic conditions  And as we have just  discussed, its estimated value at any given point in time fluctuates with new  assessments of the lasting influences on demand and potential supply  It is thus  necessarily only a rough approximation of the sustainable stance of policy over a  number of years—and one that the Committee has deviated from in the past for long  periods in the interest of stabilizing output and prices       Still, the real federal funds rate is far enough below a reasonable range of  estimates of its equilibrium value to indicate that policy will have to be tightened at  some point to forestall increasing inflation pressures  The balance of risks statement  is one way you have of informing the public and the markets about how you are  weighing your concerns about this longer-run inflation risk of the existing policy  stance against the nearer-term prospects for growth and inflation  With the funds rate  well below any plausible notion of its equilibrium, as time passes and if data are  reasonably close to expectations, the risk of rising inflation pressures should come  closer and increase, while concerns about shortfalls in growth should recede and  diminish  Adopting a statement of unbalanced risks toward heightened inflation  pressures at this meeting would convey that the Committee believes that this                          May 7, 2002 63 of 81  progression is occurring and has gone far enough to cause you to shift the major focus  of your concerns Although near-term growth forecasts have been marked down, the  first-quarter surprises mean that the levels of GDP and final demand are expected to  be at least as high in the second quarter as the staff had previously projected   Moreover, some developments over the intermeeting period—including further  indications of faster increases in health care costs, higher oil prices, and the decline in  the dollar—will be putting greater pressure on costs and prices than had been  expected In addition, as Dave emphasized, disentangling the signal about ongoing  structural productivity increases from the noise of one-off level changes in the recent  data has been especially difficult  If more of the recent gains turn out to be of the  one-time variety than the staff has inferred, increases in unit labor costs may not be as  well contained as in the staff forecast  A statement of inflation risks would have  particular appeal to the Committee if you thought that following the recent declines in  interest rates markets had not priced in adequate tightening soon enough  The  announcement of your heightened inflation concerns would tend to elevate rates  appreciably and well out the yield curve     In fact, both the market and the staff have seen the inflation risks receding a bit  over the intermeeting period, with expected tightening pushed out by at least one  meeting  If you shared this assessment that potential inflation pressures were, at  worst, no closer or stronger than in March, retention of the statement that risks were  balanced would seem to be appropriate  To be sure, near-term expectations about  policy in the financial markets are heavily influenced by your speeches and  statements  But interest rates have fallen appreciably all the way out to ten years, and  surveys tend to confirm that the public’s long-term inflation expectations remain  damped, despite the gentler and later trajectory for policy tightening and the rise in  energy prices   As I already discussed, the staff has marked down its forecast of inflation  pressures because of an assessment that output is further below its potential than  previously estimated  But as the Greenbook noted, a mechanical reading of recent  productivity would have justified raising structural productivity even further  If you  saw the incoming price, wage, and productivity data as suggesting that the level and  growth rate of potential output were more likely to be higher than estimated by the  staff than lower, inflation pressures would be even less than in the Greenbook  forecast and the turnaround in prices pushed out even further  Indeed, you might be  concerned that the possibility of higher potential output carried with it a risk that  inflation could run for a while at levels that would not provide an adequate cushion  for policy to operate against downside output shocks if they occurred  Such a  concern would reinforce the assessment that, for the foreseeable future, the threat to  your objectives from the longer-term risks of heightened inflation pressures were at  least balanced by the shorter-term risks of rising output gaps and declining inflation  rates   The market expects you to view the risks as balanced, and so such a statement  should have minimal effects on expected interest rates  As the Bluebook noted, from            May 7, 2002 64 of 81  the perspective of market participants, such a statement would not limit your future  flexibility inasmuch as many observers who anticipate a tightening in June or August  do not expect that you will first move to unbalanced risks to signal your intentions     Vince can comment on this since he did the Bluebook, but I believe the   dollar depreciation occurs after the Greenbook forecast period  So it’s after 2003 But you’re   right that after that point presumably a higher dollar would tend to damp the growth of output in   the United States, would damp inflation, and—other things being equal—would suggest a lower   path for the federal funds rate to achieve the same inflation outcomes      I think this is also a manifestation of a lingering difference between the   staff’s assessment of the strength of demand and the market’s assessment  Dave Stockton noted   that the market and the staff had come perhaps closer together as the market revised its   assessment down  But I think there is still some difference there  Market participants still have a   stronger increase in interest rates and probably implicitly a higher equilibrium rate built in than   we do, particularly after the downward revision in our equilibrium rate over the last intermeeting   period  "
6741,2002-06-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Committee has noted in its last few  announcements that the current stance of policy is accommodative, in large part to  signal that it appreciated that the current level of the federal funds rate is likely to be  inconsistent over time with its long-term goals for price stability and maximum  sustainable growth This policy stance was adopted to counteract the effects of some  very powerful restraints on aggregate demand—most notably the collapse of capital  spending and the decline in equity prices associated with a re-evaluation of the  demand for, and profitability of, capital goods  Working through the imbalances that  built up in the second half of the 1990s has depressed output and resource utilization  enough to put downward pressure on an already fairly modest core inflation rate  As  the economy began to stabilize late last year and to expand in recent months, the key  policy question has been whether the adjustment in the capital goods sector and in  expected profits has proceeded sufficiently, or other countervailing stimulative forces  have come into play, so that monetary policy should begin to move toward a more  neutral setting to forestall an eventual rise in inflation   In many respects, the news since your last meeting has supported an assessment  that the adjustment process has been progressing largely as expected  The staff  anticipated a slowdown in GDP growth along the lines experienced, as the boost from  the slower runoff in inventory waned and as growth in final sales moderated after a  surge in consumption and government spending in the fourth and first quarters   Economic activity has continued to advance, with industrial output increasing and  labor markets stabilizing  Importantly, as highlighted by the data this morning,  investment spending does look as if it has begun to recover, suggesting that the  correction of imbalances in the capital goods sector is well along  Core inflation has  continued to moderate this year, though by a little less than anticipated by the staff in  the last Greenbook And longer-term inflation expectations remain relatively low;  indeed, over the intermeeting period, the spread between nominal and indexed debt  reversed a considerable part of its previous run-up             June 25-26, 2002 109 of 179  More unexpected in recent weeks have been developments in financial markets   Through the close of business yesterday, the dollar had fallen around 4 percent  against other major currencies over the intermeeting period, the broadest stock price  index was down more than 7 percent, and most long-term interest rates had fallen  around ¼ percentage point To a considerable extent, these asset price adjustments  have reflected a response to economic news in line with the staff’s outlook for  activity and earnings, but short of the outsized expectations of market participants  It  is important to emphasize that, taken together, the net changes in asset prices over the  intermeeting period should have very little overall effect on the path of economic  activity and inflation going forward, at least when viewed from the perspective of the  staff model  This results because the restraint on aggregate demand from the drop in  stock market wealth is projected to be about offset over time by the boost to spending  and production from the lower dollar and interest rates   But it seems evident that financial markets are reacting as well to perceptions of  heightened risk and uncertainty that have the potential to damp spending in ways that  had not been anticipated or built into the model  To some extent, these perceptions  reflect the persistence and possible intensification of foreign conflicts and of turmoil  in key Latin America economies, which are seen as posing a greater risk of spilling  over to the domestic economy  The added uncertainty also represents another  lingering hangover from the late 1990s boom  The exposure of questionable practices  at an increasing number of US corporations has raised questions about governance  and transparency at firms more generally, reducing the confidence with which  investors can interpret recent history and anticipate the future  Greater uncertainty  and skittishness have been manifest in a marked increase in actual and expected  volatility in a number of financial markets  Moreover, credit risk premiums have  jumped in certain market segments and for the lower-rated borrowers who are  perceived to be most prone to corporate irregularities and most vulnerable to more- worried lenders Clearly, such market responses would tend to damp spending by the  businesses that now find the financial markets less hospitable  But heightened  anxiety about the future and about the cost and availability of finance could have  much broader effects by making both households and businesses more cautious, less  confident, and less willing to take risks in spending and investing    So long as the increase in uncertainty does not feed upon itself, the fundamentals  remain in place for a strengthening of demand over coming quarters for the reasons  presented in the chart show yesterday  With inventory-sales ratios quite low,  inventory investment should continue to contribute to increases in production—  though not by as much as in the first quarter  Growth in final demand should be  bolstered by expansive monetary policy, which is keeping real short-term and long- term interest rates low—at least for more creditworthy borrowers—supporting  household spending on homes and durable goods and enabling corporations to  strengthen balance sheets, leaving them better positioned to pursue profitable  investment opportunities  Stimulus to final demand from fiscal policy is reflected in  boosts to disposable income from tax cuts, in large increases in government spending,  and in greater incentives to purchase capital equipment that should begin to have                        June 25-26, 2002 110 of 179  significant effects over the next several quarters  As depreciation of the existing  capital stock and expanding sales continue to eat into any remaining capital overhang,  the normal accelerator process will begin to boost business spending, reinforcing the  special incentives to deepen capital given by tax law and the opportunities from  technological innovation The resulting productivity gains will continue to bolster  labor income and spending over time    In the staff forecast, nonetheless, the forces restraining spending lift only  gradually Not until next year does the economy expand at a rate fast enough to begin  to make significant inroads into excess resources  In effect, high margins of excess  production capacity, lower equity prices, cautious lenders and spenders, and moderate  expansion in our trading partners mute the economy’s response to stimulative  monetary and fiscal policy  As a consequence, in both the staff forecast and the  perfect foresight exercise in the Bluebook, holding the current accommodative stance  of policy for a time and raising the federal funds rate gradually thereafter is consistent  with maintaining inflation near its current relatively low level  Keeping policy  unchanged might have particular appeal when there is so little historical precedent to  judge the likely path for spending as the economy works through the effects of the  previous imbalances in capital goods and equity markets  With financial markets  skittish, core inflation still edging lower, and inflation expectations well anchored, the  Committee might see little to be lost by waiting to get a better fix on how demand is  likely to evolve   The Committee’s perception of the balance of risks to the outlook at an  unchanged policy stance might depend on how you weighed the various types of  information you received over the intermeeting period  The passage of time, together  with the economic data consistent with expectations that investment was turning  around, could imply that the odds on economic expansion falling short had declined  and that inflation risks had drawn closer—perhaps to the point where the latter now  were the more important threat to meeting your longer-term objectives  The belief  that the foreign exchange value of the dollar was likely to be trending substantially  lower over a considerable period would reinforce such a judgment    In contrast, should concerns continue to mount about global political and  economic developments and about the true state of finances of US corporations, the  resulting caution could cut into spending  Indeed, a few observers have read recent  financial market developments as raising the odds that your next action is more likely  to be an easing than a tightening, suggesting the possibility that the balance of risks  had tilted toward economic weakness  And in fact, financial markets this morning  have built in some odds of an easing in the October-November time frame   In the staff forecast, these greater uncertainties have not undermined the judgment  that fundamental forces will be strengthening the expansion and that policy will need  to tighten at some point, but they have pushed off the date at which inflation risks will  require firming to begin  If the Committee shares the assessment of the staff that  heightened inflation pressures are no closer now than they were in May, presumably           June 25-26, 2002 111 of 179  it would retain its assessment that the risks to its objectives are balanced  This is   what the markets expect, and the announcement of an unchanged policy along with   balanced risks should have little effect on asset prices  The heightened degree of   unsettlement in financial markets most recently, including this morning, might   strengthen the argument for not surprising market participants at this meeting unless   the Committee saw policy expectations now embedded in asset prices as seriously   misguided and potentially destabilizing  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I think they were about the same, but maybe Vince can give you a more   detailed explanation    I do think that in the staff’s assessment there isn’t much difference going   forward because in the staff forecast the NAIRU is 5¼ percent  "
6800,2002-08-13," He’s very sure!                                                                          August 13, 2002 4 of 92 "
6801,2002-08-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m used to speaking at these meetings after a   jolt of caffeine for me and for you!  The economy certainly has been working through a difficult   adjustment to previous overbuilding and overvaluation of the capital stock  This type of cycle is   highly unusual in post-World War II economic experience, and the Committee has been   uncertain as to how it would play out  I certainly saw this uncertainty at recent meetings as a bit   one-sided That is, my suspicion was that the rebound in aggregate demand could be a bit   weaker than the modal forecast and considerably weaker than the market seemed to expect  This         August 13, 2002 45 of 92  suspicion was balanced against a belief that the current stance of policy was unsustainably   accommodative over the long run  And that view about short-run shortfalls and long-run   accommodation produced a balanced risk assessment in our statements     In my opinion there were already hints before the last meeting that the process of   recovery might be encountering impediments  Those indications were largely in financial   markets where equity prices had declined  Risk spreads were starting to open up, importantly   under the influence of the uncertainty-heightening effects of accounting irregularities  The   economic data were better, but there was a question as to whether the uncertainties and doubts   manifest in financial markets would also show up in spending  The information becoming   available since the last meeting suggests that in fact they have—that demand is not strengthening   as much as expected  Businesses probably were always going to be responding cautiously to the   good fundamentals, given their experience with overbuilding  But the recent data suggest that   they are being even more cautious than we anticipated  We can see this in the hiring and new   orders data, which didn’t pick up to the degree expected at the end of the second quarter and the   beginning of the third  Judging from earnings forecasts, businesses have reduced their   expectations about sales And I think every Federal Reserve Bank president around the table   today has noted that business people in their Districts are less optimistic and are revising down   their expectations   Recent declines in commodity prices tend to confirm an easing in demand in the   industrial sector And as a number of you have pointed out, financial market conditions have   tightened in some respects, which could damp the growth of demand going forward  Markets are   reflecting this less optimistic outlook for sales and are carrying the added burden of working   through the uncertainty of how firms will be affected as financial results are restated  This is            August 13, 2002 46 of 92  affecting not only savers but also, as Dino noted, intermediaries  They are shying away from    making markets and taking positions  The resulting rise in risk premiums has lowered prices of    shares and lowered bond ratings Markets are much more volatile and brittle, reflecting   uncertainty and the lack of marketmaking  Indeed, the corporate bond market has virtually dried   up in the last month or so   Banks also are tightening terms, and accounting concerns have prompted them to be   much more cautious, demand more information, and enforce covenants more closely  As a   consequence, although the market response to weaker data has been to take out a good deal of   the expected policy tightening, this marking down of intermediate- and longer-term rates has not   flowed through to many business borrowers  Now, households are seeing lower rates in   mortgages, and that is bolstering housing prices and facilitating the unlocking of housing equity    But household wealth levels have fallen in recent months, and the greater risk aversion is   reflected in shifts from longer-term securities into money  Undoubtedly, skittish markets are   reinforcing business tendencies toward caution in spending and hiring, not only owing to the   adverse financing conditions but also to concerns about conserving cash in case their particular   firm is affected by future volatility in markets     This disappointing performance is not only a US phenomenon  Foreign industrial   economies now seem to be on a slower growth track, prices in their equity markets have been   marked down, and the perception that they’re facing a weaker outlook has kept the dollar from   falling All this implies that the United States will receive little help from the foreign sector in   terms of boosting demand  And Karen Johnson and Bill McDonough have pointed to the   downside risks in South America         August 13, 2002 47 of 92  I want to emphasize that these recent weaker indications do not in my mind undermine   the basic expectation that the expansion will proceed at least at a moderate clip  The growth in   household and government spending will bolster increases in demand and income  By and large,   excess stocks of capital inventories have been worked down  Weakness in investment spending   has abated, and investment fundamentals do look good  The earlier pickup in sales has activated   the accelerator Cash flow is improving, as gains in productivity and softness in labor markets   hold down labor costs And prices of high-tech capital equipment continue to plummet, giving   an inducement to purchase them  But I do have greater concern that it could be some time before   the rate of expansion is fast enough to begin to reduce margins of underutilized resources    Indeed, such margins could widen before they begin to narrow  As a consequence, inflation   could fall further before it stabilizes A limited shortfall or delay in the economic pickup   wouldn’t be much of a concern if we weren’t already at 1½ percent inflation, 6 percent   unemployment, and a 1¾ percent funds rate  But my thoughts on the implications for the   Committee’s posture policy going forward should wait for the next round of our discussion if   I’m to practice—at least in my first meeting as a Governor—what I’ve been preaching to the   Committee over the last fifteen years about separating the two discussions  [Laughter]  "
6802,2002-08-13," Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  Although I   am somewhat concerned about the potential for subpar output growth going forward, I think the   signs of that are relatively recent and derive from noisy high-frequency data and from   developments in the financial markets, which could turn around, particularly after we get through         August 13, 2002 78 of 92  the middle of this month  So in my view it’s far too early to ease policy at this point  There’s a   lot of uncertainty, as Governor Bernanke mentioned, and that in itself is perhaps enough to slow   the Committee down even if we thought the economy was going to be sluggish going forward  I   do favor the shift in the balance of risks because I believe the risks have, in fact, shifted  I think   the inflation concerns that might have been inherent in our stance of policy have been pushed   much further out into the future, in my mind beyond the foreseeable future perhaps  And that’s   partly because we do have some more downside risks  We’ve revised down the forecast  Nearly   everybody around the table has said they’ve revised down their forecast for the next few   quarters And there are downside risks to those forecasts  So, I see more downside risks on the   output side and less upside risks or certainly more distant upside risks on the inflation side    Moreover, I think financial markets would welcome a shift in the balance of risks   statement  It would reassure them that we understand that the landscape has changed  But it   should be coupled with a restatement of our expectation that expansion will continue  This isn’t   about double-dips Economic weakness in our statement refers to growth below potential not to   double-dips, and we should reinforce that view  It would liberate markets to build in more ease   if appropriate Unlike President Broaddus, I don’t see a zero real rate as a natural bound for   monetary policy If the economy is weak going forward, if output gaps appear to be increasing,   if unemployment gaps look as if they might be increasing, even without a recession I would be in   favor of easing policy And I believe that’s particularly important because of a point that   President Broaddus has made before, the starting point for the economy  We already have very   low inflation and a very low funds rate  Waiting to ease until the economy turned down or until   a major shock hit us would risk running into a situation that would be hard to deal with  So I   think we ought to move quickly if it becomes necessary  It’s not necessary right now  And we            August 13, 2002 79 of 92  ought to make sure that the markets can behave in a stabilizing fashion, particularly in the   current situation Thank you  "
6853,2002-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In its public statements the Committee has   been characterizing policy as accommodative since March, and real overnight interest rates have   been around zero and well below equilibrium levels since late last year  While the economy has   indeed proven quite resilient, as President Jordan noted, even after nearly a year there is no   evidence that output is headed back to—much less above—the level of the economy’s potential,   as might have been anticipated with this policy stance      September 24, 2002 64 of 115  Both the Committee and the staff have identified a number of factors counteracting the   effects of stimulative policy Many of them relate directly or indirectly to the unwinding of the   overbuilding and overvaluation of capital stocks in the late 1990s  Some of these restraining   forces abated late last year, as overhangs in inventory and capital goods were worked down in   many industries  And that contributed to the revival in economic activity this year  But some of   the forces actually intensified over the summer, and that threatens to damp growth going   forward In particular, an unusual mid-recovery heightening of perceptions of risk this spring   and summer greatly widened credit spreads and decreased equity prices     In reaction to these same perceptions and to their financial market consequences,   business caution—our umbrella term for the residual and not quite understood shortfall in   spending—also seemed to intensify  This was related in part to the accounting scandals but not   entirely, in my view Equity prices began to drop sharply and credit spreads to widen before the   collapse of WorldCom  And I think both investors and businesses are having trouble, as are we,   understanding how this investment cycle will unfold    That mystery has been deepened by the behavior of productivity  In contrast to the   second half of the 1990s, businesses have been able to realize huge increases in efficiency   without much capital deepening  These productivity gains boost household and business income,   but the drive to take advantage of new technologies has provided less of an impetus to business   spending than I had anticipated earlier this year     The reasonable expectation is that these forces will abate over time, allowing the effects   of policy stimulus to show through The key question is how fast that will occur  We’ve gotten   some mixed news on this over the intermeeting period  The ambiguous consequences of     September 24, 2002 65 of 115  productivity increases persist inasmuch as we appear to be experiencing another large gain with   slow growth in the capital stock   On the positive side of the ledger, credit markets have stabilized, allowing bond issuance   to resume  We did get through August 14 without major new disruptions or tidbits of bad news    Moreover, and importantly, private final demand has turned out somewhat stronger than   anticipated Projections of both consumption and investment have been revised up for the third   quarter But whether these upward revisions portend stronger growth ahead has been thrown   into doubt by anecdotes, earnings warnings, and further substantial declines in equity prices,   which indicate that private-sector gloom has not lifted and may even have deepened  And labor   markets remain weak, evidencing business caution about new hiring and limiting gains in   household income     There is no reason to expect that these restraining forces will go away very fast and in the   staff forecast they lift gradually—gradually enough that the growth of the economy does not   exceed the growth of its potential until late next year  In effect, the bad news is seen as already   in the markets and reflected in business decisionmaking  As the economy continues to expand,   equity prices should strengthen, risk premiums narrow, businesses become more confident, and   previous declines in household wealth weigh less on spending  But all this is projected to   happen relatively slowly—even with the existing policy stimulus—so that output gaps persist    This seems to me a reasonable forecast, given what we now know  But it’s important to   recognize that we are in uncharted territory in my view, especially when it comes to business   investment     The resulting trajectory for the economy is not all that bad  Output growth does pick up   over time, eventually exceeding the growth rate of the economy’s potential, and over the forecast     September 24, 2002 66 of 115  period inflation declines slightly from recent levels  But that outlook is not entirely satisfactory   either, as Governor Gramlich just pointed out  Inflation is already about as low as it ought to go   in my view  Society is gaining little in exchange for the lost output implicit in an economy    operating below its potential Moreover, a decline in inflation does leave the economy more   vulnerable in the event of further negative shocks that the Federal Reserve could find difficult to   counter, given the already low nominal funds rate This may not be a major risk in the staff   forecast, where inflation doesn’t fall much  But if the decline in inflation is not minimal—if the   path of disinflation were steeper because demand was a little weaker or potential output a little   higher than in the staff forecast—it would be a more important concern   To be sure, our ability to move the “not all that bad” outcome toward the optimal may be   limited, given uncertainties about the economy and the effects of policy actions  And even if   improvement were thought to be possible, now may not be the time to give it a try  We can talk   about that later, but I do think the greatest challenge to policymaking in this and the next several   meetings is not likely to be the threat of a relapse into recession on the one hand or the   intensification of inflation pressures from easy policy on the other  Rather, like the Vice   Chairman, I see the challenge as whether the risks and costs of an extended period in which the   economy is growing but only moderately and where progress in eroding the margin of   underutilized resources seems unlikely will justify an adjustment of policy  "
6854,2002-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support both aspects of your   recommendation  With inflation about as low as I believe it should go and with the possibility of   persistent output gaps and further declines in inflation, I would argue that the principal threat to   good economic performance is subpar growth  And I certainly think our statement ought to   continue to make that point   I’m not yet ready to lower rates to address my concerns without more evidence  I do give   some weight to the stronger data on private spending that we’ve gotten over the intermeeting   period Especially in light of the difficulty of forecasting and the uncertainties, I’m willing to   wait for added information though, like Governor Ferguson, I wonder whether it really will   clarify everything or raise new uncertainties          September 24, 2002 93 of 115  If the incoming data over the intermeeting period confirm the weaker picture portrayed in   the anecdotes that we’ve heard around the table, then I think the Committee does need to give   serious consideration to easing the stance of policy further  As to whether that should be at a   meeting or between meetings, I think the Committee has been well served by trying to keep   actions at meetings  I don’t think November 6 is a problem  It’s the day after the election  It   would be a problem if it looked as if we had put off taking an action until after the election  So I   think it would be appropriate to move intermeeting, if the data suggest that that’s the right thing   to do, or at the meeting if we can wait     Not the reasons but what the dissenter would have preferred to do  "
6907,2002-11-06," I agree with the Vice Chairman’s recommendation  It seems to me that   acquiring Ginnie Maes is a very natural extension of what we’re doing now  We already buy full   faith and credit paper; it’s not obvious why we’re not buying this other full faith and credit paper    I think it also may be a useful pilot project for learning how to outsource some of our functions,   dealing with more-complex securities, and dealing with other intermediaries  So I think we’ll   learn a lot by studying this that might be useful sometime down the line   I also think the ACF work is terrific, and an ACF has a lot of appeal  But we’ve put into   place some other emergency facilities, including the emergency primary credit facility associated   with the new Lombard facility and backup for the Desk  So I don’t feel that we need to develop   an ACF in order to get a CACF the way I thought we did a year or two ago  We have other            November 6, 2002 104 of 122  backups now So the ACF is a more radical proposal in a sense  It has more problems   associated with it, though I like the proposal if we have to go that way  And I certainly thank   Rick and his people for the incredible amount of work they did on this paper  We can keep it on   the shelf and come back to it and see whether we think it’s a good idea once we deal with the   Ginnie Mae issue So, I agree with the Vice Chairman  "
6908,2002-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In our discussions and announcements we have   been counting on policy accommodation and elevated productivity growth to boost the rate of   economic expansion and over time to begin to close the output gap  The logic is impeccable, but   it’s not happening Recent data confirm the sour anecdotes about flagging demand, production,   and employment that we’ve heard from the summer on and that have been so evident in reports               November 6, 2002 59 of 122  from Reserve Banks and other sources  Smoothing through the monthly data with their   distortions from changing auto incentives and shifting seasonals, and taking the staff forecast for   the fourth quarter at its face value, it’s evident that economic expansion has slowed from the first   to the second half of the year Importantly, this has reflected a downshift in the growth of private   domestic final demand rather than the speed-up we expected  The weakness in investment   persists, and now consumption growth is tapering off Moreover, the weakness is global    Growth is slowing in many places and, as Karen remarked, it reflects shortfalls in domestic   demand abroad, not just a reaction to slower US growth    It’s not entirely clear why the strong fundamentals are not showing through  It does seem   likely that the geopolitical risks we have cited—concern about terrorism, war, and oil prices—   have made people more cautious, especially businesses in their investment decisions  More   basically, the backwash of the previous capital spending boom has proven stronger and more   persistent than anticipated  This is evident not only in lingering capital overhangs in a few   sectors but also in continuing suspicions that corporations still have more residual bad news to   reveal and considerable uncertainty about how an unusual business cycle led by capital spending   will work itself out     Among other atypical developments, business failures, defaults, and downgrades have   continued to mount even after three quarters with average growth of 3 percent  And despite the   efforts of businesses to trim costs, which have been reflected in astonishing productivity   numbers, the rebound in profits has been limited, in effect stalling out in recent quarters    Disappointment with growth and profits and the perception of heightened risk and uncertainty   have had a marked effect on financial markets  And reactions in those markets are reinforcing         November 6, 2002 60 of 122  the caution in business and household spending, in part by offsetting the effects of policy easing   on financial conditions   Like President Poole, I was thinking about the degree of monetary accommodation we   have Although the Committee has reduced the federal funds rate by 175 basis points since   September 11, 2001, and the ten-year Treasury rate has come down 80 basis points, the BBB   corporate rate—a good proxy for the long-term borrowing costs facing the median corporation—   has actually risen 20 basis points over this period  Stock prices are off 15 percent, and the broad   exchange rate index is about unchanged In addition, with the credit status of businesses   changing rapidly, markets are quick to price in possible problems  In other words, in several key   dimensions, financial conditions are tighter and markets less receptive than they were before the   current degree of policy accommodation was put in place  Against this economic and financial   background perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that policy accommodation is being felt primarily   in the housing market, where rates have followed Treasury yields, and that businesses are   conserving resources by holding back on capital spending and hiring   Looking forward, I think the contours of the staff forecast—a gradual lifting of gloom   and restraint and a strengthening of demand—are as good a guess as any, given the uncertainties   that Dave emphasized A high proportion of the credit and transparency problems accumulated   during the boom period should already have emerged, suggesting that defaults and downgrades   should level off and begin to decline along with earnings restatements, thus helping to reduce   risk premiums in markets  And this should contribute to a pickup in equity prices, further   lowering the negative tug from the wealth effect  The jump in equity prices, the rise in long-term   yields, and the decline in some risk premiums over the intermeeting period suggest that financial   markets already see light at the end of the tunnel  But on many occasions in recent memory such               November 6, 2002 61 of 122  a light turned out to be an oncoming train  Continued strength in housing attests to households’   underlying willingness to spend  At some point, some of the geopolitical uncertainty should   begin to dissipate, and we do need to recall the natural resiliency of the economy—its tendency   to return to high levels of production when there are no impediments  This resiliency produced   surprisingly strong results only a few quarters ago   But the pickup envisioned is gradual and projected  The data are going the other way    As a consequence, the economy looks as if it will be on a lower track, operating with a higher   and possibly rising level of slack and greater disinflationary—or even possibly deflationary—   pressures than we expected, while inflation is already as low as I would like to see it go  And the   automatic stabilizing properties of the financial markets have been short-circuited by heightened   perceptions of and aversion to risk  So if I can edge just a bit into the second half of the   meeting—after all I’ve been good for two meetings and that’s about as much as one can   expect—I do think it’s time for a little extra push from this Committee to enhance the odds of a   vigorous rebound from the weaker level of activity now in process  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6909,2002-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your recommendation    As for the 50 basis point cut, I think we need it  Recent data are sufficiently worrisome and the   most likely forecast is sufficiently tepid to justify 50 basis points  And I do think it would feed   through to long-term interest rates  Looking at Vincent’s chart of the upward-sloping expected   federal funds rates, if the markets see us moving a little more aggressively, I think that could   flatten that chart out a little, and the effect would feed through to longer-term interest rates  And   for the reasons that Governors Gramlich and Bernanke noted, I think that would help the   economy            November 6, 2002 89 of 122  I was particularly taken, Mr Chairman, by your description of the costs of missing on   either side With a sizable output gap and low inflation and inflation expectations, the odds on   easing so much now that we produce inflation down the road seem very, very small  But if   weakness persists or if the economy is subject to a downside shock, the costs of moving too   timidly at this stage could be considerable    On the balance of risks, this is a tough call in large measure because, whatever we do,   sluggish growth and declining inflation are the most likely outcome for a few quarters  But in   my mind the more aggressive action does buy a degree of assurance about more-satisfactory   outcomes over the slightly longer term  And from that perspective, however murky it may be,   the risks may well be about balanced  Moreover, I am concerned that retaining the unbalanced   risk assessment along with a 50 basis point reduction in rates could leave the impression that the   Federal Reserve sees the economic situation as more serious than I believe it probably is and that   we’re willing to cut rates further than I believe we should with the information now in hand    "
6960,2002-12-10," Thank you When I supported the assessment of balanced risks at the last   FOMC meeting, I recognized that I was balancing near-term economic weakness with the   enhanced prospects for robust growth over the longer term after our 50 basis point easing  It was   a close call, as many noted  Although developments since the last meeting have been decidedly   mixed—if that’s not an oxymoron—on balance they have made me just a little more comfortable   in that judgment   One element of that is a reduced concern about near-term downside risks  With   businesses holding back on investment and hiring, what was most worrisome was the possibility   that consumption was showing signs of falling off and that, especially with a weak labor market,   households could pull back even more than they were already showing signs of doing  In the   event, although labor markets indeed remained tepid, consumption has come in only slightly   short of expectations Housing activity appears to be a tad stronger than anticipated, and   consumer confidence is off the lows of last fall     I also think we have had some support, albeit very faint, for the forecast of stronger   growth ahead For some time the key to that outlook has been diminishing uncertainty and risk   aversion and stronger capital spending  The positive news on uncertainty and risk aversion   comes from the financial markets, as many of us have noted  Equity prices, although falling   back in recent days, generally have held the gains registered since early October  Despite further   decreases in expected profits as read from projections of equity analysts, the implied reduction in   risk premiums on equity has been manifest as well in the credit markets, where bond spreads         December 10, 2002 49 of 87  have continued to drop substantially  Obviously, this narrowing did not reflect any diminution of   geopolitical risks Rather, like President Minehan, I suspect it was the response to the decline in   near-term downside risks I just mentioned and also perhaps to a perception that businesses and   financial markets are making progress in working through the after-effects of the boom years of   the late 1990s As time goes by without major new revelations of financial chicanery or   misrepresentation and as the size and the number of earnings restatements declines, investors   may become less fearful about severe downside surprises left over from that era     The improvement in financial markets is important because it could indicate that the   concerns of businesses and households more generally are decreasing from the extraordinarily   elevated levels of last summer and early fall In addition, not only has the better tone in financial   markets put a floor under household wealth, it also has facilitated long-term business financing,   with both bond and equity issuance picking up in November from very depressed levels    Stronger balance sheets, by affording businesses a measure of protection against the   consequences of downside risks, may make firms more willing to respond to favorable   fundamentals like an acceleration in sales and the declining cost of capital  In fact, the pickup in   equipment and software spending has already been under way, and the new data for this category   of investment have pointed to a slightly greater upward tilt in the trajectory than previously   expected E&S spending both for the third and fourth quarters of this year has been revised up,   so now the second half of the year is appreciably stronger than the first  It’s much too early to   call this the kind of strengthening trend we’re all looking for to boost growth in the year ahead    Still, it is encouraging that the new orders data were sufficiently good to lead the staff to boost   their projection of growth in E&S expenditures in the first quarter from the higher level now   expected to prevail at the end of the year  This first-quarter projection is for a fairly strong pace,         December 10, 2002 50 of 87  and there may be downside risks But even with some shortfall from this projection, the upward   trend would still be in place   Notably, the pickup in E&S investment this year—and its further acceleration in the   forecast—occurs with an ongoing lack of pricing power  Fortunately, pricing power is not   necessary for businesses to perceive profitable opportunities in new investment because many of   us, myself included, wouldn’t mind seeing overall inflation sustained somewhere around its   current level  What is required is that firms are able to anticipate that the revenue from capital   investment will exceed its cost by enough to provide an attractive margin  When revenue is   constrained by stable output prices, other sources of revenue growth must be found, or costs   must be compressed   In the outlook, increases in unit sales and greater productivity of capital should provide   opportunities to raise revenue streams  Moreover, restraint on compensation growth, increases in   labor productivity, declines in the cost of high-tech equipment, and savings from replacing worn-  out equipment should be sufficient to hold down costs  Beyond early hints of diminished   uncertainty and stronger investment spending, it now seems more likely that additional fiscal   stimulus will be boosting growth down the road     I recognize that I’ve been accentuating the positive aspects of a very mixed set of   intermeeting developments, and that the negatives, including the employment report and retreat   of equity prices, have been prominent in recent days  The firming in activity out of the current   soft spot is still a forecast, not a reality, and one that has plenty of downside risks even in the   absence of a new shock But for the first time in many meetings, there have been some favorable   developments  And the new information on balance has at least been consistent with the         December 10, 2002 51 of 87  possibility of a strengthening economy next year, and it did not indicate a softer economy and   greater downside risks than I had anticipated  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
6961,2002-12-10," I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman         December 10, 2002 74 of 87 "
7015,2003-01-28,"  Governor Ferguson, as the Speaker of the House will say tonight, I have   the great privilege and high honor of nominating Alan Greenspan to be Chairman and William J   McDonough to be Vice Chairman of this Committee     Conflict of interest!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This discussion has gone on awhile, so let me   make just a few points  One is that I’d remind Brian Sack that people sat around this table in   October 1979 and made the same argument he just made—that a policy that induced volatility in   short-term rates would not get passed through to long-term rates because it would stabilize the   economy  And what we found was that the short-term volatility did feed through to long-term   rates over the next three years in part because expectations weren’t very well anchored and   seeing the rate move around in an unpredictable way actually did feed through to long-term rates    There was a paper on this in the staff studies of the new operating procedures   I guess I come out between the two positions in your presentations to a certain extent  As   I’ve observed the Committee over time, I think there are elements of gradualism in its   policymaking but not as much as seems to show up in the data  There are a number of   occasions—like 1994, as you’ve pointed out—when the Committee thought it wanted to go some   distance but didn’t want to get there really fast because it was worried about financial fragility or   other things  Actually, despite the chart, I think there was a bit of that in early 2001 when, once   the Committee started to ease, a number of members thought the Committee probably needed to   move the funds rate down a couple of percentage points but it took three or four months to get   there  On the other hand, my observation is that most of the time when we leave this room we   think the rate is pretty close to where we believe it needs to be—not very far away—and we’re   not looking ahead to long runs of further easing or tightening  So in that case I agree with Glenn    I think an important issue is the serial correlation of forecasting errors that Vincent talked about    We learn slowly over time about the shocks and the way the economy is responding to them    Those answers reveal themselves to us after the economy is shocked  We learn over time how   big the shock is, and then we react as we get that information     January 28-29, 2003 41 of 195    With respect to the strength of our responses to output gaps and inflation gaps, I think the   Committee hasn’t been as gradual or as damped in its responses as the equations say it has  In   my view there are a couple of points indicative of biases there  One is that the Committee has   been forward-looking, so we’re really looking at forecasts and not at existing output gaps  We   can often bring information to bear that says that a particular shock will likely go away and we   don’t need to react so strongly to it  So I think the wrong stuff is on the right-hand side of these   Taylor rules; the Committee is doing much more than looking at the current levels of those two   gaps  The second point is that these estimates are made on the assumption of a constant inflation   target, in this case from 1987 through the present  I don’t want to get into a discussion of   whether it should or should not have been constant  But I do believe that, from 1987 at least into   the second part of the 1990s, the Committee surely did not have a constant inflation target  A   number of the former members of this Committee talked about an opportunistic approach to   reducing inflation  Inflation was higher than it needed to be over the long run, but there wasn’t   any extraordinary effort to reduce it  The models wanted us to be stronger in reducing inflation   because they had a lower inflation target than the Committee and the Committee didn’t react to   the model’s target but to its own  I think that biases the results to finding that the Committee   didn’t act as aggressively as the models thought it should, when in fact it acted fairly   aggressively—and aggressively enough to get some pretty darn good outcomes for the economy   over the past twenty years   Having said that, I think there is a valuable lesson embedded here, and it goes to the   discussion you were having about policy mistakes  It’s better generally for policy to act too   strongly than too weakly to developing situations  Serious policy errors have been made when   policy doesn’t react aggressively enough to a developing situation  Examples are the Federal   January 28-29, 2003 42 of 195    Reserve in the 1970s or the Bank of Japan in the 1990s  That is the sort of policy error that   allows expectations to get out in front  It allows a spiral to develop that becomes very, very hard   to reverse  If we react too aggressively, that also can be a policy mistake  But tightening too   much because we’re afraid of inflation or easing too much because we’re concerned about   deflation or recession is much more easily reversed without cumulating expectational problems   getting built in  So to me the lesson for the Committee from these optimal rules is that we are   probably better off being a little too aggressive than being not aggressive enough in terms of the   possible consequences for the economy over time       We can do the psychiatric examinations, but I hope they’re not subject to   FOIA!  [Laughter]  "
7016,2003-01-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy remains suspended between   ongoing weakness in the here and now and prospects for future strength, and we’ve seen a bit   more evidence supporting each of these sides over the intermeeting period  There’s a long list of   factors pointing to a strengthening trend for economic growth over the intermediate to longer   January 28-29, 2003 119 of 195    run, and a number of these have become more compelling over the intermeeting period  Real   interest rates for businesses have declined further—substantially for below-investment-grade   businesses—partly reflecting reduced perceptions of risks on the part of lenders  These reduced   perceptions were fed by the continued absence of new revelations of corporate wrongdoing and   some sense that the credit problems accumulated during the boom period are beginning to top   out  Fiscal policy is poised to be more expansionary than previously anticipated and perhaps   even more so than in the staff forecast if the unemployment rate edges higher as seems likely    Estimates of underlying productivity growth have been revised up  Rapid increases in   productivity should support business and household incomes  The household response to low   interest rates and continued growth in incomes has been even greater than expected, supporting   ongoing strength in housing and consumer durables spending  The resulting upward revision to   private final sales in the fourth quarter leaves a more convincing upward trend in final demand   from the first to the second halves of 2002  This should eventually underpin a pickup in   investment  The favorable fundamentals of accelerating sales, high cash flow, and a low cost of   capital should lead to much stronger investment demand over time  Stocks of inventories and   capital have been reduced considerably relative to the putative level of final sales at the   economy’s potential, and capital is wearing out rapidly  Replacement cycles have already been   stretched out, and unless they are further extended, replacement should begin to show through to   spending  This is a trend we can already see in computers  Credit markets seem pretty well   convinced that stronger growth is coming  Not only have we seen a decline in risk spreads, but   also the yield curve remains unusually steeply upward sloped, as steep as in the past when   recessions were about to be over   January 28-29, 2003 120 of 195    But these positive factors have yet to show through convincingly in the data    Importantly, business investment continues to disappoint, not yet showing signs of a sustained   upturn, and largely as a consequence, the economy remains weak  Undoubtedly war jitters and   other geopolitical risks are playing a key role in this, but we can’t be sure how big a role  As   several people remarked yesterday, “geopolitical risk” is an all-purpose label we’re putting on   forecast errors and equation residuals  [Laughter]     My sense is that the risks to the intermediate-term to longer-term outlook are skewed   toward even greater acceleration in output, but these risks are balanced by a skew toward   economic underperformance in the near term that could have important consequences for the   economy  Most prominently among the longer-term upside risks, business spending could snap   back sharply—even more sharply than in the staff forecast—as international uncertainties abate,   as financial markets’ skittishness continues to wane with fewer problems of governance and   credit, and as the ongoing rise in final sales bolsters confidence about the future  In the current   environment, as I already noted, considerably more fiscal stimulus is a distinct possibility and   that stimulus might well take effect just as the economy was recovering in any event    In terms of the downside risks to the near term, I think genuine geopolitical risks could   continue to damp demand to a considerable degree—either because the Iraq situation takes   longer to resolve or because situations arise that create new uncertainties in the manner of the   Korean and Venezuelan developments of recent months  Or we could find that factors other than   geopolitical risks are really restraining demand  This business-investment-led cycle is a new   experience for most of us  Recently the Chairman and a visiting economist engaged in a   dialogue about the recession of 1846 as a comparable episode, [laughter] but that was a little   before my time   Protracted near-term weakness for whatever reason, despite forecasts of strong   January 28-29, 2003 121 of 195    future growth, could present a difficult challenge for the Committee at a future meeting    Inflation is already low and poised to decline further, perhaps by more than the staff has   projected, given the much steeper declines that we’ve seen in recent years in price indexes other   than core PCE  That by itself is probably not a problem  It shouldn’t feed back much on   demand provided that inflation expectations don’t ratchet down substantially, which would raise   the real funds rate and lower asset prices  In the “low NAIRU” simulation in the Greenbook, the   expansion continues as projected  But it does leave the economy more exposed to downward   shocks in the sense that, with inflation expectations likely to be at least a little lower, the zero   bound is a greater constraint on our ability to reduce real interest rates  If that situation threatens,   we may need to recall the lesson I was drawing yesterday afternoon—that mistakes of overly   aggressive policy are more easily reversed than those of a policy that gets behind the curve    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7017,2003-01-28,  I support your recommendation  
7078,2003-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not sure I can follow that gloomy   assessment and alleviate it very much  Like others around the table, I’ve focused on our struggle   to sort out the restraining near-term effects of the war concerns from the more fundamental   factors affecting of the economy  Unfortunately, the picture became even murkier over the   intermeeting period  I do think we need to remember that the January data on consumption and   especially on investment raised hopes that the anticipated strengthening in demand was under   way before the economy seemed to hit a wall in February  We are dealing with what is   fortunately a most unusual, extraordinary situation—with the country on the brink of a long-  anticipated war  What is also unusual is that this war could be deflationary rather than   inflationary as the vast majority of the wars through history have been  That’s because the usual   pressures on resources from fighting the war could be outweighed by the negative effects on   private demand of a disruption to oil supplies and of heightened uncertainty  But it may well be   that the maximum deflationary impact is occurring in the lead-up to the war rather than the war   itself  It’s in the anticipation stage that uncertainty is greatest and that markets price in some   odds on major oil field disruptions  Surely, these sorts of considerations along with some very   nasty weather, at least along the East Coast—it’s always nasty in Chicago  [Laughter]     You folks in Chicago wouldn’t even have noticed it if you had had this   storm!  Seasonally adjusted, it’s always spring in Chicago  Very nasty weather along the East   Coast had a major effect on the data for employment, production, and sales in February  The rise   in energy prices since late last year, reflected in gasoline and home heating expenses,   undoubtedly sapped consumer spending directly  Moreover, the higher gasoline prices and   uncertainty about future gasoline prices may have played a role in weakening auto sales,   especially if that uncertainty caused people to postpone decisions     Governor Bernanke noted at the last meeting that, the closer the event with uncertain   outcomes, the higher the hurdle rate for investment  It’s not surprising that many different kinds   of business commitments—hiring as well as spending on capital goods—were pushed back  It   strikes me that today’s housing data may suggest that decisions on home purchases and housing   investment could be affected as well by the heightened uncertainty  Certainly this uncertainty is   reflected in equity markets, where the equity premium—a key element in what is in effect a   hurdle rate for buying the existing capital stock—has risen sharply  Undoubtedly as   uncertainties abate, the markets will improve—as we’ve already seen in the last few days—and   this improvement will allow stronger fundamentals to show through     Nonetheless, we don’t know how strong the fundamentals are  We can’t completely   dismiss the possibility that the February data were also signaling a less robust strengthening in   demand than we had anticipated  That’s certainly the way the credit markets seemed to interpret   the new information, especially the February employment report  Interest rates were marked   down across the yield curve, with declines in forward rates in the five-to-seven-year range   accounting for the largest decreases  A portion of the earlier drop in equity prices seemed to   March 18, 2003 52 of 101    reflect not only higher equity premiums but downward revisions to earnings and revenue   forecasts, which were probably only tangentially related to war fears     At this point, however, it is simply not possible to sort out the relative strength of the   various influences on the economy or financial markets  The staff based its forecast on the   current structure of prices and rates and financial markets because it was the only sensible   default mode  The lower equity prices, in particular, played a role in weakening the forecast a   touch  But those prices and rates, as Dave pointed out, reflect the means of some very skewed   and strangely dispersed distributions  All we know for sure is that, as the situation unfolds and   various outcomes get more or less probability weight, those prices and rates will change—and   possibly by quite a lot as we’ve seen in the last few days  Moreover, a good part of that   unfolding will occur relatively soon, and a reasonable presumption is that the forecast will   change too, perhaps significantly     Personally, I suspect that our next action is more likely to be an easing than a tightening    I base that on the possibility that at least a little of the February weakness reflected continued   underlying softness and broader business uncertainty and on the possibility that geopolitical risk   could continue to weigh on oil prices, sentiment, and spending for a while  I combine these   possibilities, however small, with the notion that at this stage of the economic cycle—with a   sizable output gap and low and declining inflation—the consequences from inadvertently having   policy a little too tight would be far more adverse than the consequences from having it a little   too easy  But I don’t have any real conviction about the next policy action  We’ll have more   information about unfolding events and their potential effects soon  Over the near term, much of   that information will come from reactions in financial and oil markets, as underlying trends in   spending will only slowly reveal themselves  These markets will be noisy  Undoubtedly they’ll   March 18, 2003 53 of 101    overreact, driven by hopes and fears as much as by a clear-eyed reading of the course of the   economy, so extracting the important signals could be difficult  But given my lack of conviction   about the future and my sense that market signals will be important and over time helpful, I think   the Federal Reserve should not be trying to steer markets at this point  Like many others who   have already commented, I think it’s time to admit our ignorance, get out of the way, and let   events and their reactions unfold  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7079,2003-03-18,"  I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman  I think, as I noted in my   comments, that we really don’t know enough to say anything  I would also agree with President   Hoenig in that I would try to stay away from building up expectations in the market that we are   about to do something  Although we may get clarification over the next few weeks, I think the   probabilities are very high that we could get to the next meeting before we have an idea—and   even then it might not be really clear—of where things are going  "
7127,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the answer to President Minehan’s   questioners—who I suspect are really her alter egos or perhaps she’s been speaking into the   mirror in the mornings—as to what will lead to higher growth ahead is that some of the factors   restraining growth over the last few quarters should be abating  Many of the developments over   the intermeeting period have made me a little more confident in that judgment  It seems to me   more likely that the expansion will indeed strengthen going forward and break out of the   1 percent to 2 percent growth path that it has been on since last summer   As others have observed, the ebbing of geopolitical risks has bolstered confidence,   lowered the oil price tax faster than anticipated, and fostered better conditions in financial   markets  The signs of improvement go beyond the reduction in geopolitical risks  Increasingly,   it looks as though the restraint is lifting from the other persistent force we have cited as holding   back the economy—the unwinding of the excesses of the late 1990s  These include the fallout   from bad credit decisions, deficiencies in corporate governance and transparency, the drop in   equity prices, and the overshoot in capital spending  Risk spreads in credit markets have more   than retraced their run-up of last summer, appropriately so in my view since bond default rates   have also come down substantially  Market reactions to occasional new revelations of corporate   malfeasance have been much more measured, suggesting that investors have greater confidence   in the information they are getting from most businesses even before they’ve had the benefit of   new leadership at the Accounting Oversight Board!  [Laughter]  As could be seen in Dino’s   May 6, 2003 54 of 115    charts, the implied volatilities in bond and stock markets have also fallen to the levels of last   spring  As a consequence, although surely some of the caution from governance scandals is   lingering in business decisions, the cost of capital to businesses has decreased, and firms need to   have much less concern about conserving cash for fear of overreaction to earnings   announcements in skittish markets   Equity prices have not retraced all of their losses of last summer, but they are well off   their lows of that time and have been for a while so that the force of the negative wealth effect   should be decreasing over time  The latest real side data show a little less weakness in   nonresidential construction  The most recent data do indicate a tentative pickup in orders for   equipment, reinforcing the assessment that most capital overhangs have largely dissipated and   raising hopes that replacement demand may be strengthening  Moreover, demand will be further   supported by a lower dollar, which notably has occurred without any perceptible adverse effects   on US asset prices  Surely lower oil prices, greater consumer confidence, and more   accommodative financial conditions will work together with stimulative fiscal and monetary   policies and continuing gains in real income from rising productivity to strengthen growth  You   can try that in the mirror, Cathy, to see if it works    But as the Chairman noted in his recent testimony, the extent and timing of the pickup are   uncertain We still don’t have enough new information to sort out whether the marked   weakening in February and March was almost entirely related to the close onset of war or also   reflected more-persistent problems that will damp the upturn  We still don’t have enough   information to judge how much the better conditions will feed through to spending and   production  What is not uncertain is that whatever recovery the economy experiences will be   starting from a much weaker position than I had expected just a few months ago  The data we’ve   May 6, 2003 55 of 115    received over the last two intermeeting periods were considerably softer than I had anticipated,   and my expectations for growth this year have been revised down a lot since January  In   addition, consumer inflation has come down faster than I thought it would     The staff has interpreted what we’ve seen as partly reflecting weaker underlying demand   as well as war-related jitters  So, the level of output in the Greenbook remains below the level of   the January forecast through the entire projection period  Even so, the staff has incorporated a   prompt and sharp strengthening of growth in coming months just to hold the economy on a   slightly lower path  These judgments seem reasonable, though as I just implied it may be too   early to make this call with much confidence    As for the risks, I don’t have anything useful to add to the sense of risk on both the upside   and the downside that Dave and many of you have mentioned  What I do want to emphasize is   that this lower starting point for activity and prices makes a rebound of at least the dimensions   and persistence envisioned in the staff forecast—if not a stronger rebound—all the more critical   for economic welfare, and it has potentially important implications for policy  The output gap is   wider than expected; and without a very strong rebound, it will remain wider at a time when   there is no reason to accept the loss of income and production longer than necessary  Moreover,   the slack in resource utilization implies that inflation is poised to go lower from levels already   consistent with price stability  I don’t believe the current low inflation rate is itself an   impediment to economic prosperity  I don’t see evidence, for example, that the zero bound on   wages is raising actual or steady-state unemployment rates  My guess is that most of the   bellyaching about the lack of pricing power or current inflation rates would evaporate if demand   were stronger and capital utilization rates higher    May 6, 2003 56 of 115    But there are risks from low and declining inflation rates  For the most part inflation   expectations have been stable  I’m not sure, however, that people have taken on board the very   low level of underlying inflation  Especially if that inflation falls much further, inflation   expectations could decrease in coming quarters as headline inflation moves lower following the   energy price declines  This would tend to raise real interest rates, absent offsetting policy action    Also, even at high levels of employment, very low, steady-state inflation—by keeping the federal   funds rate and other interest rates down—could limit our room to maneuver were the economy   subsequently to be hit with a downward shock  Such risks at the current rate of underlying   inflation or one that was only a few tenths lower probably aren’t large  But I would be   concerned if it looked as though we were on a glide path that would leave inflation at   considerably lower levels  For all these reasons, it’s important that we soon see the economy   strengthening, and by quite a bit, in order to reduce the output gap and limit the decline in   inflation  I’m looking forward to the discussion of the stance of monetary policy in light of this   imperative  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7128,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation and the   announcement as drafted largely for the reasons that President Poole just stated  I also would   have been comfortable if you had recommended a slight cut in rates and that had been possible   given the market situation  I agree, too, that the risk–reward tradeoff is tilted in such a way that I   would rather be a little too easy rather than a little too tight, so I’d take my chances on that side    But in that regard I think we do get a lot of benefit from this statement by breaking up the   balance of risks  I might note that I don’t think Roger did quite as bad a job in constructing the   old balance of risk statement as he averred in his statement  To me it didn’t quite have the   tradeoff in it that you said it did  But the fact that you thought it did and that others were   confused by it suggests that it is certainly inadequate to the current situation  So I consider it   very helpful to unbundle the risks  I think highlighting the downside risks on inflation will be   very beneficial by letting the world know what we are worried about  It reinforces the last   paragraph of your testimony and puts that issue on the table more forcefully  I think that will   help to influence expectations and to give long-term rates scope to move down if activity doesn’t   pick up very much and if inflation comes in lower  And I believe that’s very helpful   As to the adding up of apples and pears, I think that’s basically what we have to do here   at the end of the day  We have to weigh these different factors and add them up  By the way, I   like the apples and pears better than the sausage that I used to hear we made around this table    Fruit cup is better than sausage!

7183,2003-06-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me try to react to some of what I’ve heard   today  I certainly agree with you and the many others who say that we don’t need to make   decisions or announce anything immediately  Among other things, reading the materials and   listening to this discussion have changed my mind  So what I would have said a week ago   differs from what I would say today  We’re all learning in this process, and I think the process   needs to go on     One lesson that I drew from Japan was that not only did the Japanese get down to zero on   the interest rate and not only did they try each new policy and say they were going to take it   back, they didn’t give any sense of where they were going  They were lurching from one policy   to the next, each time saying that they didn’t think it would work  So I do believe it’s important   that we decide before we get to the point where such policies need to be triggered—and I’ll come   to that issue next—at least on a very rough sequence of what we will do and how we will talk to   the public about it  We don’t need to be very specific; but before we begin to use nontraditional   techniques, I think we need to talk about them publicly and create a sense of continuity and   confidence in our policymaking, which I believe was absent in Japan   June 24-25, 2003 41 of 211    Now, where does that sequence need to begin?  I certainly was convinced from the   material we received that 75 basis points is not a floor for the federal funds rate  In my mind,   partly because I have some doubts about how efficacious some of these quantitative easing   policies would be, I certainly would go all the way to zero on the funds rate or darn close to it, if   necessary  I admit that such an approach would trigger adjustments in markets and institutions   that would be costly  But I think the benefits of going down to zero, if we need to, would   probably outweigh those costs  The fact that these institutions have to adjust might argue for a   more gradual approach than we might use otherwise to get the funds rate down effectively to   zero, but I don’t think it argues against doing that   Something that does bother me, in terms of the current perceptions of where we are as an   institution in our thinking about this, are the newspaper stories saying that Federal Reserve   officials, whoever those anonymous people are, have said that 75 basis points is as low as we’ll   go  I certainly would like to take that notion off the table  I think the notion of 75 basis points as   a floor is one of the things that may be pressing us to move ahead faster with our thinking than   we’re comfortable with  People seem to think that once we get the funds rate to 75 basis points   we’ll have to make an announcement that we will target something else  I don’t think that’s true       Right  So if the other members of the Committee are in rough agreement, I   certainly would like you to clarify in your testimony, Mr Chairman—or in the question-and-  answer period that follows—that we don’t view 75 points as the lowest we can go  I think that   will give us some additional flexibility here   June 24-25, 2003 42 of 211    Another problem in Japan was that the authorities were overly optimistic about the   economy  They kept saying things were getting better, but they didn’t  To me that underlines   the importance of our public discussion of where we think the economy is going and what our   policy intentions are  Like Governor Gramlich, I think we do this all the time  Talking about   where we believe the pressures are coming and what the policy response will be is not something   new  We have done that in the past, especially when the economy and policy were in   disequilibrium  One example is the 1993-94 period when we said rates are low, we’re going to   keep them low until we see the economy really picking up, and then once the economy picks up   significantly we’re going to raise rates to somewhere close to the level of the natural rate  That   was a pretty strong statement  Another example is the 1999-2000 period when we said we’re   going to keep raising rates until we see economic growth slowing to potential     So in my view this idea of a commitment strategy is nothing new for us  The question is   whether we would need to modify what we already do as we move rates down to the zero bound    In that regard two issues come to mind  One is whether in that situation the Committee ought to   have a longer statement as a Committee instead of using only your congressional testimonies or   speeches to explain where we expect the economy and our policy to be going  I think we saw   following May 6 that when the Committee speaks—and this actually was surprising to me—its   statement has a little more force than when you speak, or at least reinforces what you have said   before in testimony and elsewhere  So, having the Committee talk about its expectations at a   little more length than we typically do might be helpful   The other issue is the one that Governor Gramlich raised about how specific we should   be  Like him, I’m more disposed to being vague rather than specific; it helps with the flexibility    I’m convinced that numerical forecasts under those circumstances would be fraught with   June 24-25, 2003 43 of 211    difficulty and problems and would be bound to be wrong  On the other hand, I also recognize   that, at the zero bound, the costs and benefits of perhaps clarifying expectations—if we think we   can do that—might be different than they are under the current circumstances  So if it does look   as if we’re getting the funds rate down there—and I don’t expect that we will—that would be a   time to think about whether quantification of forecasts and objectives would be helpful  I’m not   sure it would be  I rather doubt it  But that’s an area we could study if we got close to the zero   bound   Finally, I have some doubts about the efficacy of quantitative easing  I know there’s a   long-run relationship, and somehow one would think that the central bank ought to be able to set   the price level by printing an appropriate amount of money  But as Al Broaddus said, the   problem is that the relationship between prices and money growth might be a very weak one  It   might not hold over short or even intermediate periods of time  I wouldn’t reject quantitative   easing as a possibility if we got to that point, but it’s down on my list, and I would be careful   about conveying a more confident attitude about the efficacy of that technique than I think we   feel  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7184,2003-06-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with a confession  I’m an outlier    I know this is true in many respects, [laughter] but I’m referring to my forecast for growth next   year, which is above the Committee’s central tendency and close to that of the staff  I base this   bit of exuberance, which I believe to be rational, on the following factors  First, we’ve seen   tentative and preliminary signs over the intermeeting period that the economy is indeed   beginning to strengthen  It appears to be responding to the gradual waning of the hangover in   financial markets and the real economy from the excesses of the late 1990s and to the moderation   of geopolitical risks that have been associated with the war in Iraq  Retail sales and industrial   production picked up in May  Labor markets have stabilized  Capital goods orders and   shipments, while no great shakes, are still at least consistent with a rebound from the   exceptionally weak first quarter  And purchasing managers’ surveys have turned up  These   signs, including the May orders data, for the most part reflect actual transactions and decisions   taken before the May meeting and its consequences     Second, there’s now a lot more stimulus coming than we had thought at the time of the   May meeting to add to the already gathering momentum  Some of this is fiscal policy, as a   number of people have discussed, and some of it is our own doing  The perception that   monetary policy will be easier for longer has helped to lower interest rates, increase equity   prices, and depreciate the dollar, all without raising inflation expectations  Easier financial   conditions are not just occurring in the United States  Equity markets are up, and long-term rates   are down all over the globe, though other countries obviously are getting the other side of dollar   depreciation  This improvement clearly reflects developments in the United States, but it also   probably builds on a perception—reinforced by a significant easing by the ECB over the   intermeeting period—that monetary policy abroad will be easier for longer   June 24-25, 2003 114 of 211    Third, although outcomes like my forecast or the Greenbook’s seem pretty ebullient, in   fact they assume that the restraint on business spending lifts slowly and that the economy does   not exhibit all that much resilience  These forecasts do not assume that the economy exhibits a   reversion to mean behavior once the huge amount of stimulus being applied is taken into   account  In effect, the equilibrium real interest rate, although rising a bit over the forecast   period, remains unusually low and well below what one might think of as the long-term natural   rate, especially taking account of the assumed rise in productivity  In that regard the forecast is   somewhat conservative   Still, until we see an actual and appreciable strengthening of growth, I consider the risks   around such a forecast to be weighted decidedly toward the downside  In fact, the economy has   not rebounded sharply from pre-war weakness  Growth in the second quarter is a little slower in   this country than anticipated and much weaker abroad  Such downside risk is reinforced for me   by the fact that I really don’t understand entirely what is holding the economy back  Perhaps, as   we’ve speculated, the slow business spending results from a lack of confidence after the real and   financial turmoil of the boom-and-bust period  That caution no doubt has been accentuated by   concerns about risk-taking by CEOs and boards, given the severity of potential legal and market   punishments for getting it wrong  These restraints should erode under pressure from rising sales   and favorable financing terms as they do slowly in the staff forecast  But they haven’t eroded   yet  They could persist and be even stronger than in the Greenbook if businesses continue not to   see much in the way of profitable opportunities for investment  Businesses already are realizing   huge gains in efficiency by utilizing existing capital much better; rapid productivity growth is   boosting profits and income and economic potential, but it’s not increasing the incentives to   invest, at least so far  The net is that, in marked contrast with the late 1990s, sizable and   June 24-25, 2003 115 of 211    continuing monetary and fiscal stimulus has been required to have even the hope of eating into   underutilized margins of resources  We can’t be sure this configuration will improve until we   begin to see convincing evidence of a marked firming in business spending  Until then I think   we also can’t rule out the possibility that we may need to reduce interest rates substantially   further and hold them there for a time     Intermeeting developments have helped to alleviate some of my concerns about the pace   of disinflation  The rise in core consumer prices in May along with the drop in the dollar and   elevated energy prices suggest to me a lower risk that inflation expectations will decrease   substantially in the near term  Stronger demand should limit the longer-term disinflationary   trend  Still, inflation is declining at a time when it is already near the low end of a range that’s   probably consistent with nominal interest rates that allow us sufficient flexibility to respond to   added downward shocks  If inflation expectations are falling along with inflation, real funds   rates may actually be edging higher  Moreover, the improvement in financial conditions after the   last meeting was built on the expectation that, if the economy remained soft and inflation   threatened to go substantially lower, we would respond—not only by keeping rates low but by   reducing them further  My forecast, like that of the staff, assumes that the easier financial   conditions of the past few weeks will persist  With strengthening demand still a forecast rather   than an actuality and inflation still moving down, it seems to me that the economy needs the   extra stimulus from highly accommodative policy and the more stimulative financial conditions    And we need to find ways in the policy portion of our meeting to preserve the financial gains of   the intermeeting period  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7185,2003-06-24,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your recommendation  I   do think we need to follow our talk with action  As for the size, 25 versus 50 basis points, I   recognize as President Parry said that one could make a case for 50 on the grounds of being   aggressive and getting ahead of the problem  But I think 25 is appropriately sized for the   situation, given that we do see signs of some improvement and there’s a lot of stimulus in the   pipeline  I believe that the 25 basis point cut taken together with a sense of downside risk to   inflation should limit any upward ratcheting of interest rates from what little disappointment   there will be in the market  Like President Poole, I presume that if we don’t get the rebound that   we’re looking for in the third quarter, we’re going to have another serious conversation in   August about whether we need to move further     Let me make a couple more comments on some of the things that have been said  I do   have a little concern about the sense that we might shy away from a rate cut that we think is   needed because of the signal that such a move would send to the markets  If I thought 50 basis   points were the appropriate action, I would argue in favor of that, and I would have confidence in   our ability to explain it, though it would be very difficult to shape our message so that we   weren’t sending the wrong signal  I would worry if I thought that concern about the message   being sent kept us from doing the right thing  In my view it’s the combination of our words and   actions that will shape market expectations and confidence  I think we can put the two together   in a way that we get out the message we want to send     Let me touch on a few more things that were mentioned  The word “sustainable” in my   mind is growth at potential  The way I see the three sentences in the balance of risks statement is   that the first sentence is about the output gap, the second sentence is about the inflation gap, and   the third sentence adds it up  So if I think the first sentence is about the output gap, sustainable   June 24-25, 2003 148 of 211    to me means growth at potential  Interestingly, relative to what Governor Bernanke said earlier   today, the forecasts that we’ll be putting out are for growth above potential and are not entirely   consistent with the statement that we’re likely to put out  How we’re going to handle the balance   of risks language may be more of a problem going forward if growth actually does pick up  I   don’t think it’s a problem for today     Finally, Vincent’s chart in the top left-hand panel of chart 1 brought home to me that   actually it wasn’t so much the release of the words in our press statement that resulted in the   change in financial conditions; it was all the things that followed, including our own statements   It involved the interaction of what we said later and the data that came out relative to what we   had said earlier  Many of us, myself included, were a little surprised by the reactions to some of   the things we said  To the extent that some of us have expressed concern that there’s too much   talk of deflation—that people don’t understand that it’s disinflation we’re talking about—I think   we all, present speaker included, need to be very cautious about what we say  We need to be   careful that we’re not confusing the situation and fanning concerns that are not appropriate    Thank you  "
7246,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  For quite a while we’ve been saying that a   strengthening in the economy was coming but we didn’t know its timing or extent  Like others,   over the intermeeting period I saw a number of encouraging signs on the timing question that   suggest growth in fact has already been strengthening  Data for the second quarter supported   that judgment, showing a bit of a pickup under way  Notably, those data preceded the latest   round of tax cuts and probably had little to do with the extra financial stimulus that we got in the   second half of May and early June  It’s especially encouraging that capital spending seemed to   be on the upswing, including increases in shipments and orders of non-high-tech equipment in   both May and June  Among other things, this trajectory in the second quarter implies that we   don’t need quite as abrupt a strengthening in demand and activity as we previously had imagined   in order to get growth at or above the growth rate of potential toward the end of the year    Moreover, the fragmentary information for early in the third quarter that David Wilcox talked   August 12, 2003 53 of 110    about—sales, initial claims, and purchasing managers’ surveys—tends to support the hypothesis   that growth is indeed in the process of breaking above the sluggish pace at which it has been   running since last summer  The pickup in activity is not confined to the United States  There are   indications of a turnaround overseas, supporting the staff forecast of much stronger growth in our   trading partners  This is importantly a spillover from the United States, but it also reflects   expectations of stronger domestic demand abroad   While the timing of the pickup appears to be more settled, the extent of the acceleration   continues to be in doubt  My best guess continues to be that macroeconomic policy stimulus,   along with a number of other favorable developments we’ve talked about at recent meetings, will   support growth that is sufficiently vigorous to begin to erode economic slack later this year  But   we haven’t seen such growth yet, and a couple of developments over the intermeeting period that   others have mentioned argue in favor of a cautious assessment     On the demand side, a key issue is whether, after the recent tightening, financial   conditions remain supportive of a substantial narrowing of the output gap over the next six   quarters and beyond  There are reasons for concern  One way of looking at this question is to   judge whether the path of short-term rates implied by the term structure looks compatible with   such an outcome  In that regard, the implied upturn in Eurodollar rates next spring is at odds   with the flat path in the staff forecast and I suspect from the tenor our last meeting with many of   our own forecasts as well  The market seems to be anticipating some combination of a more   vigorous bounceback in demand and greater inflation pressure than is built into these forecasts    Presumably then, were higher rates to persist for long in the absence of positive surprises to   demand, we’d have to mark our projections down—and perhaps considerably     August 12, 2003 54 of 110    But there are some ameliorating factors that suggest that the risks from the higher rates   may not be that large  For one, rates are still quite low  In nominal terms, most bond rates are   only a bit above the levels of early May before the good news on growth and the passage of   substantial fiscal stimulus  Moreover, I see a considerable part of the rise in rates as an   endogenous response to ongoing positive developments  Some small part of the increase likely   was an upward adjustment in inflation expectations or at least a reduction in fears of deflation—  not such a bad thing under the circumstances  Resulting levels of real corporate bond rates are   especially low, as risk spreads have come in so far this year  In my view, a portion of the pickup   in rates results from greater confidence and optimism on the part of private investors responding   to better data and to Federal Reserve statements  This is evidenced in the resilience of equity   prices and the persistence of narrow corporate risk spreads despite huge increases in bond yields    I find it hard to believe that this isn’t being echoed to some extent in the attitudes of businesses   as they make spending decisions  Such a shift in psychology has been a necessary condition for   stronger economic activity, and it reduces one downside risk to the forecast   Finally, if markets are wrong, they will correct themselves, and rates will fall back  In   the staff forecast, market participants come to the realization soon enough that inflation and   short-term rates will remain damped longer than they anticipated so that the resulting decline in   long-term interest rates happens in time to preserve above-trend growth for the forecast period     An additional cautionary piece of information came on the supply side of the economy,   where we had yet another reminder of the astounding pace of productivity growth  As many of   you have remarked, not only does such growth raise the bar for required expansion of demand,   this increase in productivity has been achieved with very little capital deepening  Businesses are   able to enhance efficiency by rearranging production processes with about the current level of   August 12, 2003 55 of 110    capital and only relatively gradual updating of the stock  That has damped the feedthrough of   productivity growth to demand, in marked contrast to experience in the 1990s, and has made it   harder to close the output gap  At the same time, rapid productivity growth has been holding   down unit costs and contributing to continued disinflation     On balance, I see incoming data as consistent with my view that growth is in the process   of strengthening but also as not materially relieving my concerns about overall downside risks to   our dual objectives  With inflation already low and slack considerable, it’s important to have a   prolonged period of growth above potential not only to minimize lost output and wealth but to   limit the extent of disinflation  We don’t want to end up with an inflation rate that may provide   inadequate scope for monetary policy to meet unexpected downward shocks  This imperative   has implications for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of policy for some time into the   future and for the balance of risks that we will discuss in the second part of the meeting  Thank   you, Mr Chairman  "
7247,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support both parts of your   recommendation  I agree with those who’ve said that it’s very difficult to talk about the future    And I play second fiddle to no one in my humility regarding my ability to forecast; as you can   attest to over the years, that humility is well earned  I also agree with President Poole that it   would be very risky and counterproductive to promise to keep rates at a particular level for a   certain period of time  But like Governor Bernanke, I think we need to work on how we talk   about our assessments and judgments regarding the economy and our objectives going forward,   without perhaps being very specific  To the extent that the markets make their judgments about   future rates with a more accurate estimate or knowledge of what we’re thinking about, we’re   going to get better feedback from the markets  The markets are going to act in a more stabilizing   way even when they don’t agree with us, which is fine  But they need to know what we’re   thinking about in order to do a good job of assessing how the 800-pound gorilla in the money   markets views the outlook  So, while I agree that we need to give more thought to it, I haven’t   given up entirely on trying to do something in terms of how we communicate about the future    Thank you     Actually, I rather like this last sentence or some variation of it, though I   recognize that it involves a bit of a risk  But I also recognize, as I think most people around the   table would acknowledge, that what is built into the markets now is not what we think is going to   happen  That’s not to say that we can tell them exactly what’s going to happen, but I’m a little   concerned that there is a disconnect between what they think our reaction function is and what it   actually is  There is a difference in the inflation pressures they see coming and the inflation   pressures we see coming  So I think it’s worth taking the risk to change the statement to make   that point  I thought taking the sentence from the Chairman’s testimony, though I agree it gets   much more attention and emphasis in the statement here, was a good way to do that  To me   having the same statement that was in the testimony and retaining the same balance of risks as   last time—even after the better economic data we’ve had—emphasizes our judgment, which is a   little different than the market judgment  If the market wants to stay where it is after seeing this   statement from us, that’s fine; but it’s not clear to me that market participants understand what   our thinking is, and I think this would help—     It emphasizes it, I think  "
7288,2003-09-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with President Hoenig and President   Poole as well that it’s very difficult for us to talk about the future  But actually I’m fairly   comfortable with where we’ve gotten  In terms of the balance of risks sentence, in my view it   has been useful to get to the three-part assessment  I think we gave some important information   to the market when we said that we were concerned about inflation falling too low, and I believe   that has helped the market interpret our actions and predict our actions better  In terms of   President Poole’s chart, it looks to me as if most of the problems occurred before we were   making post-meeting announcements  The real misses are in ’91 and ’92, before we started   issuing any statements  I don’t see a deterioration in the predictability of the federal funds rate   since we started announcing tilts or our assessment of the balance of risks  The markets have   pretty much gotten the direction right  I think we can be fairly satisfied with the results depicted   in that chart for the period since we started announcing  So I don’t think it supports the notion   that providing a balance of risks or a tilt hasn’t been useful  I don’t see that in the chart at all   I think the summing up part of our statement is useful  As I’ve said before, it’s part of   the risk-management type of strategy that you’ve talked about, Mr Chairman  Having that third   sentence will give us an opportunity to tell the market how we’re implementing that strategy and   what we’re most worried about over the foreseeable future—that elastic concept  To me the   “considerable period” sentence is a different matter  There we did make more of a semi-  commitment about policy for some future period of time, and I was uncomfortable getting into   that  But I was comfortable doing it at that point because I thought it was, in effect, a kind of   nontraditional policy  We had the funds rate at 1 percent  People were worried about   disinflation, and it was important, particularly at that low interest rate, that the markets   September 15, 2003 58 of 78    understand a little better what we were doing  But I share everyone else’s concern that, going   forward, predicting a time dimension with regard to our policy actions should not be a part of our   regular process  I don’t think it needs to be  It was part of an unusual situation     I agree with the dialogue that you had with President Parry, Mr Chairman, regarding the   balance of risks statement  I believe we can be more formulaic, and I think Vince’s suggestion   for putting more in the Bluebook is helpful  I also agree with President Moskow that we need to   clarify our language  I happen to disagree with some of the statements about what “sustainable   growth” means  I think it is about changes in the output gap, just as President Parry wanted,   even though he wasn’t interpreting the actual statement that way  So I completely agree that we   need to start figuring out what we mean by this language and then make it clear to the rest of the   world after we make it clear to ourselves  [Laughter]  That’s something that needs to happen   sooner rather than later  These issues could come back to haunt us before too many meetings go   by, so I think we need to work on that before the January meeting  I think I’ll stop there      That proves my point about needing to clarify it!  "
7325,2003-09-16,"  Mr Chairman?     I could complicate things further by reading the Federal Reserve Act    [Laughter]  That says that we should keep long-run growth of monetary and credit aggregates   commensurate with the economy’s long-run potential to increase production so as to promote   effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest   rates  It doesn’t say to promote those goals over the long run  It just says to promote those   goals  "
7326,2003-09-16,"  In the boating industry!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  President Pianalto highlighted the difficulties   and problems the economy has encountered in working through the excesses that built up in the   late 1990s  In my view we’ve had some further evidence over the intermeeting period that the   economy may finally be working through these adjustments and that, absent further negative   shocks, it is poised for sustained robust growth under the added impetus of highly stimulative   fiscal and monetary policies  Not only does the pickup in activity that began in the second   quarter look as if it has gathered momentum in the third quarter, but also the source of the   momentum has been a strengthening in private final demand  As Dave noted, this is very   different from early 2002, when the pickup came importantly from an abatement of inventory   runoffs  Persistent reductions in investment since 2000 have been the main drag on the   September 16, 2003 59 of 106    economy, and it’s especially encouraging to see the pickup under way in orders and shipments   over a wide range of capital equipment and the ebbing weakness in nonresidential structures   As many of you have noted, businesses are still very cautious  The astounding   productivity numbers indicate that firms continue to find ways to expand output without   increasing either labor or capital  So it’s quite likely that much of the investment is for   replacement and modernization, not expansion  But the very fact that businesses no longer seem   to be stretching out replacement cycles and are taking steps to upgrade capital stocks indicates   their greater comfort that they have worked off many of the excesses  It suggests that the   capacity they have will be needed over time and that they have increased confidence about the   future   Investment fundamentals, which have been favorable for some time, are becoming even   more so  Including the staff forecast for the third quarter, businesses have seen two quarters of   substantial acceleration in output and three quarters of large increases in profits and cash flow    They have seen an unusually low cost of capital for non-high-tech equipment even after the   recent backup in long-term rates and an accelerated decline in the cost of capital for high-tech   equipment  And this is all before taking into account the temporary expensing provisions in the   tax code  Against this background, if businesses are more comfortable with the present and more   confident about the future, the pickup in investment spending should continue     The shift in attitudes is reflected in financial markets, and the adjustment from the   overexuberance of the 1990s also seems largely behind us  Yield spreads have retraced all the   run-up since 2000  Fortunately, they have not returned to the unsustainably low levels of the   middle 1990s  The slightly positive tilt to earnings surprises after a long string of shortfalls   suggests a more realistic set of expectations in equity markets  At the same time, the equity   September 16, 2003 60 of 106    premium remains unusually wide, indicating still-cautious pricing relative to those expectations   and a lowering of the odds that another collapse in stock prices will undercut household   spending     Despite the positive prospects for growth, developments on the disinflation front have   been more mixed  The immediate news has been encouraging in that the pace of disinflation has   been a bit slower than we might have feared  Consumer prices have turned up—and a bit more   than expected  I don’t know if that’s the case in this morning’s CPI report, which was somewhat   damped, but at least the previous few readings were up  Inflation expectations have been falling   but by some measures are still higher than a few months ago, providing an anchor against   substantial decreases in actual inflation    At the same time, however, the staff has interpreted recent data on productivity as   suggesting that the growth of potential output has been higher and the output gap larger than   previously estimated  So that gap is now likely to close more slowly despite a more rapid   expansion of activity  While precise estimates of potential output need to be taken with a very   large grain of salt, we do know that employment has continued to fall and that capacity   utilization remains stuck at a very low level  So we can be confident that slack isn’t declining   and probably has increased in recent months  That slack will continue to put some downward   pressure on inflation, as it does in the staff forecast  My concern about the level of inflation and   its path isn’t so much about the current and the next few quarters  It’s about a longer time   horizon, including where inflation might be when the economy eventually does approach full   utilization  As President Hoenig noted, lower inflation can be consistent with rapid growth when   productivity rises quickly  But the low inflation and low nominal interest rates will leave the   economy and policy with less of a cushion against negative shocks in the future       September 16, 2003 61 of 106    In this regard, developments over the intermeeting period, such as the apparent pickup in   activity and prices, have relieved my concerns only a little  Until waning business caution   together with fiscal and monetary ease show through definitively to increases in activity that   begin to eat into margins of slack, the jury will be out on whether growth is above the growth   rate of potential  Given the uncertainties about the pace of structural productivity growth, I   suspect we will want to see sustained and substantial growth in employment to make this   judgment  Moreover, the economy will need to grow at a pace in excess of the growth rate of its   potential for a time before we can be confident that the risks of further unwelcome disinflation   have materially diminished  Until we can see this sort of growth firmly in prospect, the   inadequacy of demand and the associated risk of disinflation should continue to be our primary   focus and policy should remain quite accommodative  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7327,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support all the pieces of your   recommendation  On the balance of risks statement, I agree to a large extent, though not   entirely, with what President Santomero said, which was to change as little as possible in that   statement  I would reserve these changes until we agree on what we mean by the words we use    I think it would be a big mistake to start changing them at this meeting before we go through the   stress-test that President Moskow suggested last night  So in my view we ought to keep the   balance of risks wording exactly as it is now until we have time to think about it more   thoroughly   As for the balance itself, I happen to agree with the current assessment  I think the risks   are balanced even on my definition of sustainable growth, which isn’t everybody’s, given that we   have strong demand but very weak labor markets  So whether the output gap will close over the   next few quarters is a very open question  In that sense the risks are balanced, as stated in the   first sentence of that paragraph  I do think we have persisting risks of disinflation, so I agree   with the second sentence and also the sentence that sums up our assessment of the risks   On the “considerable period” sentence, I think we need to set ourselves up sooner rather   than later to get to the exit strategy  This is where I part forces with President Santomero a little    I believe this wording is moving toward an economic rationale, and I’d prefer to get going in that   direction  We can’t be sure where the economy is going to be in coming months and when we’re   going to need that rationale, so the sooner we get there the better  With regard to Governor   Gramlich’s suggestion that we drop “considerable period,” I believe it’s going to be a big deal   when we do that  Getting to that point very rapidly would have market repercussions  I think it   would be interpreted as a signal that we were getting ready to do something that we’re not   September 16, 2003 86 of 106    getting ready to do  So I agree that we have to move in a more gradual fashion toward this exit   strategy, as you suggested     No, I was just saying that I supported the additional wording because it sets   us up for a future meeting  So I’m not urging—     Right  "
7382,2003-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly agree that we need to clarify the   language, and we’re not going to get it done today  We could very well make it until next   January, though I think we would need to work on it in December as well and not leave it all for   January   I started by asking what our goal was, and I think I took off from where President Poole   was in a sense but came to the opposite conclusion  I thought our goal was to help people better   anticipate where interest rates might go  By giving them a little information as to what we were   worried about, we might help them anticipate our actions a little better  I don’t think all of our   actions are keyed to new information, new shocks  Sometimes we’re at positions where we think   we’re more likely to do one thing than another because of how we see the economy developing,   and it’s helpful to the markets to tell them that  So this is about changes in interest rates and the   likely movement of interest rates  Also, consistent with what President Hoenig was saying, I   think that was what the subcommittee was trying to do—as ill-served as it might have been by   the then director of Monetary Affairs  We were trying to look at changes in the output gaps and   in the inflation gaps that would then lead to changes in interest rates  That leads me to the   Reinhart language, which to me is in that same spirit  I agree it doesn’t have benchmarks in it    That to me is a separable issue  In my view we don’t need to tell people what our benchmarks   October 28, 2003 100 of 126    are to help them see where interest rates might go in the future  We might want to tell them our   benchmarks, but I think that’s a separate debate     When I looked at Ned’s version, I did try to do some stress testing on it  Perhaps I   misread it, but it talks about the probability that economic growth will proceed over the next few   quarters at a rate consistent with the attainment of maximum sustainable employment  Then it   says that “over the same period” the probability that inflation will be undesirably high is below,   equal to, or above the probability that it will be undesirably low  That implies that the time   reference for inflation is the next few quarters and to me that was much too short a time frame  I   asked myself if I answered “equal” to both of those parts—that I thought we would be at   maximum employment in a few quarters, and inflation would be equal to or above a desirable   level—what would I be doing with interest rates in that situation?  I think I would be raising   interest rates if I believed we would be at 5 percent unemployment some time next year—or at   least I would be preparing the markets for that possibility  Now, in a private conversation with   Governor Gramlich he informed me that I wasn’t reading his words right  But the only time   reference in his formulation is “over the next few quarters”  If we mean over the next few years,   I think we need to say that; otherwise it implies that monetary policy will not be stabilizing but   will promote overshooting  I just think the benchmark issue is a separate issue  We don’t really   need to do benchmarks to accomplish what we set out to accomplish a few years ago  Thank   you, Mr Chairman  "
7383,2003-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like others, I’ll try to address two issues—the   prospects for growth in activity and the prospects for jobs  With respect to demand and activity,   the question is to what degree the strength of recent months can be sustained next year  It will   come as no surprise to my colleagues in light of my recent presentations to this Committee that   I’m optimistic in this regard  Stimulative financial conditions and fiscal policy are beginning to   show through to growth  In the absence of further downward shocks or reasons for business or   October 28, 2003 60 of 126    households to turn more cautious, I see no reason why that won’t continue, with only a modest   downshift in growth from the third quarter as in the staff forecast  While fiscal policy won’t be   quite as expansionary next year, it still will be boosting demand  Moreover, even as private final   demand might moderate a little, perhaps reacting to the falloff in fiscal stimulus, the growth of   economic activity should be bolstered as more demand is met from production rather than by   drawing down inventories   Financial conditions have been expansionary for some time  They became a little more   so over the intermeeting period as equity prices rose and the dollar fell, while corporate bond   rates remained roughly stable or even moved down a little for lower-rated credits  Whether long-  term interest rates will ease, as in the staff forecast, I think is somewhat questionable  But   judging from the recent experience, the risks around the assumption of a slight further decline in   the dollar are probably tilted toward a steeper falloff  Moreover, the drag on our economy from   weakness abroad is abating  To be sure, some of the stronger global prospects reflect a better   outlook for the US economy  But I’m impressed by the rise in interest rates and equity prices   abroad over the summer and early fall, even with the dollar depreciation  Financial markets   abroad must be sensing some added domestic demand as well     I see upside and downside risks to the forecast of reasonably strong growth along the   lines of the Greenbook  On the upside, business caution may erode faster than in the staff   forecast, where investment spending continues to undershoot forecasts based on past   relationships with accelerators, cash flows, and the cost of capital  In the Greenbook the surprise   in the incoming data was incorporated into a higher level of GDP and a smaller output gap, while   leaving growth rates after the third quarter largely unaffected  In effect, the recent data are not   interpreted as a signal that the dynamics of the expansion have changed materially, and the return   October 28, 2003 61 of 126    to full employment continues to be relatively slow given the low level of interest rates and   stimulative fiscal policy  The damped response in demand was reflected in a chart in yesterday’s   briefing, which showed that the natural interest rate implied in the staff forecast remains   abnormally low, especially relative to the assumed relatively rapid rate of growth of potential    Growth in the latter should be raising equilibrium real interest rates  But with the rise in profits   and equity prices and persistent increases in sales, business responses could return to normal   more quickly and fully than is assumed in the forecast, allowing much more of the natural   resiliency of the economy to show through to even stronger spending  The upward revision to   August orders data we saw this morning and the further gain in September I think underline this   upside risk   I believe that the major downside risk is in the household sector, which has been   supporting the economy under the influence of low interest rates  The saving rate remains quite   low  Both debt and real assets continue to pile up on each side of the household balance sheet,   and the saving rate only edges higher in the forecast  It’s not so much the debt burden that   constitutes a downward risk; rather it’s the possibility that households may decide that the   marginal utility from a larger house or another SUV begins to fall relative to the flexibility and   returns on greater portfolios of financial assets  We’ve seen no evidence of that yet  Housing   remains remarkably strong  But it could be that tendencies in this direction have been masked in   the short run by the effects of the tax cuts  So we will need to watch that the leveling-off in   consumption in September isn’t a forerunner     In sum, strong growth going forward seems a reasonable expectation  But the economy   is emerging from a highly unusual cycle in which previous signposts and historical relationships   haven’t provided much guidance, and any prediction must have an extremely wide confidence   October 28, 2003 62 of 126    interval around it  That’s also my conclusion regarding the forecasts of whether even strong   growth will erode margins of slack in labor and capital markets  We have experienced another   quarter of an astounding increase in productivity  In this case, for a very good reason the staff   decided not to build the third-quarter surprise into either the level or the rate of growth of   structural productivity  This suggests to me some upside risk on potential growth, as a number   of others have commented  It’s possible that potential growth could be stronger than is built into   the staff forecast without inducing much feedback into spending for a while  Low household   savings suggest that households are already expecting fairly strong growth in lifetime income    Businesses are clearly renewing and upgrading capital stock  It’s not yet clear that they see a   need to increase that stock very much to meet expanding sales  They still may not be very   confident that sales will grow at a rate that requires larger productive capacity  In addition, as a   number of you have noted, they may not see the need to expand capacity; judging from the third   quarter results, businesses have not run out of ways to rearrange production processes to meet   growing demand     My point here is not to second-guess the productivity forecast but to recognize the vast   uncertainty about the supply side of the economy that businesses continue to work under  We   had 6 percent growth in the third quarter and a small decline in payroll employment  Whatever   the growth rate of the economy predicted or realized, even if it’s very strong, we’ll need to watch   actual labor and capital utilization to infer how we are likely to be doing relative to our   objectives for high employment and stable prices  Uncertainty on both the demand and the   supply sides of the economy makes forecast-based policy especially problematic  Fortunately, in   the current circumstances it’s not as important as it often might be  Policy is already highly   accommodative, and the economy seems to be headed up, but there is enough slack that we can   October 28, 2003 63 of 126    afford to wait for reasonably definitive signs before deciding that the economy is on track for   drawing down those unused margins of resources and damping disinflation pressures  Until we   see that hard evidence, in my view the risks to output growing around the rate of growth of its   potential are balanced, and the risks to inflation are likely to remain downward  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
7384,2003-10-28,"  I agree with your recommendations, Mr Chairman  "
7445,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we all could agree that the shift in   sentiment around the table across almost all the Districts has been one of the more unusual   changes in a positive direction that we’ve seen in a very long time  I think it provides us with   further confirmation that we don’t have to rewrite the textbooks, at least the standard new   Keynesian ones  In the absence of downward shocks, massive amounts of fiscal and monetary   stimulus interacting with the natural resilience of the economy will boost demand and put the   economy on a track on which output is growing faster than potential     To my mind the global character of the strengthening in demand is particularly   noteworthy in that it suggests a broad base for improving economic conditions  We’ve had   positive surprises, as Karen noted, almost everywhere in the world—even in economies in the   euro area that aren’t especially resilient and where fiscal policy isn’t that expansionary  To some   extent this is a reflection of the strength in the US economy, but I think domestic demand has   picked up in many countries, responding in part to widespread expansionary monetary policies    And with our exchange rate falling, greater worldwide demand should show through at least to   less leakage from US production than we might otherwise have expected from strong US   demand going forward   The upward revisions to central tendency forecasts for both output and inflation—and   just as importantly the substantial reduction in the downside risks around those forecasts—  should make us considerably more confident about the outlook than we were a few months ago    December 9, 2003 65 of 133    It seems likely that the economy will grow rapidly enough to begin to erode slack and that   inflation will hold near current levels instead of moving substantially lower     The continuing surge in capital spending and the pickup in hiring suggest a rebound in   business confidence that is unlikely to fade quickly  In the household sector, housing demand   has remained strong even after the earlier rise in long-term interest rates  Other household   spending hasn’t fallen back and may have risen modestly further even as the effects of tax rebate   checks and the earlier surge in mortgage refinancing wear off       Private domestic demand for the third quarter was revised up 1 percentage point, and this   revision doesn’t seem to be borrowing from the immediate future  Incoming data have led the   staff to add another ¾ percentage point to private domestic demand in the fourth quarter  In   financial markets, greater confidence continues to be reflected in the persistent erosion of risk   premiums, especially on lower-rated issuers, and in rising equity prices  Taken together with the   falling dollar and stable Treasury bond rates, these developments indicate that financial   conditions are becoming more accommodative even as the faster economic expansion takes hold     On the inflation front, the declining dollar and stable inflation expectations should   provide a counterweight to continuing, if eroding, output gaps to stem the drop of inflation  I   agree with the rest of you that the risks of pernicious deflation, which never were very large,   have almost disappeared  But in my view some downward risk to the overall outlook for   inflation remains  The major unknown is productivity, where I suspect there is a greater   possibility of an upward than a downward surprise relative to the pattern of slowing productivity   growth in the staff forecast  Faster productivity growth, if it is not a consequence of capital   deepening, could slow the decline in the output gap and could put further downward pressure on   prices, especially if it comes more quickly than anticipated increases in worker compensation     December 9, 2003 66 of 133    Partly for this reason, the shift in the balance of risks around achieving our objectives for   output and prices does not call for a change in policy any time soon in my view  Moreover, what   hasn’t changed in the United States is the cost of missing to one side or another of these   forecasts  Inflation is low and, as many of you remarked, close to the lower edge of our price   stability comfort zones  And output gaps remain sizable  Shortfalls from expectations for output   and prices would have a greater deleterious effect on welfare than overshoots, including an   overshoot that results in a small rise in inflation down the road     So we should continue to take our risks on the easy side of policy  But policy is quite   easy, quite stimulative  We got here by aggressive easing to deal with the threat of deflation and   the zero bound, and in the unusual circumstances that we faced last spring and summer, we   reinforced that stance in market expectations by our “considerable period” terminology  As the   threats recede, we need to be thinking about whether we have the flexibility to react if upside   risks materialize or even if the economy evolves as expected  A zero real funds rate may not be   way out of line for a 2 percent output gap, but it would be unusual to keep the funds rate that low   as the output gap is closing next year  We can see this in the various versions of the Taylor rule,   which all point to higher rates next year This was a feature of Governor Bernanke’s presentation   last time and is even more so in the calculations using updated actual and forecasted values for   output and inflation gaps  Taylor rules are just rough benchmarks, and I would not argue that we   ought to follow them in any mechanical way  But these results do underline the questions about   how we position ourselves going forward   I look forward to the next part of the meeting to a discussion of how in our announcement   we can acknowledge a shifting balance of risks and begin the process of ensuring for ourselves   sufficient flexibility to react to potential changes in circumstances   December 9, 2003 67 of 133   "
7446,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I think we’re   moving in the right direction, recognizing that the balance of risks is in the process of changing   or in fact has shifted  Over the last couple of months, the statement hasn’t changed very much,   but the economy has, and I think we’re in the process of catching up  And we’re preparing the   markets for a modification of the “considerable period” language  I think they’ll see that  I’m   not concerned that there might be some adverse market reaction to this perception  I think the   economy is sufficiently strong and robust to be able to handle a modest to moderate backup in   rates  We will be considering the language more fully at our next meeting  So rather than try to   fiddle even more with the wording, I think just dropping that overall balance of risks sentence is   December 9, 2003 97 of 133    probably better since we will all have a chance to look at the language with a more or less clean   piece of paper next time   I agree with you that the balance of costs and risks we’re facing now is different from   anything the Fed has faced since probably the 1950s in terms of a low inflation environment  I   don’t think that rules out preemption as you seemed to be implying  I think it does mean that we   take the risk on a different side We will have to be preemptive; we’ll need to move policy well   before we see inflation picking up  It’s just that we won’t need to move quite as fast  I see it as   a lesser degree of preemption rather than no preemption     Okay  "
7506,2004-01-27,"  I’ve been in the undecided category for a long time  Today’s the day to   make a decision     I nominate Alan Greenspan to be Chairman and Tim Geithner to be Vice   Chairman of the Committee     SEVERAL  Second     I have a comment on President Poole’s comment  I saw an advantage in   going this route in terms of our being consistent across securities; we would buy everything that   was backed by the full faith and credit of the US government  But I also saw it as adding in   some sense to the adversarial relationship with the GSEs because it accentuates that difference   among them  And we’re addressing that in other ways  Given that doing this is a lot of trouble   and we don’t need to do it because of the volume of Treasuries, I wonder if it’s more trouble than   it’s worth  So even though adding Ginnie Maes to the SOMA would leave us in a little purer   position on the full faith and credit principle, I think I would follow the Chairman’s advice and   drop it for now  Dino, the market knows we’re looking at this  Do they expect anything?  Will   they be surprised?     Thank you, Governor Ferguson  I think there should be forward-looking   elements in what we announce to the public when we make our policy decisions  The reasons   for our decisions, as President Poole was suggesting, always have some forward-looking   elements in them  But I think we can be a little more helpful than that in the sense that the   Committee has an idea of how the economy and inflation will evolve over time and we could   convey that notion  Not only is that judgment a factor in the current decision, but also it would   give people some sense of how policy might evolve in the future  I’m not in favor of making   commitments on the short-term path of the federal funds rate  I think what we did last August   and have done since then with the “considerable period” language was an unusual step taken in   unusual circumstances  I’m not in favor of that as standard practice  But I do think that we have   some ideas and some analysis that it would be beneficial for us to impart to the markets, which   would help them act in a more stabilizing way, consistent with accomplishing the goals we want   to achieve     January 27-28, 2004 37 of 238    On the balance of risks language, I agree with President Poole’s history  We got to the   wording we use today in a rather unusual way  But in some sense that language evolved as a   substitute for the forecasts that other central banks provide  Other monetary authorities are able   to issue more straightforward rationales for their actions in the sense that they have very specific   forecasts and ways to discuss economic developments relative to those forecasts  There’s a very   clear sense of how they see the balance of risks going forward  I don’t think that this group of   nineteen people will ever have a forecast that it can agree on that will perform that function  So   the balance of risks language has substituted for a forecast in giving us a forward-looking   element in our statements  I agree that none of the formulas for the balance of risks has worked   well  I came in favoring the change alternative  I thought that was the cleanest way to talk about   what might be influencing the direction of rates going forward, but other people clearly don’t   agree  And in my view, both levels formulas have problems  So, Mr Chairman, I support your   proposal for lack of any better alternative, acknowledging that where we are isn’t so bad as a   starting place for a gradual evolution in the language  I do think it needs to evolve  The   Committee members don’t quite agree on the meaning of some of the language we use now  So   I think we need to have that language evolve, and it needs to happen gradually in accordance   with the situation that we’re facing   I do have some reaction to the general notion of shortening the statement  I think it   should be as concise as possible to get our basic ideas across but not more concise  I’m a little   concerned that arbitrary limits on sentences or words—even though I realize that people don’t   mean that literally—will not afford us adequate flexibility to convey the important notions that   we need to convey  So yes, it needs to be concise, but in my view it would not be a good idea to   drive for it to be so short that it didn’t contain adequate information  We have some information   January 27-28, 2004 38 of 238    to impart to the markets about where we think the economy is going, which will be helpful to   them, and I think we should communicate that information in a very general way     Thank you, Governor Ferguson  On balance I’m leaning in favor of early   release of the minutes  I think there is a lot of information in them  It’s a much more complete   explanation of why we did what we did and how we look at the future—points that I made before   in talking about the statement  And as President Minehan said, the minutes do give a sense of   alternative perspectives  Partly because we have so few dissents on the Committee’s policy   January 27-28, 2004 59 of 238    decision, I think it is important to get the sense out there that there are alternative reasons for   arriving at the same decision  Consequently, though I do think early release would move   markets and it could be uncomfortable from time to time, on balance I believe that over time it   would result in markets being more stabilizing by moving in directions we want     I do recognize the concerns that President Poole, President Guynn, and Governor   Ferguson have raised  They also have raised some technical issues about intermeeting moves or   discussions that we need to think about carefully  And I do think it would require some   discipline on the part of the Committee to avoid having the earlier release of the minutes cause   feedback effects on the Committee’s deliberations  I like the idea of the dry run  I’m not sure   we need to go through a whole year of dry runs, but we should do them at least for a while  And   it’s not only a production issue  It’s a matter of thinking about what these minutes would do to   the markets if they came out today  Now, the value of the dry run is limited because, with our   knowing that it’s a dry run, we won’t get the feedback of the minutes on the deliberations  But I   think it can at least help inform a decision later if we have a number of instances of the dry run     I wouldn’t elevate the forecast either for all the reasons people have noted,   and I certainly wouldn’t want to do psychological damage to the Chairman!  I’m not quite as   negative on them, I think, as Governor Gramlich and Chairman Greenspan  I do think the   forecasts give a sense of where the central tendencies of the Committee’s views lie  You’re   right, Chairman Greenspan, that most of what we do in the policymaking process has to do with   the risks around those central tendencies, but I think it’s helpful for the public to get at least   some sense of where the central tendencies are  And along the lines of the issues that Governor   Bernanke raised, they do actually contribute a bit of understanding as to how we moved on   January 27-28, 2004 81 of 238    average over time, though maybe not at particular points in time  But they have all the problems   everybody has noted, and I wouldn’t elevate their role    I would like to address the issue of the staff forecast, however  Maybe it’s because I used   to be sitting on the other side of the table, but I really think that releasing the staff forecast would   be a terrible idea  What we get from Dave, Karen, and Vincent is their best judgment about what   is going to happen and what the most likely course for the economy is  Any attempt to release   that forecast would tend to move them, even if only subconsciously, toward hedging that, given   worries about the market reaction or whatever  So I believe that would be a very, very bad way   to go  I don’t think it would serve the Committee well     In terms of minor tinkering with the forecast and what we release, to me core PCE is   worth thinking about  Unlike President Poole, I probably would add it rather than substitute it  I   agree that would result in an implicit food and energy price projection being there, but so be it    Total inflation is not irrelevant  What is happening to total inflation could very well shape   expectations about future inflation, and it probably does  If we believe those expectations are   important, I think we ought to talk about the total as well as the core inflation, though I agree that   the latter is more relevant to the underlying pressures on the economy so I would add it  And I   would give serious consideration to adding six months or a year, particularly to the January   forecast horizon  Maybe we can return to those issues before we come back in July     In the past it has been in the report and not in the testimony     No, it wasn’t even required by law before  By law the only thing that was   required was monetary aggregate targets  And this was appended to those targets partly because   the Committee was supposed to say how the monetary aggregate targets lined up with the   Administration’s economic forecast  So this was a way of working around that as well  The   only thing in the law right now is that we are supposed to give some sense of likely future   developments     Right, “prospects”  "
7507,2004-01-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Once again I’m an outlier in terms of my   projection of the strength in GDP growth for this year, as I can see from the charts we looked at   this morning  I want to note, however, that someone else is even more ebullient than I am, but   that person has not yet “fessed up” [Laughter]  For me, the lesson of the second half of last year   was confirmation of the strong response of the economy to fiscal and monetary stimulus once the   restraint of falling equity prices, capital overhangs, business caution, and geopolitical risks had   faded  In fact, the response was stronger and quicker than I anticipated  Consequently, for next   year I expect the fallback from the 6 percent plus growth of the last half of 2003 to be limited    Fiscal stimulus ebbs fairly gradually as we saw on a chart this morning  Household   spending held up better than expected at year-end despite weak labor markets, suggesting that its   earlier strength was based on more than just rebate checks and newly liquefied home equity    Low interest rates, rising wealth, and increasing confidence about the future surely played   January 27-28, 2004 147 of 238    important roles, and these factors will continue to boost spending  Indeed, financial conditions   have become even more stimulative over the last several months, and that will have its effect this   year  Since September of last year, equity prices have risen 14 percent, rates on corporate bonds   have fallen as much as 1 percentage point or more, and the dollar has depreciated nearly   5 percent on the broad index  The largest declines in bond rates were on the riskiest issues, and   the growing willingness to take risks in capital markets is echoed in increasing optimism about   future profits and sales by businesses more generally—a development certainly witnessed by   many of the reports we heard this morning  Lower costs of capital and growing confidence   should interact with accelerating output, strong profits and cash flow, and the need to make up   for previously postponed replacement spending to support considerable ongoing strength in   business capital expenditures  In effect, we are beginning to see greater feed-through of strong   productivity growth to spending both by households responding to rising equity prices and by   businesses reacting to profit opportunities in new investment    Given financial conditions, fiscal policy, growing confidence, and strong growth in   productivity, real GDP growth of 5 percent or more is not a stretch at all  It is well within the   normal response pattern, and this suggests to me that there are upside as well as downside risks   to such a strong forecast  In a sense, though, the growth forecast isn’t all that interesting  I agree   with President Broaddus that the interesting and more difficult questions are on the supply side   of the economy  How fast will potential grow, how will it interact with demand, and what are   the implications for the output gap and inflation?  The staff has a favorable story here  Strong   underlying productivity boosts actual and expected profits, equity prices, and anticipated income   streams, raising demand  But actual productivity growth slows some, so strong demand shows   through to a closing output gap  At the same time, compensation growth remains moderate,   January 27-28, 2004 148 of 238    labor’s share of income remains fairly low, and workers only begin to catch up with the higher   underlying productivity growth  As a result, the slowing growth of actual productivity doesn’t   raise unit labor costs very much, and it keeps core inflation at recent levels   This seems a reasonable projection, taking account of the surprising behavior of   productivity and labor costs in recent years, but there are considerable uncertainties around this   most likely outcome and appreciable skews to the probability  For one, the staff did not allow   the higher trend productivity of recent years to show through to a larger output gap, and Sandy   gave some good reasons for this  But we did see more disinflation than expected last year, and   while special factors contributed, price behavior could point to a greater probability that the gap   is larger and not smaller than the staff’s estimate  Moreover, the staff has interpreted some of the   recent productivity gains as pushing the level of productivity above its trend, and this gap   disappears once business confidence rebounds further  But given the uncertainty about the   origins of the astounding productivity gains in recent quarters, there would seem to be a good   chance that they won’t be reversed  So, actual labor productivity might not slow as much as in   the Greenbook forecast, keeping unit labor costs on a lower trajectory    Other risks point to the potential for greater price pressures  Compensation could   accelerate more as labor markets tighten, allowing higher productivity to pass through to labor   more quickly  Productivity advances could begin to show through more forcibly into demand, in   effect raising the natural interest rate more quickly than in the staff’s forecast  At this point,   however, since we have experienced repeated productivity surprises and insufficient demand to   tighten labor markets, while some measures of wage gains continue to trend down, I judge the   risk on inflation arising from the supply side of the economy still to be tilted toward the   downside    January 27-28, 2004 149 of 238    These uncertainties and skews have implications for policy strategy  Given the lags in   compensation behind productivity, this most recent productivity surprise bears a resemblance to   the mid-1990s  Then we took some of the temporarily favorable output–inflation tradeoff   resulting from the productivity surprise in output—the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent—and   some in lower inflation, as core PCE fell from 2½ percent in 1994 to 1½ percent in 1997  At this   time, with the core inflation rate in the neighborhood of 1 percent, it would be important to take   as much as possible of the productivity surprise in output, not in lower inflation  So in my view,   the supply-side uncertainties, together with the skews in those uncertainties pointing toward a   higher probability of inflation coming in below expectations, reinforce the rationale for being   very, very cautious in moving off our current highly accommodative policy stance  This is a   subject I assume we will come back to in the next part of the meeting  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
7508,2004-01-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I ended my previous presentation by saying   that I would be very cautious about moving from the very accommodative stance we currently   have  Rates are extremely low and obviously much lower than they have to be over the long run    But from a risk-management perspective, as you like to say, I think they are at an appropriate   level right now  I think that keeping them low and moving aggressively if necessary makes   sense in a situation in which the risks on productivity, costs, and prices are still pointed down    Total inflation is likely to fall  We haven’t seen any closing of the output gap  This is a situation   in which we ought to be taking our risks on the side of ensuring a rapid return to full   employment The benefits in economic welfare would be considerable  A small overshoot that   pushed inflation up a little would have essentially no cost and might even be desirable     Having said that, however, I still support dropping the “considerable period” language   and substituting “patience”  The “considerable period” phrase was inserted as a form of   unconventional policy when we were concerned about deflation and the lower nominal bound    That’s not an issue anymore  Rates will rise when we move to “patience,” but the expansion is   robust to a modest increase in rates  I think the rise will be modest since it is in the context of   weak employment and low inflation  No one should anticipate that the Committee is   contemplating an early tightening  I think retaining the slight downward tilt in the inflation risk   sentence will help, and I believe that is your proposal as well   There will never be a good time to eliminate the “considerable period” phrase  But I   think that doing so today will be seen as a logical extension of what we did last time in terms of   tying policy actions to economic developments and to the words that you and other members   have used in speeches rather than as a sign of immediate action  You will have an opportunity in   your testimony to expand on “patience” and that theme  Such a shift is not only about restoring   January 27-28, 2004 179 of 238    our flexibility; with the economy strong, it might be a good time to let the market react more to   incoming data  There are upside risks to our forecasts and to the path of rates despite the fact   that my best guess is that rates won’t have to rise for a while  Sitting on expectations in these   circumstances might not be stabilizing from the long-run perspective  This could damp some of   the interest rate risk-taking that we see in the market  I’m not sure it will do much about credit   risk, which people also have expressed concern about  I think the lack of appreciation of credit   risk is a function of a very, very good economic outlook, and I hope that view doesn’t change   even with this change in wording  I would be cautious about using that argument  It strikes me   that it’s about second-guessing asset-price levels  It’s something we didn’t do in the stock   market run-up in the ’90s, and I was pretty comfortable with how we handled that  So I’d be a   little cautious about using monetary policy to try to damp asset-price movements    "
7566,2004-03-16,"  I wondered if you had any more thoughts on the dollar, Dino  The dollar’s   rise is rather surprising given the disappointing data we’ve had on the US economy and the   decline in US interest rates  Do you have some sense that attitudes have changed from the   pervasive expectations of further declines?  Or is this the end?  "
7567,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data have underlined the virtues of   patience in our current monetary policy strategy  Demand has been strong— I’m about to line   up against my colleagues to my right, so to speak, [laughter] though not all of my colleagues—  but it has been slightly less than expected; and importantly that demand is feeding through to the   labor markets even more slowly than anticipated  One effect of this combination is to leave the   economy with a somewhat larger estimated output gap last quarter and this quarter and one that   is closing more slowly than we’d like  Moreover, the decline in equity prices and the widening   in a few risk spreads indicate some retrenchment in private-sector optimism, which is echoed in   consumer confidence surveys and perhaps, based on the information that President Moskow   provided from the business people he talked to, in business confidence as well  One can’t help   but believe that higher energy prices, perhaps terrorism risks, and job market weakness are   contributing to a slightly more sober outlook  After declining for three years, underlying   inflation may be flattening out, as the Greenbook states, but the evidence seems inconclusive to   me  The three-month rate of core PCE has come up, but from an extraordinarily low level, and   core CPI continues to decelerate   I agree with the staff that recent data and attitude shifts aren’t surprising enough to   suggest a change in the basic story  Although housing has come off the boil a little faster than   anticipated, consumption is only a tad weaker than projected; its rate of growth seems to be   picking up from the fourth quarter to the first quarter  To date, tepid labor markets, higher   energy prices, and low saving rates don’t seem to be exerting much restraint on household   March 16, 2004 55 of 107    expenditures  Most notably, business spending on capital equipment remains quite strong, with   no signs of tapering off  And the pickup in industrial production, still favorable readings from   purchasing managers, and sharp increases in commodity prices all indicate that the turnaround in   manufacturing is continuing, even if a little less rapidly than anticipated  All in all, evidence   suggests that monetary and fiscal stimulus is continuing to bolster private demand, which with   government spending also rising should keep overall growth brisk  Accommodative policy   should also narrow the output gap—and faster than it has been  I don’t have any new insights   here  Every logical argument indicates that a gradual strengthening of labor markets should be in   train, but we haven’t seen much of it yet, which in my view reinforces the arguments for   remaining patient   Nonetheless, some observers have been arguing that our patience should be wearing thin   sooner rather than later  One argument is that policy is very accommodative by historical   standards and that many of the reasons for adopting such an accommodative policy no longer   pertain  Demand has strengthened substantially, and the threat of pernicious deflation has   receded  A second concern is that policy accommodation—and the expectation that it will   persist—is distorting asset prices  Most of this distortion is deliberate and a desirable effect of   the stance of policy  We have attempted to lower interest rates below long-term equilibrium   rates and to boost asset prices in order to stimulate demand  But as members of the Committee   have been pointing out, it’s hard to escape the suspicion that at least around the margin some   prices and price relationships have gone beyond an economically justified response to easy   policy  House prices fall into this category, as do risk spreads in some markets and perhaps even   the level of long-term rates themselves, which many in the market perceive as particularly   depressed by the carry trade or foreign central bank purchases   March 16, 2004 56 of 107    If major distortions do exist, two types of costs might be incurred  One is from a   misallocation of resources encouraging the building of houses, autos, and capital equipment that   won’t prove economically justified under more-normal circumstances  Another is from the   possibility of discontinuities in economic activity down the road when the adjustment to more-  sustainable asset values occurs  Neither of these concerns, in my view, is sufficient to overcome   the arguments for remaining patient awhile longer   First, the current degree of policy accommodation seems consistent with macroeconomic   stabilization and a sensible approach to uncertainty  Policy may be unusually accommodative by   historical standards; but those standards, for a variety of reasons, haven’t been a very good guide   to recent developments in that the stance of policy has yet to result in a material decline in labor   market slack  And rapid productivity growth continues to hold down unit labor costs and   inflation  Uncertainty in the current situation seems greatest about the rate of growth of potential   GDP, as President Poole pointed out, as well as the level of the output gap and how the gap will   be reduced This uncertainty argues, in my view, for awaiting firm and convincing evidence both   that labor market slack is on a declining trend that is likely to be sustained after rates rise and   that inflation has stabilized before considering policy action  The former will tell us something   about the relationship of demand to potential supply and the latter that the remaining output gap   isn’t that large   Second, maintaining highly accommodative policy seems consistent with a risk-  management framework to possible deviations from the most likely outcomes  The low level of   inflation and the high level of the output gap mean that the welfare costs of economic growth   running a little stronger than expected are considerably lower than the welfare costs of it running   a little weaker than expected   March 16, 2004 57 of 107    Third, I believe that at least for a while the macro imperatives are likely to outweigh any   threat to financial or longer-term economic stability from accommodative policy  Any unusual   distortions in asset prices that might intensify a subsequent correction are probably small    Domestic risk spreads aren’t obviously too low for the beginning of an economic expansion    The upward tilt of the implied path of forward rates and note and bond yields looks relatively   gentle  The level of those rates may be a bit low, but they don’t seem way out of line unless   activity is much stronger or inflation much higher than I anticipate  House prices are elevated   relative to rents—and will look even more so when rates begin to rise—but are more likely to   correct by rising less rapidly than by crashing  Eggs will get broken when rates begin to rise, but   the capital in most intermediaries is high, and the system is resilient     While central banks in the United Kingdom and Australia seem to be tilting policies in a   firming direction owing to asset-price concerns, those economies are generally operating at   higher levels of resource utilization than we are, and their house-price inflation has been much   higher than ours  In our situation, a high burden of proof would seem to be on policies that   would slow the expansion, leaving more slack and less inflation in the economy in the   intermediate run to avoid hypothetical instabilities later  In short, Cathy, I understand your   concerns, but until the labor market takes a more definitive and sustained turn for the better or   until inflation looks as if its trend has changed, I’d be quite hesitant about allowing such   concerns to have an effect on policy  Thank you     As long as it’s not an axis of evil!  "
7568,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It will come as a surprise to no one that I have   at least a mild preference for staying with the inflation risk toward the downside  In my mind,   we haven’t yet actually seen evidence—we have a lot of anecdotes but no real evidence—that   inflation has even stabilized  It is true that core PCE has moved up, though from extremely low   levels  But the core CPI continues to decelerate even on a three-month basis  So I’d prefer to be   more certain that actual inflation has stopped falling before I can be convinced that the outlook   calls for moving to balance on the inflation risks   My second point is that I think we all expect total inflation to decline relative to last year    At least the FOMC members projected inflation of 1 to 1¼ percent this year, which is about   ½ point less than it was in 2003  Now, a lot of that reflects a projected decline in energy prices,   and perhaps it’s not unwelcome, but the total is expected to fall   And finally, from my perspective, in a risk-management sense, any decline in inflation   from current levels—if it’s more than a tenth or so—is more unwelcome than any increase  I   think inflation is at such a low level that a decline has more welfare costs potentially over time   than a rise  I don’t expect much to happen, but in my cost–benefit analysis, the downside risks   get a little more weight than the upside risks  "
7619,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m pleased to note that I can summarize my   comments by saying that I agree with Al Broaddus  And I’m sorry that I won’t have the   opportunity to say that again at these meetings, Al  I agree with him with regard to both the national   economy and the brittleness of the China situation  I think the likelihood of the Chinese authorities   succeeding in slowing down their boom in a smooth way is less than 50-50  We’re going to need to   monitor that situation  Many of us, myself included, have been saying that the timing of policy   tightening will depend importantly on the evolution of the output gap, especially as reflected in   labor markets, and of inflation prospects  I will review where I think we are with regard to each of   these and my sense of the implications for policy   On the output gap, accumulated information on labor markets, especially the March   employment report, has made it more likely that the strengthening we all expected is finally coming   to pass and that slack is being taken up  In effect, the data have reduced one downside risk—  namely, that productivity would remain so strong that even the forecasted robust demand would be   insufficient to absorb the substantial margin of excess labor and other resources  Productivity   growth does look as if it has slowed in the fourth and first quarters to an average of merely 3 percent   May 4, 2004 44 of 112       from the 4 to 5 percent range of the previous couple of years  But I think we still need to be   somewhat cautious in extrapolating these data   On payrolls, let me make just a couple of remarks  We basically have one month of data in   which growth has been more than marginally above the number needed just to tread water in labor   markets  And for the first quarter as a whole, the evidence suggests that the output gap did shrink,   but not by much  Capacity utilization in manufacturing rose  The unemployment rate fell   03 percentage point on a quarterly average basis, but part of that decline was accounted for by   another fall in participation rates, and the unemployment rate itself in March was above its first-  quarter average  With actual growth exceeding estimated potential by a few tenths at an annual rate,   the staff’s output gap measure fell only 02 percentage point in the quarter, to 2 percent   The staff has potential growth this year and next at around 3½ percent, in which case we’ll   need to see demand growth well north of 4 percent to make any real progress on absorbing slack  In   fact, growth of around 5 percent is the rate projected in the Greenbook, at least for the remainder of   this year, and strong growth in coming quarters seems reasonable to me  Growing business   confidence and continued household willingness to spend appear more than sufficient to overcome   any drag from higher energy prices, greater geopolitical risks, and a potentially sharp slowdown in   China  Still, we haven’t seen growth appreciably above 4 percent in this expansion, except in the   third quarter of last year, when spending was boosted by child credit checks and the cash from the   surge in mortgage refinancings  And productivity still could surprise us on the upside, as it has so   often before  In sum, I agree that the economy appears finally to be on a path toward full   employment, but some of the evidence is tentative and preliminary  The trajectory so far has been   very gentle  And even if we realize the more robust growth projected relative to productivity, slack   is likely to erode gradually over coming quarters   May 4, 2004 45 of 112       On inflation, the incoming data on prices and compensation certainly have laid to rest my   lingering concerns that inflation would continue to fall  The question is whether we are seeing a   more persistent strengthening of inflation pressures, which would be reflected in rising inflation   itself if we don’t act quickly and forcefully  On balance, I don’t think so  I see a number of reasons   to believe that inflation will remain low and stable, albeit at a higher level than I thought a few   months ago     First, some part of the recent uptick in core inflation is plausibly attributable to the pass-  through of a series of one-off price increases—in effect, adverse supply shocks in energy,   commodity prices, and import prices  Many commodities have come off the boil of late, as Karen   pointed out; petroleum prices have leveled out; and the dollar has strengthened—suggesting that   these influences are not likely to be repeated, at least on their recent scale   Second, slack, continued productivity increases, and the current elevated level of profit   margins should work to contain any tendency for inflation to rise  Depending on the measure one   uses, core consumer inflation fell between 11 and 15 percentage points from 2001 to 2003  Even   allowing for some understatement of inflation last year owing to special factors, this degree of   deceleration of prices is evidence that considerable slack has existed in labor and product markets    Unlike President Poole, I do think we can invert the equation and infer what the slack was by   looking at what happened to inflation  With resource utilization currently around or only a little   above the levels that prevailed during much of this period, the odds seem high to me that substantial   effective excess capital and labor capacity persists and will exert competitive pressures on price   increases    In addition, even with its recent slowdown, productivity growth remains elevated, which   will help to contain increases in unit labor costs  The staff sees trend unit labor costs about in line   May 4, 2004 46 of 112       with price increases this year and next; but even if unit labor costs, actual or trend, increase   significantly more rapidly than anticipated, inflation need not rise given the elevated level of price   markups  As Dave noted, markups at the end of 1997 were at levels comparable to the very high   levels prevailing today  In 1998, 1999, and 2000, unit labor costs rose substantially faster than   prices without exerting much upward pressure on rates of inflation   Finally, long-term inflation expectations do appear to be stable to me, judging from the   longer-end of the TIPS-derived yield curve as well the Michigan and Philadelphia surveys  Under   prevailing circumstances, I have trouble writing down the model that puts inflation on a rising trend,   but I have to admit I am less certain of this than I was a few months ago  Recognizing that there is   much about the inflation process that we don’t understand, we will need to monitor incoming data   on inflation and inflation expectations carefully   As for policy implications, intermeeting information has made a 1 percent funds rate less   comfortable than it was at the last meeting  Inflation is higher—less close to an unacceptably low   level and less likely to fall—changing the risk-management calculus  Higher inflation and the rise   in short-term inflation expectations do imply a lower short-term real interest rate at a time when   demand already seems to be quite strong  Although long-term real interest rates have risen in a   stabilizing response to incoming information, that increase is based on market expectations that we   will tighten beginning this summer   Given my forecast that we are not at the early stage of rising inflation even at these funds   rate levels, I still believe we should await confirmation that the output gap really is on a trajectory   toward closing before we tighten  That said, with inflation higher, risks shifting, and labor markets   beginning to firm, we clearly are closer to tightening than we were before if that confirmation   comes in over the next few months  So I agree with my colleagues that we need the added   May 4, 2004 47 of 112       flexibility in our statement  But also, given my expectations that slack will diminish slowly while   inflation remains low, the path of tightening consistent with meeting our objectives is likely to be   gradual—more gradual than in many past policy-firming episodes  I think it will be important that   one way or another markets come to understand this as we prepare to tighten  After only one month   of strong employment growth, I would be concerned that, if markets build in a rapid and sizable   increase in rates, the resulting substantial tightening of financial conditions could slow the   expansion unnecessarily  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7620,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation and all aspects of   it  Like President Minehan, I’d be concerned that, if we just dropped the last sentence, the markets   would overreact if not immediately then over the intermeeting period  As data come in, they’d start   to build in a 1994-type tightening, which is what I think they’re looking for and what a lot of the   discussion is about in the markets  My personal view—or at least my best guess—is that we won’t   need to tighten like that  Inflation is lower, and I think the output gap is disappearing but is   disappearing slowly  So not signaling the markets that expectations of a 1994-type tightening   would be the wrong—and  allowing those wrong expectations to get built into the markets—would   give us, I think, more trouble than dealing with this word “measured”  So I believe that we need   some way of indicating that our best guess is that the firming, when it comes, will be gradual     I thought the reaction to your testimony, Mr Chairman, was perfect because you dropped   “patience,” everybody noticed it, and rates reacted a little but not a lot  And you balanced that by   providing a somewhat more detailed outlook  You said that you didn’t expect inflation to rise and   you talked about the downside risk that you discussed earlier  Well, we’re not doing that here;   we’re not giving a detailed outlook in our statement  So I think the suggestion of a moderate and   measured pace of tightening is a way of substituting for a detailed forecast in an effort to moderate   the market’s reaction to our statement  Thank you  "

7669,2004-06-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My forecast, like most of yours, represents quite a   nice outcome for the economy  I have growth somewhat above the growth of potential, so the   output gap closes fairly gradually, with the economy reaching full utilization in the latter part of   2005 and core PCE inflation remaining below 2 percent  All this is accomplished in my forecast   with an assumed measured pace of tightening  Like President Yellen, I would include something on   the order of what is built into the market as measured     I am expecting both slower growth and higher inflation this year than in my January   projection  A number of developments have contributed to this less favorable configuration, but   most prominent among them have been higher prices for energy and other imported goods and   commodities  These have had the classic effects of an adverse price shock, damping growth and   raising prices  These price increases seem to account for a good portion of the pickup in core   inflation  And the effect on spendable income of the rising cost of oil and other imports with low   short-run demand elasticities probably has kept demand for domestically produced goods and   services from growing as rapidly as it otherwise would  In part, my relatively sanguine outlook   from here reflects my expectations that these shocks won’t be repeated and could even be reversed   to a degree  Oil and commodity prices have come off their highs, as demand from China has cooled   and consumers and producers have begun to adjust production and consumption to the higher   prices  As the price shock effects erode, policy stimulus should show through more to the growth of   demand, and inflation should abate  Next year, the timely erosion of fiscal and financial stimulus   help to slow growth, just as the economy approaches full employment  And inflation should remain   June 29-30, 2004 125 of 203          contained, as continuing though ebbing margins of slack along with elevated profit margins keep   markets competitive   Something is sure to go wrong  The interesting questions revolve around how fast the   output gap is likely to close—Is there a danger of overshooting without considerable near-term   policy restraint?—and around inflation  Even if slack disappears gradually, is stable core inflation a   reasonable expectation?   On the speed of closure of the output gap, recent information seems to be sending   contradictory signs  Anecdotes—ISM and other business surveys and what we’ve heard around the   table today—portray an economy with a considerable head of steam This impression is reinforced   by the large increases in establishment employment in recent months  Strong IP and a substantial   increase in capacity utilization add to the impression that slack is disappearing fairly quickly, but an   array of other data have suggested a slower approach to high resource utilization    In the household survey, the unemployment rate is unchanged since January, and labor force   participation hasn’t risen  Moreover, the workweek, which one might anticipate would strengthen   concurrently with or even before hiring, has barely budged off a very low level  GDP itself is   estimated to have grown at a 4 percent rate over the first half of the year—a solid pace, as we say in   our announcements, but hardly a barnburner when structural productivity is probably still advancing   rapidly  This estimate of 4 percent includes a leveling-out of consumption in recent months, along   with a couple of releases showing weak orders and shipments that highlight the solid rather than the   ebullient character of the expansion   Going forward, the risks around an expectation of a fairly gradual decline in slack appear to   me to be roughly balanced  In addition to the possibilities of geopolitical oil market developments   damping demand, we can’t yet gauge how spending will respond to the recent rise in intermediate-   June 29-30, 2004 126 of 203          and long-term rates  To be sure, as I already noted, several influences were holding back the pace   of expansion this year, but 4 percent growth—only moderately above the rate of growth of the   economy’s potential—doesn’t seem all that strong, given the unusual degree of fiscal and financial   stimulus in the latter part of 2003 and early 2004  Financial conditions remain supportive of above-  trend growth, but they have tightened in recent months as markets have come to anticipate our   actions  Household spending would seem to be the most vulnerable  The high level of household   spending encouraged by low interest rates over recent years must have borrowed to some extent   from future expenditures   On the upside, there is some risk that spreading optimism, especially among businesses,   could overwhelm the gradual erosion of fiscal and monetary accommodation  With an assumed   measured pace of monetary tightening, neither policy turns restrictive next year  It could be that   more of the strength in investment this year is attributable to underlying demand and less to the   anticipation of the expiration of partial expensing at the end of the year  In this case, we could see   more strength in investment persist through early next year than would be consistent with an   appreciable moderation in growth   In contrast to my views on the erosion of the output gap, I suspect, along with many of you,   that the risks around my forecast that core inflation will remain below 2 percent are not quite   balanced  To be sure, the weight of the experience of recent years suggests to me that 55 or   56 percent is above the NAIRU and that 764 percent is below the sustainable operating rate of   manufacturers  I do not believe that the rate of obsolescence of human or physical capital has   accelerated so much that this experience is no longer pertinent   Moreover, as I noted, much of the pickup in core inflation this year seems to be explainable   by one-time price-level adjustments; and long-term inflation expectations really haven’t moved   June 29-30, 2004 127 of 203          much, on balance, even as short-term expectations rose substantially  Still, there is much we do not   understand about the inflation process, as David was careful to point out this morning  And the   pickup in core inflation has been a surprise to me  The output gap is an unobservable construct—   inferred from the behavior of other variables like prices and compensation—with considerable   imprecision  And the extent of the slack in the staff forecast isn’t that large  Hence we need to   watch the inflation data carefully, and until I see some evidence that confirms my expectation that   the recent rate of increase of core CPI and PCE inflation will stabilize and even moderate at least a   little, the risk would seem to be on the side of higher inflation than my forecast   My preference for the next part of this meeting would be not only to remove some of the   accommodation of policy but also to find the combination of words that reflects both the central   tendency of expectations of a measured pace of policy tightening and the recognition that, in these   circumstances, the Committee must be alert to the possibility that it could need to take more-  decisive action  If the Committee agrees that a “measured pace” of policy tightening is the most   likely outcome, I think inclusion of these words in our announcement does convey useful   information  With that language in place over the last few months, reactions in financial markets to   incoming data have been substantial and sensible  I do not think that markets are interpreting   “measured pace” as an unconditional commitment  Retention of this language along with a   statement underlining our commitment to doing what is necessary to maintain price stability would   not materially, in my view, constrain our actions in the future  If we do omit reference to a   measured pace, we will need to rethink the balance of risks sentence  If we keep its present   configuration or the suggested configuration in which the risks are balanced for both output and   inflation, standing alone, that conveys essentially nothing about the Committee’s concerns and its   intentions  Thank you, Mr Chairman   June 29-30, 2004 128 of 203         "
7670,2004-06-29,  What were the words—“labor market conditions have improved”?  
7720,2004-08-10,"  Mr Chairman?  In fact, there’s a chart in the Bluebook that shows that   uncertainty about near-term policy has risen over the last few months  It has not risen a lot, and the   uncertainty is still pretty low, I think, but chart 1 shows that it has gone up; it hasn’t gone down   "
7721,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting, many, myself included, were   concerned about possible upside risks to inflation, even if policy tightened at a measured pace    Although the staff forecast for core inflation hasn’t changed materially, I see a number of reasons to   be less concerned about those upside risks now, despite the further increase in energy prices    Incoming data have shown core inflation to be restrained and labor compensation growth to be   fairly flat, despite rising pension contributions and an expected catch-up with past productivity   increases  This should increase our confidence in the analysis that suggests that core price increases   earlier this year were significantly influenced by one-time factors and that appreciable slack has   been present in labor and product markets  Inflation expectations have been well behaved  Short-  term expectations and the Michigan survey have moved lower  The long-end survey measures of   inflation expectations have been virtually constant  The long-run inflation compensation in the   TIPS market is 50 basis points below its peak in early May, which would seem to provide a little   extra assurance that, even if rising energy prices boost short-term inflation expectations again, long-  term expectations are likely to remain firmly anchored  And, finally, activity has been softer, and   August 10, 2004 45 of 103          the output gap has turned out to be larger than anticipated, and that should continue to restrain   inflation in the future   Smoothing through the quarterly revisions, final sales rose 1½ percentage points less rapidly   in the first half of the year than was estimated in the forecast in late June  The weakening   apparently was greatest near the end of the period; investment as well as consumption turned out to   grow noticeably less rapidly in the second quarter than had been anticipated  The July employment   report raised enough questions about the trajectory in the third quarter to cause the staff to write   down third-quarter growth even further  If the staff is right, the output gap will have closed very   little, if at all, since late last year, given the still strong productivity growth   Obviously, rising oil and energy prices are playing an important role both through the direct   import tax effects on domestic personal incomes and profits and by elevating uncertainty about the   future  Those effects are probably being accentuated by the persistence of the higher prices and the   substantial upward revisions to prices in more-distant months  With inflation expectations   anchored, rising oil prices seem likely to affect output more than inflation  That is the interpretation   that the financial markets have put on recent oil price increases, and those increases have tended to   be associated with decreases in intermediate-term interest rates  Nonetheless, it is hard to believe   that oil prices account for all of the shortfall in output relative to expectations and the apparent   inability of fiscal and financial stimulus to close the output gap   And it’s not just that models or rules of thumbs don’t see that large an impact  We don’t see   the sorts of developments, such as the drop in consumer confidence we saw in 1990, that in the past   have been associated with an outsized response to oil prices  Moreover, foreign economies don’t   seem to have been affected very much  I recognize that many foreign economies are less energy-  dependent than we are  Some of them are energy exporters  But if higher energy prices are   August 10, 2004 46 of 103          damping demand, I still would expect to see some imprint on industrial economies, and estimates of   their growth in the first half of the year have been marked up over the intermeeting period   Perhaps the upward movement in interest rates this spring is having an outsized but   temporary effect, coming as it did after such a long period of very low rates, which encouraged   people to accelerate spending  And uncertainty certainly has risen on many fronts in addition to the   energy market  It will be interesting to get a read this Friday in the Michigan survey as to whether   terrorism alerts and difficult domestic and international political situations are taking their toll on   sentiment  But interest rates have come down  Higher levels of uncertainty about energy prices   ought to be primarily affecting the level of output, not so much its growth rate, unless oil prices or   uncertainty rise further   I think the greatest downside risk to growth is the behavior of the household sector, and the   worrisome signal there is the jump in the saving rate in the second quarter  A gentle upward incline   in this rate would be consistent with good economic performance in the near term as well as over   the longer run, as investment and government spending strengthen  But we are unlikely to have   enough strength in those other sectors if saving rises more rapidly  The risk is that households are   undertaking a more fundamental evaluation of the long-run prospects for wealth and income,   reacting not only to higher interest rates, energy prices, and uncertainty but also to persistent   sluggishness in real wages and salaries, a less optimistic view of future equity prices, and shortfalls   and defaults in defined-benefit plans   Still, I see a rapid increase in saving as a downside risk rather than the most likely outcome    Interest rates remain low, and credit is readily available  This should support expansion above the   growth rate of potential  Households and businesses still seem confident enough to respond fairly   normally to these stimuli, with businesses having postponed enough investment in recent years to   August 10, 2004 47 of 103                                                            2 The materials used by Mr Gramlich are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   fill in for a modest flattening in the upward trajectory of household spending  And as many of you   have pointed out, a number of pieces of recent data—initial claims, household perceptions of   improving labor market conditions, and various surveys—are consistent with continued good   growth in jobs and output  If I had a better understanding of the recent shortfall, however, I’d have   a lot more confidence that stronger growth will resume once energy prices level out     On balance, I think the incoming data have left us with less upward risk on inflation, a larger   output gap that is probably closing more slowly than most of us anticipated, more uncertainty, and   puzzles about the strength of the expansion  Moreover, those uncertainties are skewed at least a   little in the direction of the possibility that the gap might close even more gradually, if at all, in the   present configuration of expected Federal Reserve action  And that is due only in part to the   possibility of further increases in energy prices  All this probably is not enough to deflect us from   the course of removing policy accommodation  But it would argue for an even more measured   approach and a great deal of caution and flexibility in how we think about and characterize in   announcements and speeches what we might do in the future—a subject I assume we’ll come back   to in the next part of the meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7722,2004-08-10,"  I agree with your proposal, Mr Chairman, in all its particulars, including the   language  I think it is most likely that economic growth will pick up and that the output gap will   begin to close again, and therefore, we should continue with our measured pace of tightening  I do   think that I would put a little more emphasis on the employment data than you seem to be doing  I   agree that, when productivity is moving around, employment is not a good indicator of economic   activity     Right, but it is something of an indicator of whether we’re putting people   back to work  In fact, it’s a very good indicator of that  [Laughter]  And there is slack in the   economy, so I wouldn’t ignore it entirely  I agree that we need to get back to neutral as soon as we   can, but I would say as soon as we can consistent with achieving maximum employment, which is a   directive in the Federal Reserve Act along with keeping prices stable  I agree that the default option   is to keep moving toward neutral, but my sense is that I’d be a little more data-dependent on how   fast we can get there than I think you were suggesting  The important thing is not so much the   current federal funds rate but what people in the market expect  It may be that, if economic activity   keeps softening, we will need to change expectations in the market by skipping an action at a   August 10, 2004 83 of 103          meeting at some point  So I agree with the general tenor of what you say; I’m trying to change it   just a bit around the edges  "
7770,2004-09-21,"  I’m not sure       I would be very, very careful about asking the Desk to do anything that   seemed to prejudge what our action would be at the next meeting  Moreover, it could be that the   cost of having the Desk not prejudge that—the cost of this very aggressive daily supply of   reserves, which we’ve gone to more and more over the last few years—is a little more   fluctuation in excess reserves  If the Desk supplies reserves on a daily basis, with contracts that   mature frequently, I’m not sure what the problem is      Yes     Well, he’s trying    "
7771,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with what seems to be the general   assessment around the room that the data since our last meeting have confirmed our expectation   that the soft spot in the economy wasn’t that soft or prolonged and that the economy is on a   fairly reasonable track  But I think we all have noted that recent information, including the   anecdotes, has also suggested that underlying demands and the path for the economy going   September 21, 2004 62 of 100          forward are not as strong as expected  This latter observation extends a string of downward   revisions to actual and projected growth over the year  These revisions reflect the fact that,   although economic growth has been good this year, it is considerably less than one might have   anticipated from the unusual degree of fiscal and monetary stimulus in place   The rise in oil and energy prices must be an important part of the story, but the extent of   the shortfall this year seems to be too much to ascribe to energy prices  And the fact that   inflation as well as output has been coming in below expectations since June suggests that   whatever factors are holding back the economy of late should be viewed primarily as having the   characteristics of a demand shock  For the most part, the unexplained shortfall relative to model   forecasts so far seems to be in business investment spending, and we’ve cited “business caution”   to explain it  Like President Stern in his reference to “reluctance to hire,” I think this is just   another way of labeling our ignorance  Perhaps businesses have been held back by heightened   terrorism or other geopolitical uncertainties, risks of further oil price increases, and the fallout   from governance scandals on risk appetites  However, the longer business caution persists, the   more I suspect that we’re missing something more fundamental   The bottom line, in my view, is that we just don’t have full understanding of what is   damping the response of the economy to accommodative policy  The facts that there are these   restraining forces and that our understanding of them is incomplete have important implications   for the strategy of policy going forward in terms of helping to foster both solid growth and stable   prices  Rates do need to rise, but it’s impossible to prejudge the appropriate path when we don’t   have a good understanding of the important dynamic forces at work    Tightening today is called for  I agree with most of my colleagues that it will bring the   real funds rate into positive territory  It will mean that the increase in rates is larger than the   September 21, 2004 63 of 100          increase in underlying inflation over the last year Tightening today is built into the yield curve;   on that yield curve intermediate- and long-term rates remain very low and consistent with very   supportive financial conditions  But in my view, uncertainty about the economy implies that the   path hereafter to achieve our objectives should be decided flexibly, meeting by meeting,   depending on incoming information  And I think the burden of proof for skipping a meeting or   for slowing down the pace of tightening should not be unusually high     Markets have reacted to recent incoming data by reducing the expected pace of   tightening beyond this meeting  They think we can and will skip taking action at some meetings   if the data suggest we should  These expectations could reverse quickly should incoming data on   activity or prices strengthen  I believe these types of reactions are quite constructive and impart   an important automatic stabilizer to the economy  I hope we don’t do or say anything that will   leave the impression that we are not ourselves prepared to adapt to changing circumstances    Moreover, I believe that flexibility is still most likely to be called for around a very gradual path   of tightening  Incoming data have reinforced the perception that the risk of accelerating prices   has diminished and that relatively low intermediate- and long-term interest rates could well be   required to sustain solid growth  Both markets and the staff have marked down their   expectations for policy     In addition, the case for gradualism in the face of uncertainty is well known—nicely   summarized by Governor Bernanke earlier this year  A related strain of research has shown that,   when the FOMC is uncertain about the levels of the natural rate of unemployment or, as in the   current circumstances, about the natural rate of interest, paying attention to inflation and growth   rates is useful to avoid policy mistakes  In the Bluebook table depicting policy rules, there are   two rules in which formulas for the funds rate are derived from changes in inflation and output,   September 21, 2004 64 of 100          and those illustrate this approach  They suggest a shallow upslope to rates, not too different   from the assumption in the Greenbook  Undoubtedly, this will not prove to be the appropriate   path for policy, but I’m not sure in what direction the path should deviate, and we will need to   look at the data to make that judgment  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7772,2004-09-21,"  I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman  I think the current   structure of rates is close enough to what we need, and I would hesitate to do something that   would cause a lot of fluctuations in expectations  If we get to the point in November or   September 21, 2004 84 of 100          December where we pause, I think rates will go down  It will trigger some of that refinancing   we’ve talked about  I’m not really worried about the financial system in that situation; it’s pretty   robust  It proved that in the summer of ’03  There wasn’t that much collateral damage, but we   don’t have to inflict it until we have to  "
7828,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I completely agree with Dino’s conclusion and   your assent that what we’ve been doing in the conduct of open market operations is about right    The Desk is protesting enough to make it clear that Dino isn’t prejudging the outcome of the   FOMC meeting but is trying to keep reserves from getting so overabundant that we have a lot of   volatility later  As for changing meeting dates, I know from having sat in Vincent’s chair that there   are a lot of factors vectoring in on the choice of meeting dates, and I don’t think we need to have   one more  Things are working just fine   I have a comment, rather than a question, on another thing that Dino said  Dino, you noted   that Fed commentary on the current account deficit was a factor in the weakness of the dollar  My   perception was that it was more than just commentary on the current account deficit  There was a   sense in the markets anyhow that the commentary was leaning toward trying to talk down the   November 10, 2004 9 of 107    dollar—that the Fed was engaged in actions or words designed to drive the dollar lower  I’m a little   concerned about that perception  I agree that we can’t avoid talking about the current account   deficit  It’s a huge imbalance in our economy, and how it resolves will greatly affect how we run   monetary policy in the future  And I also agree that a lower dollar sometime, somewhere in the   future is probably part of that correction process, but I do think we need to be cautious about   making statements that are perceived as talking down the dollar  Commenting on the dollar is the   job of the Treasury Department  I think that division of responsibility has been useful to us   As you’ve noted many times, Mr Chairman, we’re not very good at predicting where the   dollar is going or is likely to be  Even if it has to go lower over the long term, the Lord only knows   where it’s going to be in the short and intermediate term  And there’s not much we can do through   monetary policy about the current account deficit  It’s more a fiscal policy issue  We’ll have to   react to developments as they occur  The dollar is already under downward pressure  I think it will   fall of its own weight  The odds on a disorderly decline are very, very low, but they’re not zero, and   I think we need to be rather cautious in that regard moving forward  Treasury Department and bond   market people in talking to me noted that there had been feedback from the market that somehow   the Fed and the Treasury were at odds on what dollar policy was  I don’t believe that’s a productive   way to go in a very tender market  So, while I don’t think we can avoid talking about the current   account deficit, I think we need to be especially cautious at this point in the dollar cycle  "
7829,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Solid growth, around the rate of the economy’s   potential, and low inflation seem to have become even more entrenched over recent months  At   least so far, accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and firmly anchored inflation expectations   have provided a significant counterweight to the adverse effects on both output and prices from the   appreciable rise in oil prices since June   November 10, 2004 56 of 107    Although the rise in oil prices until recently and a fading fiscal impetus will restrain demand   to some extent for a few quarters, the leveling out of oil prices and continued favorable financial   conditions should support solid growth over time  In fact, financial conditions broadly defined have   become even more accommodative on balance since our last meeting with the fall in the dollar, the   rise in equity prices, and a narrowing of credit spreads  And even if we do experience several   quarters of slower productivity growth, as in the staff forecast, I think resource slack along with   elevated profit margins to absorb rising unit labor costs should continue to keep inflation   expectations in check   I was interested in the fact that the alternative simulations in the Greenbook left both growth   and inflation not far from the baseline  I don’t think this reflects entirely a lack of imagination on   the part of the staff!  I do think it reflects the basically sound underlying fundamentals and   associated compression in the range of risks around a pretty desirable economic outcome  Dave   Stockton characterized this as less fundamental fragility, and I think that’s right  But this very   favorable outcome does depend on the path of interest rates    Both the market and, even more, the staff see interest rates rising very gradually and   remaining at unusually low levels by historical standards as consistent with solid growth and low   inflation  As several of you noted, the staff sees a very shallow incline in rates to only 2¼ percent   at the end of 2005 and 2¾ percent at the end of 2006 as consistent with a gradually narrowing   output gap and persistent low inflation  Even the market, judging from the futures path, has a   structure of rates built in that has a rise in the funds rate to only around 3 percent by the end of next   year and to 3½ percent by the end of 2006  This implies actions on our part at fewer than half of   the future meetings through the end of next year—in effect a slowing from the recent pace  These   expectations not only reflect low inflation expectations but also embody an unusually low and very   slow rise in real interest rates  I think that, in turn, is largely a reflection of recent experience in that   November 10, 2004 57 of 107    the expansion has been damped relative to the degree of monetary ease  Businesses and households   have not responded to low interest rates the way history would suggest, even after taking account of   the effect of higher oil prices   I anticipated when I made my projection for much higher growth at the beginning of this   year that, as the effects of a series of headwinds abated, the underlying resiliency of the economy to   low interest rates would begin to show through more  But despite historically low real interest   rates, the output gap has not closed much at all since early this year and is projected to remain   around its current level through early next year   With household saving rates already at historically low levels, spending by this sector is   unlikely to be a source of strength in the future, and I don’t think we can count on a substantial   further strengthening in investment spending either  This might be a function partly of the   governance issues that Mike Moskow raised, but in addition businesses don’t seem to have been   greatly disadvantaged by their cautious behavior, if that’s what it is  Profits, productivity, and   capacity utilization data don’t seem to suggest that sales or profit opportunities are slipping away   because firms have been slow to add to labor or capital capacity  And firms probably anticipate   only moderate growth in sales going forward, given the low saving rates of households, limited   growth in export markets and domestic demand abroad, and a still-elevated dollar  And these are   not unreasonable expectations   Moreover, the marginal returns on new household and business investments may be lower   than we’ve experienced in recent years  It could be that spending on business capital in the 1990s   and household capital in recent years has left the level of those capital stocks quite high  And as   several of you have noted, the pace of technological change may be ebbing, as evidenced by slower   declines in the prices of high-tech goods and by the drop-off in high-tech investment   November 10, 2004 58 of 107    If for these or other reasons the effective neutral rate remains low relative to history, policy   is not as accommodative as it might appear by comparing current rates to history  And this   judgment seems to be built into the markets as well as the staff forecast  In my view, until we see   evidence to the contrary, we should expect that the damped response to low interest rates will   persist, and we should plan accordingly  I don’t know whether the staff’s assumption of a policy   rate that remains unchanged for some time after today is what will be required  I kind of doubt it,   as President Geithner does  But I think we should avoid doing or saying something that would   result in a substantial upward movement in intermediate- and long-term interest rates  And those   interest rates now build in a very gradual and only intermittent rise in the federal fund rates, a   slowdown from our recent pace    Our problem does not involve whether to raise rates at this meeting  Expectations of an   increase today have not impeded keeping intermediate- and long-term rates low  But at some point,   and that point may well be soon, even if the data come in roughly along the lines of the moderate   growth path in the Greenbook, I think we’re going to have to signal the markets—through deeds as   well as words—that we are not on a treadmill of higher rates at every meeting  If we don’t, we may   risk tighter financial conditions and subpar growth at a time when inflation is already low  Thank   you, Mr Chairman  "
7830,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your recommendation,   raising the funds rate and keeping the statement essentially as it was last time  I also hope we   reconsider the language in December  To some extent I may have a different focus than some   others who want to do that  I hope we leave open the possibility that we could pause from needing   to move—that we’re not locked in to tightening at each meeting  My concern about “measured”   and about the current language is that it does seem to lock us in one meeting ahead, but I don’t   think it has really constrained the market when it looks much beyond the next couple meetings  I   think we see that we’re getting good feedback from the market; our “measured” language hasn’t   impaired that feedback except for the very short term maturities because market participants see our   November 10, 2004 87 of 107    announcement as triggering the next action  So I believe we need to think about how to do this in   December, if we’re going to keep an open mind for February  If we remove “measured,” I hope we   don’t do so in a way that suggests we’re on an even steeper upward track and our pace of tightening   is not going to be measured  I don’t think that’s consistent with the economic outlook  You   seemed to imply that the inflation risks were quite skewed because of the productivity risks, and I   admit that productivity growth may be slower than we had anticipated  The staff has a slowdown   built into the Greenbook and it could—      Perhaps  I think there is a cost to being too high as well as being too low     Maybe the cost of being too high is that we have a more sluggish economy   with fewer people put back to work and too low an inflation rate if some of these upside risks to   inflation don’t occur  So I think there are costs on both sides here  If we take out “measured,” I   hope we give some sense, even if it’s a balance of risk sentence, of our assessment looking forward,   as Governor Bernanke said  I hope we don’t induce people to raise intermediate- and long-term   rates by a considerable amount because they think we’re no longer going to be measured in   removing policy accommodation  I think that would be a problem, given the outlook  Thank you  "
7883,2004-12-14,"  I think we should speed up release of the minutes to about three weeks after   the meeting, along the lines of the new schedule that Vincent suggested  I agree that there are risks   and potential costs, but I think they are partly within our ability to control and they are outweighed   by the potential gains  Potential gains come from the more timely release of the additional   information that Vincent referred to  I do think that this information, by aligning the minutes better   in time with the information that we use for our decision, will help key market reactions to better   match the FOMC’s reaction to the same information  The minutes contain a more complete   explanation of why we reached our decision, including how we are looking at future developments,   than ever will be possible in an announcement  They give a much finer reading on what the   Committee views as risks and skews in the outlook than can be conveyed by a one- or two-sentence   balance of risk statement  They give a sense of alternative perspectives of Committee members, and   this has been missing, for the most part, as the number of dissents has dwindled in recent years     I think diverse views further fill out the picture of the issues the Committee is focused on   and where it sees the risks  An earlier understanding of the Committee’s rationale and range of   views should help the public interpret the economic situation as it develops over the latter half of the   intermeeting period and more broadly to interpret our reactions to incoming data  The release   would be another news event—I entirely agree with Bill there—and markets may not always react   in ways we find desirable  This may prove uncomfortable from time to time, but I’m convinced   that, on average, over time market reactions to the information in the minutes will reinforce our   policy and help us achieve our objectives   December 14, 2004 77 of 118           Earlier release of the minutes should prove useful for other aspects of our intermeeting   communication  I think it’s helpful to have another Committee document in the public domain    There are already a lot of intermeeting events in the speeches and interviews that we do  The   minutes should assist markets to put our individual speeches and interviews in better perspective,   making it less likely that markets will make the mistake of thinking that any of us, except for the   Chairman, is speaking for the Committee  I’ve found it useful in speeches, and especially in   answering questions in public, to reference the minutes or the announcement  And having this   document published earlier will give us more opportunity to utilize this method of putting our own   remarks in the overall context and to reinforce the Committee’s message     I would not want to trade early release of the minutes for a shorter, less forward-looking   announcement on the day of the meeting  I think there are useful things we can say about the future   in that statement  I count the experience of the last five years—including the last year and a half or   so of interest rate guidance—as successes in that regard  We’ve provided information that has   helped the markets make accurate policy predictions, and in my view we have not constrained our   ability to take needed policy action  Cutting back on the announcement would leave a three-week   void in which markets would have less guidance from us, but I recognize that we’ve had a difficult   time deciding on what and how much to say in that statement  There is no consensus on which way   to go next in this regard, and announcements have evolved, and are likely to continue to evolve,   slowly  All these tendencies argue that the value of the minutes to supplement the announcement is   likely to increase over time   The main negatives, as Bill stressed, are the potential feedback on the minutes and even   more seriously on the deliberations of the Committee  We cannot adopt a new transparency tool   that would in any way make the Committee discussion less useful and productive  I do think the   December 14, 2004 78 of 118           experiment, together with the extra time embedded in Vincent’s proposal, should take care of the   concerns about whether the Committee could converge on an agreed-upon document in the time   allotted  And Vincent has explained how intermeeting conference calls would be handled   With regard to the feedback on the minutes or discussion, I think we should remember that   these are minutes, not transcripts  Artful wording can make them comprehensive and truthful   records of what we discuss and of the reasons for our decisions, without including information that   would endanger financial stability  We should continue to err on the side of comprehensive   coverage  We should not cut the minutes back  My experience as Secretary was that, on those   occasions when I debated how much to include of a particular discussion, the Committee benefited   over time from a fuller, more comprehensive set of minutes, even at the risk of some near-term   discomfort, because the ability to reference the minutes in later testimonies and public discussions   was so useful   In our last discussion, some of us expressed concern that expedited minutes would constrain   conditional or contingent deliberations for fear of how they would be reflected in the minutes  I   read the policy paragraphs in the minutes for the last two years—not the last twenty years, I confess,   Bill  But in the last few years, the paragraphs relating to our policy discussions contain few, if any,   contingent statements that aren’t foreshadowed by the announcement  In fact, in thinking about   your examples of December 2000 and March 2001, in both of those cases the announcement said   that we would be monitoring developments carefully  So I think the announcement foreshadowed   what the minutes said about the possibility of an intermeeting move   In terms of conditionality, I couldn’t find anything in looking at the minutes of the last few   years that I felt would have done the Committee harm if it had been released earlier  Now, I didn’t   look back twenty years  Conditionality in the minutes is usually implicit, not explicit  Discussion   December 14, 2004 79 of 118           does give the readers a better sense of the variables that are informing the Committee’s decisions at   that moment, and they don’t typically say “if x occurs, then we will do y”  Moreover, as I noted a   few seconds ago, there are always ways of covering discussions without contributing to instability; I   think we do that already  As a consequence, earlier release of the minutes should not deter the   Committee from a free discussion of alternative outcomes and their policy implications   Finally, this is under our control  We will be setting the precedents over the next couple of   years that will guide future Committees  I think we can discipline ourselves to maximize the gains   and minimize the potential costs of this exercise  Thank you     Mr Chairman, will there be a question of why we’re not proceeding with   early release of the minutes for this meeting?  "
7884,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As the Greenbook noted, the news on actual and   prospective demand since the last meeting has been mostly on the positive side  Consumption has   proven surprisingly, at least to me, resilient to higher energy prices, supported by rising housing and   equity wealth and continued low intermediate- and long-term interest rates  The higher level of   wealth and lower energy prices should bolster growth going forward  Absent a sharp move in the   dollar, longer-term interest rates, wealth, or oil prices, I don’t see any forces that are likely to shift   recent demand patterns enough to throw economic activity off a track that’s about in line with the   staff forecast—that is, a gradual further erosion of slack as the federal funds rate rises on a trajectory   similar to that expected by the market   December 14, 2004 44 of 118           I think the more difficult question that many of us have been addressing at this meeting is   what the inflation outlook would be that might accompany such an output path  As solid growth   becomes more entrenched and the output gap narrows, the locus of our concern naturally tends to   shift away from supporting growth and, other things being equal, the balance of risks around stable   inflation moves in the direction of faster price increases  Among the other things that aren’t equal,   however, is monetary policy  In effect, our policy tightening, both actual and expected, is designed   to keep inflation down and those inflation risks balanced  And in my view, so far the odds favor our   success with a measured pace of tightening   Concerns about higher inflation seem to be based importantly on pipeline pressures, as   reflected in more-rapid increases in PPIs at various levels of production, on the effects of the lower   dollar on import prices, and on the possibility of slower trend productivity growth, as well as on the   most recent couple of months of core CPI data  However, staff briefings yesterday and a few   months ago showed just how little of the pipeline pressures and dollar depreciation tends to pass   through to core consumer prices  There’s a lot of uncertainty about structural productivity, as   several of us have mentioned  We’ve had only one quarter of slower productivity growth after   about half a dozen quarters of growth above the presumed trend  And even a couple of quarters of   slowdown in productivity growth would tell us very little about underlying trends, especially if, as   the staff believes, the level of productivity is above the long-run trend     Moreover, a number of influences are weighing on the side of holding inflation down, and   some of these have received additional support in recent months  Increases in nominal wages and   compensation have remained moderate despite the strength in productivity growth in recent years   and despite higher headline inflation of late  To my mind, this tends to confirm that there is, indeed,   slack in labor markets  Markups of prices over unit labor costs have stayed quite high through the   December 14, 2004 45 of 118           third quarter—near record levels for nonfarm businesses—and these markups would be expected to   absorb the initial cost effects of a slowdown in trend productivity should that occur, giving us time   to react to oncoming cost pressures  And measures of long-term inflation expectations have   remained remarkably stable   I don’t want to sound complacent here  There are upside risks, but I believe if they do end   up predominating, we will have time to react before inflation rises materially  And in my view they   are balanced on the other side, so long as the evidence continues to support the existence of slack   that is disappearing only gradually and so long as long-term inflation expectations remain anchored    Moreover, I don’t see the cost of missing to one side or the other of stable inflation as being   especially skewed, given the current level of inflation  That is, I would not see 2 or 2½ percent core   PCE inflation as a substantially worse outcome than 1 or ½ percent on core PCE inflation  Of   course, one’s evaluation of implications of the two possibilities would depend critically on how they   came about—the role of demand and productivity  But, in general, I would have at least as much   confidence in our ability to truncate rising PCE inflation at 2 percent as in our ability to stop falling   inflation at 1 percent   One risk I neglected that Governor Gramlich highlighted last meeting—and it has played an   important role in our collective fretting about the current account—is that of a substantial fall in the   dollar that is much larger than assumed in the staff forecast  Surely, this is an asymmetric and   nontrivial risk that at some point could well put significant upward pressure on prices  I’d be very   cautious, however, about leaning on the tighter side in anticipation of such a development  First, the   roller-coaster dollar action over the intermeeting period was a nice illustration of the futility of   trying to predict the timing and dimension of any foreign exchange movement  Second, the   appropriate policy response to a drop in the dollar will depend on the response of other asset   December 14, 2004 46 of 118           prices—the extent to which bond and stock prices also react to the tapering-off in demand for dollar   assets  And third, the dollar isn’t the only asset that risks a price correction, and some of the other   candidates would call for a policy response in an easing direction   Recent gains in house pricing have been astonishing  Visiting bankers have told us that   investment demand is playing an increasing role in this market, and while slower increases may be   the most likely outcome, surely by this point there is a much fatter tail on the side of a considerable   softness or even decline in such prices  In such a situation, saving rates might increase sharply    I also find the recent behavior of bond yields hard to understand  While this Committee has   become increasingly confident of the vigor of the expansion over recent months, long-term yields   have actually declined, and most of this decrease is accounted for by the decreases in real rates  For   a while, this movement seemed to reflect the expectation that higher oil prices would sap demand   and flatten the trajectory of our tightening, but the softness in yields has persisted over the last   intermeeting period even as oil prices and the dollar fell  I don’t believe this decline represents   expectations of central bank buying; it’s just too widespread across instruments  A backup in bond   rates in response to unexpected strength in activity or prices would play an important stabilizing   role, but I see a nontrivial risk that something else will trigger a reassessment by markets and a   noticeable upward movement in real rates that could damp the expansion   Finally, given these crosscurrents and uncertainties, I remain convinced that our best   approach to asset-price concerns is to react, possibly aggressively, to the combination of asset-price   movements as it occurs  Such a strategy can be reasonably successful in counteracting the effects of   even a large movement in asset prices, and it avoids making policy errors by acting in anticipation   of asset-price changes that don’t occur or are quite delayed   December 14, 2004 47 of 118           The net of all this is that I would remain on the measured path of policy tightening we’ve   been following  At the last meeting, I was concerned that we would soon need to prepare the   markets for stepping off the “tightening at every meeting” treadmill  In light of the strength in   demand and overall easing of financial conditions over the intermeeting period, however, I no   longer believe that such preparations need begin with the announcement for this meeting  But given   my assessment of inflation risks, I also don’t think we should be planning on moving up faster than   the market anticipates, which does have us taking a break from time to time  How to signal this   flexibility in the announcement remains a problem, but a problem for a future meeting  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
7885,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I see an   important difference between us and the tennis player  When the tennis player runs back to the   center of the court, the ball is already flying over the net  His running to the center of the court   doesn’t affect the way the game turns out  [Laughter]  As we raise the funds rate and move back to   center, so to speak, that move can affect how things will come out  So I would not run back to the   center of the court just to run back to the center, nor would I go either way if I thought the game   wasn’t going to turn out to be right       I’m not in favor of tightening so that we can ease at some point in the future    I’m in favor of tightening because it’s the right thing to do now   December 14, 2004 67 of 118             Thank you for that clarification, Mr Chairman  "
7948,2005-02-01," As if on cue [Laughter] Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin by   commenting on a couple of the things that you said at the beginning  I think there’s a consensus—I   know that there’s a consensus—around this table that price stability, approximated by very low,   stable inflation, is the appropriate long-run goal of this Committee  And we agree that it is the way,   for the reasons you stated, Mr Chairman, as did Governor Bies, that we promote maximum   sustainable growth—by taking inflation out of the decision picture  I think that consensus actually   gives me a little more confidence than I hear from some of my colleagues that our goal would not be   vulnerable to the passage of time or changing personnel around the table  I think it’s just so widely   agreed that I’m actually not concerned about those two things   So this idea of cementing in the past performance to me carries a little less weight in   arguments that we ought to define price stability or to have an inflation target than I think some   others are giving it I think it’s already there I’d be very, very surprised to see it go away   I think in practice there’s a range of measured inflation rates that fit the general criteria of   promoting efficiency and not playing a material role in private decisions  The policy reaction to a   forecast of a given rate probably depends on what else is going on at the same time—your point, Mr   Chairman, about the dynamics of the price process   And then particularly on the supply side of the economy, as a number of you noted in 2003   when we were worried about inflation getting too low, the steady 1 percent inflation looks a lot less   worrisome when productivity and demand are strong than when they are weak  In the former case,   potential constraints of the zero bound on interest rates and stickiness of wages would be much less   threatening   I’d also guess that the prospect of inflation of 2 percent or even a bit north of 2 percent   would look a lot less adverse in the presence of persistent adverse supply shocks that were also                 February 1-2, 2005 37 of 177  depressing demand and production  And as you mentioned, Mr Chairman, the particular attitude   toward an inflation goal could be affected by our perceptions of financial stability and what is   required to keep the financial system stable   To me this suggests a zone of price stability encompassing a range of inflation outcomes,   with the edges of even that zone being soft or changeable, in the sense that our policy reaction to   inflation projected to approach or even violate some notional zone would depend on the   circumstances  In my view, this is the way we have been conducting policy  It has been very   successful in producing price stability and stabilizing economic cycles  President Lacker said that   we wouldn’t be giving up much flexibility if we adopted this definition  I’m not sure why we should   give up any   It seems to me that this type of thinking argues very strongly against a point definition of   price stability or against a range where the center has a good deal of gravitational pull In that   regard, I look at the ECB [European Central Bank], which has defined a point for its price stability   objective In my view, that definition has constrained the policy choices of the ECB in ways that are   not in the best interests of the euro-area economy   Now, by tolerating a range of outcomes, we do incur a cost in terms of variation in inflation   expectations You asked, Mr Chairman, whether there was any evidence that inflation targeting or   an inflation definition could tie down those expectations  A very excellent paper that we had from   the staff suggested that evidence was beginning to accumulate that inflation expectations are better   tied down in inflation targeting countries What is surprising is how weak and recent that evidence   is, and I think the weakness and recentness of the evidence is a testament to the fact that price   expectations have been very stable in the United States And I doubt that the welfare costs of the   variations we’ve experienced outweigh the welfare gains of the flexibility in policy reaction that I   think we’ve retained by not having a target for inflation and not having our hands tied in any way by   a numerical objective           February 1-2, 2005 38 of 177  That said, my first choice would be to enhance the status quo, as Vincent was talking about    I think there are some things we can do within the status quo, broadly defined, to reduce uncertainty   about our price stability objective In my view, we’ve already taken one step by extending our   February projections for a year As I thought about my 2006 inflation projection, I couldn’t see any   reason that it would differ materially from an inflation rate that I thought would be acceptable in the   long run I suspect the rest of you went through the same thought process  I don’t know what the   results are; we’ll see them tomorrow  But I think the results could tell the public a good deal about   the range of outcomes that the Committee considers acceptable   It does appear that one uncertainty now is about how high an inflation rate we would find   acceptable I think we could address this point, as Vincent notes, by indicating in our individual   speeches and your testimony, Mr Chairman, and in the Monetary Policy Reports the sorts of   inflation situations that would concern us   Now, if we do find that that’s not enough and that an explicit numerical range from the   FOMC as a Committee would be helpful in anchoring expectations, I would urge a couple of things    One, I would specify the objective in terms of total PCE inflation—not a price level and not just   core inflation I think changes in core inflation are better indicators of underlying inflation pressures   and may even help to predict future total inflation  But to me the arguments for price stability   suggest a broad measure, and I don’t think we should ignore trend movements in food and energy   prices that may be contributing to overall inflation  After all, this definition, if we were to adopt it, is   a long-term definition—not something we would hit year by year   I would have a fairly wide range on the definition Somebody mentioned 1 to 3 percent  I   don’t think it would be possible to make good arguments within that range that welfare is a lot   higher or lower at one point or another I would clarify that it’s a long-term definition  Inflation   rates could be out of the range for a while, depending on the circumstances, but they’d be expected   to get back in it eventually I would think that inflation anywhere in the range would be acceptable,   though we might take action to change the rate within that range under certain circumstances  And I           February 1-2, 2005 39 of 177  would emphasize, as others have noted, that choosing any range or choosing a definition in no way   connotes a downgrading of our output stabilization goal  That’s a step that Congress has refused to   take on several occasions   That brings me to a final point  If we were to take this step of enunciating a numerical   definition, I think we would need to consult extensively with the Administration and the Congress to   explain what we’re doing, why, and what it does or does not mean for the conduct of policy in the   future As near as I could tell from the International Finance write-up, in all the inflation targeting   countries—Switzerland might be an exception—the government outside the central bank was   involved in some way in the adoption of their regimes or their definitions  We’re not talking about   inflation targeting here, but it would be an important change in the way we communicate, and we   should have the understanding and the support of our elected representatives if we’re going to make   such a change Thank you  "
7949,2005-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  My forecast for economic activity in 2005 and   2006, like the rest of yours, was for growth a little faster than the trend rate of growth in potential    That reflects my judgment that the forces that had been holding back the economy in recent years   have largely dissipated, allowing the effect of relatively stimulative financial conditions to continue   to show through and raising the level of production relative to potential   My projection for growth in 2005 and 2006 is in line with the rate of growth in 2004 Yet   energy prices, whose rise must have damped growth to some degree in 2004, are expected to be flat   or somewhat lower  In addition, financial conditions have eased since the middle of the year, with   bond rates and the exchange rate lower and stock prices a little higher So, as I thought about my   projection, the logical question seemed to be whether we were on the verge of a much stronger pace   of economic growth  Although that’s a possibility, I see several factors that should keep growth to a   moderate pace  Monetary policy and fiscal policy are at the top of the list On the fiscal side, the   partial-expensing provisions probably brought forward some capital expenditures from 2005 to   2004 For monetary policy, I assumed a continued gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus along   the lines built into the staff’s forecast or the market’s  That should lead to rising real intermediate-   and long-term interest rates  A rise in real rates will damp the growth of consumption and                        February 1-2, 2005 106 of 177  investment spending directly, take something off the increase in house and equity prices—holding   down gains in wealth—and support the dollar Of course, that hasn’t been the experience over the   last six months or so, as President Lacker just pointed out  But longer-term real rates have fallen to   such a low level that I find it difficult to believe they won’t rise from here, provided moderate   growth is sustained   Indeed, I see an important downside risk to the forecast from the possibility of a sizable jump   in longer-term real interest rates, which could have a pretty serious effect on house prices and   consumption if it results from an unwinding of special factors or from a revision of unreasonably   low expectations rather than from an unexpectedly faster pace of economic activity   Until those rates ratchet higher, however, their low level, along with the basically sideways   movement of equity prices since late last year, would seem to suggest that caution among savers and   spenders has not dissipated entirely At the very least, the behavior of bond yields and stock prices   seems inconsistent to me with a new more ebullient attitude that would presage boom-like   conditions In addition, the behavior of the trade deficit is likely to be damping the growth of   demand on US resources for a while  The staff forecast, which has net exports making a modest   net negative contribution on average over the next two years, is itself premised on a pickup in   foreign demand—a pickup we don’t yet see in the data  This suggests to me another source of   downside risk   Over the long haul, as people become more reluctant to send us growing proportions of their   savings, the deficit will have to fall That will put considerable pressure on productive capacity in   the United States, but it’s not at all clear when that will begin to happen   Finally, in making my forecast of real growth, I took account of my serial forecast errors    I’ve been overpredicting growth since I got on the Committee, so I used a sophisticated algorithm to   compensate for this propensity  I decided what I really wanted to forecast and I took a little off!   [Laughter]                    February 1-2, 2005 107 of 177  My projection for core PCE inflation for 2005 and 2006 that goes with this path of output is   slightly higher than the staff forecast I gave some weight to the market-based core PCE numbers,   which have been running higher than the total core PCE, but that forecast remains below 2 percent,   and it is stable at that level For inflation, the question I wrestled with was Why not further   increases this year after the acceleration of 2004?  In that regard, the recent data from the last part of   2004 have been supportive, I think, of a stable inflation forecast With these data, every broad index   of core inflation—from GDP prices to the CPI to PCE—grew less rapidly in the second half of last   year than in the first— and significantly less rapidly, by at least ½ percentage point This pattern is   not consistent with accelerating prices It reinforces the hypothesis that a good portion of the pickup   in core inflation in the first half of 2004 was attributable to special factors a reversal of the   unexplainable undershoot in inflation in 2003 and the pass-through of higher energy, commodity,   and other import prices from late 2003 and early 2004  At least in terms of energy prices—not   imports, which are a big question mark—I think these upward pressures should not be a factor in   2005   In labor markets, increases in measures of compensation also slowed from the first half of   the year to the second Now, this is particularly noteworthy in that one might have expected the   previous run-up in energy prices and the strength in productivity increases in recent years to put   upward pressure on compensation gains  As a consequence, I think I’m a little less concerned than   some others of you that slack has already been absorbed  I can only explain the recent pace of   compensation data if appreciable slack is persisting in labor markets to balance these other upside   pressures In this environment, continued intense competitive conditions are likely to limit labor   cost increases and the ability or willingness of firms to pass through shorter-term increases in unit   labor costs into prices and thus risk market share   Finally, inflation came in lower in the second half of 2004 than I had expected  My   projection was at the low end of our collective central tendency, so most of you were a little higher   than I was Partly, this might have reflected a shortfall in growth from the projections and a smaller                     February 1-2, 2005 108 of 177  decline in the unemployment rate  But energy and import prices rose more than I had anticipated    Consequently, I also wondered whether at midyear I had given enough weight to the factors   restraining inflation—slack, elevated markups, and stable inflation expectations  To be sure, slack   should be diminishing, businesses will try to resist any squeeze on markups, and the economy may   be closer to potential than it appears right now If the dollar declines substantially, import prices will   increase, reducing foreign competitive pressure  Or if trend productivity slows more than projected,   firms could be more insistent and more successful in passing through costs than is consistent with   keeping inflation in check  Still, for now, I think low, stable inflation is the most likely outcome for   the next few years, provided policy continues gradually to firm, as slack slowly diminishes and   output grows at a moderate pace   As for the balance of risks, I’ve always thought that that phrase applies primarily, or first and   foremost, to the most likely path for inflation and output relative to our objectives at the assumed   path for policy And, in that context, the risks still seem to me to be balanced  The fact that I found   myself asking these particular questions about the outlook suggests, perhaps, a slight skew to the   distribution around these modal outcomes  But I think we should await further developments to   assess whether those skews will become large enough to influence the central tendencies, the   balance of risks, and the path on which we remove policy accommodation, or whether, as the market   and the staff expect, we actually will need to slow the pace of tightening in the future Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
7950,2005-02-01, I support the recommendation  
8007,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Activity has come in somewhat stronger in recent   months, and price pressures have been a bit more intense than anticipated at the last FOMC meeting    Evidently, continued good growth in income and high profits are keeping household spending rising   briskly and eroding any remaining business caution     The fact that surprises have been concentrated in investment in both business equipment and   housing may also suggest that the low long-term rates—the conundrum—have been having an   effect If, as seems likely, those rates have been reduced in part by declining term premiums, as   President Yellen was discussing, and not just by an expected lack of vigor in demand here or abroad,   their depressed real level would represent a net stimulus to demand most especially for business   borrowers who are facing very low risk premiums  In fact, business borrowing has strengthened   considerably in the fourth and first quarters And after an extended period in which cash flows have   exceeded business investment, low interest rates and ebbing caution have produced a positive   business financing gap in the fourth quarter, which is projected to continue for the first quarter   Moreover, the US economy is not the only one in which growth has picked up; the   strengthening of demand seems widespread globally after the disappointments in the second half of   last year And I agree with others who have noted that the sharp upward movement in energy and   other commodity prices probably reflects in part this global pickup in demand   The surprise in core PCE prices was only for one month and was small relative to our   ignorance of what drives those prices But it does raise the possibility that energy, other material                           March 22, 2005 66 of 116  prices, and import prices could be passing through to consumer prices more than anticipated  This,   coupled with the rise in near-term inflation expectations, does elevate the risk of second-round   effects from such relative price movements  And those relative price adjustments have continued in   recent weeks   Still, a number of factors seem to be working to restrain tendencies for inflation to move   higher, and we can’t ignore those Importantly, productivity growth was stronger in the fourth   quarter, and, apparently, in the first quarter, than anticipated  Whether that suggests faster structural   productivity growth than the staff has built in remains to be seen, but revisions to actual productivity   growth will help keep pressures off of labor costs and markups  Partly as a consequence, markups in   the nonfarm business sector remain at extraordinarily high levels, giving ample scope for future cost   increases to be at least partly absorbed in reduced margins  And wage and compensation growth   remain essentially flat, indicating to me that slack in labor markets persists, given the upward   pressures on compensation that would otherwise be anticipated from rising headline inflation and the   rapid productivity growth of recent years   Bond rates have risen noticeably To be sure, the upward movement seems mostly to reflect   higher inflation expectations, but higher nominal rates could have a noticeable effect on housing   markets where buyers seem sensitive to the cash flow implications of their monthly obligations    House price increases should slow quite a bit, in any case, holding back the rise in wealth and   boosting incentives to save out of current income  In addition, GDP hasn’t been revised up as much   as demand  As the trade deficit continues to surprise on the high side, the staff forecast has net   exports turning from a drag on activity to a more neutral influence  But until we see the data   confirming that shift, I think the possibility of more demand being drained abroad remains a   downside risk to the forecast                                March 22, 2005 67 of 116  The final and most important force that ultimately will constrain inflation is tightening   monetary policy  And the narrowing output gap and the possible emergence of greater inflation   pressures do raise questions about how we need to adapt our strategy to keep inflation low and the   risks in balance Two possible responses One would be to count on extending the gradual path of   rate increases to go for longer before slowing or stopping  The other approach would be to increase   the incline—prepare to raise rates by 50 basis points soon For the most part, extending the   measured path seems preferable to me  At the same time I think we should make it clear to markets   that we are prepared to extend that path, should circumstances call for it, and that we have no firm   preconceived notion regarding where our tightening should stop  The gradual approach should   enable us to better gauge the ongoing effects of our actions in an uncertain world It will give us   more opportunities to assess the effects of past tightening moves when we know that those effects   can vary and will occur with a lag Hence it will give us more opportunities to calibrate our actions   better to the needs of the economy   To date, announcing that we expect to remove accommodation at a measured pace hasn’t   materially impeded the markets from responding meaningfully and appropriately to incoming data    Over the last intermeeting period, they extended the anticipated series of gradual rate increases—   forward rates two and three years out are up by more than 50 basis points over that period, and this   seems completely appropriate to me     The structure of interest rates still seems to be consistent with achieving our objectives  The   staff forecast has inflation declining with about the policy tightening that is built into the market    Even if we’re not quite as optimistic on price pressures as the staff, gradual increases in the funds   rate in line with market expectations should provide some insurance against rising inflation    Inflation expectations beyond the next few years haven’t increased, indicating that market                             March 22, 2005 68 of 116  participants expect that the policy actions they now anticipate will be enough to insulate the longer-  term trajectory for prices from near-term increases in inflation     As a consequence, “measured” is still my best guess as to how policy rates will evolve, and   that’s what I would continue to indicate to the public  Nonetheless, our expectation of a measured   pace of firming has always been conditional  And one essential condition that we have articulated   and emphasized in the last sentence of the announcement is that inflation and its expectations remain   well behaved In my view, that would be consistent with the rate of growth of core PCE prices   stabilizing at levels close to or not very much above the experience of the last year  If doubts about   our willingness to maintain price stability emerge, I can see the potential for a very difficult self-  reinforcing feedback loop through declining confidence in policymaking in the United States and   accelerated dollar depreciation Incoming information suggesting that core prices will continue to   accelerate, or that the output gap is closing rapidly, or that longer-run inflation expectations are   deteriorating, could well call for deviating from the measured pace with a larger firming action  If   the signs were serious enough, I think we could, and should, do that as soon as the next meeting,   even if the “measured pace” language remains in place  After an expression of concern about   inflation pressures, as suggested in alternative B, the market should not be entirely surprised by such   an action under those circumstances  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8008,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your proposal, and I agree with your   analysis that the loss function is shifting and that we need to be very careful not to get behind the   curve here I think the proposed language will put people on notice that we understand that that loss   function is shifting and that this is where our concerns are So, I agree with the proposed language   I’d like to make a few comments on the previous discussion  The difference between the   alternative B and alternative C balance-of-risk statement—namely, what to assume about policy—   was exactly one of the issues that divided the second Ferguson Subcommittee  I was, at that point,   in what is now the alternative C column, and I was a tiny minority on that—at least, I felt like a tiny   minority on that subcommittee  But we’ve been around this several times  And, actually, most of   you didn’t like the alternative C language, though I think it ultimately could be useful   I do worry somewhat about President Minehan’s proposal to remove both the balance-of-risk   language and the “measured pace” language  I think something forward-looking ought to remain in   the statement  Maybe it doesn’t need to be formulaic; maybe, as suggested, when we debate it, we   could change it from time to time  I think it’s important that markets aren’t more certain than we are   about our actions, but, to the extent that we can tell them something true about what we’re going to   do and where we expect things to come out, I believe asset pricing will be better  I don’t think we   should be inserting uncertainty into the market just to insert uncertainty into the market  If we know   something about or have a sense of where we’re going, somehow saying that in some way will make   asset prices more reflective of reality   My third point is that there is a tradeoff here between how quickly the draft statements get   out to the Committee—and get more or less written in cement—and the reaction to what goes on at   the meeting and to very current information  I think we’re in a very difficult position As soon as   the statement gets put to bed, then incoming data can’t be reflected in it and what happened at the                                      March 22, 2005 91 of 116  meeting is very, very hard to reflect there  So I think we need to recognize that that tension, which   will never actually be resolved, is there as we try to get the statement wording out earlier and earlier    Right But I think if we said that, that would be useful information  If we said   we don’t know which way rates are going to go next—that we’re not sure and it depends on the   information that comes out—that would be useful for the market to know  "
8056,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Unfortunately, the economic and policy situation   became a lot more interesting over the intermeeting period  We thought we had an emerging   inflation problem; the issue was how hard to lean against it  In the event, core inflation did come in   a bit to the high side, but, in addition, economic activity was appreciably weaker than I thought it   would be, with both consumption and investment falling short of expectations   A greater-than-expected reaction to previous increases in energy prices seems to me the most   likely culprit for both the inflation and output surprises Perhaps the constrained reaction last   summer and fall to the previous run-up in energy prices lured us into giving this factor too little   weight People may not change their behavior until prices have been high for some time and they   perceive the need to build them into more permanent notions of relative prices and disposable   income  Businesses, in cutting back their hiring and capital outlays, may be reacting to their   perception that energy prices were in the process of taking a bigger piece out of household spending   or at least to increasing uncertainty about the path of that spending   The tendency for economic activity to be disappointing in several industrial economies in   recent months supports the notion of a common global thread and is consistent with the energy price   explanation And on the price side, cost pass-throughs may be easier and more readily accepted by   customers when everybody is subject to a similar shock                                 May 3, 2005 59 of 116  I agree with the contours of the staff forecast  If energy prices remain flat, growth should   pick up and core inflation should abate We’re most likely looking at a downward adjustment in the   level of demand and an upward adjustment in the level of aggregate prices, not more persistent   effects on growth rates Fundamentals continue to favor this outcome  Financial conditions remain   quite accommodative and supportive of growth sufficient to resume narrowing the output gap    Foreign demand should also strengthen, as the energy price shock is absorbed     The damped growth of compensation even in the face of higher headline inflation indicates   to me that appreciable slack remains in labor markets  Capacity utilization in manufacturing is still   below its long-run average In this environment, conditions in labor and product markets should   help keep a lid on price increases, but the incoming data have elevated the level of uncertainty about   the outlook, as many of us have remarked, and raise questions about what accounts for the recent   outcomes and suggested skews around this most likely scenario   It’s difficult to identify what, other than energy prices, could be unexpectedly damping   demand  But confidence has eroded, which could intensify and prolong energy-related shortfalls   We can see the decline in confidence in surveys of households and small businesses that we saw   yesterday and also in financial markets, where volatility and risk spreads have risen and stock prices   have fallen  Perhaps markets are better aligned with reality, but financial conditions are a little   tighter than they have been, and this will restrain spending at least slightly going forward  The   slowdown in the increase in investment spending is especially notable and would be a concern if it   were prolonged, since that’s what most of us were counting on to sustain solid growth and declining   slack over the next few quarters   The staff has interpreted the recent shortfall as reflecting in some small part more persistent   weakness in demand than would be simply associated with an adjustment to higher energy prices                                  May 3, 2005 60 of 116  High-frequency data, such as initial claims, and early indications of consumer demand in April   suggest that the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace  But at the least, the recent data   point to a greater possibility than I saw at the last meeting that growth will not be sufficient to raise   resource utilization as policy accommodation is removed further   On inflation, the decline in both short- and long-run inflation compensation and in financial   markets since the last meeting encourages me to think that energy price increases aren’t being   propagated through this mechanism  But the surprises in the core inflation numbers do suggest some   continuing risk that inflation won’t be as contained as one might otherwise have expected at given   levels of resource utilization   The puzzle here in my view is the character of the competitive environment  Given slack in   resource utilization and high profit margins, I would have expected businesses to have been   driven—by competition and desires to expand market share—to absorb more of the cost increases    But businesses clearly remain cautious about expansion, and they have been able to raise prices to   maintain very high price markups   From a policy perspective, I think we have a situation that is a bit more balanced than it was   at the last meeting  Financial conditions still seem too accommodative to be consistent with the   economy not overshooting the level of its potential once the effects of rising energy prices wear off   We need to be careful that nominal rates keep ahead of the now slightly higher underlying inflation   But a gradual pace of tightening now seems an even better guess than it might have been at the   previous meeting, in the sense of being in the center of a distribution of possible rate paths  And   that’s because a less robust economy and a larger output gap than expected should provide some   greater assurance that inflation will remain contained as we raise rates at a measured pace                                 May 3, 2005 61 of 116  As I tried to suggest, I think the distributions around the outcomes for inflation and output   have become more skewed, but in offsetting directions with regard to their implications for policy    As we’ve been saying in our minutes and speeches, how the actual path of rates evolves will depend   on the data and how some of these puzzles are resolved  But for now I would keep on our path, and   I would let the public know that that’s still our best guess for how we’ll be proceeding Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
8057,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your proposal, both the ¼ point increase   in the funds rate and the alternative B language I think a measured pace of increase in the funds rate   is still our best guess of what we’ll have to do I heard one or two people around the table say that   we might be closer to a pause than we thought, owing to the recent data, and one or two people   around the table say that we might have to accelerate the pace because they’re putting more   emphasis on the incoming inflation data  But I think the broad center of the Committee is still with   the measured pace of increases and, therefore, the broad center of the Committee believes—I   think—that we ought to tell the market that we still think rates are too low and will have to rise  And   if we tell them that without telling them something about removing accommodation at a measured   pace, I think we’ll be conveying more uncertainty about our intentions than would be helpful  In my   view, it would not be helpful to remove that language at this point   I agree that the balance-of-risk statement right now is broken and is either meaningless or, if   it’s meaningful, it’s rather distorted  But I think it’s going to be very, very hard to remove it without   sending a signal that we think we might be behind the curve in one sense or another, and I don’t   think we are, and I don’t think we want to send that signal So, my guess is that lines 5 and 6 here   are going to have to be reworked, but only at the point when we think we’re near the pause point,   and I don’t think that’s going to be June, President Moskow I’d be very surprised if it were I think   it’s going to be very hard to rework those sentences before we think we’re close to being finished   with the tightening process Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8109,2005-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have three questions  The first one is on the   price-to-rent ratio  We’ve been treating it as if most of the adjustment has come on prices  And I   wanted to ask Josh particularly whether, as you’ve been looking at the micro data and thinking   about this, the dynamics of some of these innovations that have led to a shift from renting to home   ownership might have artificially depressed rents relative to prices  And I wondered, after that shift   is over, if rents will start rising faster and close the gap that way—use up some of that 20 percent    My question is what you thought of that  And my observation is that that would present a much   more difficult situation for us sitting around this table  It would be kind of like a supply shock   because prices would be rising, inflation would be higher—and that homeowners’ equivalent rent   would be rising faster—and we’d face a more difficult situation  We pretty much know what to do                                    June 29-30, 2005 54 of 234  if house prices fall  That’s a pure demand shock  But if rents start rising, that’s another matter  So   I wondered if you’d comment on that   And then, while I have the floor, let me ask my questions of Glenn and John  Glenn, on the   1994 bubble analogy, I was surprised to see that classified as a bubble  I think there was some   inflation scare then, but there was also a real rate adjustment at the same time  If you looked at any   of the surveys, I think you wouldn’t have seen much of an increase in inflation expectations  I agree   that we had to raise real rates in order to prevent that from happening  But that seems to me a very   different animal than equity price changes or house-price changes because we are responsible for   inflation  So if we see inflation moving, we’ve got to do something about that, whereas we’re not   responsible for the relative prices of houses or equity and other things  So I wouldn’t have put 1994   on a list of situations we might think about as we’re looking at this issue of house-price gains  It   seems to me very different  I’d like to hear your comment on that   And finally, my other question for John has to do with this point about the misallocation of   resources  Doesn’t it matter what the state of the business cycle is?  If we hadn’t had so many   houses built and so much consumption over the last few years, we would have had more   unemployment  So it’s not obvious that resources have been misallocated  The resources that went   into building houses, furniture, and cars, and so forth might have been unemployed, especially if we   had raised rates more in order to lean against the house-price increases  If we had, surely   unemployment would be higher  So it seems to me that it’s one thing to talk about misallocating   resources between two states of full employment, but it’s another thing to talk about a misallocation   of resources where there would otherwise be slack in the economy  And the latter case I don’t think   really is a misallocation of resources  There’s no opportunity cost    You don’t see anything in the current situation that would differentiate it from   past history in that regard  I guess that was my question  "
8110,2005-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I made only small revisions to my forecast from   last January  We’ve seen some notable fluctuations in data and sentiment over the last five months,   but basically I think we’ve ended up pretty close to where we started, with prospects for growth that   are close to the growth rate of potential, perhaps a bit above, and core PCE inflation stable at a little   over its rate of last year    The data we received over the intermeeting period reinforced this favorable outlook,   assuaging some of the concerns on both the demand and inflation fronts that I had at our meeting in   early May  Growth in private final purchases has been good, with the second-quarter forecast to be   around 4 percent  Slack in labor markets has continued to erode gradually  Core CPI inflation   slowed, supporting the notion that some of the earlier pickup was a product of the pass-through of   previous increases in energy and other import prices, and core PCE inflation has been stable    Commodity and intermediate goods price pressures have abated, consistent with the moderate pace   of increase in production and a judgment that the global economy was not facing significant   bottlenecks, except possibly in energy markets  And importantly, inflation expectations fell on   balance despite the further increase in oil prices  The recent further rise in oil prices will indeed put   some upward pressure on core inflation, but that should be limited in time, and increases in the   prices of other imports should abate considerably, owing to the strength of the dollar   Moreover, the behavior of most measures of labor compensation suggests to me that labor   markets are not in the process of overheating and may even have some degree of slack remaining    And declines in inflation expectations provide some assurance that past increases in energy and   other prices aren’t likely to become embedded in persistently higher inflation                               June 29-30, 2005 146 of 234  Over time, of course, it is appropriate monetary policy that will keep the balance between   demand and potential supply and inflation in check, and I actually found that thinking about the   appropriate path for policy was harder than thinking about the outlook   In a fundamental sense, the favorable outlook rests on a judgment that over the last year or   so monetary policy has been well calibrated to the evolving situation  Market participants seem   comfortable with policy to date and with their expectations for the future  The simultaneous decline   in expected funds rates and inflation expectations over the intermeeting period indicates confidence   that inflation will be contained  And the rise in equity prices and still fairly narrow risk premiums in   credit markets must rest on expectations of continued solid growth    I think we can be fairly confident that appropriate policy is likely to require additional   tightening even beyond this meeting  That’s what is built into the yield curve, and that structure of   rates seems to be consistent with growth continuing around or perhaps a little above the rate of   potential and with the output gap about disappearing  And with output probably close to its   sustainable potential and inflation already having picked up a little, I agree with the rest of you that   we’re at a point in the cycle at which we need to be especially careful about keeping inflation   pressures contained But how much further we need to tighten in order to accomplish that, and at   what pace, are the interesting questions   The staff and markets have built in a leveling out of the funds rate at about 3¾ to 4 percent    That’s quite low by historical standards  The Greenbook has an implied short-run r* of only 1½   percent Still, that’s not implausible, judging from the experience of the last few years when very   accommodative policy has been associated with growth only moderately in excess of potential   And the recent downward revisions to market expectations for growth abroad—and expected policy   paths abroad—reinforce the possibility that low equilibrium rates appropriately reflect weak global                                         June 29-30, 2005 147 of 234  demand  Nonetheless, the underlying truth is that we really don’t know how much we need to   tighten, and, fortunately, we don’t need to figure that out today   I recognize that the 25-basis-points-per-meeting path is not an optimum policy  As we can   see from the Bluebook simulations, an optimum policy would tend to flatten out the trajectory as we   get close to what we think is a stopping point  The risk is that the 25-basis-points-per-meeting pace   will tend to ratify your prediction, Mr Chairman, that our last tightening will be one too many   Given the lags in the effects of policy, if we wait to see confirming signs that past increases have   slowed growth on a sustainable basis—and we aren’t seeing just another soft patch—we probably   will indeed have overshot the mark  The path could be especially problematic if it extends into the   fall when our meetings get closer together  Surely, the pace of tightening shouldn’t be dictated by   the meeting schedule rather than economic needs  But I do take some comfort in the expectation   that policy doesn’t have to be that precise  The market will tend to compensate for any   overshooting by building in a reversal, provided we let it know that we are open to that possibility   when the time comes   For now, sticking to our path of gradual rate increases would seem to be the most prudent   course, but such a path is conditional on the economy following its expected path  We should be   willing to deviate either way, even as early as August, should the data indicate a very substantial   deviation in the path of spending or prices  And our statement today should not be read as implying   anything about our expectations beyond August  That will depend on data  The higher we go with   rates, the more we need to keep an open mind about stopping places and possibly even the pace of   tightening Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8111,2005-06-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation, and I agree   with the alternative B statement that you proposed  I have two comments  One is that you said   markets would be three weeks ahead of us  But one thing that’s different is that we’re providing   them with more guidance now  So I think we need to be very careful not to provide them with too   much guidance I hope that’s clarified at least in the minutes if not in the statement  And my   second comment is that the way you described what might be coming, with weaker growth and   higher inflation, I think we’ll all be jealous of Ned after a while  [Laughter]  "
8167,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of you have remarked, underlying   demand has shown a surprising degree of vigor over the intermeeting period  Strength in final   demand should show through to output as the mini-inventory cycle works itself out  This   strength, together with revisions to estimates of the level and rate of growth of potential GDP as   a consequence of the NIPA revisions, suggests that the economy is probably a little closer to its   long-run sustainable production than we had thought  A smaller output gap, in combination with   further increases in oil prices—some portion of which is likely to show through to core prices for   a time—in turn suggests that inflation risks are a little higher and raises questions about our   policy strategy In my view, although the risks have shifted a little, they have not shifted enough   to throw us off our presumed policy path of measured increases in interest rates, and I would   continue to indicate that in our statement   I agree with the staff forecast that the increase in final demand is likely to slow going   forward, as we continue to raise rates The surprise was not in investment, which continues to be   a bit on the weak side relative to fundamentals, but rather in consumption, which is already quite                            August 9, 2005 67 of 110  strong In part, the unexpected strength reflected auto incentives and is borrowed from spending   in the future The increase in consumption required a further decline in the saving rate from an   already low level, a pattern not likely to be sustained absent continued very sharp increases in   housing prices In that regard, at some point rising short-term rates—and recently long-term   rates —should take their toll on housing price appreciation  To be sure, to date the indications of   cooling housing markets are anecdotal, such as those we heard from President Guynn; they’re   not yet data-based But if, as many assert, the demand for houses is being supported to a   considerable extent by ARMs and exotic mortgages tied to short-term rates, the effect of   monetary policy tightening should, if anything, be greater than in the past, with the housing   wealth channel bearing more of the adjustment    In addition, the further rise in energy prices is likely to shave something off spending, or   at least postpone the time when energy prices are no longer holding back growth  And the   positive contribution to final sales from net exports in the second quarter appears to be a short-  term quirk in either data or behavior  Moderate growth abroad, together with our outsized   demand for imports, should once again begin to damp demand on our own productive resources   Moreover, incoming data on prices and compensation continue to indicate, to my mind,   that there is some slack remaining, which is working to contain price pressures  Although core   PCE data for 2004 and before were revised higher, incoming information about the most recent   several months has suggested an appreciable short-term deceleration  The recent price data   were, in fact, lower than anticipated  In effect, the data tended to confirm that the higher rates of   inflation earlier this year were temporary, probably reflecting the increases in price levels of oil   and other imports, and that inflation is not on an upward track  These data have been consistent   with an economy producing somewhat short of its sustainable potential  Compensation data                August 9, 2005 68 of 110  have been contradictory and confounding, but it seems hard to believe that the surprisingly soft   numbers for the ECI in Q2 and Q1 were drawn from a labor market under pressure, perhaps   giving some more weight to President Poole’s comments on the anecdotal information there    Even the productivity numbers are somewhat ambiguous in their implications for cost   and price pressures Although past productivity growth appears to have been lower, and the staff   marked down its estimate of structural productivity growth for 2005 and beyond, actual   productivity data for 2005 are running at a higher rate than had previously been anticipated  The   estimate for the first half of the year was revised up to 2½ percent, and the current quarter is   projected to be substantially higher than that   Market participants seem to think the measured pace of policy tightening will be   adequate They have added to the extent of the tightening but not the pace  And inflation   compensation, as President Lacker noted, while edging a little higher over the intermeeting   period, remains much lower than it was just a few months ago, despite the further increase in   energy prices   Finally, I think the strategy we have followed of tightening at a measured pace and being   transparent about our intentions has a number of advantages  In particular, following this   strategy—especially compared to one of larger increases or those that weren’t well predicted by   the market—reduces the odds of significant overshooting  Gradual changes enable us to get a   better handle on their effects on the markets and the economy as they are happening  Their   predictability means that they are incorporated into financial conditions more readily and   accurately, bringing forward their effects on financial conditions and making observations about   their likely impact on the economy more accurate and timely                      August 9, 2005 69 of 110  And I wonder whether this strategy isn’t going to be especially useful given the   uncertainty about how our actions could affect housing prices, construction, and consumption    Increasing rates will affect housing markets Indeed, that’s a necessary condition for   constraining inflation pressures But increased uncertainty about the strength of this channel,   given the changing nature of mortgage markets, reinforces the arguments for a gradual approach   to policy, if possible   I agree that the incoming data should reinforce and strengthen our intention not to allow   inflation and inflation expectations to rise from here  I’m encouraged by the reaction of markets   to the news over the intermeeting period in adding 50 basis points to the string of expected   gradual increases in the funds rate This shows that they are not constrained by our language   from marking up long-term interest rates, and it strikes me as the right response, at least for now    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8168,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  Unlike   President Minehan, I don’t really look forward to evolving the language  [Laughter]   On the “gradually” issue, I guess I don’t think things have changed all that much  If we   look at 6-month moving averages of employment growth, we’ve been stuck in the same range for   quite a while now The initial claims have come down a little, but they haven’t really come   down that much So in my mind, improving gradually means that we’re gradually using up what   little remaining slack is there  And I don’t think the situation has changed materially over the   intermeeting period; those averages remain about what they were  We’re somewhat above the   sort of steady state that we need                      August 9, 2005 89 of 110 "
8212,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like President Geithner and many others of   you, I do view this as one of those rare situations in which we can truly say the outlook is more   uncertain than usual  [Laughter] But that should not deter us from proceeding with our   “measured pace” of rate increases   The pre-Katrina data themselves suggested some potentially interesting questions about   the outlook, which could have implications for policy going forward  I was especially struck by   the weakness in capital spending, despite high and rising profits and strength in other aspects of   the so-called fundamentals  It’s possible that business caution has increased again, perhaps out   of concern about the effects of the rapid run-up in energy prices on demand since last spring   But at the same time, house prices on the OFHEO index continued to rise at a very rapid pace   through the second quarter, supporting household spending and further increases in resource   utilization The expansion was continuing but had become even more unbalanced—more reliant   on declining household saving rates induced by rising house prices  Core inflation was coming   in lower than expected again But the potential for future price increases, absent a further   tightening of policy, was suggested by upside surprises on one measure of labor costs, rising   resource utilization, and the threat that increases in energy costs could feed through to underlying   inflation                      September 20, 2005 76 of 117  I agree with the staff’s assessment that the most likely outcome from Katrina is that the   economy will not be materially deflected from the path it was on  After the initial disruptions,   fiscal stimulus, rising house prices, and still favorable financial conditions, along with the   economy’s natural resilience, should overcome any drag from higher energy prices and should   keep activity increasing at a good clip in an economy that is already producing at a high level of   resource utilization   Under these circumstances, inflation pressures will not abate  And judging from the   tendency for the output gap to continue to shrink this year, we’ll probably need at least a couple   of rounds of rate increases to keep the economy near its potential and to prevent inflation from   trending higher Katrina has greatly added to uncertainty, and not just about the extent of the   near-term disruption or the effects on energy markets  The more difficult uncertainties relate to   how people may react to what has happened, how the government will decide to respond, and   how businesses and households will react to these governmental actions and to whatever the path   of energy prices turns out to be   How these uncertainties are resolved will affect the economy’s medium-term prospects   But at this point, that added uncertainty doesn’t look particularly asymmetrical in its implications   for the path of policy The risks are still two-sided  Growth could be stronger than anticipated,   for example, owing to greater government spending and new tax incentives, with implications   for inflation But on the other side, the rise in energy prices may have less of a persistent effect   on core inflation than the staff has predicted   The feed-through of energy prices to core inflation has declined appreciably over time,   and market participants who have actually marked down longer-term nominal interest rates since                   September 20, 2005 77 of 117  August may have it right that higher energy prices will have more of a negative influence on   demand than a positive effect on long-term inflation  The skews in the probabilities for the most   likely outcomes were highlighted by the Michigan survey on Friday, pointing to extra weight on   the possibility of weaker growth from increasing energy prices that affect consumer psychology   and spending but also pointing to potentially higher inflation if expectations do become   unanchored And these skews themselves have offsetting implications for policy   Moreover, uncertainty isn’t going to be reduced by pausing or slowing the pace of   tightening This uncertainty isn’t about the response of the economy to past or future monetary   policy actions Raising the funds rate, as expected, isn’t likely to undermine sentiment or   spending Indeed, pausing, slowing down, or being more ambiguous about our expectations for   policy going forward could confuse the public about our view of the situation   In sum, this is a situation in which we should make our best guesses as to the likely   outcome, however bad those guesses may be, and act on them, continuing the “measured pace”   of tightening for now Thank you  "
8213,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I’m not sure   we’re building a buffer here I think this is a question of what we need to do  And to keep   going, at least until we get some more clarification, I believe is the right thing to do  "
8257,2005-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to talk a little bit to the point Bill made,   especially if we’re going to do a survey of Committee members  I like the way we’re getting the   forecast now The staff has a view of forces of aggregate demand, potential supply, and inflation   pressures, and they take that view and fold in some course of Federal Reserve policy that will   produce an outcome that we see in the Greenbook  And in some cases, for some types of prices,   they think they can’t do any better than the market so they just put in the market forecast  Other   prices, like bond yields, etc, are endogenous; stock prices are endogenous to the process   If we ask the staff to put together a forecast that had their view of demand and supply and   inflation pressures, together with market prices—which may be built on a different view of supply                                       November 1, 2005 27 of 114  and demand and market prices—I’m not sure what we’d get in the end  We’d get an outcome that   could look very strange from time to time when their view and the market’s view differ  And then   we would want to know what we would have to do in order to produce something that looked more   sensible     Right now, we have your fed funds forecast in there  If we went the other way, I would ask   for another forecast that incorporated how the staff thought market prices would evolve  There’s no   perfect way of doing this  But I’m a little more comfortable with the way it is done now than I   would be in the other case    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Unlike President Geithner, I view the incoming   information over the intermeeting period as having mixed implications for what might be required   from us to keep inflation in check  On the one hand, demand and output, as he noted, appear to be   continuing to grow at a pace that over time is likely to gradually put added pressure on resources    Apparently, the tightening of monetary policy, the rise in energy prices, and the appreciation of the   dollar in the first half of the year were not enough to slow growth to trend in the third quarter  And   the September employment report and October data on initial claims suggest that the underlying   pace of job creation has been maintained going into the fourth quarter  Moreover, demand over the   next few quarters, as many of you pointed out, should be boosted by the ramping up of rebuilding   efforts   Still, conditions do seem to be in place for a moderation in growth over the intermediate term    Financial conditions have tightened  Interest rates have moved higher; in response the exchange   rate has firmed and stock prices have dropped a little  All of the increase since the last meeting was   in real interest rates, and most of the rise didn’t seem to be in response to data, but rather to our own   speeches, making it unambiguously restraining  In addition, volatilities have backed up a little and   risk spreads have widened just a little since the middle of the summer, suggesting that investors are   a bit less confident about the future, even if they’re still too confident   Data and anecdotes on housing markets hint at some moderation, and that began even before   the recent rise in rates, perhaps as a consequence of the earlier increases in interest rates as well as   the elevated level of house prices relative to incomes  Home equity loans at banks actually fell last   month, suggesting that equity extraction is no longer so attractive  But as best we can tell, without a   new repeat-sales index, the rate of increase in the prices of existing single-family homes has not                                          November 1, 2005 66 of 114  slowed, while price increases for condos have moderated very little and remain quite high  All in   all, we seem to have reached an inflection point in the housing market, fortunately  And house price   increases, working through the wealth channel and as an inducement to construction, should be less   of a stimulus to demand in the future, though how much and how fast is a very open question   Higher energy prices could take something off of consumption, even after gasoline prices   decline in coming months  Natural gas prices will be elevated through the winter heating season    And the negative results of consumer sentiment surveys—which persisted into October, even as gas   prices declined—could be suggesting a more marked response than we’ve seen over the past few   years of increases   In the staff forecasts these forces slow the economy to a rate of growth slightly below its   potential, even with a slight easing of financial conditions as policy firms less than the market has   built in   It’s as good a guess as any and better than any forecast I might make  Given the range of   uncertainty, however, the important point for us at this meeting is that growth is likely to slow to   closer to the rate of growth of potential, but it’s probably going to take at least a couple more policy   firmings   The news on prices and costs has been more favorable for the inflation outlook  Core inflation   has been damped, despite substantial increases in energy prices before the hurricanes  Because the   increases in the prices of petroleum and petroleum products have been large and sustained, they are   more likely to show through to core prices than at any time since 1980  But I’m encouraged by the   lack of much response so far this year  And energy prices themselves have eased off much more   than expected when we last met   Pass-through effects of past increases in energy prices in the staff forecast are magnified and   persist for a time because of the associated increase in inflation expectations  In this regard, the                            November 1, 2005 67 of 114  results of the Michigan Survey are cautionary, but long-run forward measures of inflation   compensation in the market have risen only modestly, and they do remain well below their levels of   last year and the early part of this year  I suspect that household inflation expectations will ease   back if gasoline prices retreat, as they are expected to   Business labor costs are probably not putting much upward pressure on prices  The trend in   ECI compensation continues to be favorable, including wages and salaries increasing at a 2½   percent rate for several quarters now  The lack of upward pressure is especially noteworthy in the   face of huge increases in consumer energy costs, and it seems inconsistent with tightness in labor   markets that might begin to escalate costs at prevailing levels of resource utilization  And   productivity growth in the third quarter was strong, holding down the rise in unit labor costs  In the   Greenbook, compensation and core prices accelerate noticeably over coming quarters  In my view,   incoming price and compensation data raise the odds that the pickup could be a bit smaller, with   inflation settling at a slightly lower level if output follows the Greenbook path   On attitudes, we’ve had competing anecdotes at this meeting  Most of you—I think the   majority of you—seem to suggest that businesses are sensing some increased pricing power  That   would, if it’s true, support the staff forecast; but it hasn’t shown through in actual prices paid by   consumers as of yet  Because the economy seems to have a good deal of forward momentum at a   time when resource utilization is high, and because higher energy prices do threaten to feed through   to core prices and inflation expectations, we need to continue firming until we have some better   indications that conditions are in place to keep inflation restrained   Underlying trends in output and employment will be obscured by the effects of the hurricanes,   including the onset of rebuilding efforts, and this circumstance probably amplifies the already   present danger of overshooting with our policy  I’m not sure myself how useful estimates of r*, the                                           November 1, 2005 68 of 114  neutral federal funds rate, will be in reducing the risk of overshooting  They do provide a rough   guide that we’re in the neighborhood, but I don’t think they’re a very precise measurement  In that   regard, I myself am not uncomfortable retaining the “accommodative” language until we decide we   don’t need to tighten anymore  I’ve defined accommodative for my own purposes as too low   [laughter]—too low to accomplish my objectives   I think we can mitigate the risk of overshooting in policy by keeping our eyes on the   underlying drivers of resource utilization and demand—such as housing prices and household   reaction to energy prices, as well as cost pressures and inflation expectations  And I do think the   “measured pace” of tightening has been helpful in this regard as well, in contrast to 1994 and 1995   when tightening picked up at the end and I think the risk of overshooting increased  I’m   comfortable with tightening again at this meeting and signaling that we do not think we are finished   removing accommodation  But just what we should signal about our expectations for the future will   require a fresh look at each meeting, and I support the general sentiment that we need to look at our   language very, very carefully going forward  Thank you  "
8258,2005-11-01," I agree with your recommendations—moving 25 basis points, sticking with this   language, and giving full consideration to new language between now and the next meeting  I’m   actually not as worried as some others about the statement being stale  It has been accomplishing   our objectives, I think, in an amazingly successful way  Markets have correctly interpreted what   we’re talking about and what we’re doing  We haven’t had the slip-ups that we had when we were   changing language a lot    No, it has been unchanged for quite a while; I agree with that  But we can defer   this discussion  "
8302,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The news over the intermeeting period has   suggested some shift in the nature of the inflation risks faced by the economy  Low and stable core   consumer price inflation together with declining retail energy prices and some continued edging lower                             December 13, 2005 53 of 100  of inflation expectations seem to imply a reduced threat from near-term feed-through of energy prices   to expectations or to core inflation   At the same time, however, information on output and demand indicate that the economy   remains on a growth track which is expanding a little more quickly than potential supply  And this is   a trajectory that would increase pressure on resources at a time when those resources are already   being fairly well employed The reasons for the greater-than-expected momentum in output are   unclear  Some of the strength may represent a more muted response to hurricane disruptions or   energy prices than anticipated, but much would seem to be related to underlying strength in aggregate   demand  The upward surprises in demand in the third quarter were global, not just in the United   States Increases in industrial commodity prices and sizable gains in equity prices around the world   evidence widespread economic strength and expectations that it will persist   Added demand and rising equity prices have provoked little, if any, offsetting tightening in   financial conditions in credit markets  Long-term interest rates globally were little changed on   balance over the intermeeting period, and risk spreads out the yield curve and across risk categories   continue to be low, reflecting the basically optimistic outlook of investors   Perhaps the resilience of the global economy to oil price increases and persistent expansion in   global GDP, including in such laggards as Japan, are slowly increasing the confidence of non-  financial businesses as well  In the United States, the growth of business investment has come into   line with past relationships with the cost of capital and changes in output, though the level of   investment still remains a bit lower than might be expected   As a consequence of this strength, one question is whether the current constellation of interest   rates and asset prices, including expectations of the funds rate topping out in the 4½ to 4¾ percent   range here, is tight enough to produce the moderation in growth needed to keep the economy in the                            December 13, 2005 54 of 100  neighborhood of its potential and to keep inflation stable  In the staff forecast and in the markets,   such a rise in the funds rate is seen as sufficient to contain inflation, and that strikes me as a   reasonable estimate, pending further information     Although long-term rates haven’t changed much for several quarters, short- and intermediate-   term rates have increased quite a lot and will continue to move higher as we firm policy  These   higher rates should exert increasing restraint on spending, especially for households that have been   relying on borrowing at low short-term rates to short-circuit liquidity and income constraints when   buying durables or houses   The slowing in consumer credit growth and mortgage loan applications in recent months may,   indeed, indicate that higher short- and intermediate-term rates are beginning to bite  Moreover,   perhaps as a consequence of the rise in borrowing costs, we do see some signs of a cooling in housing   markets, as many of you remarked  Certainly the perceptions about housing markets of both builders   and buyers have deteriorated noticeably in recent months, and the shift in attitudes may be particularly   important when a significant portion of the activity in this market has been linked to investment   demand  Based on these indicators and others, a slowing of house price appreciation and a   moderation in construction activity next year seem to be a reasonable expectation  Such a slowing is   a critical element behind the moderation in growth next year in the staff forecast, and I suspect in the   market’s assessment as well   Still, we need to see more concrete evidence that this channel is working as anticipated, both   in prices and in activity, before we can be confident that demand is likely to moderate  Nonetheless,   the incoming information also reinforces the notion that we can afford to retain the gradual path of   policy tightening as we look for signs that moderation is coming  With the upward revision to   estimated structural productivity growth, the economy is not expanding very much above its long-run                      December 13, 2005 55 of 100  growth of potential  In addition, the better productivity and the downward revision to compensation   data show the increase in business costs being held in check better than had been evident  And the   higher rate of growth of structural productivity should help to hold down that increase in costs going   forward  Moreover, the markups of price over unit labor costs have risen appreciably in the last two   quarters for both nonfarm business as a whole and, within that category, for nonfinancial corporations    And those markups are close to the record highs of the mid-1990s, suggesting that businesses have   some room and incentive to absorb some of the increases in labor costs that might be coming   As a consequence of these developments, I think we can be a little less concerned about the   immediate threat of higher inflation, though we still need to focus on forestalling the potential for   supply-demand imbalances to develop over the medium run  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8303,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your proposition to tighten policy by 25   basis points today  And I agree with you that we’ll probably have to move in January, with a good   deal of uncertainty about where we’ll go after that  If I could design the market reaction to our   announcement—which I know from long experience I can’t—I would leave rates about unchanged   when we’re finished, with some probability of tightening past January, but not 100 percent  Like you,   I think we’re at a point where the momentum in demand and the level of resource utilization are such   that if we’re going to make a mistake, we ought to err a bit on the side of going too far rather than   stopping too soon   Exactly what the role of asset prices is in that is a much more difficult issue  I certainly see   asset prices playing through to the macroeconomic situation, as you said—in particular, housing   prices and the way they have stimulated not only residential construction but consumption more   generally  And as I said in my remarks, I think we need to see some sign that that market is cooling   off So, in that regard, I agree that asset prices are critical to the outlook  Whether I would worry                                   December 13, 2005 85 of 100  about imbalances and put a little more emphasis on them, aside from the macro outlook, I think is a   much more difficult question   In terms of the language, despite my expansive reading of the word “accommodative” at the   last meeting, I support its deletion from the announcement and the wording of alternative B  I don’t   think we have to go to a restrictive policy in this firming cycle, which I would define as a policy   designed to cause the economy to run below potential in order to reduce inflation  I think I’ve just   been reinforced in that judgment by the recent data on costs and prices  But we don’t need to get into   linguistic hair-splitting to make our point about what we intend to do  I support taking attention off of   a precise definition of “neutral,” which remains a shifting and elusive quarry  And that was inherent   in the use of the word “accommodative”   In terms of the wording of the statement itself, I like alternative B as it is currently worded  I   agree with you that moving from “is likely” to “may” would signal that we are about to stop, or that   we think the odds are at best 50/50 that we’ll move again, and we would have a heck of a rally in   financial markets  And as I said, I’d prefer to leave markets unchanged at the end of this  So I would   go with “is likely” at this point, given my expectations, and save moving to “may” for the January   meeting, if we think the odds are 50/50 for March   As for the word “measured,” I would prefer to keep it in the statement  To me, it means that   we think we’ll be moving in 25 basis point increments, and I do believe that’s our intention  I’d be   concerned that omitting it would be interpreted as an indication that the Committee would be looking   at the possibility of moving in 50 basis point increments, and I don’t think that’s what we intend to do    In the phrase “measured pace,” I thought it was the word “pace” that tended to carry the concept of a   series of moves, rather than the word “measured,” which, to me, meant 25  So I’m in favor of   dropping “pace” and keeping “measured”  Thank you, Mr Chairman                            December 13, 2005 86 of 100 "

8348,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The projections I submitted for this meeting   reflected expectations of an economy that probably is operating in level terms somewhere in the   January 31, 2006 61 of 106    neighborhood of its long-run, sustainable potential and will continue to do so over the next two   years with growth broadly in line with the growth of potential and inflation basically stable  My   forecasts for 2006 are very close to those I submitted last January and June  That’s partly a product   of innate stubbornness  [Laughter]  But it also reflects the fact that 2005 came in largely as   expected—after allowance for hurricanes and an energy shock last year that elevated core inflation   and damped growth somewhat compared with our forecasts last January  This is encouraging in   that it suggests that we are not looking at major unexplained and unanticipated forces acting on the   economy   At this point, our focus appropriately is on keeping inflation contained  I see several reasons   for optimism in this regard  One is the performance of core consumer prices and price measures,   which continue to suggest that the pass-through of higher energy prices will be limited  Core   inflation was roughly stable last year  It picked up a bit in the fourth quarter, but that was from   unusually low readings in the third quarter  Declining consumer inflation expectations in the most   recent Michigan survey, along with the failure of market-based inflation compensation readings to   respond significantly to the substantial run-up in oil prices and higher core readings over the   intermeeting period, just reinforce my assessment that any pass-through should be small and limited   in duration   As we noted at the last meeting, perhaps the greater threat to sustained good inflation   performance comes from possible increases in pressures on resources  The critical question is   whether growth in output close to trend is a reasonable expectation with only modest further policy   firming, given the low level of long-term rates, reduced drag from energy prices, and a boost from   rebuilding  I thought it was a reasonable expectation, for a number of reasons  First, after   smoothing through the fluctuations caused by auto incentives and hurricanes, private domestic final   January 31, 2006 62 of 106    demand already showed signs of moderation last year  Growth in private domestic final sales   slowed from 4¼ percent in the first half of the year to 3 percent in the second half of the year, with   every element—consumption, business fixed investment, residential housing investment—  moderating  The staff estimates that about 03 of this was due to hurricane effects, but that still   leaves underlying private demand slowing to an annual rate of about 3¼ or 3½ percent  This   moderation did not reflect the full effects of our policy tightening, especially on the housing market    Even well-anticipated increases in the short-term rates seem to be having a significant effect on   housing markets, which have become more dependent on adjustable rate mortgages to maintain   affordability  We are just beginning to see the anticipated slowdown in this sector   With growth in consumption and sales constrained by a leveling-out of housing wealth,   businesses are unlikely to see the need to step up the pace at which they are adding to their capital   stock  As a consequence, investment growth could slow, at least slightly, over the next few years,   reflecting reduced impetus from the accelerator  Finally, although foreign economies are   strengthening some, foreign investment and consumption remain subdued relative to income  And   given our continuing outsized appetite for imports, net exports are unlikely to be putting added   impetus to demands on domestic production    I think there are several upside and downside risks around this picture of growth near   potential, as a number of you pointed out  I agree that the housing market is the most likely source   of a shortfall in demand  I don’t think we can have much confidence about how the dynamics of   this market will play out now that it has begun to soften  My suspicion is that, as little bubbles in   the froth are popped, the risks are tilted more toward quite a sharp cooling off than toward a very   gradual ebbing of price increases and building activity  On the other side, it seems to me global   demand would be a major upside risk to growth and to price stability  The extraordinarily rapid rise   January 31, 2006 63 of 106    in commodity prices and upward movement in global equity prices may indicate a very fundamental   turnaround in foreign demand and attitudes beyond just a stepwise strengthening of growth  For   now, these remain risks that we’ll need to monitor   In making my forecast, I assumed we would tighten at this meeting, and likely at the next as   well, to gain greater assurance that inflation will remain contained over time, consistent with my   forecast of a 1¾ percent increase in core prices in 2007  However, I do see action in March as   dependent on the readings we get in coming months  There is, as usual, considerable uncertainty   about the precise nature and magnitude of the risk to the outlook, but we’re dealing with an   economic picture that overall is remarkably good and expected to remain that way for the   foreseeable future   Reflecting on this situation, among many, many aspects of the past, I end my remarks as I   began them  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8349,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree on the second point that we should   postpone consideration of what we vote on for the reasons that the Vice Chairman just noted  I   support the increase in the federal funds rate today  I’m a little concerned, like the Vice Chairman,   that this “may” language could cause a bit of a rally in financial markets, but I think it reflects the   general tone around the table and is certainly close to my thinking  I think we’re more likely to   have to firm than not at the next meeting—the odds are 50–50 or greater—and this puts the market   on notice that that’s approximately what our thinking is  So I agree with that one  "
