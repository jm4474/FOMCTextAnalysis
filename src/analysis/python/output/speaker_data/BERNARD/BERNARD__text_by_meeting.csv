7441,2003-12-09,BERNARD,"  I’ll be reading the directive wording on page 15 of the Bluebook and,   with regard to risk assessments, the first two sentences that the Chairman read to you from the   draft press release  That’s what is being voted on  With regard to the directive itself  “The   Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with   maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”  With regard to the   sentences going into the press statement  “The Committee perceives that the upside and   downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly   equal  The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and   now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation”       Chairman Greenspan   Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner  Yes  Governor Bernanke   Yes  Governor Bies    Yes  President Broaddus   Yes  Governor Ferguson   Yes  Governor Gramlich   Yes  President Guynn   Yes  Governor Kohn   Yes  President Moskow   Yes  Governor Olson   Yes    President Parry   Yes     "

7495,2004-03-16,BERNARD,"  I’ll begin with the directive wording, which is at the bottom of page 11   in the Bluebook “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions   that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run   objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent   with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”  Moving on to the risk   assessment, which is part of the formal vote, that would be the language under “B” on page 12   “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable   growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal  The probability of an unwelcome fall in   inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in   inflation  With inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be   patient in removing its policy accommodation”     Chairman Greenspan   Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner  Yes  Governor Bernanke   Yes  Governor Bies    Yes  Governor Ferguson   Yes  Governor Gramlich   Yes  President Hoenig   Yes  Governor Kohn   Yes  President Minehan   Yes  Governor Olson   Yes  President Pianalto   Yes  President Poole   Yes      March 16, 2004 88 of 107   "
7519,2004-05-04,BERNARD,"  As far as the directive is concerned, the wording can be found on page 14   of the Bluebook “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions   that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run   objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent   with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent”   With regard to the wording also being voted on, taking Vincent’s revised draft, sentence   number 6, of course, is unchanged from last time  It reads “The Committee perceives that the   upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are   roughly equal”  And then we have the revised wording under alternative B for sentences 7 and 8   “Similarly, the risks to the goal of price stability have moved into balance  At this juncture, with   May 4, 2004 100 of 112       inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be   removed at a pace that is likely to be measured”     Chairman Greenspan  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bernanke  Yes  Governor Bies   Yes  Governor Ferguson  Yes  Governor Gramlich  Yes  President Hoenig  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Minehan  Yes  Governor Olson  Yes  President Pianalto  Yes  President Poole  Yes    "
7543,2004-06-29,BERNARD,"  I’ll begin with the directive itself, which is on page 14 of the Bluebook    “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price   stability and promote sustainable growth in output  To further its long-run objectives, the   Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing   the federal funds rate to an average of around 1¼ percent”   Then with regard to the portion of the statement in the press release that is part of the vote,   which is the third paragraph, the wording is  “The Committee perceives the upside and downside   risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are   roughly equal With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes   that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured  Nonetheless, the   Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligations to   maintain price stability”     Chairman Greenspan  Yes  Vice Chairman Geithner Yes  Governor Bernanke  Yes  Governor Bies   Yes  Governor Ferguson  Yes  Governor Gramlich  Yes  President Hoenig  Yes  Governor Kohn  Yes  President Minehan  Yes  Governor Olson  Yes   June 29-30, 2004 154 of 203          President Pianalto  Yes  President Poole  Yes     "
