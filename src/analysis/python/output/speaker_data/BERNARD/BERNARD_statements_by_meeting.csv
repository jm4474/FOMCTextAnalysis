4,1987-08-18," In the operational paragraph, there's a problem that Mr Cross and Mr Truman pointed out on the factual portion of lines 24 to 26 The dollar, at least as of an hour ago, instead of having risen further, was unchanged I don't know what the latest figure is, so that needs to be changed to make it factually correct   About unchanged   ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, and the behavior of the aggregates This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June to September at an annual rate of around 5 percent Growth in M1, while picking up from recent levels, is expected to remain well below its pace during 1986 The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate consistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent "

113,1987-11-03," In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions sought in recent days The Committee recognizes that the volatile conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for a special degree of flexibility in open market operations depending, in particular, on demands for liquidity growing out of recent or prospective developments in financial markets Apart from such considerations, slightly lesser reserve restraint would--   --or slightly greater reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates While the outlook for monetary growth over the months ahead is subject to unusual uncertainty, the contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from September through December at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent, but more rapid growth is possible should preferences for liquidity be particularly strong Over the same period, growth in M1 is expected to be well above its average pace in the previous several months The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent   Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Boehne Yes President Boykin Yes Governor Heller Yes Governor Johnson Yes President Keehn Yes Governor Kelley Yes Governor Seger Yes President Stern Yes "
