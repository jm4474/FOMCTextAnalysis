9207,2013-10-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Concerns about the approaching debt  ceiling began to affect financial markets when the government shut down on October  1 and intensified significantly early last week  The effects on the Treasury bill and  repo markets have been most pronounced, and outflows from money market funds  have been sizable  Yesterday, Fitch placed the US triple-A credit rating on negative  watch  Nonetheless, broader financial conditions have not been materially affected   Since the start of October, yields on Treasury bills maturing between October 17  and November 14 had increased as much as 66 basis points  The most concerning  development has been soft demand in recent bill auctions, some of which have  cleared at unusually high spreads to pre-auction yields and had multiyear-low bid-to- cover ratios  However, today’s bill auctions were relatively well received, and bill  rates have declined substantially during the trading session today   Yields on longer-term Treasury securities, including those with interest payments  scheduled for the end of the month or later this year, have been relatively little  changed   Turning to secured funding markets, overnight Treasury GC repo rates had  increased as much as 16 basis points since the start of the month  Term Treasury GC  repo rates have also increased, with mid-November and year-end tenors rising as  much as about 20 basis points  Lenders reportedly pulled back from term lending  amid concerns that, without the ability to modify collateral eligibility schedules over  the term of the contract, they might receive securities at risk of delayed payment  The  resulting rise in term rates, along with concerns regarding the possible receipt of at- risk securities in overnight transactions, reportedly pressured overnight rates higher    October 16, 2013 7 of 50    Despite increased volatility, contacts have characterized overnight GC repo markets  as relatively liquid, though they have reported some deterioration in the liquidity of  term markets   Amid the rise in repo rates, the Desk’s dealer repo survey shows that the amount  of Treasury securities financed by dealers in overnight repo was relatively little  changed through last week, but has trended up so far this week  Money market fund  outflows have been sizable, and several large fund complexes and banks indicated  that they had sold their holdings of Treasury securities maturing from mid-October to  early November or announced they had no holdings of these securities  Many  reported taking related proceeds and placing them in overnight repo or leaving cash  uninvested, and available data indicate sharp increases in deposit balances at  custodian banks this week     Turning to Desk operations, we have not seen any material change in dealer  pricing of Treasury coupon securities with at-risk interest payments in our purchases,  the composition of collateral in securities lending transactions, or participation in the  daily overnight RRP operations  However, the Desk has received numerous  questions and concerns about Federal Reserve activities and market practices more  broadly  The general confusion on several important operational issues appears to  have weighed on confidence and possibly on industry preparedness and contingency  planning  The most frequent questions have related to the eligibility of securities with  delayed payments in open market operations and at the discount window   I would be happy to take any questions     In the case of delayed payment, the most crucial risk is that the Treasury   loses market access  In most of the assumptions that we are working under, the Treasury would   still have market access  So in that sense the principal payments would be rolling over  I guess   I’m not answering the right question  In the case of an actual default, the Treasury would have   issues there  The scenario we’ve been thinking about is that the risk of a delayed payment gets   very high, and then the Treasury might lose market access  That causes problems for them in   rolling over the large amount of debt, and it’s the principal payments that are most sizable     The most obvious would be that they would fail to cover the auction   amount  I would view that as losing market access  Pricing is clearly one concern  We saw   quite adverse pricing, relative to where bills were before the auctions, last week  I think that’s   something that we could absorb, but it would be the lack of coverage of the auction that would   be the problem  And that would mean that they wouldn’t be able to roll over the principal     Yes  I would like to briefly highlight some of the operational  issues the Desk would encounter with the possible policy actions and delayed- payment scenarios  Some of these issues are also faced by market participants in  their own transactions   First, in order for the Desk to accept Treasury securities with delayed principal  payments in operations, the Treasury would need to authorize the New York Fed to  extend on Fedwire the maturity date of any security maturing the next day—by   1000 pm at the very latest   Second, the Desk’s current Treasury LSAP purchases are not likely to  substantially mitigate market disruptions in delayed-payment scenarios  As a simple  example, we have about $22 billion left to purchase in October, and even if we only  purchased securities that will pay a coupon on October 31 during eligible operations  for those securities, it would amount to about $9 billion of the $700 billion in affected  securities   Third, while the Desk’s securities lending operation would be one way for market  participants to borrow unaffected securities, the legal agreements and some of the  processing infrastructure around these transactions make them less effective in  delayed-payment scenarios  In particular, the timing of operations will not allow  dealers to finance their borrowed securities in the triparty repo market    Fourth, repo operations could provide cash against affected securities, providing a  direct response to funding pressures  However, the current structure of triparty  settlement practices for any cash lender, including the Desk, may result in large  intraday credit exposures for securities that mature during the course of the repo term   That finishes the operational issues I wanted to highlight     I think Lorie is telling me maybe about two weeks, and I think she means   two weeks, not 10 business days  Is that right?  Yes     So that would be 70 percent  I think that’s a very large number relative   to the securities we’re talking about  If I understand President Lockhart, it’s the Fed’s   intervening when there are delayed payments on US Treasuries and taking those out of the   market that has a strange appearance  I think what Bill English was trying to say is that we   would do the operation using market prices, and a lot of us think that the operational difficulties   of dealing with delayed payments are what we are trying to deal with then, not providing   forbearance to the US government, because it would be at market prices   October 16, 2013 19 of 50      I would agree with what you said, Bill  The slight difference that I think   President Lockhart might be indicating is that we are basically asserting a confidence that we’ll   be paid back the principal, which requires the Treasury to be well over at auction, because those   are much larger amounts than the coupon payments     I was going to give the example of the Treasury Market Practices Group   (TMPG), which put out some guidance in the summer of 2012 about how we would roll   securities as being a good market practice  One way of looking at getting clarity over the   discount window and open market operations would be to give the market—assuming 1 through   5 would actually happen—certainty about that  And the way that the TMPG put this is, even   with this clarity, the actual event of either a delayed payment or getting very close to it, would be   a very serious event  And I think what I was trying to capture when I went through the   October 16, 2013 33 of 50    operational issues is even though, say, 1 through 5 is out there, that doesn’t really deal with those   fundamental operational issues  It just takes one of them off the table for the market  They still   have the rest of them to deal with   For President Lacker’s point, we gave the example in our existing LSAPs that there   would be $700 billion at risk for the October 31 coupon  At most, under our existing regime, we   will be able to buy 9 of those  So it’s unlikely we could directly affect whatever the market   would want to do with those $700 billion if the market had a strong view on those securities     It’s actually the opposite, President Evans  When this came up at the   most recent TMPG meeting, and people repeatedly asked us, we would not give an answer to   this, because our understanding is there hadn’t been an agreement to give clarity on this issue    So we have various nonanswers that we give to people     I think most people perfectly understand why we’re not saying anything    But they might not understand why they’re supposed to understand that—if people can follow   that  "
