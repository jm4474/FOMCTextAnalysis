7281,2004-01-27,"  Your first international exhibit presents an overview of   developments in selected international financial markets  As can be seen in the top  left panel, a key development over the past half-year has been the renewed slide in the   January 27-28, 2004 97 of 238    foreign exchange value of the dollar  The decline in the broad dollar (the black line)  was due entirely to depreciation against the major currencies (the red line)  The  dollar fell to record lows against the euro (the black line on the right) but also fell  substantially against the pound (the magenta line) and the yen (the blue line) as well  as all the other major currencies  In contrast, since last summer the dollar has held its  ground against the currencies of our other important trading partners, depicted by the  blue line in the left panel  The dollar appreciated against the Mexican peso, while  developing Asian governments generally continued to resist appreciation of the  currencies, as indicated by the stability of the Korean won      The other key development in international financial markets since your last chart   show has been the response to expectations of rising economic growth  As indicated  in your middle left panel, movements in long-term bond yields in major foreign  economies have mirrored the rise in US yields since last summer, as well as their  recent slight decline  Stock prices, on the right, extended their second-quarter  rebound through the end of the year, both in industrial countries and in emerging  markets  As shown in the bottom left panel, another indicator of improving  confidence, yield spreads for both emerging-market countries and industrial-country  corporate borrowers, continued to move down last year  With EMBI+ spreads now at  their lowest level since before the Russia crisis in 1998, some concerns have been  raised that borrowing conditions have become too easy, raising the possibility of  future financial crises  However, as shown on the right, gross capital flows to  emerging-market countries remain well below their 1997 peaks, even as cross-border  debt issuance by industrial economies has continued to grow      Your next exhibit describes the recent and projected recovery of global economic   growth  As indicated in the first row of the top left panel, our trade-weighted  aggregate of foreign real GDP, after languishing in the first half of 2003, is estimated  to have accelerated to a pace of nearly 4 percent in the second half  With monetary  and fiscal conditions in most economies remaining accommodative, the global high- tech sector on the rebound, and US growth projected to remain strong, we see  foreign real GDP growth remaining brisk through 2004 before slowing a bit next  year  This growth should gradually reduce the extent of economic slack abroad  It  should also support continued expansion of international trade; as shown in the top  right panel, the rebound in world exports over the past two years has mirrored the  turnaround in global industrial production       As indicated in the middle left panel, the acceleration in economic activity has   also contributed, along with the decline in the dollar and other developments, to  rebounds in oil prices (the black line) and other commodity prices (the red line)   Going forward, oil prices are projected to decline over the next two years, in line with  quotes from futures markets, as increasing supplies of Iraqi and non-OPEC oil  become available, while nonfuel commodity prices level off  With commodity prices  stabilizing and excess capacity projected to diminish only gradually, inflation rates,  shown on the right, are expected to continue moving down in Latin America and to  remain subdued in the industrial countries and developing Asia   January 27-28, 2004 98 of 238    Returning to the top left panel of your exhibit, the second row indicates that the  foreign industrial countries are expected to share in the global economic rebound, but  at a slower pace than the world economy as a whole  Industrial country growth is  expected to register just under 3 percent this year and next, and the path of euro-area  growth (line 3) is expected to be lower still  As shown by the red line in the bottom  left panel, industrial production in the euro area has moved up since the middle of last  year, while the rise in business sentiment indicators such as the German Ifo survey  (the black line) point to further strengthening  Going forward, the euro-area economy  will likely benefit from the rebound in global growth and from continued low interest  rates; however, it faces headwinds in the form of an appreciating currency and some  move toward fiscal restraint      In Japan (line 4 in the top left panel) GDP growth is expected to slow a bit in the   next two years from the 2½ percent pace registered in the second half of 2003,  notwithstanding the additional quantitative monetary easing announced by the Bank  of Japan last week  As shown in the bottom right panel, available indicators suggest  the economy is unlikely to fall back into recession  Machinery orders have moved up  on balance in recent months while unemployment is edging down  Still,  unemployment rates remain high by historical standards and are likely to restrain  future consumption  Moreover, much of Japan’s growth in recent quarters has been  due to buoyant exports to developing Asia; with growth in this region slated to slow  from its brisk second-half rebound, and with the yen having strengthened recently, the  stimulus from exports and export-related investment will likely diminish     The outlook for the emerging-market economies is described in your next exhibit    As indicated in line 1 of the top left panel, real GDP growth for these countries  rebounded at a 61 percent annual rate in the second half of last year and is projected  to grow at still brisk rates over the next two years  The rebound in growth since last  summer was due almost entirely to developing Asia (line 2), which grew at a  blistering 11 percent pace in the second half after contracting slightly in the first half   This rebound in part reflected the recovery of retail sales, tourism, and confidence  from the SARS epidemic  The rebound was also due to the continued recovery of the  global high-tech sector; as shown in the top right panel, industrial production in many  developing Asian countries has tracked the recovery in the global semiconductor  industry  Finally, developing Asian growth has been boosted by buoyant domestic  demand in China, including substantial state sector investment  As shown in the  middle left panel, rising demand has helped to push consumer price inflation into  positive territory—although much of the rise reflects higher food prices—and has  also pushed down China’s trade surplus a bit  As shown on the right, exports of  developing Asian economies to China (the red line) have soared, even as exports to  the United States and Europe have been much weaker  While much of the increased  exports to China are being drawn in by higher domestic demand, many of these goods  are being further processed and re-exported to third markets  This reorientation of the  region’s trade along more vertically integrated lines is evidenced in the bottom left  panel, which shows that the recent growth of US imports from Asia is accounted for  exclusively by higher purchases from China   January 27-28, 2004 99 of 238    In contrast to developing Asia, the recovery of growth in Latin America (line 5 in  the top left panel) has been tentative  This is due in large part to lackluster  performance in Mexico (line 6)  As indicated in the bottom right panel, since mid- 2003, Mexican exports (the blue line) have recovered in tandem with US industrial  production (the black line)  However, Mexican industrial production (the red line)  has only recently turned up  The earlier weakness in Mexican production likely  reflected runoffs of inventories, and with US demand growth expected to remain  strong over the forecast period, we are projecting a rebound in Mexican growth going  forward  Nevertheless, several factors, including the failure of Mexico’s government  to make progress on tax and energy-sector reforms, point to vulnerabilities in the  economy’s performance     Your next exhibit addresses the outlook for the US external sector  As indicated   in the top left panel, both US export growth (the blue bars) and import growth (the  red bars) were quite weak in the first half of 2003 but picked up substantially in the  second half  This pattern reflects the recovery of GDP growth, shown at the right,  with US growth (the red bars) and foreign GDP (the blue bars) both rebounding  from their subdued first-half performance  Going forward, continued rapid GDP  growth here and abroad is expected to keep both exports and imports expanding  briskly  I should note that, while beef exports fall nearly to zero for most of this year  as a consequence of import bans prompted by mad cow disease, this should have only  a very small effect on aggregate export sales      Because US growth is projected to exceed foreign growth and because the   responsiveness of US imports to income is believed to exceed that of US exports to  foreign income, the growth of imports would be expected to exceed that of exports,  all else being equal  However, lagged effects of the past depreciation of the dollar,  shown in the middle left panel, as well as effects of mild projected future depreciation  are expected to buoy exports and restrain imports going forward  In consequence, the  growth of exports is projected to exceed that of imports in 2004 and 2005   Nevertheless, because imports are substantially greater than exports, imports rise in  absolute amount by more than exports over the forecast period  This leads to a  further widening of the current account deficit, shown as the black line in the middle  right panel  Owing to growth in the US economy, the deficit as a percent of GDP,  shown as the red line, narrows slightly over the next two years     Returning to the middle left panel, our forecast of a modest further depreciation of   the dollar is based on the view that the widening US current account deficit and the  need to finance it will continue to weigh on the dollar  Nevertheless, the timing and  magnitude of any future additional decline is obviously quite uncertain  The bottom  panel of your exhibit breaks down the recent financing of the current account, shown  on line 1  Notably, the share of the financing coming from official sources (line 2)  has stepped up considerably over the past year, reaching about $250 billion at an  annual rate in the first two months of the fourth quarter  Conversely, net private  capital flows (line 3) have moved down  Foreign purchases of US securities (line 4)  declined from $418 billion at an annual rate in the first half of 2003 to a little over   January 27-28, 2004 100 of 238    $300 billion in the first two months of the fourth quarter  Interpreting these data is  complicated, however, as purchases in September and October were extremely weak,  whereas they bounced back in November  Data on foreign direct investment in the  United States (line 6) are available only through the third quarter of last year, but  these inflows also show a decline from 2003H1  Conversely, US purchases of  foreign securities (line 5) and US direct investment abroad (line 7) appear to have  held up well in the second half of last year  These data suggest that official purchases  of dollars increasingly are substituting for private capital inflows in financing the US  current account deficit and, as such, may be preventing the dollar from moving down  more rapidly than would otherwise be the case       Your final exhibit explores some alternative scenarios for the dollar  As indicated   by the black line in the top panel, the broad real dollar, though down considerably  from its peak in early 2002, is still well above its trough in the 1990s  Particularly  given the widening external deficit, a steeper decline in the dollar than our baseline  projection is a distinct possibility  However, the implications for the US and foreign  economies will depend upon the circumstances in which this decline takes place  The  middle left panel details several alternative simulations of the staff’s model  In the  first scenario, indicated by the solid red line, the fall in the dollar is triggered by  higher-than-expected foreign GDP growth  Such higher growth might plausibly be  due to the long-awaited rise in productivity growth among foreign industrial  countries, for example, or to a pickup of investment and consumption in developing  Asia  Specifically, this scenario combines a shock to the risk premium on US assets,  which would lead to a 10 percent decline in the dollar in the absence of changes in  monetary policy, with a shock to foreign domestic demand equal to 1 percent of GDP  in 2004 and an additional 2 percent of GDP in 2005  This combination of higher  foreign growth, indicated by the red line in the bottom left panel, and the lower dollar  leads to an improvement in the US current account balance, the bottom right panel,  and a rise in US growth of about ½ percentage point, the middle right     The second dollar depreciation scenario is a so-called disorderly correction—that   is, a rapid fall in the dollar that engenders a steep falloff in US bond and equity  prices as well  It is not clear how plausible this scenario is  The fall in the dollar  since early 2002 has not disrupted financial markets, nor did it do so during the  dollar’s previous correction in the 1980s  Nevertheless, this scenario arises  frequently in financial press commentary on the dollar  So to explore its effects, we  assumed the same shock to the dollar as in scenario 1 but added shocks to risk  premiums in other asset markets that lower US stock prices about 12 percent and  raise long-term bond yields 50 basis points  The combined effect of these shocks is to  leave US growth (the dashed red line in the middle right panel) down only a little  from its baseline path, as the adverse effects of higher interest rates and lower stock  prices are offset by the stimulative effect of the dollar’s decline on net exports   However, foreign growth is lowered about ½ percentage point below baseline,  reflecting both the appreciation of their currencies and lower US growth        January 27-28, 2004 101 of 238    Finally, while we view the risks to the dollar to be weighted toward the downside,  we cannot preclude the possibility that the dollar may rise above its projected path  over the next several quarters  Our projection of US real GDP growth exceeds that  of most private forecasters, and as the market’s assessment of US growth and  associated rates of return is adjusted upward, the dollar may be boosted as well  The  blue dashed lines in your exhibit trace out the effects of such a shock  While foreign  growth is boosted above its baseline path, US growth is restrained a bit, and the  current account deficit widens  To sum up, considerable uncertainty surrounds both  future movements of the dollar and the circumstances under which such movements  might occur  At the risk of saying something you may have heard here before, this  makes the outlook for the US external sector particularly difficult to pin down at the  present time  [Laughter]  Sandy will now continue our presentation       Yes, they are   January 27-28, 2004 104 of 238      They would most likely still go up, but I think you’re quite right     That is very much the case  I completely agree with you that the measure   you are proposing probably would be superior  The constant price data for all of these different   countries, which we were getting from their national data sources, were not available    Transforming it into SDRs is a very good idea and would be worthwhile     That is correct, and I think you’re quite right that transforming the data   into SDRs would be useful       Absolutely  That said, one of the issues we’ve been focusing on in our   forecast of trade is the fact that trade does seem to be much more sensitive to industrial   production than it does to GDP  That’s in part because much of trade is composed of   January 27-28, 2004 105 of 238    manufactured goods, which are more related to industrial production than to GDP as a whole  So   we think there are definitely a lot of fundamentals underlying this correlation  But I believe you   are quite right that the decline in the dollar has probably exaggerated the relationship presented   in that chart  "
7753,2006-06-28,"  In contrast to the mixed news on economic activity coming out of   the United States and despite the international financial volatility that Dino described,  readings on foreign economic activity have been generally positive  Importantly,  some of the areas of the global economy that had been weak in previous years are  showing signs of strength  As indicated by the blue line in the top left panel of  exhibit 11, euro-area industrial production has been moving up on balance in recent  months, buoyed by solid manufacturing orders  The consumer had been the laggard  in the euro zone’s recovery; but retail sales have edged up, and the first-quarter data  on German consumption (not shown) were quite encouraging  In Japan, the middle  panel, the rapid expansion that kicked in last year appears to be continuing  As in the  euro area, manufacturing orders and output have been quite strong  And after  generally disappointing growth for the past several years, Mexico’s economy, shown  on the right, has accelerated on the back of strong manufacturing production, destined  in large part for the United States     These indications support our estimate that total foreign growth (line 1 in the   middle panel) registered a healthy and broad-based 3½ percent in the current quarter   To be sure, this represents a step-down from the exceptionally strong performance in  the first quarter  The deceleration was mainly in emerging market economies (line 7),  particularly China and Mexico  The Chinese government has taken several additional  measures in recent months to slow investment, including restricting investment in  certain sectors, raising down payments for real estate purchases, and tightening  lending guidelines; we anticipate that these measures will finally bring overall growth  down to a more sustainable pace  Mexican GDP, having surged more than 6 percent  in the first quarter, likely has cooled to a still-robust 3½ percent rate in the second   Second-quarter growth in the industrial economies (line 2) is estimated to have shown  a more muted decline from its first-quarter pace  Canadian growth likely slowed  along with the US economy, but Japanese growth is estimated to have stayed strong  while activity in the euro area and the United Kingdom accelerated      Beyond the current quarter, we see growth in the emerging market economies   holding steady while that of industrial economies moderates a bit further  Lower US  economic growth will restrain demand  Additionally, foreign economic activity will   June 28-29, 2006 17 of 177    be responding to previous and prospective increases in interest rates  As shown in the  bottom left panel, which presents our projections for key foreign policy rates,  although we believe the tightening cycle is winding down in Canada, it still has a way  to go in the euro area, and it has yet to begin in Japan     Finally, the recent sharp declines in global stock markets (the black and purple   lines on the right) as well as the increase in emerging market credit spreads (the red  line) will likely weigh on spending in both industrial and emerging market  economies  Were downdrafts in international financial markets to continue and to  intensify, they could lead to sharp falloffs in activity  For now, however, financial  markets appear to be stabilizing with equity prices having reversed only a small part  of previous steep run-ups and EMBI spreads remaining at historically low levels  A  few economies—especially Turkey, South Africa, and Hungary—remain under  pressure, but this likely reflects their particular vulnerabilities rather than more  generalized turmoil in emerging markets  Accordingly, returning to the top line of  the middle panel, total foreign growth is projected to make a smooth landing to its  estimated trend rate of roughly 3¼ percent     This “goldilocks” projection for the foreign economies hinges on our assessment   that inflation will remain contained despite continued high commodity prices and  diminishing slack  As shown on the top left panel of exhibit 12, average inflation in  the industrial economies is projected to move up a bit further in the current quarter  but to then ease as the pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices into  consumer prices is completed  In the emerging economies, government policies tend  to slow the response of domestic energy prices to those set in world markets;  accordingly, inflation for these economies is not projected to peak until later this year,  after which it also moves down      As shown on the right, our projection, based on quotes from futures markets, is   that prices of both West Texas intermediate crude oil and non-energy commodities  will flatten out but stay elevated  Oil prices have increased considerably faster than  our import-weighted aggregate of non-energy commodity prices; but some non- energy prices, especially those of metals such as copper, have indeed moved up  sharply over a short period of time  The quarterly data plotted in the chart obscure  the fact that, most recently, prices of metals and other commodities have moved back  down, in part because of the same concerns about future monetary policies and  growth that have weighed on financial markets  The middle left panel shows spot  prices for copper and zinc; although these have declined sharply, they remain  extremely elevated     Increases in demand have been an important driver of the overall rise in   commodity prices in the past few years  Some observers have taken this rise to be a  signal that the global economy is overheating  Indeed, as shown on the right, world  GDP growth (the red dashed line) has been brisk in the past two years, and this  growth does appear to be correlated with the rate of change of oil and other  commodity prices  Yet rising commodity prices are probably not so much a symptom   June 28-29, 2006 18 of 177    of generalized global overheating as a reflection of rapid industrial development in  Asia, particularly China  As indicated in line 2 of the bottom left panel, China, by  itself, has contributed 1½ percentage points to global economic growth in the past  three years; moreover, of the total increase in world oil consumption (shown in  line 3), increases in Chinese consumption (shown in line 4) accounted for more than  one-quarter  China’s contributions to global output growth appear to have been  supported by corresponding increases in capacity  CPI inflation excluding food, the  solid line in the panel on the right, has remained quite low at around 1 percent  recently  Data on overall industrial capacity are not available, but we do have data  for specific sectors  The red cross-hatched bars in the panel indicate Chinese  steel-making capacity, and the solid bars represent actual production  China’s steel  production has soared to 31 percent of total global output, but by dint of extraordinary  levels of investment, capacity has risen even more     Thus, rising commodity prices likely reflect sectoral bottlenecks in the midst of   rapid Asian development rather than a more-generalized global overheating  The top  left panel of exhibit 13 focuses on resource utilization in the foreign industrial  economies  The solid black line represents the staff estimate of the output gap—that  is, the excess of actual over potential GDP; it suggests that actual output in the  industrial economies is now near but not significantly above potential  The message  that the industrial economies are not overheating is also supported by measures of  capacity utilization rates in manufacturing, expressed as deviations from their  ten-year averages; aside from Japan, capacity utilization rates in the major foreign  industrial economies are close to historical levels     It is not possible to construct reliable measures of potential output and of the   output gap for the developing economies because the requisite data on stocks of labor  and especially capital are not available  Moreover, as these economies are  undergoing rapid structural change, conventional output gap calculations would be  doubly tenuous  Measures of manufacturing capacity utilization are available for  some developing economies, as shown on the right, and they point to declining levels  of resource slack  Whether overall GDP in these economies has moved up beyond  potential, however, is difficult to say  The middle panels present a mixed picture of  recent inflation trends in three of our important trading partners  In the euro area,  twelve-month headline inflation (the solid black line) has edged up in recent months;  however, both core inflation (the dotted red line) and wage growth (the blue dashed  line) have stayed subdued  In Canada, headline, core, and wage inflation have all  been creeping up, although core inflation remains at only 2 percent  In Mexico,  notwithstanding rising global energy prices and accelerating wages, both headline  inflation and core inflation have been trending down  The bottom left panel shows  unit labor costs  Recent cost growth has been coming down from high levels in  Canada and the United Kingdom, has been reasonably contained in France, and  remains negative in Germany  Finally, the right panel indicates that long-term  inflation expectations in the foreign industrial economies excluding Japan—whether  measured by bond market breakeven rates (the black line) or semiannual surveys (the  red line) have remained around 2½ percent or below   June 28-29, 2006 19 of 177    To sum up this lengthy discussion, although there is some risk of more-severe  upward pressures on foreign inflation, the data in hand appear to support the more  benign scenario we have built into our outlook  A second key risk to the outlook  centers on the dollar  As indicated in the top left panel of exhibit 14, the US current  account deficit reached nearly 2 percent of world GDP last year, balanced primarily  by surpluses in Japan, emerging Asia, and especially the oil-exporting countries  As  shown on the right, the US trade balance, while having recovered a bit from its  plunge in the wake of Hurricane Katrina last fall, nevertheless remains on a  deteriorating trend  Market focus on external imbalances likely explains much of the  decline in the broad dollar (the black line in the middle left panel) in April and early  May      However, the market’s attention to global external imbalances appeared to fade by   mid-May, and the dollar has moved up since then  Neither the dollar’s decline nor its  subsequent rebound could be explained by the differential between US bond yields  and foreign bond yields, shown on the right, which has moved little this year The  markets also apparently took no signal from the mid-June announcement of US  balance-of-payments data, shown in the bottom panel  As shown in line 1, the current  account deficit narrowed in the first quarter, reflecting a smaller nominal trade deficit,  reduced transfers abroad, and an improved balance on investment income  As for the  financing of the deficit, private foreign purchases of US securities, line 4, slowed  sharply in April  However, neither the good news about the deficit nor the potentially  bad news about its financing had much of an effect on the dollar     In projecting the future path of the dollar, we have wrestled with the usual tension   between the need for the dollar to fall over the longer term to restore current account  sustainability and the fact that in the shorter term the dollar can do pretty much  whatever it wants  Accordingly, as indicated by the black line in the top left panel of  exhibit 15, in our Greenbook projection the broad real dollar depreciates only about  2 percent annually  However, we are keenly aware that a refocusing of investor  attention on sustainability could lead to a much steeper decline in the dollar  This  exhibit compares our baseline projection of the external sector with a simulation of  the staff’s FRB/Global model in which the dollar declines an additional 15 percent  over the next year and a half; this is the same simulation summarized in the  International Developments section of the Greenbook  As shown on the right, our  baseline projection is for the trade balance to continue to deteriorate for the remainder  of this year but to flatten out a bit next year as oil prices top out and the slowing of  US growth takes effect  Because of J-curve effects, the path of the nominal trade  balance is roughly similar under the alternative simulation, at least during the forecast  period  However, the additional depreciation leads to declines in real imports and  increases in real exports  Accordingly, as shown in the next row, the contribution of  net exports to real GDP growth, which is negative for most of next year in the  baseline, becomes positive under the alternative simulation     A more-rapid depreciation of the dollar would affect prices as well as output  As   shown on the right, in our baseline projection, core import price inflation—which we   June 28-29, 2006 20 of 177    project will rise to 4 percent in the third quarter because of rising commodity prices— decelerates to 1 percent by the end of next year as commodity prices flatten out  The  additional dollar depreciation in the alternative simulation adds 2 to 3 percentage  points to core import inflation over the forecast period  As shown in the next row,  core PCE inflation rises about ¼ percentage point, reflecting both the higher import  prices and brisker economic activity  Accordingly, the Taylor rule in the model leads  the federal funds rate to rise above 6 percent by the end of next year  This squeezes  domestic consumption and investment somewhat and, as a result, real GDP growth in  the alternative simulation rises a bit less than does the contribution of net exports to  GDP  Notably, foreign growth declines a bit less than US growth rises  In sum, we  view a sharp decline in the dollar as unpredictable but entirely possible  Such an  event likely would lead to more US growth but also more inflation and a need for  tighter monetary policy than currently incorporated into the Greenbook forecast        My pleasure  We’re keenly aware of the fact that the United States   economy plays a leading role in the global economy  During the last downturn, at the beginning   of this decade, when the US economy started to slow, our European colleagues often said,   “Well, we’re probably not going to experience a slowdown ourselves because our exports to the   United States, as a fraction of our GDP, are relatively small”  But, in the event, they did slow   down because the United States economy affects the world not only through direct trade links   June 28-29, 2006 27 of 177    but also through indirect trade links  Europe may not trade as much with the United States, but it   certainly trades with other economies that do trade with the United States  Their economies are   also affected through financial channels  Clearly, many financial markets turned down at the   beginning of this decade as they are turning down now, albeit now to a lesser degree  So we’re   keenly aware that a slowdown in the US economy would affect the world economy    Now, we are not building in a very sharp slowdown for the world economy because we   think that the conditions don’t merit that at this time  In the emerging-market economies, the   fundamentals are really quite strong except in certain economies that are under a lot of pressure    In the industrial economies, two of the main areas—the euro area and Japan—had been weak in   the past and are strengthening now  So, as I say, we don’t see a sharp slowdown as the most   likely outcome, although there is a risk of that  At the same time, it’s important to note that we   are building in a moderate slowdown for the total world economy, from about 4 percent in the   second half of 2005 and the first quarter of this year to about 3¼ percent by the end of the   forecast period  It may not sound like a great deal, but when you aggregate the entire world   economy, a percentage point change is more meaningful than it might be for an individual   economy  So we’re very aware of the linkages between the United States and the rest of the   world and feel we have taken those into account      Do you mean would they slow down more than is embedded in our   baseline forecast?      That seems quite likely the case  If the US economy were to slow to a   significantly greater degree than embodied in the baseline forecast, probably many economies,   particularly the Asian economies that depend on us very heavily for their export markets, would   indeed slow down much more than we are anticipating at this time      I will answer the small question  Then Larry can answer the big one    [Laughter]  I agree with you that there is actually a certain disjuncture, if you will, between the fact   that steel prices have stayed up and the growing capacity in China  I don’t have a full answer to   your question, but I would offer just a couple of thoughts  The first is that, unlike a homogeneous   primary commodity, steel comes in many forms, and there are different markets  So the very   substantial increases in Chinese capacity in some products don’t necessarily lead to price declines in   other products that may be particularly important to the United States  The second point to mention,   which is much more obvious, is that iron ore prices actually have gone up very significantly    June 28-29, 2006 30 of 177    According to the data that we’re looking at, basically they are 18 percent higher than they were a   year earlier  What seems to be going on is some tension between increases in ore prices, on the one   hand, and improvements in capacity, on the other hand, which might reduce the margin between the   ore and the final steel products  Perhaps those circumstances will go some way toward explaining   the anomaly      Just to extend Karen’s remarks a bit—as Karen suggested, we have for quite   a while had a certain amount of difficulty identifying a standard Phillips curve relationship between   domestic output gaps and inflation in all foreign economies  We have done research in our division   over the past few years, and we actually have identified various types of relationships between gaps   and inflation in many industrial economies  They tend to differ from economy to economy  In   some, an output gap will matter; in others, a change in an output gap will matter  So there really   isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach toward predicting inflation in the foreign economies, and we don’t   use one  We use different approaches in different economies tailored as to what seems to work   So based on that, in terms of asking what particular concept of capacity underlies the   statements in our briefing on Monday, the answer is that it’s one that does not take a stand on your   particular issue  It depends on the economy  I should say we are, as Karen suggested, very aware   of the work that the BIS has done, which shows extraordinarily important effects of the global   output gap measure on domestic inflation rates  As Karen pointed out, that work has quite a few   conceptual flaws in terms of how one really measures the output gap in economies where that   June 28-29, 2006 36 of 177    concept is so ill-defined  On top of that, some very tenuous preliminary research that we’ve done   seems to indicate that the equations themselves, depending on the time period and the definition of   the left-hand-side dependent variable, are not quite as robust as their authors suggested  So we very   much leave open the possibility that some measure of global capacity may, indeed, be important,   but we are very far from being able to pin that effect down  "
7850,2006-12-12,"  A few months ago, when Karen Johnson asked me to fill in for her   at the December FOMC meeting, I immediately wrote to Santa Claus and asked, as  my present, for some major international event to take place, be it an emerging- market crisis, skyrocketing commodity prices, or a spectacular collapse of the dollar   Such developments are not always welcomed by financial market participants or by  ordinary working people, but they certainly make for interesting conversation   [Laughter]  Well, if you believe what you read in the financial press, Santa granted  me my third wish  As Dino has discussed, since you last met, the dollar is down  about 5 percent against the euro and 4½ percent against sterling  Two weeks ago, The  Economist saw fit to put on its cover a picture of a dollar bill with George  Washington’s jaw dropping      To put these recent developments in perspective, however, the dollar declined   considerably less against the currencies of most of our other major trading partners,  and the broad dollar has fallen only about 2 percent over the intermeeting period   This is still a significant decline for so short a period, but is only half the size of the  drop posted between the March and May FOMC meetings earlier this year  Also, we  have seen nothing to indicate that a major rebalancing of investor portfolios away  from the greenback is imminent  Accordingly, as is our practice, in our forecast we  have adjusted down the starting point for the projected path of the dollar but continue  to project only a modest decline in its real value going forward     Even before the dollar’s recent decline, we were seeing some limited evidence of   improvement in the US external balance  A few weeks after your October meeting,  we received data indicating that the monthly nominal trade deficit had shrunk from a  record $69 billion in August to $64 billion in September  Although this downshift  principally reflected declines in the price of imported oil, the trade deficit had been  boosted by rising oil prices earlier this year, and their subsequent fall and stabilization  at least should diminish one factor widening the deficit going forward  This morning,  October trade data were released; they indicate that the trade deficit shrank a bit  further, to about $59 billion  This deficit was even smaller than we’d anticipated,  with exports a bit stronger and imports a bit weaker      The recent performance of real net exports also appears a little more positive    The September trade data and other recent information point to somewhat weaker-  December 12, 2006 13 of 134         than-expected real import growth in the third quarter and nearly flat real imports in  the current quarter; this flattening is due in part to a sharp decline in the volume of oil  imports as domestic users work off an unusually high level of inventories  With real  exports estimated to have continued expanding solidly, the December Greenbook  shows real net exports in the third and fourth quarters combined adding slightly to  US GDP growth in comparison with the slight drag we wrote down in October  This  morning’s October trade release suggests that we’ll probably revise that contribution  up a little further      Over the next two years, real import growth should pick up as US activity   accelerates and oil imports stabilize  With export growth holding steady, supported  by the ongoing expansion abroad and the declining dollar, real net exports start  deteriorating again and subtract about 01 percentage point from GDP growth in 2007  and 025 percentage point in 2008  This drag is quite small, however, compared with  the nearly 05 percentage point drag exerted by net exports on average from 2000  through 2006  It is also about 01 percentage point smaller than in the October  Greenbook, and we would attribute this principally to the weaker dollar       Consistent with the improved performance of net exports, the weaker dollar has   also led us to project slightly stronger trade and current account balances  The  current account deficit now expands just a touch, from about 6¾ percent of GDP at  present to 7 percent by the end of 2008, whereas the trade deficit remains about flat as  a share of GDP—at around 5½ percent—over the forecast period  Does this  flattening out suggest that sustainability of the US external balance is just around the  corner?  Absolutely not!  [Laughter]  The trade deficit is still projected to widen a bit  in nominal, dollar-value terms  As long as the trade balance remains substantially in  deficit, borrowing to finance that deficit ultimately will lead to growing external debt,  rising payments on that debt, and ever-larger current account deficits  Our projection  has the net international investment position, which was negative 21 percent of GDP  in 2005, sliding to negative 36 percent of GDP by 2008       The slower deterioration of US external balances that we anticipate depends on   continued solid economic growth among our trading partners  Our trade-weighted  aggregate of foreign real GDP growth clocked in at about 4½ percent in the first half  of this year, which likely was a little faster than its trend rate  The data we’ve  received since the October Greenbook reinforce our view that a stepdown is in train,  with growth in China, Mexico, Japan, and the euro area all slowing in the third  quarter from previous unusually elevated rates  We estimate that, all told, the foreign  economy decelerated to a pace of 3¼ percent in the second half of this year, and we  see it staying at this more sustainable rate going forward       Can foreign growth remain this strong, even as US GDP growth is projected to   average less than 2½ percent over the forecast period?  US growth and foreign  growth are highly correlated, reflecting both direct trade links and indirect links  through financial markets and confidence effects  However, growth rates here and  abroad do not move in lockstep  Over the past thirty years, gaps in excess of 2 to   December 12, 2006 14 of 134         3 percentage points have periodically opened up between US and foreign growth; at  about 1 percentage point, the growth differential we are projecting is not unusual  Of  course, were the United States to fall into recession, this would likely be bad news for  our trading partners  Since 1970, five recessions have been dated for the US  economy, and on all those occasions foreign growth slumped as well      As we put together our outlook, we also had to consider whether it would take a   sharper slowdown than we are projecting to prevent widespread inflationary  pressures  We are heartened to see that, as in the United States, the decline in oil  prices since August has led to sharp declines in headline CPI inflation in many of our  trading partners  For example, euro-area twelve-month inflation has fallen through  the ECB’s 2 percent target ceiling to only 18 percent, while Canadian inflation has  fallen to 1 percent       However, inflation abroad should pick up again with projected increases in oil   prices  Moreover, resource utilization abroad has been rising, and it is difficult to  identify much slack in the major foreign economies  To date, measures of core  inflation and wage growth are not signaling significant upward pressures, but  unemployment rates are generally near lows last reached at the end of the 1990s  The  emergence of more-pronounced inflationary pressures, should that occur, would  likely trigger a more substantial further tightening of monetary policy and financial  conditions than we are currently anticipating, leading to a falloff from the steady  foreign growth called for in the Greenbook forecast  This, in turn, could put the US  trade and current account balances on a more negative trajectory than we now expect   That concludes my remarks       There has been some work on that  It looks as though in a couple of foreign   industrial countries that there is some evidence of declines in term premiums  It’s very difficult to   determine why those term premiums have been falling or, more generally, why long-term bond   yields in the foreign countries have been going down recently with those in the United States  Part   of that is likely due to the fact that global financial markets are extremely well integrated; so when   December 12, 2006 22 of 134         US yields move, foreign yields have a tendency to move as well, along with the kind of changes in   exchange rates you might expect  "
8307,2008-08-05,"  For the next couple of weeks, millions of people around the world   will be watching the Olympic games in Beijing  For those of us charged with  forecasting the global economy, of course, China-watching is a year-round task  But   August 5, 2008 18 of 145    notably, the most salient developments since your last meeting have arisen outside of  China  Chief among them, of course, have been the precipitous fluctuations in the  price of oil  When the last FOMC meeting concluded on June 25, the spot price of  WTI crude oil was running at $134 per barrel  It soared to over $145 by mid-July  before plunging to about $119 as of this morning  The $26 per barrel drop over a  three-week period was the largest on record in nominal dollar terms, although in  percent terms, the 18 percent decline we’ve seen has been exceeded on a couple of  occasions in recent years  Notably, many other commodity prices, especially those  for natural gas and many food crops, also declined sharply       It has been heartening, and a welcome change, to see oil prices undershoot rather   than overshoot our previous forecast  But it would be premature to pop open the  champagne  We’ve seen several other steep declines in oil prices in recent years that  gave way to renewed upward surges, and it remains to be seen whether an important  shift in the supply–demand balance has occurred  Saudi Arabia added a total of  400,000 barrels a day to its production of oil in May and June, and there are  indications that its production rose in July, too  However, these increases bring total  OPEC production up only to their level in early 2006, and the world economy has  grown considerably larger since then  Analysts have cited gloomier forecasts of  global economic growth, and thus global oil demand, as contributing to the weaker oil  prices; but those forecasts have been coming down for the past year with little  apparent effect  Although oil consumption in the industrial economies clearly has  slowed over the past year, we have yet to see either a concerted buildup in US oil  inventories or any indications that oil demand among developing countries is slowing   Therefore, a further lurch upward in oil prices is a distinct possibility  Moreover,  with spot and futures prices having first soared and then plunged since your last  meeting, the relatively flat path of oil prices that we are projecting is only about  $12 per barrel lower, on balance, than in the previous forecast  In the meantime,  indicators of foreign growth have come in a bit weaker than we expected, and  inflation readings have been on the high side  These gloomier aspects of the  international outlook counterbalance, to some extent, the improved tone of oil and  other commodity markets       Clearly, prospects appear weakest in the advanced economies  Consistent with   our earlier forecasts of a sharp deceleration in activity, we estimate that growth in all  four of our largest industrial country trading partners—Canada, the euro area, the  United Kingdom, and Japan—came in below 1 percent in the second quarter  In the  United Kingdom, a sharp contraction in the housing sector appears set to drag the  economy into a mild recession in the second half of this year  The remaining major  economies should skirt recession but remain quite weak in the near term amid  slackening export performance, continued stresses in financial markets, tightening  credit standards, and very sharp erosions in business and consumer confidence     Why are the foreign industrial economies slowing about as much as in the United   States, when the subprime crisis originated in this country and the major drag on the  US economy is the slump in a nontradables sector, housing?  Clearly, part of the   August 5, 2008 19 of 145    story involves the international financial linkages that have led foreign markets and  institutions to share in the stresses and losses induced by the US subprime crisis   Another part of the story involves a common shock—the global boom in oil and food  prices—that has cut into real household income and spending around the globe   Third, even as the persistent decline in the dollar since 2002 has buoyed US exports  and growth, this has come at the cost of trade performance and economic activity in  our trading partners  Finally, the foreign industrial countries have enjoyed little or  none of the substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus we’ve seen in the United States  over the past year     We estimate that growth in the emerging market economies also slowed further in   the second quarter, to a pace of roughly 4 percent, where we have it staying for the  remainder of the year  Obviously, this is well above the growth rate of roughly  1 percent that we’ve penciled in for the industrial economies, but it is still below their  likely potential rate as many developing countries struggle with softening export  demand and rising food and energy prices  Notably, however, even after slowing in  the second quarter, estimated Chinese growth powered on at about 10 percent      By 2009, we see both foreign advanced and emerging market economies   accelerating as financial stresses ease, the US economy picks up, and commodity  prices stop restraining the growth of real household incomes  This recovery scenario  depends crucially on our projection that headline inflation starts moving down within  the next quarter or two, so that substantial monetary tightening is not needed  The  recent decline in oil and other commodities prices provides some comfort that this  scenario will materialize  However, we saw some surprisingly sharp increases in  consumer prices in June, bringing 12-month headline inflation to around 4 percent in  the euro area and the United Kingdom, 5¼ percent in Mexico, and 6 percent in Brazil   In most of our major trading partners, inflation excluding energy and food prices has  remained better contained; and in China, headline inflation has actually moved down  from its February peak of 87 percent, registering 71 percent in June  Even so, until  we see several quarters in a row of declines in aggregate measures of inflation, we  will not be out of the woods     So far, the imprint of slowing foreign growth and rising foreign inflation on the   US external sector has been limited but not negligible  Turning first to prices, core  import price inflation has moved up sharply, from about 3 percent last year to  11 percent in the second quarter; this was the fastest quarterly increase since 1987   Most of this acceleration was concentrated in material-intensive goods, such as food  and industrial supplies, and was likely due to rising commodity prices rather than to  more-generalized pricing pressures abroad  However, inflation in imported finished  goods also increased this year  As we noted in a special box in the Greenbook, prices  of imports from China have been moving up briskly as a result of increases in  domestic costs and in the value of the renminbi  This step-up in the so-called China  price explains less than one-fifth of the overall acceleration of core import prices but  about one-third of the run-up in inflation for finished goods imports  Even so,   August 5, 2008 20 of 145    assuming commodity prices stabilize going forward, we expect changes in overall  core import prices to slow quite substantially in coming quarters      So far, US external sector performance has held up well in spite of the slowing   global economy  Net exports added 2¼ percentage points to real GDP growth in the  second quarter, the largest quarterly positive contribution since 1980  Admittedly,  much of this reflected a 6 percent decline in imports, which were dragged down both  by weak US demand and the quirky seasonal pattern in the data on oil imports   Even so, exports expanded at a very healthy 9½ percent, supported both by the  depreciation of the dollar and by continued robust demand for commodities  Going  forward, we anticipate export growth holding up at a still healthy 7 percent or so, as  foreign economic growth picks up right around the time that the boost from previous  dollar depreciation starts wearing off  The contribution of net exports to US GDP  growth should move down, but this will chiefly reflect a recovery in imports as the  US economy picks up  Thank you  David and I will now be happy to address your  questions             Well, the short answer is that we don’t have enough consistent sources of   data to square it  But you certainly point to a factor that many people have talked about—the   rapidly increasing wages, particularly in those industrial areas on the seaboard that are responsible   for most of the manufacturing  It’s hard to square the relatively limited data that we have on those   wages with movements in overall CPI  But there, too, is a limitation—those CPI numbers that are   cited from China are mainly for urban areas, so it’s hard to know how comparable those are with the   others  As you know, there’s also an extremely large food component in the Chinese CPI  So   because basically food is probably less labor-intensive than the types of manufacturing in which   August 5, 2008 22 of 145    most of the workers are working, that’s part of the way to square that  In some sense, the food   prices aren’t reflecting those high wages as much  Then a final wild card is that there are different   views on what’s happening on both the level of profit margins in China and what they’ve been   doing  A lot of anecdotal reports suggest that profit margins are razor thin and that they are being   squeezed  Other analyses, including some of the World Bank’s, suggest that those profit margins   are still pretty ample  So I think you correctly allude to an important phenomenon—the rising   wages because of high demand for workers—but we’re still busy sorting out the data to figure out   exactly how that maps into prices     Sure  As I mentioned, core import price inflation shot up very rapidly to   over 10 percent in the second quarter, and our approach toward modeling and predicting core import   price inflation focuses on three main sources of increase  First are increases in foreign cost   pressures, which we proxy by CPIs, which have not been a particularly important driver of core   import prices as of late, though they are not negligible  Then the other two, which are more   important, are declines in the dollar, which push up our prices, and finally increases in commodity   prices because a lot of our imports, even core imports, which exclude oil and high-tech products,   still have a lot of commodity input into them  For the past few years, our experience has been that   the pass-through of declines in the dollar into core import prices has been relatively moderate  It   has definitely contributed materially to the increase in core import prices but not as much, we feel,   as the run-up in commodity prices, which has had a pretty substantial effect  One way that we can   sort of confirm that impression is that we know that the prices of imported material-intensive   products that have the most commodity input have gone up much more rapidly than prices of   finished goods, and that has been true over the past year as well  So for all of those reasons, we feel   August 5, 2008 26 of 145    that commodity prices have been the prime impetus for the run-up in core import price inflation    Going forward, we take our guidance from the futures markets, which indicate that oil prices and   other commodity prices will flatten out  As a result, we anticipate that, relatively shortly, core   import price inflation also should start to decline  At the same time, our anticipation is that,   compared with the past few years, the dollar will fall less rapidly going forward than in the past, and   that should be another factor supporting our view that core import price inflation should diminish     Right  So, yes, thank you  In the case of core imports, we exclude oil,   which is very important, as well as computers and semiconductors     As you correctly point out, Europe, in particular, does indeed have a lot of   financial stresses; and some parts of Europe, particularly the United Kingdom as well as Ireland and   Spain, are looking at some very serious weaknesses on the housing side  So we are, indeed, kind of   in parallel but not exactly the same as our domestic colleagues building financial stresses into our   August 5, 2008 34 of 145    outlook  We don’t necessarily increase or decrease the amount of financial stress in our forecast in   lockstep with the domestic side  In particular, the European financial situation has probably gotten   a bit worse over the intermeeting period, but some indicators haven’t deteriorated to quite the extent   that they have in the United States  Nonetheless, we have built in a fair amount of financial stress    One factor that’s worth keeping in mind is that we built it into our outlook fairly early on  So we   haven’t adjusted downward the outlook for Europe by that much compared with the last couple of   Greenbooks, but we had already built in quite a bit of weakening of activity, and a lot of that does   reflect both the direct effects of financial stresses as well as their knock-on effects on tightening   credit standards for banks  "
8507,2009-03-17," Following on Dave’s litany of woes about the US economy, I can  offer little comfort from the international arena except to say that we’re not alone in  our troubles Data we’ve received since your last meeting indicate that foreign GDP  declined at a 7¼ percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, much faster than we  estimated in January and the sharpest quarterly decline—by far—since the start of our  series in 1970 Of course, while the phrase “misery loves company” rings true from a  psychological standpoint, it doesn’t work so well in economics  As I’ll discuss later  on in my remarks, US exports plunged in the fourth quarter and were a significant  drag on US growth   The fact that the rest of the world has joined the United States in recession is not  all that surprising  With the United States accounting for about a quarter of global  GDP, and with the world’s major economies tightly linked through trade and finance,  downturns in the US economy historically have coincided with downturns in foreign  growth The big surprise has been which countries have been hit the hardest  The  United States, the United Kingdom, and the euro area, which have been at the  epicenter of the financial crisis, registered fourth-quarter declines in GDP of “merely”  6 to 7 percent Conversely, in many economies whose banking and housing sectors  were less affected by the initial turmoil, output dropped much more sharply  by  10 percent in Mexico, 12 percent in Japan, 13 percent in Brazil, and more than  20 percent in Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand   What accounts for the seemingly outsized response of many economies to the  financial crisis?  Clearly, one factor at work here is that, as is typically the case in  recessions, the demand for manufactures has fallen more sharply than demand for  total goods and services—this has led to unusually sharp falloffs in exports by many  Asian economies  A second factor has been the collapse in commodity prices, which  has weighed heavily on economies in Latin America and the Middle East  Finally,  since the intensification of the global crisis last fall, investors have been pulling out of  many emerging market economies, disrupting the flow of credit to households and  firms   Indicators for the current quarter are pointing to another 7 percent drop in foreign  GDP, with activity declining at a similar pace in both the advanced and emerging  market economies  Industrial production, purchasing managers’ surveys, and  business and consumer sentiment have either continued to fall in the past few months  or are holding at the extraordinarily depressed levels reached late last year  Our  forecast has foreign output declining more gradually in the second quarter before  bottoming out later this year and accelerating to nearly 3 percent by the end of 2010   If our forecast materializes, the foreign economy will have endured four quarters  of contraction, the same as in the 1981–1982 recession, but much longer than the                            March 17–18, 2009 117 of 266  slowdowns of 1974 and 2001 By the time the foreign economy touches bottom late  this year, real GDP will have declined a record 4¼ percent, and we are projecting a  weaker rebound thereafter than occurred following the prior downturns  Accordingly,  although it seems premature to be predicting the recovery when economies are still in  free fall, our outlook does not seem entirely fanciful  It does, however, depend  importantly on a number of factors that remain up in the air, including a stabilization  of financial conditions and the recovery of the US economy   Given the difficult outlook, strong support from the public sector will be critical   Foreign governments will be providing a substantial amount of monetary and fiscal  stimulus over the next few quarters  However, given the pace at which private  demand is contracting and our uncertainties over its prospects, we judge this stimulus  to be just adequate to secure the tepid recovery we are projecting, but insufficient to  insure against any future negative shocks   Starting with monetary policy, Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom already  have cut policy rates to 50 basis points or below  And although the ECB’s target  remains at a lofty 1½ percent, the market rate itself has been trading in the  neighborhood of 85 basis points Accordingly, any significant further monetary  support will have to come from balance-sheet expansions  The Bank of England,  Bank of Japan, and Swiss National Bank have moved forward on such measures in  recent weeks, and we expect them to be followed by other major foreign central  banks, but to what extent and with what ultimate effect on their economies remain  open questions   In the emerging market economies, notwithstanding the pace at which output is  contracting, we expect only moderate further policy loosening  Central banks in Asia  have already eased considerably, and a number of policy rates in the region are now  at 2 percent or below In Latin America, interest rates remain much further above the  zero lower bound, but the falloff in capital inflows, associated sharp currency  depreciations, and continued high inflation will likely restrain further rate cuts   Given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy, the need for fiscal  support is all the more pressing  By our estimates, recently announced fiscal plans  should add about 1 percentage point to foreign growth, both in the advanced and  emerging market economies, in 2009  This represents considerable stimulus, roughly  similar to that projected for the United States this year  But as only the US and  Chinese plans provide significant additional stimulus in 2010, more effort will be  required should the global recession prove more persistent than expected  Moreover,  many countries with high public debt or deficits—such as Greece, Ireland, Hungary,  and Turkey, to name just a few—are constrained from substantial fiscal support and  may even have to cut their budgets   If financial conditions ease enough to allow freer access to international capital  markets, a number of governments may loosen monetary and fiscal policies further   However, rather than stabilizing, there is a distinct risk that financial conditions could                    March 17–18, 2009 118 of 266  take a turn for the worse We are particularly concerned that the fragile situation in  Eastern Europe could deteriorate into a full-fledged banking and balance-of-payments  crisis, jeopardizing the condition of many western European banks and potentially  triggering a global emerging markets meltdown  Such a crisis would not only deepen  contractionary pressures in the world economy, but would prompt many governments  to tighten their monetary and fiscal stance, just when accommodative policies were  most needed   Even without an emerging markets meltdown, the global recession is having a  profound effect on international trade and on the US economy  In the fourth quarter,  US real exports plunged at an annual rate of 25 percent  This, by itself, would have  subtracted more than 3½ percentage points from US GDP growth  Because US  imports plunged as well, net exports subtracted a little under a half percentage point  from GDP growth, but this is still a far cry from the nearly 2 percentage point positive  contribution registered in the first half of 2008  Going forward, we expect both  imports and exports to drop off further this quarter and next as the recession here and  abroad continues, with the contribution of net exports hovering around zero  In the  remainder of the forecast period, however, imports start picking up along with the  US economy, while exports remain moribund  Although we see the economies of   our trading partners recovering a bit faster than the US economy, another outcome   of the global financial crisis—the nearly 20 percent rise in the dollar since last   summer—helps support imports and restrain exports  As a result, we predict net   exports will subtract a half percentage point from US GDP growth during the   remainder of the forecast period, adding yet another headwind to a long and growing   list     From an overall economic standpoint, the situation in Mexico is quite   serious First of all, for the past three or four years, Mexican growth has probably been less than   we might have expected, given its proximity to the United States and our markets and given how   much potential there was for the economy to grow if the right structural reforms were   implemented  In fact, a lot of those reforms have not been implemented  Mexican growth has   been sort of moribund It has depended on the United States as a source of both external demand   and jobs for its people Now that the US economy is going down, the Mexican economy is   suffering pretty badly, as evidenced by the 10 percent annual rate of decline in GDP in the fourth   quarter        March 17–18, 2009 120 of 266  Let me just add that obviously it is facing very serious political problems as well  There   have been a lot of reports in the paper about drug problems and the violence associated with that    So, clearly, on a wide range of issues, Mexico has got problems   Balance of payments and banking sector issues were of course front and center in   Mexico’s crisis of ’94 and ’95, and we would be hesitant to discount that possibility entirely   now, but, interestingly, the banking system in Mexico seems to pose less risk than it might—   certainly less than the banking system in Eastern Europe and probably less than those in other   emerging market economies  First of all, a large share of its banks are foreign-owned, and that   represents some source of stability  On top of that, the banks that are operating there appear to   be less dependent on short-term wholesale sources of financing  So their situation is a little   better Obviously, the situation could take a turn for the worse in the coming year if the decline   in output is sufficiently large that nonperforming loans go up a lot  But for right now, as I say,   while Mexico has got a lot of problems on the balance of payments and on the banking fronts,   the issues don’t seem as pronounced  "
8653,2009-11-03," Since your last meeting, there hasn’t been enough time to  complete the playoffs and the World Series, much less to significantly alter our  outlook for the world economy  We feel more secure that a global recovery is under                   November 3–4, 2009 60 of 201  way, and we’ve notched our forecast of overall foreign GDP growth a bit higher for  the near term Thereafter, however, our outlook is little changed, and we continue to  grapple with some pretty thorny questions about how the recovery abroad will play  out   As Nathan has reported to you in past meetings, the bounceback from recession  has been strongest in those regions that were least implicated in the initial financial  turmoil  We had already judged that economic growth in emerging Asia—which  soared at a 14 percent annual rate in the second quarter—risked being too hot not to  cool Assuaging our concerns somewhat, incoming data suggest that emerging Asian  GDP decelerated in the third quarter, but to a still-strong 9 percent; we have already  received GDP numbers for China, at 98 percent; Singapore, at nearly 15 percent; and  Korea, at 123 percent   In Latin America, as well, a strong recovery appears to be in progress  The  Brazilian economy had already grown nearly 8 percent in the second quarter, and  indications are that a solid expansion has continued on the back of government credit  programs, expansionary fiscal policies, higher commodity prices, and improvements  in financial markets  In Mexico, where GDP had plunged again in the second quarter  as a result of swine flu and auto-industry cutbacks, recent increases in industrial  production and exports—much of them tied to the reviving US market—point to a  sharp rise in activity in the third quarter  All told, we now estimate that Latin  American GDP, after falling 2 percent in the second quarter, rebounded nearly  7 percent in the third   Going forward, we anticipate that overall growth in emerging economies will step  down to a more sustainable 5 percent pace over the next two years  Such solid but  unspectacular expansion is by no means assured  The ongoing rebound may be more  dependent than we’ve assumed on extraordinary fiscal and credit stimulus in China,  which has generated important spillovers via higher imports and commodity prices,  but this stimulus cannot last forever  Additionally, the current surge in production in  China and elsewhere may in part involve inventory restocking predicated on overly  optimistic anticipations of export sales to the advanced economies  But even so, the  fundamental underpinnings of recovery in emerging markets seem fairly strong   Their financial systems are in reasonably good shape; they are regaining access to  international credit markets; and in most cases, they have scope for further stimulus  of domestic demand if conditions warrant   We are, frankly, less confident about the prospects for the advanced foreign  economies  Data for the third quarter have been mixed  In Japan, recent readings on  industrial production, consumption, and trade have been quite positive and suggest  another solid rise in GDP And in the euro area, further increases in purchasing  manager surveys, industrial production, and new orders suggest expansion  However,  GDP in the United Kingdom surprised us by dropping 1½ percent in the third quarter,  despite survey indicators pointing to moderate growth  And Canada’s monthly GDP  series moved down in both July and, as we learned after the Greenbook projection                 November 3–4, 2009 61 of 201  was put to bed, August as well All told, we estimate that GDP in the advanced  foreign economies grew 1½ percent in the third quarter, its first positive reading since  the first quarter of 2008 but a touch below what we’d written down in September   Although we expect the recovery in the advanced foreign economies to quicken in  the current quarter, we continue to struggle with the longer-term outlook  On the one  hand, financial stresses and balance sheet problems point to an unusually slow and  prolonged recovery In both the United Kingdom and the euro area, bank loans have  been declining in recent months While these declines may reflect weak demand for  loans as well as weak supply, the stresses in the banking sector are worrisome,  particularly given the bankcentric nature of intermediation in Europe  On the other  hand, deep recessions historically have given way to sharp recoveries  Moreover,  future economic growth should receive important boosts from the inventory cycle, the  expansion of exports to the United States and emerging markets, and continued policy  stimulus   Balancing these forces for recovery with the headwinds from the financial sector I  described earlier, we continue to project economic growth through the forecast period  of some 2½ to 3½ percent, a pace that only slowly erodes the extent of resource slack   Partly as a result, headline consumer price inflation, which currently is running  negative on a 12-month basis in most foreign advanced economies, picks up only  gradually over the next few years Accordingly, we continue to believe that major  foreign central banks will wait until the second half of next year or early 2011 to start  tightening policy Anticipations of this extended period of low rates and ample  liquidity appear to explain why long-term government bond yields throughout the  advanced economies have remained low since this summer, even as the accelerating  global economic recovery has supported increases in equity prices, declines in credit  spreads, and upticks in a wide range of commodity prices  Notably, WTI oil prices  have risen some $8 per barrel over the intermeeting period, apparently reflecting  optimism about future demand   Unlike the price of oil, the value of the dollar ended up little changed over the  intermeeting period, but it garnered an awful lot of attention on the way  A number  of points are worth noting here First, although the broad dollar index has fallen  11 percent since its recent peak last March, it had risen about 20 percent since the  summer of 2008 and so remains above that previous low  Second, we continue to  believe that much of the prior upswing in the dollar was due to flight-to-safety flows  and dollar shortages in funding markets and that, as Brian Sack suggested earlier this  afternoon, the fall in the dollar since the spring has principally reflected the reversal  of those developments as financial stresses have abated  The contained nature of US  Treasury yields might seem to contradict this narrative of rising appetite for risk, but  as I noted earlier, foreign bond yields have also remained quiescent, likely  anticipating a long period of monetary accommodation  Furthermore, we have seen  little evidence that foreigners, particularly in the official sector, are shifting out of  dollars to a significant extent or that any other sort of disorderly conditions are  materializing       Finally, the decline in the dollar to date will lend important support to US   economic activity  At present, we anticipate that US net exports, having added some   2 percentage points to US GDP growth during the first half of this year, will have a  roughly neutral influence thereafter as the stimulus from a sharp recovery in exports  is about offset by a similar expansion of imports  An alternative simulation included  in the International Developments section of the Greenbook, which shows the effects  of a 10 percent decline in the real broad index of the dollar, provides some sense of  the implications for the outlook had the dollar remained at its March peak  Export  growth would be some 2 to 3 percentage points lower, import growth about the same   amount higher, and US GDP growth as much as 1 percentage point lower by the  second half of next year As well, inflation would be about ½ percentage point lower   Accordingly, the depreciation we’ve seen to date has helped to reflate the economy  while avoiding becoming disorderly  Going forward, we project much more gradual  dollar depreciation, as is our wont, but we will be monitoring exchange markets  carefully for any more-abrupt shifts  Brian Madigan will now continue our  presentation                                                                2 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   November 3–4, 2009 62 of 201 "
8954,2011-01-25,"  As with the US economy, the foreign outlook appears reasonably  bright, but that depends critically on the financial stresses in Europe remaining  contained  As indicated in the top left panel of exhibit 5, in the wake of the rescue  package for Ireland last November, peripheral European sovereign spreads have  remained high and volatile  They moved up toward year-end amid expectations that  Portugal would be forced to seek financial assistance, but came down more recently  following stepped-up ECB purchases of peripheral bonds and several well-received  bond auctions by Portugal, Spain, and Italy  Stresses in dollar and euro funding  markets have remained in check, and, so far, the core European economy appears to  have been little affected by the financial turmoil in the periphery  In Germany, where  real GDP growth likely topped 4 percent last year, the stock market, purchasing  managers’ index, and the Ifo survey of business sentiment continued to move up  forcefully in the fourth quarter   All that said, financial stability in Europe faces a number of challenges over the  next few years  To begin with, as indicated in the middle left panel, the governments  and banks of Spain and Portugal will need to finance the redemption of roughly  €200 billion in maturing bonds both this year and next, as well as ongoing budget  deficits, and this makes them highly vulnerable to shifts in investor sentiment   Second, as indicated in the panel on the right, Greece’s debt burden is most likely  unsustainable, and, unless the European authorities decide to continue bailing it out, a  restructuring of Greek sovereign bonds threatens further disruption to European  markets; this event could come as early as 2012, when Greece is slated to return to   January 25–26, 2011 71 of 282              the market for much of its funding  Finally, if the peripheral European countries are  to continue servicing their debts, their economies must begin to grow  However, as  shown in lower left panel, over the preceding decade, unit labor costs in peripheral  Europe rose unusually rapidly, and this loss of competitiveness poses a clear threat to  their economic growth   At present, the central strategy for containing the turmoil is to protect Portugal  and especially Spain from speculative attack so that contagion does not leapfrog to  Italy, Belgium, and beyond  There is a good chance that Portugal will turn to the EU  and the IMF for a financial rescue package in the near future, while Spain’s stronger  fiscal position, combined with prospects of strong backing from the EU and the IMF,  should keep financial pressures there at bay  However, we judge that credibly  backing the two countries will require resources totaling over €500 billion, whereas  available resources of the EU and the IMF are only on the order of €375 to  €400 billion  So far, European policymakers have been discussing plans to expand  their backstop capacity, and it is critical that they do so before market sentiment takes  a further turn for the worse  The authorities have also scheduled another horizontal  review of European banks for the first half of this year  This review must be more  credible than the one conducted last summer  A more severe adverse scenario must  be assumed, more banks should be identified as requiring additional capital, and the  authorities must be able to muster the resources to help recapitalize banks whose  balance sheets are found wanting   Unlike the governments in the emerging market crises of the past, Europe has  sufficient resources to address its problems, and in the final analysis, we expect that  the authorities will likely do what needs to be done to prevent financial chaos  Based  on this admittedly uncertain assumption, our baseline outlook for the global economy  is reasonably positive, as may be seen in the table at the top of your next exhibit   As in the United States, foreign GDP growth slowed sharply in the middle of last  year as inventory cycles played out, the rebound in global trade slowed to a more  sustainable pace, and policy stimulus faded in some countries  In the emerging  market economies, line 3, economic growth likely bounced back in the fourth quarter,  led by near 10 percent growth in China, line 4  As shown in the middle left panel,  aggregate industrial production in the EMEs has stayed strong in recent months, and  EME exports, the middle panel, have rebounded  As shown on the right, our sense is  that output in the emerging market economies has largely returned to potential,  although such estimates are admittedly uncertain, and should stay in that range as  output growth continues at about its historical trend   By contrast, we see output in the advanced foreign economies—the red line— remaining well below potential, with the gap eroding only slowly  Much of the blame  rests with the euro area, line 8 in the table, where continued financial stresses in the  peripheral economies, as well as strenuous fiscal consolidation throughout the region,  will push economic growth down to a paltry 1¼ percent in 2011 before some  normalization of conditions supports faster growth in 2012   January 25–26, 2011 72 of 282              Given the extent of the resource slack, policy interest rates in the AFEs, the  bottom left panel, are likely to stay on hold for most of this year before being boosted  gradually thereafter  Although headline inflation rates (not shown) have been pushed  up recently by energy prices, core inflation rates are below their pre-recession pace in  the euro area and Japan, and their surge in the United Kingdom principally reflects a  hike in value-added taxes and the steep depreciation of the pound  The low policy  rates do not appear, as yet, to be inspiring much speculative excess, either  For  example, corporate credit spreads remain well above pre-crisis levels in the euro area  and the United Kingdom   Some observers suggest that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced  economies are exerting tangible effects on emerging markets, encouraging capital  inflows that are boosting currencies, exacerbating inflationary pressures, and fueling  speculative excesses  As described in your next exhibit, the real story appears to be  more complicated  First, flows to emerging markets have indeed been strong over the  past year  However, this strength likely reflects a reversal of the capital outflows that  occurred in 2008 and the emerging market economies’ generally brighter growth  prospects, in addition to accommodative policies in the advanced economies   Second, EME currencies have not risen as much as some discussion would  suggest  Much of their recent appreciation, again, merely reverses their plunge after  the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and while some currencies, such as the Brazilian  real, have breached pre-crisis levels, others, such as the Korean won, remain  depressed  In aggregate, the real value of emerging market currencies against the  dollar is just a little higher than at the beginning of 2007  Of course, the run-up in  these currencies would have been higher in the absence of exchange market  intervention, but by how much is difficult to say   Third, we have been scouring the emerging markets for indications of asset price  bubbles, and, with the prominent exception of the run-up in housing prices in China,  Singapore, and Hong Kong, we do not have much to report  The memo on asset  valuations distributed to the Committee last week flagged some richness in Latin  American equity valuations (not shown), but it is not clear they reflect an inordinate  degree of risk-taking as yet  Notably, spreads on dollar-denominated corporate bonds  remain quite elevated in Latin America and are still above pre-crisis lows in emerging  Asia   Finally, inflation rates in EMEs have, indeed, risen above pre-recession levels, as  shown in the bottom left panel, and this has been a source of considerable concern to  policymakers  However, much of the run-up reflects rising commodity prices,  particularly for food, and we see headline inflation rates eventually settling down as  these prices stabilize   Rising oil and commodity prices—shown on the right—could themselves reflect  accommodative policies and low interest rates  However, a surge in speculative  demand for commodities caused by low interest rates would likely be associated with  rising inventories, and, as we discuss in the Tealbook, inventories of commodities   January 25–26, 2011 73 of 282              (not shown) generally have been coming down  Rather, mounting oil and other  commodity prices more likely reflect strong demand from rapidly growing emerging  market economies such as China, as well as declines in the dollar  Based on futures  markets, we are projecting these prices to flatten out going forward as supply catches  up with burgeoning demand  However, given the strengthening outlook for global  growth, we cannot fully preclude the risk of another steep run-up in oil and  commodity prices such as occurred in 2008   Although inflationary and speculative risks may be less pervasive than some have  claimed, EME authorities undoubtedly need to tighten monetary policy further to  ward off economic overheating, and they will seek to do so in a manner that  discourages further increases in capital inflows  They will likely continue to rely on  the same mix of measures, to greater or lesser degrees, that they have used in the past  year or so  measured increases in interest rates (as shown in middle right panel),  allowing limited appreciation of their currencies, and various forms of capital  controls  These policies should keep inflationary and speculative pressures in check,  thereby obviating the need for more strenuous policy tightening later, which could  threaten the economic expansion  However, that remains a discernible risk to the  outlook   Assuming that our baseline forecast of solid, steady growth abroad materializes,  the outlook for US trade, shown in your next exhibit, should be encouraging but  hardly eye-catching  Admittedly, earlier last year we experienced a certain frisson—I  had to look up the pronunciation—of excitement as the growth of imports, the green  line in the top left panel, soared well above that of exports  This led net exports, on  the right, to subtract 2½ percentage points from GDP growth on average over the  second and third quarters, raising concerns that inroads into US spending by foreign  producers could slow the recovery  However, we were reassured by evidence that  rising imports were not so much displacing spending on domestic production as they  were being pulled in by mounting domestic demand  As shown in the middle left  panel, industrial sectors experiencing larger increases in production (the horizontal  axis) also tended to experience larger increases in import penetration (the vertical  axis)   Turning to the right, we are inclined to believe that imports, having been  unusually depressed during the recession, were simply rebounding to the level— represented by the dashed line labeled “model solution”—implied by fundamental  determinants, such as real GDP and the real exchange rate  Exports were rebounding  more slowly, perhaps because exports include many capital goods whose sales have  been restrained by still-depressed levels of investment overseas  In any event, data  for October and November pointed to a pause in imports, and, going forward, we are  projecting less exuberant import growth, even as exports pick up a little more quickly,  buoyed by continued declines in the dollar  In consequence, returning to the top right  panel, after an outsized but transitory contribution to real GDP growth in the fourth  quarter of last year, net exports make very slight positive contributions this year and  next  And the current account deficit, at bottom right, narrows gradually  With the  current account deficit less than half its size in 2006, our representatives at G–20   January 25–26, 2011 74 of 282              meetings will be able to declare confidently that the United States is a full contributor  to the effort to reduce global imbalances  Nellie Liang will continue our discussion     Nellie, can I make a few remarks while you’re looking?     We do believe that the Greek sovereign debt is unsustainable, but a couple   of points are worth making  First of all, there is some chance that the European Union will   decide to bail out Greece completely so that they do not have to default or restructure their debts    I don’t know what the chance of that is, but that is certainly in the probability space  Second, we   don’t place that high a likelihood on a full EU bailout for Greece, and instead we place a much   higher likelihood on Greece’s undergoing some kind of restructuring  It is our working   assumption for our forecast, and it is also our hope, that this process occurs a bit down the road,   when investors will have had a good opportunity to “ring-fence” Greece away from the other   countries  That is, investors understand that Greece’s situation is unsustainable, and when the   January 25–26, 2011 82 of 282              restructuring occurs, they won’t be surprised, they’ll be ready for it  If that, indeed, occurs, then,   not only is our exposure to Greece close to de minimis, but the exposure of the other large   Western European banks to Greece is not so great either  Basically, as long as you can keep the   investor sentiment stabilized, the direct exposures to Greece are probably small and can be   maintained  The problem that we had back in May was that we were in an atmosphere of very   great uncertainty, where nobody had ever seen an industrial economy close to default  In that   atmosphere, expectations ran rampant, and all types of global financial markets were highly   destabilized  It’s our assumption that that will not occur if Greece has a restructuring, let’s say, a   year or two down the road  But, obviously, that’s a hope, not a certainty     Shall I start and you follow?     Well, I think that’s the major element  When this erupted in May, it was   very novel, as I mentioned before  We hadn’t really had the experience of an industrial economy   coming close to default—though, of course, we had had many instances with emerging market   economies—and there were no institutions in play to address the problem  There was   tremendous uncertainty about how far European authorities would go to put money on the table   to backstop these economies  So in that situation of tremendous uncertainty, you had dislocation   throughout global markets  Since then they’ve responded in a number of ways that have given   investors heart   For example, they bailed out Greece in a somewhat ad hoc manner, and then they   followed that up with actual institutions, such as the European Financial Stabilization   Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility, which were established to backstop   further sovereign runs  They were used in the case of Ireland, and in fact, they came to Ireland’s   rescue somewhat more readily than to Greece’s   More recently, recognizing that they still don’t have enough money in the kitty, they’ve   been actively discussing enlarging it  Ideally, that would have gone through this month, but in   fact, it was postponed to a European summit in March  In addition, it’s now recognized that the   January 25–26, 2011 87 of 282              stress tests of banks that were done last summer probably were not severe enough, and they’re   undergoing another round of tests  All of these things together are giving investors some   confidence that the situation is getting dealt with     No, I didn’t     It’s based on a combination of indexes of different types of nonfuel   commodity prices that are published by the IMF, I believe  We take them with the IMF weights   and we reconfigure them to match the weights that are based on United States imports  Once we   have those weights, we re-weight each group, and the groups are beverages, other food, metals,   and agricultural materials  We then get futures curves for some of the different commodities in   each of those groups to create projections of these commodity prices for each group, and then,   using the weights, we come up with the aggregate projection     Well, it’s much more futures-based than it is model-based     Right, exactly     It is exactly based on futures curves, which are highly fallible and yet not   apparently more fallible than humans  [Laughter]     Well, that’s very interesting  I would just mention that, first of all, we are   quite focused and eager to put more resources into looking at the effects from within China, such   as wage pressures, on the prices of the goods we import from them  Second, we have been doing   and will continue to do a great deal of work trying to parse out the relative factors pushing up   commodity prices  We are very attuned to the role of futures market and financial demands in   that regard, and we’ll continue to do work on that  "
9109,2011-09-20,"  It is a cliché of FOMC meetings that the outlook is unusually  uncertain and the risks especially large  But I have conducted an admittedly  unscientific poll of my colleagues, and they have rarely seen the prospects for the  global economy hang so heavily on how political and financial developments over the  next several months unfold  With the crisis in Europe deepening and financial  markets extremely jittery, any number of events, such as a disorderly Greek default,  could trigger a chain reaction of events that would be very difficult to control   Greece faces two critical hurdles in the near future  First, it will likely run out of  cash by mid-October unless it receives a scheduled disbursement from the IMF and  European Union under the loan program agreed to in May of last year  But Greece  has fallen well short of its fiscal targets, and the negotiations to revise the program  and unlock the disbursement have been very difficult  Second, to help Greece meet  its fiscal obligations over the next several years, European leaders agreed at their  July 21 summit to provide a second rescue package to Greece, but this package  requires unanimous ratification by euro-area governments, and political resistance to  it is running high  Moreover, the new package is predicated on private creditors  participating in an exchange to roll over their claims, but interest in this exchange  appears to be falling short of the authorities’ goals   For some time now, we have judged that Greece’s debt was unsustainable and that  some form of default or restructuring of this debt was likely  However, we  anticipated that by the time this transpired, spillovers to the rest of Europe and  beyond would be limited, either because other European countries would have  succeeded in convincing investors they were more creditworthy than Greece, or  because authorities had built financial firewalls sufficiently high to protect Spain,  Italy, and other countries from contagion  Certainly, Europe has failed on the first  count—spreads on Spanish and Italian bonds rose sharply during the summer and  would be higher still had not the ECB started purchasing these bonds last month  On  the second count, the construction of the firewalls is behind schedule  The July 21  agreement would give Europe’s financial rescue fund, the EFSF, greater flexibility to  buy the sovereign bonds of vulnerable countries, lend to countries that do not have an  IMF program, and help recapitalize banks  However, it did not include the  enlargement of the EFSF from its current notional size of €440 billion to the  €1 trillion or more needed to backstop Italy and Spain   For the moment, euro-area leaders appear to be focusing on trying to ratify the  changes to the EFSF agreed to at the July summit rather than addressing the critical  task of expanding the EFSF or providing some other means of support to vulnerable  European governments and financial institutions  Thus, at present, the only  institution with the resources to head off a systemic run on the debt of European  sovereigns is the ECB  However, the ECB has been understandably reluctant to get  ahead of the political process by expanding its current program of sovereign bond  purchases into a more comprehensive backstop; indeed, underscoring deep divisions  within the ECB itself, Executive Board member Jürgen Stark resigned two weeks  ago, reportedly in protest over the ECB’s recent policies   September 20–21, 2011 117 of 290              At this point, you may be wondering how I will justify our Tealbook forecast that  Europe will manage to avoid a major financial meltdown  Our view is that, while  European leaders have been behind the curve at every juncture of this crisis, they  have also reluctantly come to do what was needed to avert catastrophe at every one of  those junctures  Admittedly, this is a close call, but we anticipate that, as market  pressures build further, these authorities eventually will find themselves compelled to  provide the scale of support to their sovereigns, as well as their banks, needed to  prevent a systemic financial breakdown  That said, we recognize that accidents  happen, and the risks here are very worrisome    Although our modal outlook is that a financial meltdown will be avoided, the  combination of continued financial stresses and stringent fiscal consolidation should  restrain the euro-area economy for some time to come  Real GDP growth fell to only  ½ percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, and generally weak readings on  manufacturing, business sentiment, and consumer confidence over the summer point  to only a little improvement in the third quarter  Going forward, we see euro-area  growth continuing to languish near 1 percent over the next year or so before an  eventual easing of financial stresses and pickup in the global economy provide some  uplift     In the advanced foreign economies as a whole, real GDP had stalled in the second  quarter in the wake of the supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquake and  stoppages to Canadian oil production  With these shocks behind us—notably,  Japanese output has recovered rapidly—advanced-economy economic growth likely  bounced back to 2¼ percent in this quarter  However, in light of widespread declines  in stock prices, the problems in Europe, and the markdown to the US forecast,  growth in the advanced foreign economies is expected to dip down over the next few  quarters and average only 2 percent through 2013  This lackluster pace is barely  sufficient to erode a still-substantial amount of resource slack   In the emerging market economies (EMEs), GDP growth had also slowed in the  second quarter and likely bounced up a bit in the third, averaging about 4½ percent all  told  Going forward, we are projecting EME growth to remain at around this rate— which is a little softer than its historical trend—for the next year before it picks up  along with the acceleration of the US and other advanced economies  Data on EME  manufacturing and exports have been a little soft, but indicators of domestic demand  have held up better  A key risk is that the EMEs may not be able to continue relying  on domestic spending for their growth in the face of persistent weakness in the  advanced economies   In response to continued concerns about the outlook for the global economy, oil  and other commodity prices have remained below their peaks reached earlier this  year  In consequence, inflation rates in the advanced foreign economies have  generally moved down sharply in recent months, and continued ample resource slack  should keep price pressures under control for some time  Given the weakness of  inflation pressures and the gloomier outlook for growth, most central banks in these  economies are now expected to withdraw monetary accommodation more gradually,   September 20–21, 2011 118 of 290              and we are anticipating that no major advanced-economy central bank will raise rates  before 2013  Notably, Japan and Switzerland have been struggling to contain the  effective tightening of financial conditions caused by their soaring currencies; Japan  undertook a record intervention of $57 billion to weaken the yen in early August,  while Switzerland arguably went even further, setting a ceiling on the Swiss franc’s  value in terms of euros     In the EMEs, by contrast, inflation continues to run fairly high and output gaps  have largely closed  However, EME inflation is likely to start moving back down as  food prices soften, and prospects are that monetary tightening will slow in this region  as well  Several Asian central banks have already refrained from tightening in recent  months, citing the heightened risk from the global slowdown, and Brazil used the  same rationale to explain a 50 basis point cut in the policy rate in late August   Throughout most of the summer, concerns about Europe and global growth  principally affected the United States through their effects on domestic stock and  credit markets  During the intermeeting period, however, these concerns pushed the  dollar up sharply, and the projected path of the broad real dollar is now some  3 percent higher than in the August Tealbook  Largely in response, we have revised  down US export growth over the forecast period to about 7½ percent, on average,  and the average contribution of net exports to US GDP growth, at about  ¼ percentage point, is also a little weaker  Even so, trade should continue to  represent a relative bright spot for the US economy, thanks to still-solid growth in  the EMEs, the fact that the broad real dollar remains low by historical standards, and  the roughly 3 percent annual depreciation—chiefly against the EMEs—we are  projecting for the next two years  That concludes my remarks  We’ll be happy to  take your questions     Yes  Our simulation involves, for Europe, a very substantial increase, for   example, in corporate credit spreads and a decline in consumer confidence there that reduces   output in Europe some 8 percent below baseline, which is obviously very substantial  For the   United States, we have also built in an increase in credit spreads, although smaller amounts, as   well as some confidence effects, leading to a decline just in the level of GDP below baseline in   the neighborhood of 4 or 5 percent  Now that, I will say, is probably the biggest negative effect   we have ever built into an internationally based simulation in the Tealbook  But we can go   further  [Laughter]     Well, we have certainly spent a lot of time thinking about that issue,   particularly for China and Brazil, which are larger trading partners with us and figure more   prominently in my thinking, though we do follow Turkey as well   In China, for some time, there have been a number of property-market-related risks, both   in terms of prices having risen very high and in terms of there being very substantial lending,   which puts at risk not only some borrowers, but also lenders  In particular, a lot of state and   local governments in China have been using off-balance sheet vehicles to try to channel funds to   developers and others  It’s sometimes like a substitute for fiscal policy for them  So that   represents a concern  However, it is true that over the past half-year or so, property prices in   China, based on our perhaps imperfect measurements, seem to have tailed off a bit and maybe   even declined  And of course, the Chinese government and the PBOC are taking a lot of steps to   try to rein in the lending  It’s certainly something that’s very much on our radar screens, and   we’re very aware it  But we don’t see the overheating problem getting worse, at least as far as   the property market in China is concerned   We’ve also been following Brazil carefully for very much the same reason  There have   been very many anecdotal reports of a bubbling property market in the country  Unfortunately,   we don’t have as good data on housing prices there, but there’s no reason to disbelieve the   anecdotes  And part of the problem is that Brazil ramped up credit growth a great deal during   the financial crisis and hasn’t really reversed that now  So we’re watching that carefully  Thus   far, we haven’t seen evidence of a bust of that sort, and we have seen the GDP growth and the   September 20–21, 2011 121 of 290              economy slowing  We’re looking forward to that tailing off again without a meltdown  But it’s   something we’re following     Well, I will say a couple of words, and then maybe my domestic   colleagues can add on  In some respects, the flight to safety could be a double-edged sword in   the sense that on the one hand, most negatively for the United States, it would probably   appreciate the dollar very substantially, and we’ve already seen a little bit of that happening    And that would be adverse for our net exports and represent a contractionary force through that   channel  As well, the flight to quality would probably raise credit spreads for riskier borrowers   in the States, and that would be adverse  On the other hand, of course, Treasury yields would fall   more, but it’s not clear how much more they would have to fall, so that plus would be mitigated    And then finally, there’s an issue that we’re already running into with the movement of money   September 20–21, 2011 122 of 290              market funds into banks, which is that the banks themselves are hitting their capital concerns  So   I’ll stop there     If I could just add to that, I completely agree with everything you’ve said,   including the fact that right now European leaders are focusing almost exclusively on getting the   current changes to the EFSF passed  A couple of weeks ago, I had your idea in mind, and I   hoped it were true, but every single European, including many ECB officials that I’ve talked to,   has provided me with not the tiniest hint that they have in mind this expansion of the EFSF’s   capabilities and they’re just keeping it secret  I just haven’t gotten any information that would   suggest that view  "
9134,2011-11-01,"  I will not be referring to charts  Last week, even as millions of  children were eagerly anticipating Halloween, Christmas came early for equity  investors  Santa left them a package of new measures to address Europe’s fiscal  crisis, beautifully wrapped in shiny paper bearing the seals of the 17 euro-area  nations  Once the package was unwrapped, however, it turned out that a lot of  additional assembly was required, many parts were missing, and no one was sure  whether, once the whole thing was put together and plugged in, it would work at all   In fact, this week’s market movements suggest people are becoming more convinced  that it won’t   The announced package contained three main elements  First, in order to bring  down Greece’s debt burden to sustainable levels, representatives of private creditors  have agreed in principle to participate in a debt exchange that would reduce the face   November 1–2, 2011 120 of 282              value of their claims by 50 percent, a much larger haircut than the 20 percent agreed  to in July  This would open the door for a new loan package for Greece, to be  provided by European countries and the IMF, which would provide critically needed  financing until 2014   Second, having failed to assuage market concerns about European banks in July,  when the authorities released a stress test requiring almost no increases in capital,  European leaders have now agreed to more stringent standards  These include a  demonstrably higher minimum capital-to-asset ratio and a marking-to-market of bank  holdings of sovereign debt  Preliminary reports suggest banks will be asked to raise a  little over €100 billion in additional capital, with banks failing to raise these funds by  June of next year being forcibly recapitalized by national governments   Finally, European leaders announced two complementary approaches to what is  arguably their most urgent task, providing financial backstops to vulnerable European  governments—especially Italy and Spain—to protect them from market contagion   One scheme involves the European rescue facility, the EFSF, providing the resources  to guarantee a fraction—perhaps 20 to 25 percent—of the value of new government  bonds  In the other scheme, the resources of the EFSF would be used to take a first- loss position in a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, that would seek financing from  investors—including sovereign wealth funds from China and the Middle East—and  channel it to borrowing governments  In either case, the intent of European leaders,  having rejected both an enlargement of the EFSF and direct use of the ECB as a  lender of last resort to governments, is to leverage less than €300 billion in the  EFSF’s uncommitted resources into over €1 trillion in new lending capacity   As Brian discussed earlier, that the European leaders were able to agree at all on  these measures came as a pleasant surprise to many observers, as it provided hope  that the leaders were taking their predicament more seriously  However, the next  several months present a series of risk events as European authorities attempt to  implement their proposals  The first such event unexpectedly materialized last night,  when the Greek prime minister announced a parliamentary confidence vote in his  government and popular referendum on the loan package, putting the plan in jeopardy  and causing European markets to plunge this morning  Looking a bit further down  the road, the haircut on Greek debt is intended to be achieved through a voluntary  bond exchange, partly in order to avoid triggering credit default contracts, but it is  questionable whether the deal will attract sufficient participation  By the same token,  many details of the financial backstop plans remain to be worked out, and the  participation of sovereign wealth funds from China and the Middle East seems mainly  wishful thinking at this point   A second and more worrisome concern is that, even if the plan announced last  week is fully implemented, it may well fail to quell market pressures  Even under the  European authorities’ optimistic scenario, Greece’s net debt remains above  120 percent of GDP for the rest of this decade, and servicing that debt burden will  require continued draconian fiscal austerity measures  Thus, Greece may well fail,  again, to meet its performance goals and threaten renewed default  Were such an   November 1–2, 2011 121 of 282              event to trigger renewed flight from risk, it is doubtful that the new financial  backstops announced last week would suffice to protect Italy or Spain  These  arrangements might guarantee only a quarter to a third of the value of new bonds  issued by vulnerable governments, and in the midst of a financial panic, that may be  entirely inadequate to attract investors   Accordingly, with observers well aware of these concerns, the most likely  scenario is that markets will remain jittery and funding restricted for some time to  come  This distasteful outlook is reinforced by the fact that, in response to financial  strains and the additional budget cutting that those strains have engendered, the euro  area’s economy has weakened even further in recent months  Banks have tightened  lending standards, measures of manufacturing activity have deteriorated, and business  and consumer confidence have slid sharply  We now expect euro-area GDP to  contract slightly this quarter and next—a markdown of 1 percentage point from our  September forecast—before edging up to a still-tepid 1½ percent pace by 2013  This  miserable performance should keep unemployment firmly above 10 percent and, by  making it even more difficult for economies to meet their fiscal targets, continue to  keep markets on edge   Outside of Europe, the economic picture is brighter but by no means exuberant   Aggregate foreign GDP growth rose from only 2¼ percent in the second quarter to an  estimated 3½ percent in the third, but that acceleration owed exclusively to Japan’s  recovery from its March earthquake and the associated restoration of global supply  chains  Recent data have been mixed  Japan’s economy has bounced back more  quickly than we had anticipated; Chinese GDP grew 9½ percent in the third quarter,  well above expectations; and the Canadian economy also expanded briskly   However, third-quarter GDP growth appears to have moved down in some other  countries—notably Korea and Brazil—and the scant data for the current quarter are  fairly subdued   All told, we now estimate that aggregate foreign GDP growth will fall back to  2¾ percent in the current quarter, reflecting the contraction in euro-area GDP, the  effects of this contraction on the export sectors of other countries, and the completion  of the bounceback of global production from the Japanese earthquake  Going  forward, projected foreign growth edges back up to nearly 3½ percent by 2013 as  Europe’s economy regains its footing and US activity accelerates     With the global economic outlook remaining relatively subdued, non-fuel  commodity prices declined further since your last meeting  By contrast, crude oil  prices in the spot market moved up a bit, but this was mainly in response to tighter  inventories, and oil prices remain below their earlier peaks  Thus, even as 12-month  headline inflation rates moved up in September to 3 percent in the euro area and over  5 percent in the United Kingdom, quarter-to-quarter rates of inflation in these and  other advanced economies continued to move down from their highs at the beginning  of the year  In the EMEs, a similar downtrend in inflation was interrupted in the third  quarter by rising food prices in some countries, but this uptick should prove  transitory, and we expect further disinflation in the region going forward    November 1–2, 2011 122 of 282              Amid diminishing inflation pressures and economic growth that is too slow to  significantly erode resource slack, several major central banks announced further  stimulus measures during the intermeeting period  The Bank of England expanded its  asset purchase program by £75 billion (or 5 percent of GDP), while the Bank of Japan  expanded its program by ¥5 trillion (or 1 percent of GDP)  The ECB held its policy  rate constant at 1½ percent but announced additional purchases of covered bonds and  brought back auctions of one-year money  In the EMEs, the pace of monetary  tightening has clearly diminished in the face of concerns about weak global growth— notably, Brazil lowered its policy rate by another 50 basis points over the  intermeeting period, even as 12-month inflation breached 7 percent     Against the background of weak foreign economic growth, exports grew at only a  4 percent pace during the second and third quarters  Import growth has been running  even slower, however, so net exports made a small positive contribution to US GDP  growth of about a quarter of a percentage point  During the next two years, we expect  export growth to step up to an average of nearly 7 percent, in part as foreign growth  firms; the dollar also supports export growth, as even after rising a bit over the  summer, it remains well below its values in recent years  In consequence, the  contribution of net exports to US GDP growth rises slightly next year, but this  contribution dwindles in 2013 as the pickup in the US economy leads to faster  imports   Deborah will now continue our presentation     Oh, right  What I thought I said—but I might have erred in my reading—  was that they are required to raise it one way or another      Their first option will be to go to the private markets     Thank you—that’s correct  In their statements and in their discussion,   they are very eager that that target not be achieved through deleveraging     Exactly  That is, indeed, a loose instruction  And so they’re trying not to   have that be the case  They have talked about restricting dividends and things like that in order   to achieve that, but thank you for that clarification     I’ll just start by saying that’s an excellent point, and it’s something that   people have raised as an issue  It is interesting that those same concerns came up after the July   agreement by Europeans to impose a haircut of only 20 percent on private creditors  And in the   event, that concern seems to have been shrugged off, but it’s come up again with this much   larger haircut  One could imagine a situation after this, especially if it goes through, where   indeed the role of CDSs could diminish  "
9161,2011-11-28,"1  As Brian has discussed, the attempt by European leaders in late  October to promote a comprehensive solution to the euro-area financial crisis has  largely failed, and the crisis is deepening and threatening to spill over from the  European periphery to the core  In Greece, the government collapsed two weeks ago  and was replaced by a temporary caretaker government headed by former ECB Vice  President Lucas Papademos  Greece’s main opposition party has generally signed on  to the fiscal reforms Greece has agreed to with the IMF and EU, but in order to repay  its creditors and finance its deficit over the coming couple of years, Greece is  negotiating a new €130 billion program with the IMF and EU, and this new loan is  contingent on Greece’s private-sector creditors voluntarily writing down the face  value of their claims on Greece’s government by 50 percent  However, the  discussions between the Greek government and its private-sector creditors on this  debt restructuring have been fractious, putting the new loan package in jeopardy and  adding to speculation that Greece may soon default and possibly withdraw from the  euro area   If the European leaders had succeeded in putting the financial backstops in place  to protect Italy, Spain, and other governments from contagion, the Greek situation  would be just a sideshow with limited potential to destabilize broader markets   However, efforts to strengthen the euro-area financial backstop have been stymied   The October plan was to leverage the remaining €270 billion in uncommitted  resources of the EFSF with private-sector funds to achieve over €1 trillion in                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   November 28, 2011 8 of 40              capacity  But with outside investors showing little enthusiasm for this scheme and  the EFSF itself having difficulty raising funds, it appears unlikely that the EFSF, by  itself, would be able to protect Italy and Spain from a major run on their debt   In the absence of a credible backstop, investor concerns about sovereign default  have begun to snowball, as Brian has described  In Italy, soaring borrowing costs,  along with weakening economic conditions and calls for more budget cutting, led to  the fall of the Berlusconi government and his replacement by former EU  commissioner Mario Monti  Although this change may bode well for future  economic reforms, the political transition has been chaotic and has further roiled  financial markets  Indeed, investors remain uncertain as to whether Italy’s new  government of unelected technocrats will be able to muster the political support  needed to push through unpopular fiscal austerity measures   And now, alarmingly, market pressures are spreading to core euro-area  economies, with France’s and Belgium’s borrowing costs rising, Belgium’s credit  rating being downgraded by S&P, and, as Brian mentioned, even Germany having a  poor bond auction last week  Calls are mounting for the ECB to stem the panic by  taking a more active role in funding vulnerable governments, possibly by channeling  funds either through the IMF or the EFSF  An alternative approach, involving greater  fiscal centralization and the issuance of Eurobonds guaranteed by the euro area as a  whole, is also mustering support, including most recently by the European  Commission  However, Germany and the ECB so far have continued to resist these  options, increasing investor concerns that the financial crisis could deepen while  European officials watch either helplessly or passively from the sidelines  Moreover,  the recently announced plans for the recapitalization of Europe’s banks are believed  likely to promote deleveraging and contribute to a credit crunch that will further  weigh on Europe’s economy   Turning to the economic outlook, our October forecast for only slight declines in  euro-area GDP this quarter and next now seems optimistic  Retail sales, industrial  production, and new orders fell sharply in September; October surveys show  continued declines in business and consumer confidence; and the euro-area composite  PMI in October and November has fallen well into contractionary territory  Given  the escalating financial stresses, the troubled banking sectors, and ever-increasing  calls for fiscal consolidation, we are currently anticipating that the recession in  Europe will be more severe and prolonged   These conditions present a significant risk to US financial systems and to the  US economic recovery  With this in mind, the FOMC might want to consider  changes to its liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks aimed at easing funding  stresses and bolstering investor confidence  Accordingly, as detailed in the proposed  resolution circulated earlier this morning, we are seeking your approval of a  six-month extension of the existing dollar swap lines through February 1, 2013, along  with the establishment of additional swap arrangements with our central bank  counterparties to support the provision by the Federal Reserve of liquidity in  Canadian dollars, British pounds, Japanese yen, euros, and Swiss francs  These   November 28, 2011 9 of 40              foreign currency swap lines are not needed today, but they would be established as  part of a broad network of bilateral swap lines intended to address potential future  funding needs and to support market confidence by demonstrating cooperation among  the major central banks  Before the initial drawing on these new swap lines, the  Foreign Currency Subcommittee would consult with the Federal Open Market  Committee if possible under the circumstances then prevailing  These new  arrangements would also expire in February 2013   Both for the dollar swap lines and for the new lines providing other currencies, we  propose that the Chairman establish the interest rates by agreement with the foreign  central banks and in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee  He  would keep the Federal Open Market Committee informed, and the rates agreed  would be consistent with the principles discussed with the Committee  In this regard,  we have reached tentative agreement with our foreign counterparties on a reduction in  the cost of borrowing through the existing dollar swap lines of 50 basis points—from  100 basis points over OIS to 50 basis points over OIS  The reduction in borrowing  costs should help reduce banks’ aversion to using the swap facilities, thus  strengthening their liquidity positions and reducing the pace of their deleveraging and  associated impacts on credit conditions  These actions, if approved, will be described  in a coordinated announcement by the Federal Reserve and our five central bank  counterparties—the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National  Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Canada  That announcement is likely to be  made Wednesday morning  That concludes my remarks     Yes  On question number two, I do not believe we know that much that’s   not in the press, but perhaps the Chairman can add to that  On the issue of solvency, a couple of   things  First, clearly, the G-7 is engaged on this, and they have had talks recently  But   November 28, 2011 10 of 40              ultimately the role of the non-European members of the G-7 is really going to be to advise and   perhaps pressure the European leaders on steps that need to be taken  They are addressing both   the liquidity and the solvency issues, and those do need to be addressed jointly  The liquidity   issue is quite obvious, which is that the possibility of a self-fulfilling prophecy of an investor run   leading to default looms very large, and so you do need some backstops  At the same time,   particularly the European leaders are keenly aware that there are solvency issues involved  They   are very reluctant to put liquidity rescue measures in place if they cannot be assured that Italy,   Spain, and other peripheral countries will put in place the fiscal reforms needed to guarantee   solvency and sustainability  In that regard, the most obvious option now on the table is basically   that any rescue measures be done in conjunction with an IMF program to enforce the   conditionality needed to provide comfort to the European leaders     On that issue, a couple of points are worth making  First of all, in our   bilateral agreement with the ECB, basically, they would be beholden, as per the contract, to   return dollars to us in any event, even if the collateral that we were holding—the euros—no   longer had the standing that they did beforehand  So, first, from a legal perspective, we are still   owed the dollars  Second, presumably, the euro would still be exchangeable for the currencies   that would succeed the euro if it came to that  So, in that instance, too, there will be value  And   finally—and I think this is important—right now, we’ve got two different tenors of swaps, the   one week and the three month  Certainly, the one-week swaps are short enough so that we could   foresee an event and not lend any of those  Even the three-month swaps seem to have a   sufficiently short time frame that if it looked as though the demise of the euro area were   imminent, we could basically not participate in those swaps  So I think we have a reasonable   amount of comfort on all of those fronts that the demise of the euro area, while no longer as   unthinkable as it once was, probably does not pose a threat to the safety of these swaps  "
9177,2011-12-13,"  In a classic sequence from the comic strip “Peanuts,” Lucy urges  Charlie Brown to run and kick the football, promising that this time, she won’t pull it  away at the last second  As we wrote down the Tealbook forecast of the global  economy last week, we were faced with our own Charlie Brown moment  Would  European leaders finally deliver on their promise to alleviate the region’s fiscal and  financial strains or would their efforts once again fall short, dooming the markets so  eagerly running up in advance of last Friday’s summit to another unseemly pratfall?   With the experience of the failed summit programs of July and October still fresh in  our minds, we assumed that the Friday summit announcement would indeed fall  short  We were not disappointed   December 13, 2011 13 of 198              In order to restore investor confidence, any agreement by European leaders would  have to achieve two objectives  First, it must convince investors that vulnerable  European governments will eventually achieve fiscal sustainability  Second, it must  ensure that these governments can finance themselves until that sustainability is  achieved  Regarding this second point, investors were hoping that the summit  agreement would provide the ECB with credible assurance that it could step up its  support for vulnerable governments without removing the incentive for those  governments to follow through on their fiscal commitments   To be sure, the plan announced last Friday takes some important steps forward   First, it introduces stronger mechanisms to discipline the fiscal performance of  participating European countries in the longer term, including imposing a ceiling on  their structural budget deficits of only ½ percent of GDP  Second, the plan includes a  number of measures to bolster the nearer-term financing of vulnerable European  governments  It proposes that European countries lend €200 billion to the IMF,  which could help finance an IMF loan to Italy, Spain, or other European  governments  And it moves up the creation of the permanent European rescue  facility, the ESM, to mid-2012  Pending an additional agreement by European  leaders, this would allow its €500 billion in lending capacity to augment the roughly  €270 billion remaining in the temporary facility, the EFSF  Third and finally, it  removes the requirement in the ESM that future rescue lending to governments be  accompanied by a restructuring or rolling over of their liabilities to private creditors   This measure seeks to reassure investors that Greece’s restructuring will be the  exception, not the rule   Although markets moved up on the Friday announcement of the plan, they gave  up those gains yesterday, and the plan is unlikely to fully restore investor confidence  in the near term  To begin with, nearly all the details regarding timing and  implementation of the so-called fiscal compact remain up in the air, and with  participating governments having until March 2012 to sign the agreement, we can  expect continued market volatility as prospects for the deal wax and wane   Furthermore, the financing measures in the plan fall well short of the unconditional  guarantee of sovereign funding needs that the markets appear to be seeking  The  €500 billion that the ESM could bring to the table would not materialize until the  middle of next year  And the €200 billion loan to the IMF is only one of many steps  needed for the IMF to support an embattled European government  That government  has to swallow its pride and request an IMF program; the IMF has to approve the  program; and then the government has to fulfill the fiscal conditions of the program  for a sustained period  Finally, it is very uncertain whether the ECB will derive  sufficient comfort from the fiscal compact to step up its provision of sovereign  financing—ECB President Mario Draghi has voiced support for the agreement but  has also downplayed the likelihood of aggressive ECB action in support of  sovereigns   In consequence, our best guess is that financial conditions will remain highly  strained, and quite likely deteriorate further, in the coming months  Such  deterioration would raise the risk of catastrophic events such as the default of a major   December 13, 2011 14 of 198              European economy or failure of a large bank  In the face of such a challenge, we  believe the ECB would ultimately be moved—in conjunction with IMF lending—to  provide much stronger assurances of financing to vulnerable European governments   But even so, it will probably take well into next year for investor confidence to be  regained and for financial stresses to ease   Accordingly, we are now predicting a much longer and deeper recession for the  euro area than we did back in October  Euro-area GDP barely edged up in the third  quarter, and since then, PMIs have fallen further into contractionary territory,  consumer and business confidence have continued to slide, and the unemployment  rate has risen to 103 percent, its highest level in more than 10 years  In our forecast,  euro-area output drops about 1½ percent over the current and next four quarters,  similar in its depth and length to the recession accompanying the ERM crisis of the  early 1990s  This is followed by an exceptionally anemic recovery in 2013, because  even as the financial situation improves, vigorous fiscal consolidation subtracts nearly  2 percentage points from growth in that year   Fortunately, the outlook for most other foreign economies is less bleak  To be  sure, even excluding the euro area, foreign real GDP growth is estimated to have  slowed in the current quarter, to about 3 percent from 4¼ percent in the third  Some  of this slowing reflects knock-on effects of the European crisis, and indeed, export  growth and manufacturing activity in many emerging market economies has  weakened  But much of the current slowing also reflects developments that are less  worrisome, transitory, or both  The deceleration of Chinese real GDP from  9½ percent growth in the third quarter to 8¼ percent in the fourth puts it on a more  sustainable trajectory; Japanese GDP popped up 5½ percent in the third quarter as it  recovered from its earthquake, but is on track to slow to 2 percent as that bounce  fades; and severe flooding is estimated to have temporarily pushed down Thailand’s  GDP a whopping 14 percent at an annual rate this quarter while also disrupting  supply chains for its trading partners   Going forward, the economic growth of our trading partners outside the euro area  is expected to strengthen to a solid 3½ percent by 2013 as the European crisis  eventually eases  Counting in the euro area as well, however, aggregate foreign GDP  growth falls from 3 percent in 2011 to only 2½ percent next year before rising back to  3 percent in 2013  This trajectory is nearly ½ percentage point below our October  projection and, along with our revised forecast for the dollar, weighs heavily on the  outlook for the US external sector   As Brian discussed earlier, flight-to-safety flows pushed up the dollar during the  intermeeting period, and we expect further upward pressure as financial turbulence  continues  Accordingly, we have revised up the path of the broad real dollar by more  than 2 percent on average during the forecast period  In combination with our  markdown of foreign GDP growth, this pushes our forecast for US exports over the  next two years from 6¾ percent in the October Tealbook to only 5¼ percent in our  current forecast, a substantial revision  As a result, the contribution of net exports to  US GDP growth during the next two years falls close to zero in the current forecast   December 13, 2011 15 of 198              from positive ¼ percentage point in October  And this markdown would be even  larger, had we not lowered the forecast of US import growth in light of the  downward revisions to US economic activity  David will now continue our  presentation     Are you talking about the uncertainty about what the dollar is going to do   or the uncertainty in terms of the mapping from the change in the dollar?     Yes  We have different models, but looking at our partial equilibrium   model of trade, we estimate models that link US exports to foreign activity and the real   exchange rate  Those models have performed relatively well in the past, but the standard error,   we will have to admit, is reasonably large  It is also reasonably large in the neighborhood of   large turning points in the economy  That is most relevant right now to the elasticity of our   December 13, 2011 25 of 198              exports with respect to foreign output, but it is probably also present in terms of the   responsiveness to the dollar  Now, to amplify on that slightly, in the development of our export   forecast, we decided that the standard elasticity of our exports with respect to foreign GDP   basically ends up being in the neighborhood of 1 percent, although it might be a little bit larger   than that because we observe that around deep recessions in the global economy trade usually   falls by even more than the long-run elasticity  We have a little bit of that built in, but not too   much  All told, yes, the uncertainty is fairly large     You mean bigger than the contribution of net exports?     Possibly in that neighborhood, I would have to look into that  But in   terms of our point estimate for exports, our export growth is going to be 5 to 6 percent  The   uncertainty is not going to be larger than that     No, I certainly don’t profess any uncertainty about the direction     We are certainly monitoring that situation pretty closely, and I have to say   that there are some different factors in play in terms of our thinking about the outlook for   Chinese GDP growth  First, just to get this clear, we have long predicted the so-called soft   landing for the Chinese economy, right?  And we have frequently been surprised on the upside as   GDP growth continues to be greater than we were penciling in  It’s against that background that   I think we have to look at future developments   The evidence on credit creation is a little bit on the mixed side in the sense that if you just   look at the standard measures of bank loan growth to China, they have certainly softened a bit   from the previous year, but they are still running at around 15 to 16 percent, which is a healthy   pace  At the same time, there are some broader measures of loan growth that include some of the   off-balance-sheet types of items, and that seems to have slowed down a little more  That seems   to be consistent with the story that, earlier on, Chinese authorities clamped down on this loan   growth, and they also introduced macroprudential measures like lower loan-to-value ratios that   also clamped down  We are seeing some evidence of that, in that the property market in China   seems to have been taken off the boil a bit  The property prices have flattened out in recent   December 13, 2011 27 of 198              months  There are some mixed signals, but all told, it does look like there is some slowing in the   property market   Most recently over the intermeeting period, the Chinese authorities lowered their reserve   requirement a notch, so that is like indicating that maybe they think that the tightening cycle has   gone far enough  Putting all of those things together, we are looking at some slowdown in   Chinese growth to a more sustainable 8¼ percent pace  Personally, I wouldn’t be surprised if   China surprised us again on the upside  That said, the combination of those slowing credit   aggregates, plus the decline in manufacturing PMIs and the other evidence you point to, does   support the view that growth is sliding     First of all, we almost never end up correctly calling that event  I think it   would be premature at this point to develop much certainty about that very adverse scenario,   aside from the fact that all we have seen so far is some flattening of prices in recent months    Property prices in China, as measured by the 70-city survey, are still 4 percent above their year-  earlier level  It is also true that the market in China is a little bit different than in the United   States, in the sense that a lot less of the residential market is financed by heavy leverage or loans   and a lot more of it by cash  Furthermore, in the context of a very rapidly growing economy, a   little excess capacity is less worrisome than it is in a more slowly growing economy  Right now,   we are not calling for a property crash that could lead to more adverse consequences  But that is   certainly an important risk to the outlook in China, and if it weren’t for the Europe situation, that   could be getting close to the top of the list     Yes, exactly  It was 8 percent in the first quarter and 7 percent in the   second     The foreign GDP forecast that we make is based on using the real foreign   GDP aggregate values for each of the economies of our trading partners  That is not converted to   dollars, that is just real euros, real Canadian dollars, et cetera  For every one of our trading   December 13, 2011 30 of 198              partners, we have a projection of what their real GDP is and their real GDP growth  Then, we   take those growth rates, and we basically aggregate them up, weighting by their shares in US   trade  In that way, that calculation is purely separate from any consideration of exchange rates,   except insofar as the trade weights that we use are based on the current dollar value of our trade   with them  We have a more or less exchange-rate-free measure of foreign GDP growth, and that   has a particular effect on our projection for US exports  Then, separately, we have a measure in   our models for the value of the US dollar converted into real terms using our and their CPIs,   and that represents basically the trade competitiveness channel  We have both of those measures   in our model  "
