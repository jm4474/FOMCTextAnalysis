9259,2011-08-01,FOLEY,"  Yes  Mr Chairman, I’ll start by noting that the on-site teams and  the liquidity risk specialists are in continuous discussions with the firms  But, as  Brian mentioned, last week it was apparent that there was increasing stress in short- term funding markets, and that resulted in increasing intensity and frequency of  discussions with the firms  That culminated in discussions with the CFOs of a  number of the domestic firms late last week   I think the primary message we heard back from the firms was that they’re all  seeing significant inflows of deposits  As Brian mentioned, that’s related to money  market mutual funds either moving out of Treasuries or holding additional cash as  contingency, but other clients are doing the same as well  The firms view this as a  temporary development; they anticipate similar rapid outflows once the situation is  resolved  So from that standpoint, they view the situation as manageable  But at least  one firm indicated that as the situation continues on or if there is a payment default,  there’s potential for rapid acceleration of deposit inflows, and that could cause a  number of issues, one of which Brian alluded to   To be more specific, I think the effects have been more apparent at the clearing  banks—JPMorgan Chase, Bank of New York Mellon, and State Street  Again, that’s  been driven primarily by money market funds moving out of Treasuries into cash   They’ve seen some of that same behavior from foreign governments and corporates   August 1, 2011 15 of 53              as well  The effects have been most significant, again, in terms of deposits coming  in  JPMorgan Chase, for example, has picked up more than $40 billion of deposits  over the last week or so  That accelerated at the end of last week; on Thursday,  deposits increased by $16 billion  As a result, it has been increasing its balances on  deposit with the Fed  Over the course of 2011, that’s typically averaged about  $40 billion for JPMorgan Chase  On Thursday, that amount was up to $118 billion in  terms of deposits at the Fed  So it’s already been sizable  The bank gave indications  that particular clients—and it mentioned one large money market fund complex— suggested that if they were concerned about potential disruption in Treasury security  repayments, that they would intend to place $50 billion in deposits in a very short  amount of time; it suggested another large money market mutual fund would  similarly place a very large amount of funds on deposit in a short amount of time   And that was at JPMorgan Chase  In terms of the situation today, thus far it hasn’t  seen any significant acceleration deposit inflows  The expectation is something more  along the lines of the average it saw last week—so where it is going to peak around  $18 billion, it is expecting an inflow, say, in the $5 billion to $10 billion range  It’s  still early today, and I think the indications we saw from the other firms as well is that  that’s a similar expectation, if their expectations hold up   State Street also saw very large inflows  Deposits increased about $44 billion last  week  Half of that came from just two 2(a)7 funds last Tuesday, and for the  remainder of the week it had more of a trickle effect, mostly from non-2(a)7 funds— close to 25 clients in total that were increasing their deposits at State Street  Again, it  is investing that in the bank’s fed funds account, the Fed balance, which is up by  $49 billion through Friday  It is also saying that it’s difficult to know what the  developments will be today  It is expecting more of that trickle effect as compared  with very large increases   A similar story at BNY Mellon  It’s seen significant increases  The bank’s view  is that the market right now is in a bit of a wait-and-see position  It is expecting at  some point a significant drop-off in deposits or outflows in deposits  It is not seeing  that today, and it is expecting it probably won’t see that until later this week,  assuming that the situation in the Congress is resolved   In terms of the other large LISCC banks, we’ve seen similar trends but they are  much more modest  Wells Fargo is one example where we’ve seen about $6 billion  or $7 billion of deposit inflows  It views that as general risk aversion among their  clients in contingency planning  B of A and Citi also have seen a comparatively  modest increase in their deposits   In terms of the concerns at the banks, the primary concern that we’ve heard—over  them wanting to have some clarity in terms of discount window activity and parity of  payments—is around the potential rapid increase in their balance sheet  And the most  immediate effect of that would be on their Tier 1 leverage ratios and the potential  that, for prompt corrective action purposes, if their Tier 1 leverage ratio fell below  5 percent, that would initiate some supervisory actions   August 1, 2011 16 of 53              Our regulations do require state member banks to provide written notification in  the event that they breach the well-capitalized level on an intraquarter basis  We’ve  talked to the banks about their concerns there  We’ve drafted some interagency  guidance that we would potentially communicate in case events continue as they  are—very similar to guidance we issued around Y2K and after September 11  The  intent really is to provide latitude to the firms if they remain in sound financial  condition, if it’s clear that the effect is only temporary, and if the firm is prudently  managing the balance sheet growth—for example, placing the additional funds on  deposit with the Fed   We’ve been working with the OCC and the FDIC on the interagency guidance   It’s clear that we’re taking a consistent approach in our thinking on these issues  The  OCC reached out to seven large national banks on Friday  The message was that the  firms should act reasonably and responsibly, and that the OCC will not be concerned  if capital ratios dip a bit—and it is talking about from 7 percent to the 6 percent range   Its view was that no large national bank was immediately in danger of breaching  prompt corrective action, and that it will continue to assess the situation by staying in  contact with the firms   In terms of discussions that we have with the firms, JPMorgan Chase was one  institution that may raise the potential for some constraints around prompt corrective  action at the bank level  It indicated it still has about $170 billion of balance sheet  capacity at the lead bank, so it has significant capacity, and much more at the holding  company—closer to $700 billion—on a consolidated basis  But again, it is concerned  about those very large customer deposits potentially coming in   By our calculation, Bank of New York Mellon is probably closer to the 5 percent  threshold  We spoke to the bank about that  It had been thinking primarily about the  quarter-end calculation; I’m not sure it was focused on the intraquarter calculation  It  is going back and recalculating along those lines, but it could be that it is very close to  the 5 percent ratio, and that may trigger a notification   Now, State Street believes it has significant room  It can absorb about another  $220 billion of asset growth before it has a problem in terms of the 5 percent ratio    The only thing about that that I’m probably able to comment on is that it   does seem like there’s been almost a one-to-one relationship between the incremental deposits   coming in and the increase in the Fed deposits    Just one more point  The general risk aversion and the disruption and   stress in the short-term markets have also affected the foreign banking organizations  It’s been   most evident at the weaker firms, the French firms in particular  SocGen has talked about   significant maturities over the course of this week and next week  If it is unable to roll those, it   may be in a position where it has to implement its contingency funding plan  BNP indicated that   a number of its counterparties were requesting buybacks of CDs over the course of the past   week  Calyon also has a very large number of maturities coming up  So those firms are being   affected—I think the core European firms to a lesser extent, but clearly these issues and the   general risk aversion has affected funding for the European firms  "
9399,2013-10-16,FOLEY,"  Thank you  Louise Roseman briefed the Committee in 2011 on  three principles that underlie the procedures to handle government payments during a  debt ceiling impasse  Those principles largely continue to apply today based on  current discussions with Treasury staff  The first one is that principal and interest  payments on Treasury securities would continue to be made on time  The second  principle is that the Treasury would decide each day whether to make or delay other  government payments  The third principle is that any payments made would settle as  usual   In terms of principal and interest payments, principal payments on maturing  Treasury securities would be funded by Treasury auctions that roll over the maturing  securities into new issues, so the new issues would fund the redemption of the  maturing securities  Interest would be paid based on available cash in the Treasury  general account  To make a coupon payment, however, the Treasury may need to  delay or hold back making other government payments, even if it had sufficient  balances on a given day, in order to accumulate sufficient funds to pay a future large  coupon payment   While not expected based on current discussions, if the Treasury decided not to  prioritize principal and interest payments and had insufficient balances to redeem  maturing securities, it would instruct the Reserve Banks to roll forward in one-day  increments the maturity date of maturing securities  The securities would then  continue to be transferable on the Fedwire® Securities system  Interest payments  would also be held within the system until the Treasury authorized their release   When the Treasury could make its payments, it would pay principal and interest in a  manner that market participants have indicated would be the least disruptive to their  operations    October 16, 2013 9 of 50    Each evening, the Treasury will make a decision whether to release or delay  payments based on balance projections for the next day  The Reserve Banks have  worked closely with the Treasury staff to implement technological and operational  controls to ensure that government payments would not be made until the Treasury  has authorized their release each evening  Such procedures exist for payment  systems, such as ACH and Fedwire Funds, as well as other lines of business where  the Reserve Banks serve as fiscal agents  The Reserve Banks have been in close  communication with the Treasury staff regarding all of the operational details   Payments that are made would be settled as usual, and financial institutions and  consumers should have confidence that payments made would not be rescinded   Payments made over the ACH, however, would be originated for overnight  processing rather than the normal several days before settlement  This operational  change could mean that some consumers would receive benefit payments or payroll  payments somewhat later in the day on the settlement date, rather than first thing in  the morning (or even the day before) as is usual industry practice  The Treasury is  considering providing information to the public later this week regarding how the  debt ceiling would affect government payments (assuming the Congress does not act  as expected), and we understand that the Treasury’s communications may address  many of these issues   I’m happy to take some questions    I think that there are assumptions being made by market participants  I do   know that there are some who are making scenarios that say, “Okay, if it happens in terms of   prioritizing principal and interest, this is what we would do  If there is not going to be   prioritization of principal and interest, here are some other assumptions that are made”  I think if   you are in a situation where principal and interest are not prioritized, there is a big question of   how a lot of institutions would handle that situation in terms of their contingency planning    That’s a big open question  So I think there’s a lot of uncertainty in the market  "
