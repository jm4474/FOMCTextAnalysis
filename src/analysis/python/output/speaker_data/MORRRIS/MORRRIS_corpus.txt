  I think the virtue of the system, Mr Chairman, in that context is that the  Committee would be clearly alerted to the fact that if it holds down the funds rate over a period  of several months, it is highly probable that it will get a pattern of monetary growth which is  excessive and will exceed its longer-run targeted numbers  I think that, in the sense that the  Committee has this brought forcibly to its mind at every meeting, I think we’ll face up more  realistically to this choice we’ve got ahead of us      And I think to follow up on the point that Mr Axilrod made, I think that to  the extent that we choose a rate without careful consideration as to the probable monetary growth  that is to be associated with it, we’re very likely to run off course in those instances when our  economic forecast is wrong  To the extent that we’re focused on reserves as our operating target,  I think we’re less vulnerable to making mistakes when the forecast is wrong than we are when  we are pursuing the federal funds rate target     I think you can make the argument, Chuck, that the difference lies in the  ability of the Manager to control--     I can support the figures that you gave to us, Mr Chairman, but I’m a little  disturbed about the procedure that we’re using in establishing our long-term goals  What we’re  doing is making modest changes in the growth ranges, superimposing those modest changes on a  very volatile base number of the base period without really giving any elaborate consideration to  the effect of this over a long period of time     A period of say two to three years--how is this adding up over a longer  span?  In the present instance, we’re using as a base a period in which M2 grew very rapidly and  M1 grew very slowly  I think, in that sense, you might argue that the ranges we’re presenting  here are more conservative for M1 than for M2       4/20/76 - 31 -           The other thing that bothers me is that we’re not giving any [unintelligible] consideration  to the compatibility of our current one-year projection with those that we had given to the  Congress in earlier periods  In other words, how consistent is this set of numbers with a set of  numbers which we gave to the Congress three months and six months ago?  Are we going to run  into instances of serious incompatibility?  I think it’s possible that, in fact, it could well happen  in the future and that therefore it seems to me we need a little more staff input in making--     Well, I think in [unintelligible] situation, for example, whereas if we were  going to make both the projections--the long-run target we put out six months ago and the long- run target we are publishing today--if we’re going to make both of these, we would have to have  the kind of policy changes that we wouldn’t think would make sense     I’m not arguing that the Committee would necessarily come up with a  different judgment on the numbers, but it seems to me that this is input that the Committee ought  to have  That we ought to know the relationship between what we’re doing today and what we  [unintelligible] for earlier periods  That doesn’t mean that we’d necessarily come up with a  different judgment  It does seem to me that this is a part of the information process that we don’t  have     You wish to resign from the FOMC?     Mr Chairman, I have two points to make  One is that I’ve sensed that the  economy is really moving ahead more rapidly than our projections indicate  I think one factor  that ought to be given some attention is this whole business of retail sales  The April figure,  particularly, shows a slight decline--it seems to me that this could very well be another case of a  seasonal adjustment problem because, if you applied the 1975 seasonal factors, instead of getting  a decline in April, you would get an increase of 44 percent     Yes   SPEAKER(?)  Say that again, Frank     That if the 1975 factor was used, it would translate that slight decline to an  increase of 44 percent      Well, I think, looking at these numbers, the last three months taken as a  whole are stronger than with the new factors     That’s right     The other point I’d like to make, Mr Chairman, is this  I’m concerned  about whether we are going to be prepared in this Committee to properly assess, particularly as  we go into 1977, the capacity limits of the economy  Back in 1972, this Committee made a  misjudgment  I think, fundamentally, looking back on those days, we misjudged the capacity  level of the economy  We ran into widespread shortages of materials at a much higher level of  unemployment than we had anticipated  My question is, I’m worried about whether in this next  expansion we are going to be in a substantially better position to make judgments than we were  in 1972       5/18/76 - 18 -         It seems to me we ought to, as a System, give a high priority in our research work to really  getting a grasp on what the capacity limits really are in the various major materials, and perhaps  this is a job that could be split up between the Reserve Banks and the Board’s staff  But it seems  to me, that--I would hate to see us make the same mistake that we made then  And I think I’m  particularly concerned that we’re again moving in sync with the other major industrial countries  in an expansion phase, so that the chance of misjudging the situation, it seems to me, is still very  high  Would you want to comment on that Lyle?       If we had had it in March 1972--     Well, I feel intuitively that, even if we aggregate an index that you’re  working on, and even though that total index may look not too bad, we may run into shortages in  particular areas that could be very troublesome      My thought, Bob, was that particular commodities could be assigned to  particular Reserve Banks such as steel in Cleveland, paper to Boston, something like that, so that  we’d have continuing responsibility to the Committee from a particular bank organizing--     Mr Chairman, one little bit of intelligence on these lines  One of my  directors recently returned from a business council meeting  He reported to me a dramatic  change in the confidence of the business community represented there from three months ago      5/18/76 - 27 -         The confidence in the sustained expansion of the economy  He was surprised at the degree of  improvement in confidence      No, it’s not unusual, but I think it does suggest that we are going to see a  change in the conservative inventory policies and plant expansion policies     But I think we do have to face the prospect that our forecast could still be  conservative given this major change that’s [unintelligible]     We have been exploring the strange behavior in the demand for money in  the past year and we have run into one phenomenon that I would just like to ask Steve about,  whether it’s something that the System ought to explore  That is the big increase in net total  funds purchased by the commercial banking system, which was running in the middle of 1970 at  $4-1/2 billion; in the middle of 1975 it is up to almost $18 billion  [Would] an examination of  this to see whether it would help explain the demand for money be worthwhile?  It’s a project  that we could undertake, but I think you could do it more readily here     But if you are a corporate treasurer and you are putting your money out  for one day, would you consider this to be a part of your balance or not?  I’d be inclined to think  that I would      I am talking about the net purchases of the commercial banking system     No, I am talking about the purchase of funds from outside the banking  system     And you should also look into the volume of funds purchased from thrift  institutions, as a separate factor     By commercial banks  That’s a part of this aggregate     Predominantly the thrift institutions and the corporations     I think the fact that this series is growing--at the end of ’74 it was almost  $22 billion, the growth rate of this is not [out of proportion with the] growth rate of the money  supply, and it may have some explanatory value     5/18/76 - 39 -           Mr Chairman, Murray Altmann complained to me at the coffee break that  he’s going to have a hard time writing an expanded policy record this time because [there]  wasn’t enough dissent       I can’t help him this time, I promised in some future date to help him  But  I think at this point I support your thesis that the appropriate policy is a pause, so I therefore  support your narrow range of the funds rate  I would not be concerned to lower the upper ranges  of the aggregates because, if the only long-term objective we’re concerned about is the most  recent one we made, it is true that we are running above that more recent objective, but it’s also  true that we are about in the middle of the objective through the fourth quarter, and we are a little  on the low side of the objective [unintelligible] the third quarter     Now, all of the discussion seems to be centered around the most recent path, and if this  means that the earlier paths are to be ignored, then in effect we only have a three-month  projection instead of a 12-month projection factor  Seems to me we have to give some concern  to the other objectives and also to the fact that in establishing the most recent path and the  preceding path, we established them in relatively low quarters  So it seems to me that I’m not  concerned about what is called this second quarter bulge  And I’m a little happy, in fact, that we  are going to continue our procedure, [although] I think, sooner or later, it’s going to get us in  trouble projecting 12 months ahead on the most recent quarter regardless of what random  movements may have biased that recent quarter up or down     Well, I’m not so sure, Mr Chairman, that it’s simple from the public  relations point of view  That is, I think it would take a lot of explaining, and a lot of getting the  message across, if we were to come out with the substantially lower rates and adjust  [unintelligible] if we had a higher base  So I’m concerned about the--     --since maybe one of these days, one of these quarters, we are going to run  into a situation where, in order to avoid an excessively rapid or an excessively slow growth in the  money supply, we would have to come out with numbers for the next 12 months which the  public and the press are likely to misinterpret as meaning a radical shifting in policy in one  direction or another  I was talking [about it] to Mr Partee this morning at breakfast as something  that our Subcommittee on the Directive ought to examine, not in terms of the immediate problem  but in terms of what sorts of situations this might lead us to  That’s all I have to say      Mr Chairman, I have one comment and one question  [My comment] is  on this exercise of alternative policies  I am not talking--   SPEAKER(?)  [Unintelligible]     --about monetary policies now, Mr Chairman, I am trying to make a point  about the usefulness of this as--     Well, then, I’ll turn to my question, and that is, you gave an optimistic  report on prices, but in the past couple of weeks [we have been] getting a very sharp increase in  the weekly indexes of basic commodity prices, which I find difficult to jibe with the overall  analysis, [as] all of our indicators [are suggesting] a decelerating rate of growth, and I wonder if  you could help me on that score     No     Mr Chairman, I like your set of prescriptions  I’d like to go back to a  comment I wanted to make earlier on the usefulness of these alternative monetary policy  formulations  Seems to me that they don’t have an awful lot of relevance to us because of the  time horizon of the projections  That is, whenever you ask an economic model to give you the  economic effects of the more expansionary policy over a fairly short period of time, you’re up  against the fact that the lags in the impact of monetary policy are much shorter on production  than they are on prices     I think every sheet of this kind that I have seen in the past eight years around this table  suggested that a more expansionary policy would produce benefits in greater real growth and  very little in price effects, and I think that reflects the fact that the time horizon for this kind of  exercise has got to be longer to be useful to the Committee       7/19-20/76 - 44 -   It seems to me that for this kind of analysis to really give us much insight, we need to push  it out to 1978 or 1979  Now I know that the further out you get, the more difficult time you have  in projecting  Nonetheless, because of the differential lags of monetary policy between output  and prices, I don’t think that this kind of analysis is really very helpful  The other question I  had--     I think that’s right, sir, but I don’t think we can set them solely on the  basis of the projections of the next 12 to 18 months  I think implicitly we are not acting on that,  and if we were, we would have to revise our monetary growth upward     The other question I had, Mr Chairman, was more of a technical nature   Looking at the alternative B projections for the credit proxy, I see that we are projecting a slower  rate of growth for the proxy than was the case three months ago  This seems a little curious to  me  I don’t know whether we are presenting the proxy to the [congressional] committee or not,  but if we are--     I see  It’s hard for me to understand why, if M1 is going to grow at the  same rate, why the proxy would grow at a slower rate over the next 12 months than our estimate  made three months ago     Yes, but I assume that it’s mostly CD policy that’s dominant     Mr Chairman, I believe the staff’s economic projection is correct, and I  think alternative B is the proper course for us at the present time  Although, I would emphasize  that, along the lines of Mr Partee, I would expect the Manager to use the full range that is  provided to him on the funds rate, particularly if the monetary aggregates come in on the low  side, suggesting that the period of sluggishness is extending     And I would also like to support the proposition that Governor Coldwell made  I think it is  highly appropriate for the Board to be planning a fall reduction in reserve requirements, and I  think such a change would be extremely helpful to us on the membership problem which is  raising its head in New England very severely now  And I think it can be explained to the public  and the press that this does not reflect an easier monetary policy but simply one of the options we  have to meet the seasonal needs for credit  So I think that’s a very good suggestion, Phil, and I  hope we get some support around this table  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I agree with the staff’s economic projections  I do have a  question, however, and that is, it seems to me that this Committee over the next couple of years  will need all of the intelligence it can get on the question of price expectations  And in this  regard I want to ask the staff whether it thought it would be useful to include in the Greenbook a  section analyzing what’s going on in the futures markets for basic commodities, both food and  nonfood  And also whether it would be useful to analyze whether we could get any kind of  intelligence of note through analyzing what’s going on in this new Treasury bill futures market     The 1959 steel strike must have been such an exception     Mr Chairman, I would like to support the asymmetrical funds range here   I think the evidence does suggest that we are getting a reacceleration in the economy,  but it  seems to me it would be prudent to give the Manager a little more room to lower the funds rate in  the event that the evidence coming in tends to suggest that this reacceleration is in fact not  occurring  But with the understanding that he would not move to the midpoint of this  asymmetric range but could use it in the event that the aggregates come in weaker than were  expected     Mr Chairman, until about two weeks ago I was willing to accept the  slower growth rate in the economy as a normal cyclical phenomenon which often occurs in the  stage of an expansion as the thrust of the inventory cycle diminishes  But it seems to me that the  evidence that’s come in the past few weeks suggests that there is a basis for somewhat more  concern than I had a month ago  I was quite surprised at the breadth of the weakness in the  leading indicators in August  Only housing indicators showed any strength, and the breadth of  weakness in all of the other indicators was, I think, evidence that we ought to be alert to the  possibility that the economy is going to go more slowly than we had talked about     I have been looking into the little evidence that we have as to what has been happening in  September and October for some sign that this August weakness was being reversed, and I have  yet to see any real evidence that, apart from the housing sector, we are seeing a turnaround  It  seems to me that, even though Mr Gramley is not a devotee of leading indicators, we have  arrived at essentially the same position by a different means  I do agree with the analysis that the  risk of forecast error on the downside is more serious than I had thought in the past two months     And one other thing  Of course, it disturbs me, looking at the new projections which the  staff has given us, that--granted all the problems in projecting to the end of ’77--we are looking  at a number of 47 as the latest staff projection of real growth in 1977  I think that, for the first  time, we have a projection from the staff that is too low to be acceptable by this Committee as a  target  I think a 47 percent real growth rate is slower than we need to deal simultaneously with  the inflation rate  Obviously, if you are talking about 7, I’d be concerned that it is too high, but I  think 47 is too low     Now, the problem, it seems to me, is not the threat of recession  I don’t think that we have  any of the characteristics in the economy that would lead us to have a concern for that  I think  the problem is a sluggishness in the rate of growth  And it seems to me that the risk there is  much higher than I would have contemplated a month ago or two weeks ago     Finally, on this reference to the Michigan survey of consumer sentiment, I’d like to point  out that not all the surveys are showing these results  The Sindlinger survey, which is done on a  weekly basis, is showing a continued deterioration in consumer confidence     Sindlinger     Could I say something about Mr Sindlinger?  Now, Mr Sindlinger is in  many respects a crank  He takes these numbers and tries to forecast the stock market, the rate of  growth of the money supply, and so on  And so as far as his analysis of these numbers, he  verges on the absurd, if not going beyond the line  But nonetheless, [for] all of the weaknesses  of Mr Sindlinger as an analyst, I have found his numbers, bare of his interpretation, to be  extremely useful and quite sensitive to the current mood of the consumer  For this reason I     10/19/76 - 14 -   would tend to downgrade, or at least water down, the findings of the Michigan survey, which are  considerably older     Well I, let me say I didn’t work--     Well, I just wondered, Mr Chairman, whether the staff was biased  because of the absurdity of his interpretation     I’ve been following his numbers for a few years, and I found them very  useful     Mr Chairman, for a number of months now, this Committee has been  instructing the Manager to give equal weight to M1 and M2  And I think the continuing  diversion [of] growth rates is a continuation of relative growth rates which are out of line with  our past history  It seems to me that is going to give the Manager problems in continuing this  kind of directive  I was wondering what advice Mr Axilrod would have for the Committee on  how we ought to proceed in the future [unintelligible]       10/19/76 - 34 -     Mr Chairman, would that contemplate an immediate movement of the  funds rate?  Are you contemplating an immediate move of the funds rate to say, 4-7/8, which  would be the midpoint?       Mr Chairman, I find myself in disagreement with Mr Gramley’s position   It seems to me that the basic problem of economic policy in the past decade is that we’ve had a  fiscal-monetary policy mix which has been adverse to investment  I think to the extent that the  recent weakness in the economy is a product at least in part of the shortfall in government  spending, it’s particularly appropriate that we have a response in monetary policy  And I think  that Mr Gramley’s feeling that we will not get much of a response in the economy to lower  interest rates and higher security values that a somewhat easier policy would create, I think it’s  something I don’t share  So for all these reasons, I would support Mr Partee’s position,  accepting your specifications for the aggregates but proposing a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 funds range with  instruction to the Manager to move to 4-3/4 and see how things develop from there       Well, Mr Chairman, I think that what I would do this session is to present  the same numbers you presented the last time, all the way  I think given the softness in the  economy, I would be concerned about scaling back in any of the numbers at this time, even  though I think that, quite clearly, as a long-term proposition, that’s what we have to do  I think  the timing, however, might be unfortunate  And while I sympathize with Mr Partee’s technical  reasons for raising M2 and M3, and I think as a technical matter there’s a lot that could be said  for it, by the same token I wouldn’t want to be raising the limits in this environment either  I  think you may or may not be able to persuade the Committee that you are doing it for technical  reasons, but I think the press would not report the technical explanations but simply the  upgrading  So I think the safest thing, the best thing would be, for one time, present no changes       Mr Chairman, do we [unintelligible] just the bare minutes or [also the]  supporting documentation and reports that would be referred to in the minutes?     11/16/76 - 15 -             Mr Chairman, I share your feeling that it’s premature, to say the least, to  be talking about recession  I don’t think the numbers suggest that  I think the issue is whether  the rate of expansion of the economy is going to be anywhere near what we consider to be  optimal  It seems to me that the projections the staff had given us are, I think, not unrealistic,  and they are well below the rate any of us would describe as the optimum rate of expansion for  the economy next year  It seems to me this is the issue we ought to be concerned about in  formulating the policy for the next period     Mr Chairman, with respect to the three points you asked us to comment  on--this issue of shortage of liquidity, I think you really have to say, “compared to what?”  I  think, certainly, the economy is more liquid than it was a year ago, but if you ask about the state  of liquidity relative to where it has been in corresponding periods of the business cycle, earlier  business expansions, I think you would find that the answer to the question is that the economy is  less liquid than it has been in corresponding periods of expansion  Certainly this is true of the  corporate sector, [which] is nowhere near as liquid as it was in the earlier economic expansions     Yes, I know that it has a secular trend, but I think, nonetheless, if you  would ask the question, is the corporate sector more or less liquid than it was in corresponding  states of business expansions, you would have to say--     The other dimension of it is that if you think of liquidity in terms of the  availability of money, I think quite clearly money is available, but here again, money is available  at substantially higher interest rates than was the case in corresponding phases of business  expansion  I think it’s particularly important for the housing market  That is, mortgage money is  available, but it’s available at rates considerably higher than we have encountered in other  periods when housing was expanding     Well, no but I don’t think the real rate of interest is particularly important  to the individual buying a home  I don’t think he thinks in terms of real interest  I think he  thinks in terms of the amount of the monthly payment relative to his salary  And I think that the  increase in interest rates we have seen over the past five years has required, say, the young adult  buying a home for the first time--     He has to pay a higher percentage of his income than we did when we  bought our homes  Would it make a difference if we moved to a different policy?  I think yes  I  think it would certainly be helpful to the securities markets; I think it would be moderately  helpful to the stock market as well as the bond market  And to the extent that it would promote a  trend toward lower mortgage rates, I think that would be helpful       11/16/76 - 35 -           On the discount rate, I think we ought to move  I’ve been restraining my board from  moving, but I think that the time has come  I think in moving, though, I would recommend that  we move a 1/2 rather than a 1/4  That is, if we move a 1/2, that would only bring the discount  rate down to where the federal funds rate is at present     I am pleased that you propose that we do move to a somewhat more expansionary policy,  but I think I would move a little further than you suggest, Mr Chairman  I would propose a  4-1/2 to 5 range on the funds rate, instructing the Manager to move to 4-3/4  This is a marginal  difference, but I think the evidence is persuasive enough to me that we need to move more than  1/8  And therefore I’d like the specifications of alternative A better  It seems to me, for us to be  publishing specifications showing a range [with a lower bound] as little as 2-1/2 percent on M1  in this context bothers me a bit  I’d rather see the range on M1 be 4 to 8     And it seems to me in this context that we ought to give more weight, at least temporarily,  to M1  Because I think it’s pretty clear to me that if you have to ask yourself which series, M1  or M2, is more descriptive of what appears to be going on in the real economy, I think that you’d  have to argue that M1 should be given, in this context, more weight than we normally would  give it  That’s all I have to say     Total reserves, and then into RPDs      I would like to say that my agreeing with the recommendations represents  a reversal of a position I took as a member of the Maisel and Holland predecessor  subcommittees  My thinking has been changed for two reasons  I think my previous thinking  was stated very eloquently in Governor Wallich’s supplementary statement  But I think two  things have changed my thinking     First, I think that experience has demonstrated that we can control the money supply over  periods of six months to a year with the present operating procedure, provided that the  Committee is willing to move interest rates sufficiently to do it  I think the great case in point  was the first half of ’74, when we succeeded in hitting our aggregates objectives in a very  difficult situation  We did so by unprecedented movements in short-term money rates  I think  the last half of ’74 we backslid a bit into our former ways--we expressed an unwillingness in the  last part of the year to move rates sufficiently on the downside to get the kind of monetary  growth rate that we were seeking  So I think point A is that we can do the job with the present  operating procedure     Second, I think that despite the limitations in the experiment, it does show that, during a  one-month period--and for an operating instrument, that is the relevant period--the multiplier  relationship between reserves and monetary aggregates is extremely unstable  And it has not  been demonstrated that a reserves operating target would be superior to a federal funds rate  operating target     One other point I wanted to add to the first point, on the success we had in the first half of  ’74 in terms of hitting our objectives  I think it also shows that we do not need day-to-day  stability in the funds rate to produce an environment for control of the money supply if we are  willing to move in significant increments     I think there is one final point  There is an implication in Henry’s statement to the effect  that a reserves operating target would somehow desensitize the market to Federal Reserve open  market operations, and therefore the Federal Reserve would somehow be freer to move interest  rates because of this desensitizing  I don’t think that’s realistic  I think that we have to  recognize that to any investment institution or underwriting institution, the reading of the Federal  Reserve’s intentions is of prime importance  And no matter what operating instrument we use,  as long as we have a rational system and adhere to a rational system, the market is going to  figure out how to read that system     If we shifted to a nonborrowed reserves operating system, the first thing that would happen  is that every single investment house, underwriting firm, in the United States would immediately  gear up to forecast nonborrowed reserves  And it would take a little while, but pretty soon they     12/20-21/76 - 31 -         would be doing about as good a job as we do  Because they could afford to invest in the talent  necessary  In the five years between the time I left the Treasury and joined the Federal Reserve,  I was with an investment counseling house  I would spend a couple of hours every week  analyzing the Fed and reporting to our investment committee  At that time we were operating on  free reserves  And it didn’t take long to get into the swing of things and to interpret those  numbers coming out  I don’t think I misjudged a move in Federal Reserve policy once in five  years     Now I think the other thing is, in addition to everybody’s forecasting nonborrowed  reserves, which would be difficult and would [involve] a lag, as long as you have a narrow funds  constraint, the market will still be observing the range in which the Manager is operating--let’s  say the range is 4 to 4-3/4, just to throw out an idea for tomorrow--and the market observes that  the Manager will continue to intervene at those two points, even though the rate may fluctuate  day-to-day  As soon as the Manager is not intervening at 4 to 4-3/4, you will get the same flow  of information on the ticker tape     So I think that the idea that we can, by changing our present system, somehow get away  from the extreme sensitivity in the market to monetary policy, and to remove whatever  inhibitions that gives us, is just not realistic  I think the form of market sensitivity will change  [but in] substance will still be there  I don’t think that our concern about market reaction would  diminish one bit     It seems to me that, as I say--I’m a repentant sinner--I think clearly we can do the job with  the present system  And the way we can really is by a willingness to move rates  There is no  other system that would permit us to do the job if we are not willing to move rates  I don’t care  what your operating target is, as long as you have a narrow funds constraint, you’re not going to  control the money supply  So it seems to me that we ought to be diverting our attention to more  [unintelligible]     Mr Chairman, in line with Governor Lilly’s comment on what we’d do if  we have to publish the specifications immediately, I think one thing, clearly, we’d have to do is  to publish a very wide funds range  I think any narrow funds range would produce a very  immediate market reaction  If the funds range were so wide that it could encompass a  tremendous array of moves, I think we would desensitize--it seems to me this is one thing we’ll  have to do       Mr Chairman, I picked up a little piece of intelligence last week that I  think perhaps you might like to comment on  I talked to Joe Barr shortly after he had attended  the annual Christmas party of the House Ways and Means Committee, and he told me that he  found that the reaction of the members of the committee on this issue of a tax cut to be quite  surprising  First, he said that there is going to be a great reluctance on the part of the committee  to approve any tax cut  Second, he thought that the committee was exhibiting, this goes for  Ullman and a lot of other people on the committee, a great disenchantment with the use of tax  measures as a stabilizing device  So this suggests, if this intelligence is correct, that perhaps the  tax cut might ultimately come through if the President pushes it, but that it might take a while  longer getting through Congress     I was going to say, he also added [that] he was a little bit surprised [at] the  vigor of the determination of the House leadership in the last year or so, O’Neill and the others,  to maintain the independence of the Congress from the presidency  Politically they argue that  almost all the members of the House were elected by bigger majorities than the President in their  districts, and they don’t feel beholden to the President  Here is another aspect, I think, which  might produce a greater delay in response [by] Congress than might otherwise be the case     Sir, in that connection, is anything being done to try to get the wholesale  price index on a transactions basis rather than list price basis?     We have the same problem in New England, and 25 percent of the total  ski-area revenue comes in the Christmas-New Year’s week  If they lose that, that’s gone  forever     But then it is too late [for] the ski industry     Steve, we have been for a number of months instructing the Manager to  give equal to weight to M1 and M2, that’s [unintelligible] to policy, given the diverse behavior  of these two series in the last six months  Should we, in your judgment, continue to give the  same instruction to the Manager, or should we alter it?     Mr Chairman, I think the choice that we face today, between a pause and  another modest direction of ease, is a difficult one  I don’t feel any overwhelming conviction  [about] which course is correct  I think a strong case can be made for a pause  But I think, on  balance, I come down on the side of another modest move in the direction of ease, for two  reasons  First, I think that monetary policy is the only policy that can be operating while the     12/20-21/76 - 69 -         Congress is deliberating fiscal movements  And what we do today cannot influence the real  economy while the Congress is deliberating  I think we can affect the mood and the psychology,  and given the fact that there is some reluctance on the part of the Congress to move dramatically  on taxes, it seems to me that the better [mood] could have something to do with the kind of fiscal  package we have     I think we are all feeling better about things than we were a month ago  And I think one of  the contributing factors to this is the decision we made a month ago to take another step in the  direction of ease and the response we have gotten to that move from the bond market and the  stock market  I think that clearly is an element in the better feeling  Because, as Lyle said, in the  absence of the assumption of a fiscal stimulus, he would not have revised upward the projection  on the basis of the numbers that have come in during the past month     The second thing that influenced my judgment is that I think we’re in a situation where  another small move in short-term money rates can have a fairly significant impact on long-term  rates  I am thinking in particular about the posture of insurance companies today, which I think  are probably in the most liquid condition that they have been for the past 15 years  They have  been staying short in the expectation of putting their money out at higher rates than they could  get at the time  At least the Boston companies are now getting very restive with this policy  It is  costing them so much to stay short that I think one more modest move on short-term rates could  produce quite a change in response in investment policies in the case of insurance companies   You could have quite a healthy effect on the long-term market     So, for this reason, I would propose that we establish a funds rate [range] of 4 and 4-3/4,  instruct the Manger to gradually move the rate down to 4-3/8, and pick the figures for the  aggregates to correspond to this  I recognize that there is a cost associated with this and that is  that, later on in 1977, if we do what I suggest, we are probably going to have to take restraining  action a month or so earlier than we would otherwise have to  I think that’s the bullet that we’re  going to have to bite sometime next year anyway  And it seems to me that, on balance, I think  the case is stronger for another move now     Mr Chairman, I’d like to follow up on Governor Partee’s comment on the  crowding out issue in ’77  The staff has an estimate of corporate external financing in ’77  How  does that compare to ’76?      1/17-18/77 - 32 -             But to have a major problem you would have to have a substantial  upgrading in the corporate investment numbers     Mr Chairman, I guess I’m in a minority position in this, but it seems to  me that there are advantages in the present situation of staying with the present ranges  I think  you’re quite right that we must have a policy of gradually moving down the ranges  But I don’t  think we ought to get an [unintelligible] policy--to have a feeling that we’ve got to make a  change every three months  It seems to me, given the state of the economy, that on pure  economic grounds, a case could be made for staying with the present ranges until the leading  indicators of capital spending start showing some strength, which they don’t at the moment  And  my second reason is that, it seems to me, this is not a change  The change you’re proposing is  not a change in substance  This seems to me to be a questionable judgment     I would prefer [waiting] until the next meeting of the Committee, [which] would be in  May  It seems to me that would be a better time to make changes  I think we would be better off  to stay with the present set in this particular context     Well, I think you’re quite right, Mr Chairman, but I think that if we were  making a change in substance here, and [if] I thought we had the economic case to make it, I  think it would be quite different  But to make a change that I don’t think is substantive in this  climate--I don’t think that it makes a lot of sense     Mr Chairman, I think that the differences we’re talking about are quite  narrow, but I think I would prefer to keep the present midpoint and use a 4-1/4 to 5 range     Mr Chairman, I think there is a need for the Committee to make policy in  a longer-term time frame than we’ve been accustomed to  I thought I would ask if the staff has a  concept of what the optimum growth path ought to be for the economy over the next few years,  and if so, how does the projection for ’77 relate to that time path     I think a kind of interesting development in the New England academic  scene--we have Otto Eckstein, for example, coming out now with the concept that we really had     2/15/77 - 13 -           not better plan for a rate of growth on the average over the next four or five years in excess of 5  percent--5 percent is really the outside limit, and the Phillips curve will rise very sharply with a  growth rate in excess of that     It’s undesirable, right     I think that’s the implication  I think so  But he also argues that this path,  which would get us to about 5-1/2 percent unemployment in 1980--that, at that time, we are  likely to [have] approximately the same degree of strain on capacity [for] basic materials that we  encountered in 1973  Now, I don’t know how, I’m curious to know if you would share this  particular view?     There is a precedent  In the third year of the expansion beginning in ‘69,  M1 velocity was 62  But, of course, that was accompanied by a sharp rise in interest rates  So  there is a precedent, but not without major changes in short-term money rates accompanying it     But even then, at this stage of the cycle, that is not an unusual level of  velocity for M2  Because in the third year of the cycle beginning in 1960, M2 velocity was 62     Mr Chairman, I support your position with alternative B  I think that the  time to lean against the bulge will be in the third quarter, when we find out how much the bulge  was  I think in terms of timing, [it is] more appropriate to do it then than to start to do it now  I  agree with Governor Gardner that to take even the minor step toward that now is premature      No, I have nothing to add      But in that event, you could contemplate that we might only release to the  public the almost meaningless directive that we’ve published in the past  I don’t see how, if we  were advised by a court that we had to release it earlier, that the court would permit us to simply  release such an innocuous statement      Mr Chairman, I heard a theory yesterday that the new budget procedure  may have something to do with this  That under the present system it is more difficult to get  supplementary budgets through the Congress  And therefore the agency heads tend to put a little  more into the budget than they might otherwise have done  Whether there’s any validity to that,  I don’t know     Mr Chairman, I would like to follow up on Governor Partee’s question  and ask, in terms of your flow of funds work, what is the implication of this projection for the  flow of funds, particularly the external corporate demand for monies?  What does that tell us  about the likely behavior of interest rates?     Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the analysis of velocity numbers for the  third year of expansion would suggest extremely heavy pressures in the credit markets  Because  the flow of funds numbers are giving us a contrary indication, it would be quite unique to have a  third-year expansion with very little change in corporate demand and the big jump in velocity  coming together     I think also the fact that the recession was much more severe than most in  the past is another dimension     Offsetting balances?       Well, Mr Chairman, I would accept your specifications, and I also agree  with you that our actions in the coming months ought to be in response to the facts as they come  in and not in anticipation that the projections will be realized  I think, in general, this Committee  has functioned better when it moved on the basis of the facts coming in than when it moved on  the basis of projections  I think of 1968 and 1972, two years where we got in trouble because we  acted not on the basis of facts coming in but on the basis of projections which proved to be  incorrect  So I think as a general strategy matter, the course you recommended is one that I  would accept     Mr Chairman, I like your proposal, and I agree with Henry Wallich that  the rebate was killed because the economy is performing much better than we thought it was at  the time the rebate idea was generated  And for the same reason, it seems to me that this is  exactly the kind of time monetary policy ought to respond  I think we got a strong full thrust in  the economy, [and] perhaps our second quarter estimates are on the conservative side  I have an  intuitive feeling that things are really moving, and that while the uncertainties over the energy     4/19/77 - 35 -           policy are likely to have a drag on capital investment, that’s not where we’re getting the thrust at  the moment, and I don’t see any near-term concern stemming from that     As I mentioned to you at the coffee break, I think, near-term, the energy program is going  to be a drag on investment decisions--simply the uncertainty of not knowing what kind of rules  of the game you’re playing under--but I think, long-term, it is going to have a very positive  effect on investment decisions  Once the program is adopted and people know what the rules of  the game are, I think we are going to see a surge in energy-related investments     I think that we can also defend your program on structural grounds  I think there is pretty  clear evidence that we are returning to a more normal relationship between M1 and M2  And it  could be defended--if for no other reason than I think that this combination is structurally better  than the former one  And I also think Henry Wallich’s base drift argument is a good one  I think  in looking at ranges for the future, we ought to give some recognition that we have had  overshoots--and undershoots--in the past, and clearly we have had an overshoot in M2  And to  scale down the year ahead makes good logic     Steve, do we know in advance that the Social Security Administration is  going to issue checks early?     You mean the seasonal adjustment factor was changed, or just how did  you?     Mr Chairman, I support your proposal  Even though the difference  between 9-1/2 and 10 is pretty small, as these things go, I think, given the fact that this bulge is  the bulge of only one week at the moment, I wouldn’t be comfortable [with] even that modest  narrowing of the range  I would like to stay with the original proposal     I think there has been a good deal of that, Phil, simply because the brokers  find that they can offer better rates than the banks, and I think another piece of evidence is that  the performance of the stock market relative to the growth in margin credit is much weaker than  you would otherwise anticipate       Because otherwise you’ve got to assume [unintelligible]--somebody’s  moving out of the market and allowing the little guy to take it over, and that doesn’t seem to fit  the facts     Mr Chairman, could I clarify your proposal?  Do I understand you  properly that you keep the funds rate at around 5-1/4 and only move it up if we were hitting the  higher part of the ranges?     Well, I think that my feeling, Mr Chairman, is that we ought to make a  bigger move right now  I think the economy is very strong  I think the lull that Mr Partee and  Mr Eastburn speak of is certainly a possibility, but I don’t see in the indicators any evidence that  it’s probable  We are faced with this April bulge in the money supply, which means that even if  the staff’s projections are correct for May and June, that we are going to come out with a very  high M1 number  And in order to meet the midpoint of our longer-term ranges, this would mean  M1 growth at 4 percent and M2 at 68 for the subsequent three quarters, and that, gentlemen, if  our forecast is correct, is going to be very difficult to do     It seems to me that we need to take out some insurance today against the May and June  aggregates coming in higher  And therefore, I would propose a funds range of 5 to 6 percent,     5/17/77 - 29 -           with the Manager instructed to move to 5-1/2 next week  Now, unlike Mr Partee, I don’t view  the spring of 1975 experience as a mistake  It seems to me that that’s sort of the model that we  ought to be thinking of in this kind of context  Because it seems to me that the move we made  for the spring of 1975--because it was reversed rapidly as the evidence came in showing that we  didn’t have a permanent increase in the demand for money--we didn’t harm the economy  But if  we had been right, and there was a big increase in the demand for money, we would have been in  a much better posture to meet it, and--     Well, it seems to me that, again, it is a matter of taking out insurance [in  case the] second quarter bulge turns out to be bigger than we are now projecting  But I think we  ought to make another move, and I’m just talking about a modest initial move next week, to  5-1/2 [and] give the Manager authority to move as high as 6 if the numbers come in on the high  side  It is not often, Mr Chairman, [that] I’m on your right     I’m by myself     Paul, will that also include the extent of what impact it will have on the  operations of the Desk?      5/27/77 - 6 -        I think that you ought to [have the System account act]  One thing is, it  would give us some concrete experience with operating difficulties if there are some  It will be  helpful to this Committee when we have the meeting     Well, I think in general we are more optimistic than Paul suggests [for]  New York  I think we have seen our capital goods industries continue to rise in orders--a feeling  that capital spending is about to get going  I think New England is pretty optimistic at the  moment  Not bullish  No one has been looking for a boom, but no one really wants a boom, and  I think there is a pretty general degree of satisfaction for the way things are going     Mr Chairman, I have two comments  I think there’s one measure of  confidence that we shouldn’t overlook, and that is the remarkable performance of the bond  market in the last few weeks despite the fact that we pushed up short-term rates--and in fact  probably because of it, because we showed the determination to move promptly  And despite the  poor price index numbers coming out, we have seen a willingness in long-term investors to buy  at declining yields, and the long-term market is significantly below where it was when the  federal funds rate was at 4-3/4  So I think that is one area of confidence       I think there is an expectation that we are not going to have a sharply  rising trend in interest rates  That also shows up in the Treasury bill futures markets  The  Treasury bill futures yields are going down, reflecting an anticipation of that     I think so, yes     6/21/77 - 18 -           I think if we had not moved in the face of that April bulge [in M1], we  would not have had a decline in the long-term yield      Well, I think if we get this continued confidence in the bond market, it’s  going to spread to the stock market as well     That’s right     My other comment is less optimistic, Mr Chairman  Getting back to the  wages issue, which I think is going to be very critical in the next 18 months or so  I was talking  recently with John Dunlop, and he is very pessimistic on wages  And his argument is that we’ve  had a number of settlements recently in automobiles and other areas that have produced a  maladjustment in the normal wage structure  And therefore, that is going to put pressure on  union leaders in other areas this year and next to come up with settlements that will bring them  back in line with the auto workers and steel workers and so on  I was wondering if the staff had  looked into this--what Dunlop considers to be a really difficult structural wage problem?       He is pretty happy about the construction sector  But it’s outside of  construction that he thinks we’re--     6/21/77 - 19 -           Yeah     Mr Chairman, I’m very much disturbed by this prospect of an early July  artificial bulge in the money supply  It seems to me that our response ought to be to adjust the  seasonal adjustment factors to reflect the fact that our present seasonals are wrong  To do  otherwise is to give a market which is very sensitive to these numbers a misleading impression  as to what is going on  We now have in the marketplace a feeling of confidence that we have got  the money supply under control  I don’t think we ought to mislead the market, but on the other  hand, for us to publish numbers where we know the seasonal adjustment factor is wrong, I think  doesn’t make any sense  I hope I can find some support around the table [for] that possibility     Well, I think seasonally adjusting weekly data involves a lot of  uncertainty anyway  But it seems to me that we do have some historical basis for making an  adjustment we ought to use     6/21/77 - 24 -           If it happened every year, then the seasonal would take [it] into account,  and we would not be showing a big bulge  It’s [because of] the fact that it doesn’t happen every  year that we’ve got a problem      I don’t think it makes the average figure for the year higher, because the  rate of change in August would be lower because of this     We are talking about very big increases in the first week of July, Mr  Chairman--about $3 billion      We do this for the industrial production index when we have a special  factor       All I’m suggesting, Steve, is that we have a good seasonal adjustment  instead of a lousy one      Well, Mr Chairman, I think we are very fortunate that the staff  projections for May and June turned out to be pretty close to reality and that we didn’t need the  insurance on the funds rate that I feared we might need a month ago  I like alternative B  I  would hope that we could stay, as Dave Eastburn suggested, at 5-3/8 for the month  But on the  other hand, I would expect the Manager to use a full range in the event that we get a radically  different performance in the aggregates than we’re now expecting     Alan, what’s been the reaction to the comments in the BIS [Bank for  International Settlements] report about the place of the American dollar?     Mr Chairman, my speech is brief  I don’t see any basis for challenging  the staff forecast at this point in time  I feel as Paul Volcker does that if there are errors in the  forecast for the next few quarters, the reality is more likely to come out on the low side than the  high side  And I think that our ability to forecast in this inflationary environment is less than it  was before  It seems to me that the implication of that is that this summer we’ve got to keep  very close watch on the numbers and be willing to revise, I think, and to adjust     For this reason, I disagree with you that we meet too often  I think there are meetings,  such as today’s, when the caliber of the conversation suggests that we really don’t have an awful  lot to talk about  But the problem is, we don’t know when those months are going to be, Mr  Chairman     Mr Chairman, I, too, come out with Governor Partee  My preferred  position would be no change at this time  I don’t feel that credibility requires that we change our  long-range goals every quarter  But I think we are entering into a period of decelerating growth   I like the tone of the economy now  I think it is clear, at least for a couple of quarters ahead, that  we’re going to have decelerating growth  I think the only question is the rate of deceleration   However, I would accept your 4 percent lower level on M1, Mr Chairman, if you feel it has  symbolic value  I think, in the expansion, the number we’ve got to focus on most seriously is the  upper end of the range  So I really--if we can buy some symbolism with lowering the lower end  of the M1 range to 4, I would certainly accept that     I don’t see where we have a base drift problem at this meeting  That reflects my feeling  that, at this stage of the cycle, we ought to be coming out toward the upper end of the ranges   And looking at the past six months, we’ve had M1 growth of 61 [percent] and M2 of 88, and it     7/19/77 - 41 -    seems to me that’s about where I think we should have been  I would, however, be opposed to  reducing the upper end of the range at this time  I fear that we would not be giving ourselves  enough leeway, if we’re taking these ranges seriously, and I fear that it might force us into an  interest rate policy that might prematurely stifle the economy  So I would come out exactly  where Governor Partee would     Mr Chairman, I accept your proposal     Mr Chairman, I think I have some differences [with] the point of view of  staff and the point of view of Mr Winn  It seems to me that animal spirits in the [Keynesian]  sense are pretty well [hid]  Governor Wallich’s analysis is correct  But I think, in addition to  that, you have the psychological factor of all these uncertainties generating an unwillingness to  make commitments  I think it’s reflected in behavior in the stock market, for example  And it’s  reflected, I think, in the commitments figures for new capital investment, which is really while  we have an upward trend  I think it’s an upward trend that is not going to be of sufficient  strength in the next six months to offset the slackening that I see in the consumption sector and  the housing sector     It’s a surprising thing--although my own staff happens to agree with the Board’s staff in  their projections--I tend to think [unintelligible]  I was surprised that the ray of data coming in  [during] the past month did not lead to a more significant change in the projection  Because it  seems to me that the probabilities are now that--and this may be bad--the projections for this  quarter and the next are going to prove to be substantially too high, and that the first half of 1978  is likely to be substantially stronger  And [it] could well be that this will be a better path, as far  as maintaining control over inflation, than the path we’ve projected     Well, I feel very strongly that the weight of the evidence--no growth in new orders for  durable goods, flattened retail sales for several months, substantial decline in basic commodity  prices--right across the board [in] the indicators that tend to lead the economy, there is a base of  weakness that I don’t think is compatible with the modest slowdown in near-money growth rates   We would have to see quite a basic change coming up pretty quickly in these factors to justify  the projection  My intuitive feeling is that we’re going to be revising these numbers down     8/16/77 - 8 -             When you say significant, what percentage rates of increase over the first  quarter do they think about?     I was thinking from the first quarter to the second quarter     No, I feel the same way     I agree with you on that, Bob, and I think there’s a lot of what they call  closet indexing going on  The managers not admitting that they’re indexing, but they’re acting  as if they were indexing, out of the same sort of desperation that made this fad go as far as it has   The actual number of overt index funds is still very small  But closet indexing is very big     The depressing prices of the growth stocks have overweighed in most  professional portfolios, so, in order to get closer to the index, they are selling growth stocks and  buying others     Because the major indexes are weighted very heavily by the growth stock,  much more so than the general market  The general market has done better than the growth  stocks     We find New England resorts have been doing very well     Mr Chairman, I am quite pleased with our performance during the past  month  I think that the move we made in the funds rate was needed to maintain our credibility in  the marketplace, in light of the big bulge in the aggregates  I think we could take some pleasure  from the performance of the bond markets  The reaction in the long-term market has been  practically nil, and in fact the long-term rates are just about where they were, when the funds rate  was at 4-3/4 in March     8/16/77 - 36 -             Well, because I think that the fact that long-term rates have been stable is  an expression on the part of the bond investor that the Federal Reserve is exercising a reasonable  degree of control over the money supply, and that therefore a long-term commitment makes  some sense at the current level of rates     I think you can slow down the rate of growth in money supply without  pushing  long-term rates up  The long-term rates are to a large extent a function of expectations     Well, what I would argue, Paul, is that, if we had not responded to the  extent that we did in the face of an 18 percent rise in [money], the reaction in the long-term bond  market would have been very different     Well, to go on, Mr Chairman, I think that I would support alternative B, which is  essentially a stand-pat policy for the next four weeks, [as] a pretty good one  I think it takes time  for the monetary aggregates to respond to a change in interest rate policy  I don’t think that we  have yet seen the effect of the upward adjustment in our short-term rates, and I think you won’t  see that until September-October     My inclination would be to go easy on the discount rate at the moment, for  two reasons  I think it could well be, in view of my feeling about the deceleration in the  economy, that we might have to move short-term rates lower before the end of the year  I would  like to see some confirmation in the next month or so of some resolution of what I see as the  conflict between the real economy and the monetary economy right now  In other words, we’ve  got, in the real economy, a deceleration of the rate of advance; and in the monetary economy,  you’ve got an acceleration in the rate of advance  And these two are going to be reconciled  either in terms of a stronger economy or a decline in the demand for money     And for that reason I would be inclined to go slow on raising the rate until this  reconciliation happens, because I think the timing of a rise in the discount rate at a time when  we’re going to see more and more talk in the press about a deceleration in the economy could  lead some unsophisticated observers to see a causal relationship between an increase in the  discount rate and a slowdown in the economy  I would like to see a little more evidence of  which way we’re going before we raise the rate, and we can live--we’ve learned to administer  the discount window with a differential between the discount rate and the market rate in the past     By administration I mean that we can avoid an excessive use of the  window by a bank in order to pick up the differential     By kicking them out of the window after a certain amount of time     Our policy is that the discount window is not a permanent source of  capital     I don’t understand what you mean, Phil     No, I think the wider the spread you have between the discount rate and  the federal funds rate, if you have the gap where the discount rate is lower, obviously it’s going  to be very attractive to banks to come and use the window  And therefore, in that kind of a  context, we’d have to administer the window a little more rigorously than you otherwise would   I’m saying that I’d be willing to do that for another month or so until I can see which way--until  I can see some resolution of the conflict between the real world and the monetary world     No, but it’s just that the larger the gap between the funds rate and the  discount rate, the more administration you have to do     I’m not saying the standards are different  For obviously, when the  discount rate is above the funds rate you don’t have to do any administering at all  I think that  this doesn’t mean that we can’t live for another month with the present discount rate, that’s all,  even though the gap is 3/4     Sure     Mr Chairman, I think I see one thing that’s damaging  I think on the  basis of the memorandum that I read before I came to the meeting, I would have shared your  position, but in light of this Hannaford amendment, it seems to me that if we voluntarily change  our practice, that weakens our case for getting something like the Hannaford [proposal]     I want to say, shouldn’t we wait until we find out whether they’re going to  sue?     Well, Mr Chairman, I think we are probably ready for some kind of  consensus     Consensus motion  I think several of us have to catch airplanes     Mr Chairman, on this business of full employment, I tend to define where  we are in terms of the unemployment rate for married men and for heads of households  And if  you look at that, it suggests that we’re about 1-1/2 percent from full employment, which means  that full employment would be measured around Bob Mayo’s 5-1/2 percent level because, with a  decline of 1-1/2 percent, you’d have the unemployment rate for married men down to 2 percent  and for heads of households down to 3 percent  And I think, historically, those levels have been  associated with full employment     On the forecast on the outlook, we still tend to be a little more pessimistic than the staff,  and I think our difference lies primarily in the consumption sector  That is, we think it’s  improbable that automobile sales in ’78 will exceed the ’77 levels, which the staff has projected   It is true that, if you look at the relationship of installment credit to income, we are still well  below the peaks reached in ’73  But I think the current level of installment credit relative to  income is extremely high relative to any other period  If you exclude the ’73 period, that  relationship is already very high  And whether, starting out from that point, we can sustain a  further increase in automobile sales seems questionable to me    And the other factor we’re giving some weight to is the one you mentioned earlier--the  wealth effect, on consumption, of the decline in the stock market  And I think that while it may  be quite appropriate to weigh in other types of wealth, such as land and real estate, I think our  observation is that the impact of the stock market is disproportionately [large] in its effect on  consumption [relative] to real property and that sort of thing because, for the reason you  mentioned, Jim, people look upon stocks as being a liquid instrument, and they typically don’t  look upon real property in that sense  So, for the year beginning in the fourth quarter of ’77,  whereas Board staff is projecting a 47 [percent] real growth rate, we think it would be more  probable, given our outlook on consumption, to have a figure of 4 to 4-1/4  So we’re marginally  more pessimistic     Well, I can’t think, Mr Chairman, of anything that would put a further  damper on capital spending plans     No, I disagree     Well, take, for example, the Penn Central crisis situation     Well, Mr Chairman, I have been doing a lot of soul searching for this  meeting  Particularly because I feel that, near term, the economy is not going to be as strong as  the staff has projected  On the other hand we’ve got the fact that we’ve had two quarters of  back-to-back growth rates substantially in excess of what we were shooting for  And I  personally found the August numbers rather disappointing  I was hoping for a reaction from the  July bulge, and it didn’t happen     It seems to me that we’ve got to make a move at this meeting if we’re going to maintain  credibility in Federal Reserve policy, particularly in the light of the fact that next month we’ll  have to set long-term targets  I think our setting of the long-term targets next month will be very  awkward if we act as if we were not terribly unhappy with the excessive rates of growth we’ve  gotten in the last six months  So I would buy two-thirds of your prescription, Mr Chairman, in  that I’d buy the 3 to 7 and 4 to 8, although I would certainly be amenable to lowering the lower  level  I’d be happy to see for that period a smaller number than 3 or 4     But the thing I’m unhappy about is the proposition that we should leave this meeting  instructing the Manager to adopt a status quo policy on the funds rate until such time as he sees     9/20/77 - 47 -   the numbers moving out of the range or approaching the end of the range  I just don’t think  that’s appropriate in the light of six months of overshoot  I buy the 6 to 6-3/4 range, but with a  proviso that the Manager be instructed to move to the 6-3/8 midpoint by next week to  demonstrate to the market and to the business community that we are not satisfied with what’s  happened  I think maintaining our credibility here is very critical  And I think we’re on the  verge of being where the market is going to judge us pretty soon one way or the other if we show  a tendency to drag our feet here     Have you settled on the midpoint?     6-1/4--     Have you seen this Rand Corporation study that I’ve read about in the  press, which suggested that the current market price of oil products in the United States,  excluding taxes, is about the same as in Europe  And therefore the implication is that the control  of oil prices at the producer level, which was designed to average--to bring us halfway between  [the United States and Europe] on consumer prices of oil, is not working  Have you been able to  analyze that?     I’d like to see it     Mr Chairman, I’d like to pursue something that we started talking about a  little earlier, and that is the vulnerability of the thrifts in this cycle  We made a survey of the  Boston savings banks this morning, trying to find out how they have been doing in October   Now in the past, the Boston savings banks have been very sensitive--their deposit flow has been  very sensitive to interest rates  And in the past, at a time when the federal funds rate was at  6-1/2, they were howling and screaming, [as] I recall  Today, the results of the survey showed  that, while they didn’t think they would do as well as they [did] last October, they were really  doing pretty well     It seems to me that--and I suppose this is reflected in your projections here--the thrift  institutions are in a different position than they were in the last period when we were tightening  the rates, and this is suggested by the fact that you’re projecting the Treasury bill rate to rise  toward 8 percent, while, at the same time, you’re not projecting anything but a modest decline in  housing starts after the second quarter of next year  I suppose in part this is due to the fact that a  lot of the interest-sensitive money that was sitting there in ordinary savings accounts is now  structured out [in time deposits] and is not likely to leave until the maturities come due  But my  question--one thing this Committee needs to know is--from the present level of rates, how much  room do we have with the thrift institutions as far as putting them in a position where they’re  likely to suffer net outflows of funds?  How far away are we?  Do you have any comment?     Mr Chairman, I think the aggregates figures cover up a great diversity of  experience  But the Boston savings banks, for example, [in] ’73 and ’74, had net outflows in  every month for 18 consecutive months, while at the same time, the savings banks outside of  Boston were recording net inflows every month  I think there is such a thing as  disintermediation     Yes, it is     Yes, but they were comparing this October to last October, and they  expected some outflow for tax reasons  But by and large, they’re not terribly unhappy     That’s right     Well, we didn’t make it a very extensive survey--just trying to find out if  they were beginning to get alarmed yet or not  I thought it was a little surprising     How much room do we have?     I’m not sure, Henry, that’s the only interpretation the market places upon  our intervention  I think there’s also the simpler interpretation--that we in the Federal Reserve  think the market has gone too far, and we don’t think there’s a lot of risk involved in increasing  our level of intervention     Mr Chairman, I come out in the same place that, although I would find  alternative C acceptable, I think alternative B, in which we retain the present range for M1 and  adjust M2 and M3, is preferable  I think that we have a prima facie case over the past seven  months that perhaps we may be returning to the relationships between money and GNP that  existed prior to 1975, and if that is the case, I think that we may well be hard pressed to stay  within the 6-1/2 percent upper limit  So I think on balance that I would prefer that solution,  although, again, I wouldn’t object to move to alternative C  I don’t think that they’re all that  much different     Mr Chairman, in thinking back on past periods when we’ve had bulges in  monetary growth, if you look back historically in those events, say, last half of ’68, last half of  ’72--it has been typical that the staff has been projecting for the months immediately ahead of us  a marked slowing in monetary growth  And I think that the Committee has very often leaned  excessively on these projections and have been disappointed when the bulge kept going  So I  think it’s important that we get from Steve some probability evaluation of this slowdown in the  months immediately ahead of us     Well, I think the only point I was trying to make is to caution the  Committee that we shouldn’t necessarily assume that the bulge is over, and on the basis of  similar past experiences, where the Committee has acted on that assumption, we had made  wrong decisions     Well, Mr Chairman, I can’t buy the federal funds range specification of  alternative B  I think we have to make a decision today whether to stand on the status quo,  which I think is what alternative B is, or whether we ought to move toward more restraint  I  come out--     Except that, given the record of the past seven months, to constrain us to a  move of a 1/4 [point] I think is inadequate  I don’t think the evidence suggests that we’ve hit a  level of the funds rate which is conducive to getting the growth in the aggregates under control   So I would suggest a federal funds range of 6-1/2 to 7, with the Manager instructed to move to  6-3/4 next week  Now I grant you, this decision would be a lot easier if the economy were  booming     But I’ve been asking myself the question, can the economy--is it strong  enough to tolerate the prescription I’ve made?  I think it is, in part because I think the thrift  institutions are somewhat less sensitive to movements in short-term rates than they were in ’73  and ’69  But looking back to common earlier periods when we had these bulges, I find some  common characteristics, Mr Chairman  I’m taking advantage of my nine years sitting around  this table, and these are the common characteristics     First, the Committee never understood why the bulge happened  The staff did not forecast  it  However, the staff did forecast that in subsequent months the bulge would be eliminated; if  not eliminated, at least we’d return to a lower rate of growth  Second common characteristic was  the fact that the Committee agreed that the economy was not too strong, that we had a lot of  slack in the System  And in fact, looking back to ’68, the Committee was concerned about  overkill, as you recall, the 10 percent surcharge and so on  We have that common characteristic   We’re convinced that the economy is not too strong, certainly     Third, the Committee comforted itself during these bulge periods with the degree to which  it had moved interest rates  You know, I think Mr Partee has taken comfort in the move we’ve  made recently  We did move interest rates sharply in ’68, and we moved them sharply in ’72   You see, the problem was that we didn’t move them fast enough  The fourth characteristic of  these bulges is that, a year later, the Committee agrees that [our slow reaction to] the bulge was a  mistake, that we should have moved more promptly  Now this may conceivably be the  exception, that this bulge is one that we won’t regret, that this bulge may, as Steve suggests, be  over  I find those comforting thoughts, but on the basis of past experience, I don’t feel capable  of giving them a high degree of probability       10/17-18/77 - 59 -         So I think this Committee has to continue to move on interest rate policy until we reach a  level--when we have some actual evidence--that will bring rates of growth that we all believe are  excessive under control  And that’s why I think the federal funds prescription of B is inadequate  at the moment     I’m not abstaining  I’m willing to vote, but I wouldn’t vote for A or B     I just wanted to ask Tom if you had any feedback from the Solicitor  General as to his willingness to press our case     I don’t think you would call that a slight change in the directive, Henry  I  think that is a very major change     Mr Chairman, I just want to say I support your position entirely  I’m very  much concerned about changing the directive [in a way] that would eliminate the funds range,  because this would require that this Committee no longer have an interest rate policy, that we  have given the Manager carte blanche to move rates as he sees fit, and I don’t think that in fact  will ever be the case  I think that this Committee will always have an interest rate policy  We  have always constrained the Manager, and I think if we fail to publish those constraints, we are  really violating the order of the court  I think the directive committee ought to take this into  consideration       Mr Chairman, last month I dissented because I thought we had no  evidence that we had reached the level of the funds rate which would be consistent with  beginning to attain control of the aggregates  And I think the evidence of the last two weeks  shows that finally things are beginning to move our way  It’s obviously not conclusive, but I  think it’s sufficient to me to suggest that a stand-pat policy is appropriate this month, whereas I  didn’t think it was last month  So I think alternative B is acceptable to me, and I would buy your  and Mr Volcker’s downward shift of the lower limit of M1     I think that’s entirely appropriate  I move that that change be  incorporated     11/15/77 - 42 -           I’ve read it     Well, if you do violate that rule, that is precisely the time you’re going to  get a whopping market response     Except you’ll be telling the market a lot more than if you always had a  1 point spread  You’d be giving the market a lot more information when you move from a half  point to a full point spread     Well, that was really committee number three     Mr Chairman, my only concern about the report, which I thought was  very good, was the interest rate spread recommendation  I think it will prove to be very  advantageous to us to pick a spread and stay with it  Because from now on, if we are having  instantaneous release, every time you change the spread, you are going to be giving information  to the market that may be misinterpreted  I think we ought to make a decision as to how wide  the spread ought to be and stay with it rather than varying it from meeting to meeting, which I  think is going to cause a lot of trouble     While right now I think a 1/2 point spread is fine, I don’t think that, long term, we will be  able to sit through a 1/2 point spread without impairing our response time to changing  conditions  And it seems to me that the ideal time to establish a 1 percent spread is when you  don’t have expectations in the marketplace of a rapid change in interest rates to come  I don’t  think you have that now  And I think this is exactly the kind of time you want to get the market  used to a 1 percent spread  Because whatever we pick, I think we are going to find it hard to  move away from it       Yes, but we won’t be publishing anything about a zone of indifference, I  don’t think  This will be again, a sort of thing that we don’t vote on but--     I think [hearing from] New York would probably have been the best thing,  because New England is doing surprisingly well in this expansion, much better than the middle- Atlantic states  This is not the basis for my feeling that I’m modestly more optimistic than the  staff forecast  First, for the reason Henry Wallich mentioned, that the President’s tax reduction  program is not yet factored into the forecast  And that even if the implementation is deferred  until October, I think that once the dimensions of the program are made known, it will affect  expanding decisions--     But beyond that, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the numbers that have  come in the past month have been considerably stronger than I had anticipated  I think the  employment numbers, for example, plus the increase in the work week at the same time, was  surprisingly strong  We have seen a real turn in the basic commodity prices, and the indicators  in general are showing an acceleration--show the economy coming out of the little mini  inventory cycle that slowed us down temporarily  So I’m not looking for a boom period, but  I’m, as I say, modestly [more] optimistic than the staff       Well, Mr Chairman, things are going our way for a change, and I think  your specifications are quite acceptable  I would have a slight preference for Paul Volcker’s 2 to  8, but apart from that--     Mr Chairman, this is Frank Morris       Happy New Year to you  My question is Why was there a delay between  the President’s announcement last week and the implementation of what I thought was the meaning  of the announcement yesterday?       I’m here, Mr Chairman, Frank Morris     1/5/78 9      Mr Chairman, I find our intervention policy in the foreign exchange markets   very troublesome  On the one hand, I’m very much aware that there are limits to what we can do in  intervention  On the other hand, it seems to me that if we do decide to intervene--and if we’re  going to have an impact--we’ve got to intervene on a larger scale than we have in the past  I think  the purpose of intervention is not to soak up dollars, because obviously we can’t intervene on a  scale sufficient to soak up the volume of dollars around  The purpose of intervention is to instill  some element of psychological change in the marketplace and one doesn’t do that with intervention  on a very small scale  I think there is an analogy to the lender of last resort function  I think back  to the Penn Central crisis, for example, where we assured the banking system that we were going to     1/17/78             11  provide whatever money was needed to cool that situation off  We turned confidence around and  we ended up not putting in anywhere near as much as some of the experts thought we would have  to put in to turn the situation around  Our present course of intervention seems to me on a very  small scale       [We’re] building up some liabilities and we’re not producing, on the   confidence side, any really vigorous demonstration to the market that the United States thinks the  dollar has come to a level that the risk in this operation is pretty small  Now Chuck says, and quite  rightly, that he doesn’t know where the dollar should bottom [out] and neither do the people in the  marketplace  They don’t have any better basis than you do for making that judgment  [If we’re]  intervening at all, I think it ought to be done sparingly and on a large scale instead of frequently on  a small scale       Mr Chairman, we had a rather interesting discussion among my board   members as to why we are getting such a sluggish upturn in capital investment in this recovery   One of my business directors by the name of Miller raised this proposition, which he feels [is true  based on] his own firm and from talking to people and businessmen, that businessmen perceive  investments in this climate to be considerably riskier than investments in earlier periods  And they  have responded by shortening the payoff period required to authorize investments  He says the  common payoff period now for investment is 4 years, whereas in the early ’60s it was 8 years and  in the early ’70s, 6 years  I think if the business community is applying a criterion that severe--that  is, a payoff period of 4 years--it’s very clear that an awful lot of investment would not be able to  meet that sort of criterion  So they are only going ahead with that limited body of investment in  which they have confidence they can get it through in 4 years  Does that jibe with your  observations, Dave?       No      Mr Chairman, while I did not support the increase in the funds rate range, I   agree with you that [given] the situation [in the foreign exchange markets] we cannot permit rates,  in the short term, to decline  So I would support alternative B with the money market directive       Mr Chairman, this was the first time I was aware that the limitations we   place on the Manager are limitations on gross transactions  It seems to me that the procedure has  some question marks  The objective of the limitations is to assure the Committee that our net       2/28/78           4  exposure will not exceed a given amount  And it seems to me that the limitations for the future  ought to be placed in terms of a net change, not the gross transactions; they don=t carry nearly the  same meaning       Henry, you implied that we=re in a new period in which the “presence”   pronouncement of the joint Treasury-Federal  Reserve [statement] somehow no longer has the  weight it had before, and I=d like to understand why you feel that way       Mr Chairman, we are somewhat more pessimistic than the staff forecast    Whereas the staff has a 4-1/2 percent real rate of growth from the fourth quarter of ’77 to the fourth  quarter of ’78, we would be inclined to think more in terms of 4 percent  The housing sector is one  area where we differ  We think that the projected housing [starts] are still on the high side  It=s  difficult for us, if we accept the staff’s Bluebook numbers of an 8 percent federal funds rate in the  last half of this year, to have that associated with only a very modest rate of decline in housing as  the staff has projected  On the other hand, while we=re more pessimistic, we=re not entirely  unhappy about our projection in the sense that, given all of the inflationary forces and the position  of the dollar and so forth, perhaps a 4 percent real growth rate will not be a bad result for this year       Can you explain what that is?      Mr Chairman, I think I come out in exactly the same position as Governor   Partee      I don=t feel cowardly; I just want to exercise prudence      So I would accept your specifications with the Partee/Jackson proviso of   only cutting the range for M3 by 1/2 percentage point      It=s going to cause quite a stir in the market when we first start selling   agencies  It seems to me that it=s incumbent upon us at that time to explain to the market why we  are doing it because the stir on the first occasion is going to be pretty substantial, I would think       Well, Mr Chairman, I=m torn  When I first came and sat at this table--not   this one but the other one--we used to have directives that said “maintain prevailing money market  conditions”          2/28/78           48  SPEAKER(?)  That=s correct      I think you could make a case for doing that for the next three weeks  On the   other hand, it seems to me that if we are going to establish a range, we could make a good case for  having an asymmetrical range  If we get two months back to back of no M1 growth, this suggests  to me that it would make just as much sense to go back to 6-1/2 percent [on the funds rate rather]  than to advance it to 7 percent in case of various outcomes of monetary growth  I may be biased in  the sense that I didn=t vote for 6-3/4 to begin with, but it seems to me that if we respond on the  funds rate because of a very marked slowdown in monetary growth, we ought to be able to explain  that to the international financial [community] as not signifying any unwillingness to influence the  money supply  So it seems to me that alternative B, as written, would be quite satisfactory  As a  secondary measure, I would go back to our old 1968 [directive language] for this one occasion and  say we=re going to maintain prevailing money market conditions, period       Henry, it’s not clear to me why the daily limits should be established on a   gross basis in the first place      Well, it just occurred to me that perhaps we might be limiting the   discretionary action of the Manager  If we had this kind of limit on domestic open market  operations, it would have to be enormous  Is this $200 million satisfactory to the Manager?       I must say, Mr Chairman, that I don’t find the argument for a gross limit   very persuasive      Mr Chairman, I think it would be well for the Committee in this context to   keep a fairly open mind on the question of how strong the economy really is because I don’t think  we have a very good fix on the underlying strength of the economy  We’re looking at numbers,  some of which show great weakness, and we’re dismissing them--as we probably ought to--as a  function of the weather and the coal strike and so on  God knows, coming from Massachusetts,  where the whole state was shut down for a week, I know that there has been an impact   Nevertheless, I would hate to see us get into a fixed feeling of certainty that the second quarter is     3/21/78              28  going to be very strong  I think most of our historical experience shows that when we have  temporary interruptions of this nature, the previous underlying trend picks up after the effects of the  destruction are gone  But I can recall at least one incidence, in 1960, where we had a long steel  strike in the last half of 1959 and we had a general expectation that as soon as the strike was over  the economy was going to take off like a rocket  Business Week was featuring in its January 1st  [issue] “the sizzling ’60s”  The ’60s did sizzle, of course, but not in 1960  We came out of that  strike and had a 6- or 8-week rebound and then the economy went into a recession  I’m not  predicting this is going to happen  I don’t think it is going to happen, but we ought to keep it in  mind as a possibility  In looking at the very weak rates of growth in the aggregates, I think there’s  potentially a 10 percent chance, say, that they may be telling us that the underlying economy is a  lot weaker than we’re projecting         Is anybody looking at the Okun/Wallich idea of the tax-oriented incomes   policy?    SPEAKER(?)  Yes, they’re both looking at it!        Steve, I seem to recall that last July we began to get a weekly sample of   deposits at non-member banks  I was hopeful that this would mean that in the future the  benchmark revisions would be negligible  Is this evidence that the sample is not adequate?       You haven’t actually been using the sample?      Mr Chairman, I like your specifications--I think they’re very suitable for   the situation--with a money market directive  I say that because I am uncertain as to just how  strong the economy is  Therefore, I think we ought to essentially have a stand pat philosophy until  we can get a better fix on it  On the other hand, if we do get a very strong rate of growth in the  aggregates in April, I think this would be prima facie evidence that our projections of a strong  rebound are probably right and, therefore, I wouldn’t object to going up to 7 percent under those  conditions  And I wouldn’t mind cutting back the upper limit [of the range for M1 and M2]  somewhat as long as it didn’t mean that we would be moving up on a fairly small or moderate rate  of growth in the money supply in April       Mr Chairman, I support the subcommittee’s view of this  I think it is just  not a workable proposition  Let us say that we try to establish some ranges this morning for three  years  If we assume that the economy is going to continue to expand for three years, with the  present rate of wage trends, I don’t think we can come out with anything very much different than  the current ranges for the next three years  If we were to do that, it would have a negative public  image  If we were to do something different on the assumption that Mr Strauss is going to be able  to somehow get the rate of wage advance down and we produce expectations that we can’t deliver  on, I think the credibility of this institution could be seriously damaged  Given the present state of     4/18/78             12  our knowledge, I just don’t think that we can produce a meaningful 3-year range  And to try to do  it could damage our credibility       Mr Chairman, a month ago I argued that we ought to keep an open mind on  the outlook because the statistics were muddy   I think in the past four weeks we have gotten data  that are not muddy  It is very clear that we are coming out of the slowdown with a very strong  economy--stronger, I think, in the second quarter than the staff is projecting  If we have the sort of  slowdown in growth rates in the last half [that is projected]--or even Phil Coldwell’s growth  recession--that would be very constructive     I ought to emphasize my support for Henry Wallich’s position that we are getting close to  capacity  I follow a couple of series on the labor force which I think are good measures in the  sense that they reflect people who have good reason to believe they are permanently attached to the  labor force, and those are the unemployment rates for heads of households and the unemployment  rates for married men  Both of them are within 08 of their l973 peak levels  I think we should not  have as a target getting back to that degree of utilization of the labor force because at that degree of  labor force utilization our ability to stabilize the rate of inflation is going to be greatly impaired  So  we are talking here about a margin of play of maybe 05 percent  That would mean an objective  [for the unemployment rate] of maybe 57 percent or something like that overall  Given this fairly  narrow tolerance in which we have to operate, I think there is a real risk of the economy moving  too fast, and I think we ought to recognize that risk  It is not a projection, but the great vigor of the  last four weeks suggests to me that it is now a substantial risk       Paul, I would simply note that a year ago the staff projected a 3 percent  appreciation in the dollar       4/18/78             24     No, I support your recommendation       Mr Chairman, I think if you can get away with the procedure you used last  time of presenting your own personal view--and I like the idea of presenting a range rather than a  point projection--fine       If you find that you can’t, then I would be much less fearful than some of   the others around here of the consequences of presenting to the Congress a consensus point of view  and indicating that we have two members of the Committee who think it should be lower and three  who think it should be higher  I think Arthur Burns had this feeling that the Federal Reserve  always had to present a monolithic view to the Congress or all hell would break loose  I always  thought that was quite unrealistic  I know that in the past few years there have been occasions  when some of the Presidents were called up before Congress to testify  And the whole Board and  the Board’s staff--everybody around here--was absolutely terrified that they would say something  that would somehow get the Chairman in hot water  That didn’t happen  Even when we had a  renegade from St Louis in the group who said some things that made Mr Burns unhappy, nothing  really happened as a consequence of this        So I have always thought that this idea that we had to present a monolithic  view and that any differences--this whole idea of playing one against the other--is gravely  overdrawn  If it should happen that sometime the Congress invites all the members of the  Committee for, say, two or three days of hearings to hear everybody’s view on the economy, I can  guarantee it won’t happen very often       If they really push you hard, I don’t think you need to fear horrendous  consequences from displaying some diversity of viewpoints       Peter, I don’t think you ought to apologize to the Committee for failing to  keep the federal funds rate absolutely stable during the 4-week period  I think we would be better  off if we could design a little more instability into the funds rate--create a little more uncertainty in  the market as to precisely where policy is  It seems to me, even though it occurred against your  wishes, that the [result] was highly desirable       Well, Mr Chairman, I like the Partee specifications of 4 to 9 and 5-1/2 to  9-1/2  I like the idea of our moving in anticipation of the bulge  It is going to be for the first time,  as far as I know  I’m not quite as bold as Mr Partee  I think we ought to instruct the Manager to  establish a 6-7/8 percent rate by this Friday and to move beyond that only if he finds evidence that  [the aggregates] are about to exceed the established ranges       No       Could you elaborate, Scott, on your reluctance to buy marks in the open  market?  Most of the foreign exchange traders I’ve talked to about this have complained about the  lack of symmetry in Federal Reserve operations  I hear that if we’re going to be concerned about  disorderly markets on the downside that we shouldn’t be afraid to show our face when the market  is moving very strongly on the upside       But not in the market       Yes, let me ask the staff whether you have any consensus on the natural rate  of unemployment, given the current structure of the labor force       [Unintelligible] right       In this connection, Mr Chairman, could I follow up on this?  [Jim], have you  taken a look at this study by Wachter that just came out recently?  I haven’t had a chance to read it  myself but I understand it suggests that we are much closer to capacity than most of the numbers  generated earlier have suggested       Well, in a sense, Mr Chairman, my view is a little opposite from Phil’s as  far as the third quarter is concerned   I hope that the pattern that [the staff] set out in the Bluebook  happens, because I think it is pretty close to an optimum development over the next year or so  But  what I’m concerned about now is the possibility that the third quarter may be substantially stronger  than we are now contemplating       I think the second quarter is going along very strong       Well, I think the Board’s staff’s 9 percent is about right  What I’m  concerned about is the stronger third quarter and there are two pieces of evidence that led me to  wonder about this  I don’t have a conviction, but if we do get a much stronger third quarter than  we’re projecting, I think we’ll have real problems this summer  The first of the two pieces of  evidence is the surprising performance of automobile sales, which I think were probably above all  of our expectations, particularly because of the level of consumer debt  This does not jibe with the  kind of behavior on the part of the consumer that I had expected  The other thing is the amazing  strength in the stock market, which suggests to me that animal spirits in the Keynesian sense have  had a remarkable recovery       Well, it suggests to me that capital spending may well pick up much more  strongly than perhaps even the staff is projecting  Certainly, the stock market--I think you’d agree     5/16/78              15  with me, Bill--does influence the behavior of businessmen and it reflects the thinking of  businessmen  And it has a wealth effect on consumer spending  So if this remarkable performance  were to continue for a while, I think it could be an independent source of strength in capital goods  and in consumer spending  I hope that doesn’t happen because I think two very strong quarters  back-to-back could put us in a very difficult position  So I hope you’re right about the third  quarter       Steve, could you elaborate a bit more than you did in the Bluebook on the  reasons for the big bulge in the last published data and [give us] whatever information you have as  to how permanent that bulge is likely to be?       Mr Chairman, I support your position for a reason that you didn’t mention       Well, I think that this is a reasonably important one  We did get a jump on  the problem last month and it’s the first time that I have sat around this table that this Committee  has ever acted in anticipation of a bulge in the money supply and I think that’s a great step forward  But we also know from a study of history that the monetary aggregates react with a lag to a change  in interest rate policy by the central bank, so that we have not yet seen the full effect of the move  that we’ve already made and the impact that the current level of rates is having  I don’t think we  should ignore that fact  One little piece of evidence the New England mutual savings banks  outside of Boston--and their deposit flows are less sensitive to interest rates than those of the  Boston savings banks--had a net outflow in the month of April       Yes, but still it is significant nonetheless  On the other hand, Mr Chairman,  while I can accept Steve’s projection of 9 percent for M1 for the second quarter, since I can  average that [with] the first quarter and come out with 6-1/2, I do think that we’ve got to structure  ourselves so that we don’t exceed that number  Therefore, it seems to me that we should do this   First, I like the funds rate of alternative A, moving to 7-3/8--we’re almost there now  But I would  scale down the range for M1 to 3 to 7 because an 8-1/2 upper limit for that range would mean that  if the staff projection for May is correct it could accommodate a 10-1/2 percent increase in June,  which I think is too high  Similarly, on M2, if the staff projection is correct, the 9 percent  May-June average would accommodate roughly a 12 percent rise in M2 in June  And it seems to  me that we simply can’t [accept that]; that’s beyond the pale  Therefore, those ranges ought to be  revised downward to something like 3 to 7 and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, which would assure that we stay  within the current projections for the second quarter  And to do so I would give the Manager full  authority to move up to 7-3/4 percent if necessary--if the evidence coming in suggests that June is  busting out all over, as the song goes       That’s true       I think this is an improvement in language, but I don’t think it necessarily  will get you out of the PR problem that these 2-month ranges have caused--and it has been [going  on] for a long time  I think there’s a lot to be said for the Committee moving away from this  2-month structure, and I want to compliment the Philadelphia Fed for the research it has done in  this area  It seems to me that this is the question the Committee fundamentally ought to address  itself to pretty soon, because I don’t think there is any way we can describe these 2-month ranges  without the press and the Congress describing them as targets--I don’t care what we call them       Which is the appropriate one?       There=s another problem, Mr Chairman, and that is that there is a cyclical  variation in the relationship of M1 to M2 and our present range structure reflects the kind of  relationship that you typically get in an easier money period  As money tightens, the rates of  growth of M1 and M2 tend to come together and we have not recognized this, I think, in the  present structure  It seems to me that we ought to  That=s another issue, which works in the  opposite direction of this one       Well, Mr Chairman, a month ago I was concerned that the third quarter was  going to come in a lot stronger than the staff had projected  In particular, I thought that was a  possibility because I feared that a surge of investment might be accompanying the changed thinking  that was then evident in Wall Street  And I found my reaction a little “too bad” in the sense that  quite clearly we don=t have room in the economy for a capital goods boom  Even though in the long  run that is exactly what we have to have, there is no room in the system at the moment to  accommodate it  I say I feared a strong third quarter because I think that would have put us in an  extremely difficult situation, with strong [rates] of growth in the aggregates in the second quarter   But the evidence coming in over the past month, although it apparently hasn=t changed Chuck=s  mind, has changed mine The May survey of plant and equipment showed a surprisingly poor  performance and it is confirmed, I think, with the figures on capital appropriations and new orders  for plant and equipment  The figure that I thought might be coming in just isn=t there      We have a new factor in this situation because the Proposition 13 effect, which we can=t  measure very well, quite clearly is going to reduce state and local spending in California but its  influences are being felt as far east as Massachusetts where we have under way a momentum for a     6/20/78                23  referendum to place a limitation on the size of state government expenditures  It appears to be  having a fairly general sobering effect on plans for state and local spending in general      If you look around the economy to find areas where we might get this speculative enthusiasm,  the consumer sector is the only one that you can really hang your hat on  Investment has not come  through  Government spending--Federal and state and local--is not going to provide much net  stimulus  And it appears that housing has already peaked  But to hang your hat on the consumer  sector--I agree with the staff on this--is pretty hazardous in light of the fact that in recent months we  have seen the consumer finance more of his spending by credit than at any time in our history  Both  the ratio of consumer credit to current expenditures and the growth of consumer expenditures are at  all-time highs  The ratio of household debt to disposable income is at an all-time high  And Mark, I  don=t think the average consumer thinks an awful lot about real interest rates  When he looks at a 10  percent mortgage, he says  How much of a down payment is this going to mean for me?  It may turn  out to be a great investment, but can my cash flow finance this situation?  And with his debt already  at an historic peak, the amount of further expansion in consumer debt that would be required to have  the consumer continue to lead the economy ahead just seems to me improbable      So in looking at the staff projections, I think I=d be inclined to be a little more pessimistic on  real growth and a little more optimistic on the price side  That’s because if we do get this  deceleration of real growth that we=re talking about, historically a deceleration of growth rates has  been accompanied by at least some deceleration of prices as well   Geoffrey Moore had a paper in  our conference along these lines--Ted, you have it and I think that might be worth passing out to  everyone  Maybe I=ll send it to all the members of the Committee because it demonstrated, I thought  rather convincingly, the relationships between the rate of growth in the economy and the rate of  inflation, and not just the level that the economy is at  So I would expect that we=d be easing back to  the 6 percent rate of inflation that we had seen earlier  But this means also that my unemployment  rate figure would probably be higher than the staff has projected       Yes       Well, I don=t know what the average of the four quarters [would be], but I  think we will be moving back to a 6 percent inflation rate over time       But the real question in my mind is whether we can avoid a recession in 1979   That I think is the key       Well, I’d say it would probably be somewhat above 6 percent  But I think  we=re going to have a very difficult job, even with a lot of luck, engineering things so that we can  avoid a recession in 1979  Now, I think Larry called our attention to this projected deceleration in  monetary growth rates, which comes automatically from Steve=s arithmetic  Clearly, if you look at  that and you say we=re going to decelerate M1 growth down to the 2 to 2-1/2 percent level and  decelerate M2 growth down to the 6 to 6-1/2 percent level, then on the basis of past history, you=d  have to project that we=d be moving into a recession by the second quarter of ’79       Sure  So it seems to me that the fundamental issue is not what the growth rate  is going to be in ’79, but whether policies can be geared to avoid nosing into a recession in say, the  second quarter  Now, you might argue perhaps that a mild recession--if it could be kept mild  enough--might not be all that bad  That=s off the record, I assume  But on the other hand, the  economy is extremely illiquid  The corporate sector has really not gone far in building up its  liquidity  The consumer sector, as I said earlier, is at an all-time historic debt position  As for the  banking system, while it has worked out a lot of its problems, if we moved into another recession in  ’79, I can tell you that I think I=d be spending more time on bank supervision than I am now  So  that=s the thing that concerns me  I think we may be building a trap for ourselves in the way we’ve  presented our long-term ranges in terms of trying to juggle two measures--M1 and M2--that do not  move in a constant way over the business cycle  So I think your idea, Mr Chairman, of dropping  M1 this time is a very good one  And I think we ought to drop it for all times       But at least you can tie it to this automatic transfer effect; that=s a good  rationale for departing from it  And maybe you could add M3, since M2 and M3 do move together  in a reasonably predictable way and we=d be out from under M1 as a guideline  I think that would be  a great step forward and save a lot of trouble in the future       The problem is we=re supporting two women and they=re running off in  different directions     SPEAKER(?)  It=s very expensive       I think we=re all monogamous at heart       Mr Chairman, I guess I=m in a minority of one so far  Since I now feel that  the third quarter is going to show the slowdown that the staff has been projecting for some time, I=m  a little less hawkish on monetary policy than I would otherwise have been  So I would go for the  alternative A funds range of 7-1/4 to 7-3/4 percent, with a money market directive, and I would stay  at 7-1/2 until such time as we get confirmation that the July aggregates are in fact coming in strong  I=d use a range of 5 to 9, which means that if we get another 9 percent growth in M1 in July we  would move to 7-3/4  At the current position of the economy, it seems to me that that is a sufficient  move       Mr Chairman, I think all this suggests that we=re going to continue to have  trouble until we get rid of the 2-month range as an operating device       The problem, Larry, is that the 2-month range is largely dictated by what  happened in the first month  It has nothing to do with the long-term ranges     SPEAKER(?)  It=s already finished       What about the security of the wire?       No, I=m talking about the daily FOMC wire       Yes       And presumably this would permit us to organize a conference call in less  than two hours, if we had these dedicated lines?       Well, that would be a big plus just by itself       All right, sir  Jim, the problem I have with this whole scenario is that we are  projecting moderate growth rates through 1981 under conditions of very severe financial strain  without generating a recession, all of which seems to me very improbable  It seems to me that the  more probable case would be a recession beginning sometime in l979 or at the latest l980-- producing quite a different array of results than this  I think this [forecast] is sort of a test tube  product, but it doesn’t conform to the probabilities as I see them       Well, Mr Chairman I think we are headed for a recession in l979  I don’t  know whether it is going to start in the first half or the second half, so I have a range for real GNP  of 1-1/2 to 3 percent  The 1-1/2, of course, will be if the recession starts in the first quarter   Therefore, I am more optimistic on prices in connection with this scenario since I have noticed in  recent years a very coincident behavior between the rate of real growth in the economy and the rate  of change in prices, without much of a lag  So I would expect something like 6 to 6-1/2 on prices  in that kind of situation and obviously the unemployment rate above 6 percent by the second  quarter of the year       Well, I think we are building up financial pressures in the system       Well, Mr Chairman, I would like to first comment on the Bluebook page  IV-3, which estimates the impact of automatic transfers on M1  The text states that this is based on  the l976 experience with NOW accounts in New England  The problem with that rationale is that  the NOW account began in New England in the summer of l972  It seems to me that the l973 or     7/18/78              23  l972-74 experience with NOW accounts is much more relevant for the initial period than the  summer of l976 experience because the NOW experience taught us two things  The first was that  the public changes its habits very slowly  The savings banks in Massachusetts and New Hampshire  were advertising vigorously during the first two years of NOW accounts and the rate of growth of  NOW accounts during that period was very slow  It took a lot of hearsay and people talking to  each other, in addition to advertising, to really get the thing moving     So I think these estimates of the impact of automatic transfers on the growth of M1 are  greatly exaggerated  I think that in the first year the impact is going to be very small--not only  because the public changes its habits slowly but also because banks are reluctant to adopt  expensive innovations unless they are forced to do so by competitive pressures  In the case of the  NOW account, we had the competitive pressure of the thrift institutions offering this very attractive  instrument, which drove the banks into also offering it  If we had had a situation where the banks  had been offered NOW account powers but not the thrifts, I think the growth of the NOW account  would have been exceedingly slow because the banks would have been reluctant to push a product  that they knew was going to cost them a lot of money      Now, in the case of the automatic transfer, both of these factors--the fact that the public does  not change their habits very quickly and the reluctance of the banks to adopt expensive innovations  unless forced into it--are going to work very strongly in the first year or two because in most states  the thrifts will not be able to offer a competing instrument  In the State of New York they will and  in a few other states where [thrifts] have demand deposit powers  But by and large around the  country the S&Ls and the savings banks are not going to be able to offer a competing product, and  the development of the automatic transfer is going to be based on inter-commercial bank  competition generating pressures for change  So I think we should not have the hope that the  automatic transfer is going to restore the kind of the relationship between M1 and M2 that we  would like to see happen in the year ahead  I don’t think that is going to happen      I sent out a note indicating my feeling that we ought to nonetheless take the advent of  automatic transfers as a public rationale for doing something that we ought to do anyway, and that  is to move to a single M2 target with M1 and M3 given as memorandum items  By that I mean that  we’d express the target in terms of M2 and say in our records that associated with it we would  expect x rate of growth for M1 and y rate of growth for [M3]  I think there are important reasons  for making this change  First,--       They should have  First, I think the dynamics of the changes in the  payments mechanism are going to force us sooner or later to move to a broader concept of money   We already have in the case of New England some $2-1/2 billion of transactions accounts that are  not in M1  Forty percent of these are not in M2  If what has been going on in New England for  several years is going to move eventually to the rest of the country, which I think will happen, I  think we are going to have to move to broader and broader concepts of money  I would even  propose M3 now if it were operationally feasible  But since it is not, I think we ought to leave the  transition for the moment to M2  So, sooner or later we are going to be pulled into the direction of  broader measures of money as being the most relevant      7/18/78              24     Secondly, the problem that we’ve found with having two targets is that their relationship  varies over the business cycle  That is, in easy money periods you would expect the structure of  [comparatively] high M2 relative to M1, and in tight money periods you would expect the growth  rates to converge  That being the case, if we are going to keep two targets, we should be moving  toward raising the M1 range relative to M2  But, politically, that is simply not a feasible thing to  do  I think any upward revision in the M1 range would create a substantial stir in the markets  It  seems to me that we have a situation reasonably well attuned to making a shift that I think we are  going to have to make ultimately anyway toward a single broader [measure of money]       I would keep the present range of 6-1/2 to 9       I would use higher levels for M1 than are given in the Bluebook with  automated transfers since I don’t think they are going to have that big of an impact  I would use the  “without” figures as a basis for the range in M2       The “without”       I would say "We would expect…"       I would be a little leery about changing the M1 range, even though I don’t  think--       4 to 6-1/2 is reasonable       I think I’d be inclined to leave all the numbers the same and simply change  the emphasis       Mr Chairman, I would like to support a federal funds range of 7-1/2 to 8  percent  I would stay at 7-3/4 until the aggregates triggered a move to 8 percent, but I would lower  the triggering points to 3 to 7 for M1 and 5 to 9 for M2       It would be triggered if it came in over the projections  The projections are  [for M1 growth of] about 7 percent       My feeling frankly, Mr Chairman, is that we can get by for a while without  the participation of the Presidents but that we ought to seek to develop a secure communication  system, which we could use for a lot of other things as well       Mr Chairman, when we look for this new system, I think we are in dire need  of a greatly improved hard copy transmission system as well     7/18/78              59       We've got a developing shortage of labor in Connecticut to make the  engines for those airplanes       Mr Chairman, I think we were the most pessimistic last month on the  outlook       And we still retain that position  The evidence of the past month of a  leveling off of retail sales, and very poor new orders figures--particularly for capital goods, which I  thought were very disappointing--lead us to still think the staff projections are too optimistic as far  as real growth is concerned  We would look for 1-1/2 to 2 percent real growth during the period  you suggested       I think the last half of this year is going to be somewhat less strong than the  Board's staff is projecting  And we're not looking for much, if any, growth at all in the first half of  next year       The main areas of difference, I think are in consumer durable goods and  housing and also state and local government  On the other hand, I'm more optimistic on prices as a  consequence of this more sluggish economy  The fact is that I've noted a very tight correlation in  the past few years between the rate of growth in the economy and the rate of change in prices,  excluding things not related to the rate of growth in the economy like food and so on  So I would     8/15/78             16  look for a deflator in the range of 6 to 6-1/2 percent--which I think is the lowest around here--and  an unemployment rate of 6-1/4 to 6-1/2       Mr Chairman, I think the Committee is coming out just about right; a  7-3/4 to 8-1/4 range seems right  I think we can't afford another bulge in the aggregates in  September, so I would agree that the ranges ought to be moved down a bit--4 to 8 and 6 to 10 I  think are about right  And the discount rate, because of its high visibility and low cost, ought to be  part of the international package       Yes       Mr Chairman, I support the operation  I think [of] the United States  currency as a world currency, and we have the responsibility of seeing--to the extent that we can-- that the foreign exchange markets operate in a rational way  But I agree with Phil Coldwell that if  we're going to do this, it ought to be done on a sufficiently large scale to establish credibility in the  marketplace  I think what happened last December and early January, when the United States  government came out with an announcement by the President, Secretary of the Treasury, and the  Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board that we were going to intervene--and then we failed to  operate on anything except a very small scale--was a net loss of yardage in the operation  I think if     8/15/78             37  we're going to do it, we have to be prepared to do it on a sufficient scale to impress the market that  we are prepared to be a force in the marketplace       Well, Mr Chairman we're still much more pessimistic than the staff and   we think that [is supported by] some of the numbers that have come in over the past month  [I’d  note] the surprising weakness in new orders for durable goods, which was broadly diffused across  all types of orders--it was not a phenomenon of transportation equipment in particular--and the very  disappointing performance in the capital goods sector, including the weakness in new orders plus  the sharp decline in capital appropriations, which have a long lead time  So we're still very much  on the pessimistic side, looking for 1-1/2 to 2 percent real growth and, for that reason, a little less  inflation than the Board staff has projected       Mr Chairman, at least on the surface it would appear that our decision this   month is more difficult than last month because on the one hand we have more evidence that the  economy is moving into a period of slower growth but this evidence is accompanied by another  bulge in the growth rates of the monetary aggregates  A month ago I thought we were in a  decelerating phase of monetary growth and it now appears that we're in an accelerating phase   With August and September we'll be publishing under the new numbers close to 10 percent for  those two months [for M1] and a little over 11 percent for M2  The question is  Which of these  targets do we move toward?  It seems to me that the evidence suggests that at this juncture we  ought to be moving toward dealing with the bulge in the aggregates--toward assuring ourselves that  we don't extend this bulge through October  I'm reassured only very slightly by the 6 percent M1  projection for October since the reliability of those projections is so extremely low  I'd hate seeing  another 9, 10, or 11 percent added to what we have      I take this position because I've been looking at the issue of how severely monetary policy   is impacting the expansion at this point in time  And my conclusion is that the impact is not a very  severe one  We have, at a time when the economy is close to full employment, the remarkable  phenomenon of inflows into thrift institutions at double digit rates, which I think is unique in the  monetary history of recent years  We have a commercial banking system that I don't think is under  any substantial pressure  If you look at the change in portfolios at commercial banks, you again  find something strange for a period when the economy is close to full employment  And that is that  the commercial banking system has been increasing security holdings over the past three months,  including holdings of municipal bonds, which again is not characteristic of the behavior of a  banking system that's under any kind of pressure  Furthermore, we're seeing another interesting  phenomenon in that over the past couple of months as we have pushed short-term rates up, long-  term rates have come down      All this suggests to me that we have more room to act on the aggregates without having   traumatic effects on the real economy  So I would propose a range of 8-1/4 to 9 on the funds rate,  moving the target immediately to 8-5/8 and with ranges for M1 of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 and M2 of 6 to 10  Also, Mr Chairman, I would not be too worried about a massive impact of automatic transfers on  M1 during the next year  I don't think it's going to happen  The New England experience with the  NOW account shows that people don't change their deposit habits very readily even when they're  offered a remarkably good deal, as they were offered in New England with a no-service-charge  NOW account  The banks apparently are planning to price this new service of automatic transfers  fairly expensively  If they stick to this, I think automatic transfers are going to kick off with  something like the gait of a large turtle       I think the German proposal is very reasonable, Mr Chairman  The  existing arrangements were a heritage of the Bretton Woods days, and we ought to recognize that  things have changed a lot since then       Based on experience that didn't have the kinds of inflation rates that we are  now failing to enjoy       Mr Chairman, the numbers have come in a little stronger in the past month  than I'd expected  At the same time, we're shifting our policy period from the second quarter to the  third quarter and this sort of offsets things  But we still come out much more pessimistic than the  staff, with something like 1-1/2 to 2 percent real growth  In other words, I think that the chances of  avoiding at least a mild recession in '79 are not too good  But we are also looking for some  deceleration in inflation to about 6-1/2 percent and an unemployment rate of about 6-1/2 percent       Chuck, would you elaborate on what you meant by the sliding base?       I agree with Phil  I wish Steve did have the courage to come out [with a  recommendation] to eliminate M1  The idea that it's a better economic indicator I just don't think  stands up, at least in the statistical analysis  That analysis shows that since 1966, M2 correlates  better to GNP than M1  So it’s not clear to me in what sense M1 is a better indicator  Also I think  that a proliferation of indicators is not a healthy development for this Committee  I look back over  the past couple of years and we comforted ourselves in ’77 that while M2 was strong, M1 was well  within our guideline  And we comforted ourselves this year that while M1 was strong, M2 has  been within the guideline  If you look at both years combined, they are both way outside the  guideline  I question whether a proliferation of indicators is leading us in the right direction       I think we need some market input to this new concept of M1+  One  possibility is that there are other things that might be included--for example, overnight RPs  I  would hate to see us put M1+ in a directive until we've had some feedback from the market and  from the academic world as to whether it is a reasonable alternative  Are we ready to give it any  kind of official sanction?        I would opt for a federal funds range of 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 and move  immediately to 9  I think we've got to keep probing until we find the level of rates that is going to  stabilize the money supply  I also feel, given the degree of monetary restraint that now requires,  that it would be associated with higher levels of interest rates than we've seen in prior cycles  I  think that it would be safe, despite Steve's advice, to use a single M2 guideline of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2  percent       We respond by actions and that's--       There's no question if the President gets the wage rate down to 7 percent,  then that makes it a hell of a lot easier for us       Have they established an amount on that?       Mr Chairman, I think the critical assumption that underlies the projections  is a rather dubious one, and that is that we will be able to have a reasonable degree of control over  the money supply over the projection period at the current level of the federal funds rate  We've  had a couple of weeks--say, a month and a half now--of rather pleasant readings on the aggregates   But I don't think we can conclude from that that the current level of the federal funds rate is going  to do the job  Look at the rate of growth of bank credit in the past couple of weeks  It seems to me  that we have a new surge of a growing demand for money  Am I interpreting these numbers  wrong?  I would like for Steve to comment on that       And they never have  I'm sitting here wondering why this might be and it  occurred to me that a possible explanation is that we may have a smaller ratio of expert economists  to businessmen in the population       The question is how long could you accommodate them       Well, Mr Chairman, we've been more pessimistic than the staff for a long  time and we're happy to see them approaching [our view] gradually  I think, as Nancy does, that a  recession is inevitable  I think the questions--the uncertainty elements--are how big it is going to  be and when it will start  The one missing piece of information that I have is what the Federal  Open Market Committee is going to do  I think we're going to be challenged quite severely in the  next few months by a very strong upsurge in demand for money  Again, I just base this on what  has been going on in bank lending very recently  We haven't had a very restrictive policy until the  last few months  Sure, interest rates have gone up, but we haven't had a period in which money has  not been available for mortgages for the guy who wants to buy a house, for consumer credit, or for  the business community  We are now entering that phase and I think we're going to see an upsurge  in demand for money and the question is  Will this Committee accommodate this upturn over the  next few months?  [In that] case the recession would be put off one or two more quarters, but it  would be bigger when we got there  Or are we going to refuse to accommodate it, in which case  the recession would come sooner and be milder  My own feeling is that the country would be  better off if we take a posture of not accommodating an increase in the demand for money and have  a mild recession beginning in the second quarter  That would strengthen the President's voluntary     11/21/78              19  program rather than undermine it, which I think a policy of accommodation would do  And then  we’d get the economy moving up again by the fourth quarter of next year      There are some uncertainties here, Mr Chairman, reflected in my rather wide range of  numbers       Well, I think, characteristically, as you enter the later stages of a boom,  particularly an inflationary boom, you get a rise in demand for money       You don't get a rise in the demand for money?       Well, I think they are very closely linked  I think to the extent that you  control the aggregates by pushing interest rates up, you--        Well, I think they will soon be reflected in the monetary aggregates in  time That's going to be our problem in the next three months, as I see it      So I would say, Mr Chairman, 1 to 2 percent real growth, 6-1/2 to 7 percent inflation and  6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent on the unemployment rate       I come out, Mr Chairman, very close to Henry Wallich's formula of 9-3/4  to 10-1/4 on the funds rate, with the Manager instructed to stay at 9-3/4 unless we have reached the  upper limit [on the aggregates]  I think the Manager ought to have at least a half point to operate  with  But the only area where I diverge from Henry is that I think we ought to eliminate the M1  and M1+ figures from our objectives because I don't think we can interpret either one of these  numbers I would prefer simply to see a single range for M2 of 6 to 9 percent       I think the word “supporting” doesn't go very well with a federal funds  range of 1/4 point       Mr Chairman, I don’t think we understand what is really going on in the  economy       I think it’s because we haven’t had enough experience judging the reaction  of both the consumer and the investor to an economy with a high rate of inflation       Quite clearly, the numbers coming in over the past month are vastly  stronger than I had expected and I think stronger than any of us had expected  And I think it’s  quite possible that the fourth quarter will be even stronger than the staff has projected and perhaps  the first quarter as well  At the same time, we are getting these conflicting signals between what is  going on in the real economy and the behavior of the aggregates  I think it’s quite clear that we are  not for long going to have a very exceptionally strong economy coupled with very weak growth in  the aggregates  One of these two things has to come to an end, and I don’t think we are sure which  one is going to give at this moment      This suggests to me that this is an extremely poor time for the Committee to be planning  not to meet for seven weeks, unless we are prepared to give the Manager a lot of room on the fed  funds rate to respond to changes in the aggregates  I think it would be very poor management on  our part to leave for seven weeks anything like the kind of directive we gave the Manager last  month  It seems to me most probable that we are going to face a bulge in the aggregates in the next  three months, and I suspect it will be bigger than the bulge that Steve and his group has given us in  their projections  I think both domestic and international considerations require us to move pretty  promptly against the bulge in the aggregates  I think the exchange markets would certainly be  carefully observing any resurgence in the rate of growth in the US money supply  I realize that     12/19/78          12    suggesting that we meet again in three weeks will place a big burden on the staff and I simply  suggest that they respond by giving us not the full Greenbook-Bluebook treatment but some simple  updating  But I think we are in a too unstable situation to consider not meeting again until  February 6th       Would the loss be the Treasury’s?       Would it be chargeable to the budget or would it be chargeable to the  Exchange Stabilization Fund?       It’s one of the few real virtues of Humphrey-Hawkins        I want to support John Balles  I think this recommendation represents a  big step forward  I think it will not only improve our performance and prospective monetary policy  by adding a longer period for the short-term objective, but I think it will also make communications  to the public much easier to understand         For example, at the current meeting, the 6 to 10 on M2 in the directive for  the 2-month period means [something] like 6 to 7-1/2 on the 3-month period  I submit that the  latter will be much [easier] for the public to understand and will give us a better perspective of  what we are doing than the 6 to 10  So I really strongly believe that’s the best thing in the whole  report        Yes        I beg to differ on that point  And the reason is this  In the 3-month period  you have three pieces of information plus one guess  That is, you have the one month that’s  known, the second month where we have a lot of information, and then the third month, which is  sheer guess work and for which the information value is extremely low  Now, I submit that is  better than having one month for which we have some information  For example, we don’t know  much information about December; we have a little information on it but our December projections  could be way off        I think the difference is that the longer the short-run guideline and the more  months of information we have in that guideline, the more likely the Committee is to make up for  any past undershoots or overshoots  And that I think is--       Mr Chairman, I have a very different perception  of the economy than the staff has presented to us I would like to  think we could fine-tune the economy as nicely as our projection But  it seems to me that in the past month we have seen a very unusual  combination of numbers We've seen indicators not only in December  but continuing in January that suggest the economy is coming on very  strong At the same time we have had an unusual deceleration in the  growth of the monetary aggregates and bank credit And the latest  unusual phenomenon to add to these other two is that we have seen,  despite a steady federal funds rate, a decline in short-term money  rates Now, this combination of a very strong economy, very weak  monetary growth, and a decline in short-term money rates is rare I  looked back in history to find out when we usually get this  combination, and I find that it typically occurs in months immediately  preceding a business cycle peak I think the closest parallel was  January, 1960 ,  when the economy was charging ahead following the  resumption of steel production Everybody was talking about the  sizzling ' 6 0 s   Both monetary and fiscal policy were moving toward  restraint And to me the first indicator of the 1960 recession was  the surprising weakness in short-term money rates in January of that  year  cycle peak in the second quarter and a mild recession in the last half  of this year   the demand for money is not going to happen So, Mark, I don't think  you have to worry too much about that 2 percent I was concerned,  too, when I looked at the Bluebook I think we should lower the  ranges modestly But the Bluebook reductions looked awfully big to  me, given my expectations But Steve has saved the day, after writing  the Bluebook, by immediately disavowing it as imprudent I think the  numbers that Steve--   So I have concluded that the most probable expectation is a   Now, in that environment, I think the projected decline in    Yes I think the numbers he came up with  [today] are very prudent; I would like to see a widening of the M 2  and  M3 ranges to 5-1/2 to 8-1/2  percent and 6-1/2  to 9-1/2 percent but  [otherwise] I think his suggested ranges are very appropriate     2/6/79 -23-    I think that's more of a description of how the  Committee feels about all of these ranges because it seems to me that  if we have a telephone meeting it will take something really  tremendous to trigger us off the 10 percent [funds rate] in the next  few weeks    Well, all this not very important if we're going  to have a consultation before we move    Mr Chairman, I think we're facing an emerging  conflict between the domestic and international requirements of  monetary policy  quite clearly, we're moving into a period where they are going to be  in conflict, because I think we're approaching a cyclical peak in the  economy some time around midyear for the reasons cited by Chuck  Partee I would simply add one more point In the month of January,  when we had no increase in industrial production, we had a whopping  increase in inventories, which suggests that final demand was  extremely weak Now, this picture of an approaching cyclical peak is  not conclusive and, of course, it won't be conclusive until the peak  is three or four months behind us And that is why monetary policy  has always lagged in the past If we're waiting f o r  conclusive  evidence, we'll inevitably lag again But if we change policy now in  the face of inconclusive evidence, it means that we have to be  prepared to shift again if it appears that the economy is somehow  getting a second wind, which I think is unlikely but possible In my  view, we don't know much about the demand for money; we used to think  we did a few years back But we do know something about the supply of  money And one thing we know is that we're not going to get much of a  supply if bank reserves don't grow, and they haven't grown for the  past six months If it's our objective to avoid a recession, I think  we have to move today; I don't think we can wait for another month  One thing I've found around this table is that one can always make an  impressive case for waiting for another month But the evidence  suggests to me that the time to move is now I think the issue is  whether we seriously are concerned about avoiding a recession or not  Paul, I think, is resigned to a recession; I think the international  constraint may be more of a factor in his thinking than he let on   In the past year they've been nicely in harmony but,   VICE C H A I W  VOLCKER Inflation is a factor in my thinking    But the issue is whether we will be better off  in 1980 with a 7 percent unemployment rate or an 8 percent  unemployment rate I'm inclined to believe that in the long run we  will be better off with a 7 percent unemployment rate simply because  that is likely to be more conducive to the maintenance of the kind of  conservative fiscal policies that are now being talked about in the  Congress I'm a little concerned--as I was about Nancy's idea of  waiting a month--about John Balles's phrase "slight tilt," which  implies a move to 9-7/8 percent or something like that [on the funds  rate] It seems to me that if we're going to move, we're going to get  some flack no matter how much we move We're going to get just as  much flack moving to 9-7/8 as we would to 9-1/2 percent     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -22-    I think we ought to move at least to 9-1/2  percent and we ought to move now    Tomorrow would be all right     3/20/79 -26-    Mr Chairman, as I said earlier, I would move to  9-l/2 percent on the funds rate When that has been recognized in the  marketplace, I think the Chairman ought to hold a press conference and  explain this unprecedented development of the Fed moving the funds  rate down before we're actually in a recession    We might actually be in it, yes    But it would be an unprecedented move and I  think we would have to explain to the market that with a 10 percent  funds rate, we've had no increase in bank reserves in six months and,  therefore, no increase in the money supply We need to explain that  although our concern about inflation has not diminished, we also have  concerns about the economy and want to keep it on a slow growth path  rather than send it into a recession We should note that if our  concerns about the economy should change--if it turns out that the  current trend toward a softening in the economy tends to be a short-  term phenomenon--we will be quite prepared to move the funds rate back  up to 10 percent At least we'd have a head start on the job that I  think we're going to have to do later on anyway    Mr Chairman, I still believe that the economy is in a peaking  process and I believe that the aggregates have to be viewed in the light of what has been going on in  the past six months Even with this bulge, M2 has only grown at a 4 percent rate in the past six  months, so at the moment I would not make any change If this strength should be sustained into  May then I think we would have to move against it But at the moment I would do nothing    Okay    Mr Chairman, I just want to say that I am  pleased that Jim had such a good record last year because I have a  very strong feeling that his record is not going to be as good in the  next twelve months It seems to me that we have--    It wasn't so good in the last twelve months It  seems to me that we have a classic cyclical decline; the [evidence] is  almost overwhelming And I think the latest piece of evidence that  you cited--that there was a [big] decline in durable goods orders is  the last straw Now, the staff projection does assume--as it has all  along--a 6 percent rate of growth in M1 adjusted for ATS, and we have  not gotten that for seven months    Yes, there was one month But that was  generated by the IRS and not the FRB So I think we have not created  the financial climate that you've been predicting Would you want to  comment on that?    Mr Chairman, as I indicated earlier, I think we  are close to a cyclical peak Conceivably, it may already be behind  us, with weakness in consumption and housing being covered up  temporarily by inventory accumulation, the classic form of a peak I  don't think we should casually assume that the recession is going to  be very mild We talk about the lack of imbalances in the economy  Very often we don't recognize the imbalances until sometime into a  recession For example, in late '13, I think no one forecast as  severe a recession as we had in '74-'75 If we are seeking a soft  landing, then I think we've got to move monetary policy now in a less  restrictive direction If we're going to recognize the lags of  monetary policy, we have to do what we've never done before and that  is to move before the evidence is overwhelming that we are in a  recession Now, this would take some explaining to the public because  it would represent a radical departure from the past practice of  always overstaying a policy of either ease or restraint That has  been the record of the past 15 years and I would hope that in this go-  around we could break out of that cycle [To do sol it seems to me  that we have to move toward ease at this meeting A modest easing in  rates now, although coming at a time when inflation is very high,  could very well forestall a need for very sharp declines in interest  rates later on So I think the moment is now I'm sure I won't get  much support for this proposition, but I feel very strongly that now  is the time    Mr Chairman, I agree with Chuck Partee's  aggregates of 1 to 5 percent and 5 to 9 percent but I think his  federal funds range is a bit too timid History tells us that in a     5/22/79 -32-   recession it's very difficult to get monetary aggregates to grow  unless we push interest rates down So I think the funds range ought  to be 9-112 to 10 percent with a move to 9-314   M R   PARTEE Of course, Frank if the aggregates come in  really low--if they come in minus, say--we'd have to take another  look    How do we know when the appropriate time is, M r    Chairman?    Mr Chairman, this is Frank Moms I wonder if Steve can give us any  enlightenment on the nature of the bulge in M1 and particularly in demand deposits   M R   AXILROD Well, President Moms, I’m afraid I can’t be very enlightening [The  bulge] has been very widespread [across M1 components] in June and we don’t have any  particular special factor that would literally account for it in that particular month US  government deposits have risen and have not declined [subsequently] At least in April they  declined a little but in June they’re showing a rather substantial increase So that factor, which  you and I have disputed over the years as to whether it has any effect, if it had an effect it is in the  wrong direction    Is there a perception in the market that we're  headed for a pretty serious recession in this country and that that's  likely to improve our fundamentals on the trade side?     7/11/79 -4 -     Mr Chairman, I suppose 1'11 get the same answer  to this question, but it seems to me that the interest rate pattern  projected is not very believable in the sense that the staff is  suggesting under alternative B that we could maintain a 6 percent rate  of growth in M1 with only a very modest decline in the fed funds rate  to 9-1/2 percent at the low point If this were to occur, it would be  the only recession that I can recall, large or small, in which we were  able to maintain money growth during the recession with very little  change in the fed funds rate And I find that a little incredible    Well, I guess where I really differ is in my  expectation that the recession is going to be much more severe than  you're projecting    Well, Mr Chairman, as I indicated earlier, I  think we're facing a bigger recession than the staff has projected,  primarily because of the consumer sector When Jim talked about the  other sectors that were not as vulnerable, he neglected to suggest  that we have a major sector that is more vulnerable And that is the  consumer sector, where the debt burdens of the consumer are  substantially higher than they were going into the '74 recession The  staff's projections show that the bulk of the consumer adjustment is  already behind us in the second quarter and that hereafter the  consumer is going to play a pretty much neutral role in the recession  That's where I would differ I think we are going to see a rising  saving rate We are beginning to see it now; we've been very  surprised to see in the last few weeks an upturn in ordinary savings  accounts after a long period of steady decline So I think the move  toward a higher saving rate has already started I believe we could  see the unemployment rate go as high as 9 percent next year rather  than the 8 percent the staff has projected In my view that would be  counterproductive to the long-run anti-inflation fight If we have  that big a recession, the hope of keeping some constraint on fiscal  policy is going to be diminished, inevitably  postpone my comments on what we ought to do in the short term As far  as the long-term ranges are concerned, I would be happy with Steve's  proposals   I would like to    For both years    Well, Mr Chairman, this Committee has  traditionally overstayed policy both in the direction of ease and of  restraint and I would like to see us violate this tradition once It  seems to me, with the economy clearly in a recession, that we ought to  start moving to try to mitigate the amplitude of the recession--to try  to take out some insurance that the recession will not be bigger than  the staff has projected So with that in mind, I would propose that  the funds range ought to be 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent with instructions  to the Manager to move to 10 percent immediately I think history  gives us assurance that the aggregates are not going to run away from  us in a recession, even with an aggressive interest rate policy Now  I recognize that this is going to be disturbing to the foreign  exchange markets in the short run But once the markets understand  that our economy is turning down while the rest of the world is still  moving up, I think it will turn out to be a short-run phenomenon And  we can use our open market operations in the foreign exchange area to  mitigate the shock But I believe we have a conflict between our  domestic and our foreign objectives I think we have to sacrifice  one, and I would sacrifice the exchange market at the moment    Mr Chairman, with the economy in the fourth month of a recession which could turn out to be quite severe, I don't think we can use monetary policy to deal with the [international] situation The recession will improve the fundamentals of our balance of payments When that shows through, that's going to help the position of the dollar In the meantime, I think the only instrument that is appropriate for us to use is intervention policy, which I would be willing to use on a wide scale   Mr Chairman, the amazing strength in the aggregates has changed my position I would be for an increase in the funds rate to 10-1/2 or 10-5/8 percent and a move in the discount rate to 10 percent I think Henry's idea of getting the Treasury to announce simultaneously an increase in gold sales is a very good one    7/19/79   We have had a very firm 10-1/4 percent, so it seems to me that a firm 10-1/2 percent would be appropriate   It seems to me that it's quite similar to the first half of '74; we had a [comparable] phenomenon at about the same time [of the cycle]   Do you have any estimates of the burden of consumer debt service--taking into account mortgage debt plus other debt--now and how it would compare to 1974?  -18-    8/14/79   The issue is whether the debt burden seems significant [enough] or not to affect consumer behavior and perhaps create a slower response on the part of the consumer in the upturn than we have been accustomed to in the past   They both show a rising surplus?   Well, Mr Chairman I agree on the nature of the box we're in as you described it It seems to me that we can work our way out of the box if we gear our policy to the aggregates in the next 6 or 8 months I think we're in a situation very similar to the second quarter of '74 when we had declining final demand The decline was cushioned by a very large inventory accumulation, financed by a substantial expansion in bank credit, and this in turn I think led to a sharp rise in the aggregates It seems to me that the problem in '74 was not that we leaned so hard against the expansion in the first half, pushing the funds rate to unprecedentedly high levels, but that we moved so sluggishly when the aggregates failed to grow in the last half of the year Our slow movement on the other side I think  -29-    8/14/79  produced a much bigger recession than was necessary and probably more reaction on the fiscal front than was really productive So I would agree with your judgment that we should take a symbolic action today that would not be terribly damaging to the future prospects for the economy but would have some symbolic significance to the markets  I would suggest moving to 11 percent on the funds rate, raising the discount rate to 10-1/2 percent, but giving the Manager a money market directive and informing him that there should be no move beyond 11 percent without further consultation with the Committee A move of that size is not going to have any major further weakening impact on the economy; it would be slight, but not significant I think it would yield us some psychological benefits and would be a worthwhile move provided that we're willing to perform differently in the last half of the year than we did in the last half of '74 [We should] really move against a situation in which the aggregates are not growing, and I think that's likely to be the case in the fourth quarter when we get a big decline in inventory accumulation   We could make it into a coffin   Also, if you're going to give something to business, you've got to give something to the consumer   Paul, I would just say this Since we're after some symbolism here, I think we'd get a lot more symbolic impact at 11 percent than at 10-7/8 percent I think a movement of [only] an eighth of a point might produce a perverse reaction from the market It seems to me that a nice round odd number like 11 percent is what we ought to be seeking   Well, I think they'd be well advised to drop the  guidelines To raise the guideline going into a recession doesn't  seem to me to be a great contribution toward stability And all these  inequities and distortions are building as we go along    Do we still have the Committee on the Directive?    I sort of lean [in the same direction as] Dave  Eastburn and Nancy Teeters at this juncture The evidence seems to me  to indicate that recession momentum is gathering force very rapidly  and that the recession is likely to be more severe than the staff  forecasts I had hoped, since it was the best forecast recession  ever, that we would get some restraint on inventory accumulation But  the whopping increase in inventories in July plus the big demand for  business loans at banks in the last 4 or 5 weeks suggest to me, even  though oil inventories may be down some recently, that we’re still     9/18/79 - 2 5 -    getting very big inventory accumulation in August and early September  This, of course, suggests that when we start turning that corner,  we’re likely to have a pretty big inventory swing, probably bigger  than is in the projection I also agree with Nancy on the point that  in the past [several] weeks we‘ve moved short-term rates almost 150  basis points; long-term rates in some cases [have risen] almost 50  basis points I can‘t ever remember a month in which we‘ve moved  rates more than that We’ve gotten a lot of bang for the buck in  terms of the relationship of the relatively small move in the funds  rate to the very big moves in the rest of the market I think we have  yet to see the effects on economic activity of the actions we have  taken So, I would come out the same place Dave did; I think we ought  to behave a little differently going into a recession than we would  behave in a continuing boom environment   All history teaches us that when the inventory accumulation  starts to abate we will get a slackening in the aggregates And I  think the long-run track of the aggregates up to now has not been bad  Over the past 12 months [we’ve had growth of] a little less than 5  percent on M1 and a little less than 8 percent on M2, and I think  that’s about what we would have wanted to come out with a year ago  So it seems to me that we ought to stand pat for the next month As  far as the discount rate is concerned, it seems to me that we ought to  hold that in reserve in case we need to use it In the event that we  get a run on the dollar, it would be nice to have a symbolic gesture  in the closet that would permit us to announce another 1 percentage  point increase in the discount rate, which would attract a lot of  attention in Europe and so on So I would rather save that weapon for  future use As far as moral suasion is concerned, we might have had  that as a part of the package last November 1, but I think it’s much  too late now I think the recession will substitute for moral  suasion    I would certainly subscribe to your  recommendation, Mr Chairman    Well, I don't have a measure of credit crunch  but I do have measures of the funds rate and the rate of growth in the  money supply, and the behavior of those is quite similar   M R   BAUGHMAN My recollection is that we had a very  different situation with respect to credit availability but I was told  just recently that a bank from Chicago was working diligently in an  eastern area to round up business loans We wouldn't have had that, I  think, in 1975    Well, I think the money center banks are still  very aggressively looking for loans But if you go outside the money  centers, the banks are very tight At least they are in New England    But the state and local sector is much weaker  than it was in 1974-75    But bank credit was expanding pretty rapidly in  the first half of ‘74    I agree with Chuck His analysis fit my views  very closely Despite my view that the recession is going to be  sharp, I think we are in a situation where we have to be willing to do  something dramatic today It’s not clear to me that a change in  operating procedures is going to gain us much yardage on the foreign  exchange market because many will not understand what we are doing    I think the Committee has to understand that we  are talking about something that will give the Manager discretion;  [I’d] give him at least 2 percentage points on the up side in the next  few weeks We have never done that--that’s a dramatic change in our  behavior--but that’s what we are talking about And I think our  credibility will really suffer if we announce a change in procedure  and then fail to have the guts to go through with it    Well, that’s right But it’s got to be a pretty  big number    The other thing is that we are going to need to  educate the market very soon on this So, if we go ahead with this  change to a new procedure, I think you ought to have a press  conference today    Are the bond markets closed? Okay    We are going to have to go through a learning  procedure anyway Even if we were to postpone it for a couple of  weeks, we have a lot to learn and we might as well start learning now    You may remember, Paul, back in 1974 we were  operating the discount window with a 4 percent spread between the  funds rate and the discount rate    Administration of the window can control--    Well, if we follow Phil's formula, we do have a  little room to miss on the up side If we shoot for the--    I would propose 4 percent for M1 and 7 percent  for M2 in order to give us a little margin for error    The increase has to be at least one percentage  point    If we are in that situation, the Chairman can  have a telephone conference and we can discuss whether we want to stay  locked in or not   M R   BALLES The staff paper did recommend a range of 3 to 5  points didn’t it, Steve?    For security reasons you'd prefer not to get the  other Reserve Banks in on the discount rate?     10/6/79 -55-    Sure it will That's true The [point] is that  to control the money supply ultimately we are going to have to control  total reserves, and it's really not going to be a l l  that helpful if we  make our nonborrowed reserve target and end up with $6 billion dollars  going out through the discount window     10/22/79 - 6     Yes The savings banks are offering it Money  is available, but the demand is falling off very sharply because of  the rate--the fact that they are asking 13 percent plus 2 points    We don't have a usury ceiling    I think we are seeing for the first time real  price rationing in mortgage markets In the past, most of the impact  has been on availability but I think we are in a situation now where  we could well see a liquidity buildup in the thrifts because the  demand is not there at those rates of interest   The other shock I have in mind is the proposition 13 shock  because I have been making a lot of comparisons to the '74-'75 period  One area of the economy that was a great sustaining force in '74 and  '75 that clearly is not going to be that way in 1980 is the state and  local government sector     11/20/79 -25 -    Having said that, it seems to me that the reserve path under  alternative C looks quite all right and I would start out with the  initial assumption of $1-1/2 billion in borrowing And I think I'm  much more optimistic than either Nancy or Mark about what this  procedure is going to yield for us The figures that Steve showed us  yesterday made it very clear, I think, that over very short periods of  time the reserves/deposits relationship is very unstable But as we  add [timel--as we go from 2 months to 3 months to 4 months--1 think we  will see, if we can stick with our guns, that relationship stabilize  I have urged Steve to give us some cumulative totals as we go along  and I think they will bear out this relationship   M R   RICE Question You are associating $2 billion of  borrowing with alternative C as--    I said initially $1-1/2 billion    But I'd certainly move to $2 billion if the  money figures come through strong enough    But he didn't say whether it was forward or  backward !    Well, I'd point out that our debate about total reserves dates back to 1969, which tells you how long we've been thrashing around this problem But we shouldn't be too impatient with this We have a lot to learn about how to run this system I certainly don't feel the way Mark does that the adjustments to the nonborrowed path were wrong I think it would have been wrong to have permitted an even greater deviation of total reserves from the path needed to produce [the desired growth in] the aggregates And just as we are learning, the commercial banks are going through a learning phase now I think that $600 million of borrowing is an aberration, which we are not going to find in future periods once the money managers of the banks have adapted themselves to this new operating procedure I met with a group of them a couple of weeks ago and I found them in a great state of confusion as to how they ought to manage their affairs in this new regime So we're both in a learning phase; and I think we can get back to more predictable commercial bank  -12-    1/8-9/80  behavior once the money managers begin to learn how others behave in this new regime   The reaction would be devastating   The alternative is that we go back to unpredictable changes in the money supply  -14-    1/8-9/80   I think one of the two has to be unpredictable   Mr Chairman, I think the solution is that the Committee's directive should be on the basis of total reserves, and the Manager should be allowed to vary the nonborrowed objective in order to achieve the total reserves   It is operational, but it's not--   I have one question on M2 I presume, Steve, that in setting your compatible ranges for M2 for 1980, you're assuming that short-term rates will not get down low enough to produce any great reflow of funds into the thrifts?   If you look at 1975, say, which was a year of recession, a year comparable to 1980 [as projected], M2 went up by 123 percent even though I think our 1975 policy was not too expansionary   Well, we've had a number of years of NOW account experience in New England; I doubt that our seasonal is that much different from the rest of the country   Very brief, sir I think we ought to be able to show a substantial reduction in our guidelines for [this] year, simply because it is [likely to be] a year of recession It's a year when the demand for money is going to be down And it's only in recession years, in my judgment, that we are going to be able to reduce the guidelines I can't see us reducing them in '81 from the levels we set for [this] year if the economy is expanding As a theoretical proposition I'd like to see [growth] go from 5 percent to 4 to 3 to 2; but it seems to me that if we don't cut the ranges back now for '80, we are not likely to cut them back for '81 or '82 Therefore, I would go for the 3 to 6 percent [M-1A] range and try to explain to the market that it is a reduction I think we are going to have a hard time explaining that it is a substantial reduction because everybody is so confused about the ATS add on and take off and so on that they are not going to be as impressed with 3 to 6 percent as we are   Mr Chairman, I think alternative B looks good, even though I came out yesterday for a 4-1/2 percent midpoint I feel that if we are going to bias the flow during the year, it ought to be the opposite of what most people have been saying I think the rate of growth in the early part of the year ought to be greater and the rate of growth in the latter part of the year less because I think we will be better off with a saucer-shaped recession than a V-shaped one So, to the extent that we can obtain these [rates of growth], it's such a weak economy that it should help to cushion the extent of the decline and hopefully produce a more saucer-shaped than V-shaped recession  -71-    1/8-9/80   Right Traditionally, following our earlier policies, we have supplied very little monetary growth in the early part of a recession We have encouraged a sharper decline in the economy thereby We lagged in reducing interest rates and then when the unemployment rate got really high, we turned around and produced very rapid rates of growth in the money supply That led to very big swings in the economy, which I think are counterproductive in the long run to controlling inflation   It probably is, largely I'm not suggesting that we can--   It's just that to the extent we have to make a decision, it ought to be biased in this direction But I'm not under any illusions that we can fine-tune this thing   It would seem to me a lot more sensible if the Committee instructed the Manager to seek a total reserve path that would be compatible with these [Ml and M2 growth rates] rather than have the FOMC try to estimate what the [appropriate] level of borrowing is I think we could eliminate that from our agenda without any loss, and probably some gain, before--   I don't really understand that   And, therefore, I don't think it makes any sense for the Committee to tell the Manager to follow a nonborrowed target unless we also tell him not to pay attention to total reserves Now, in the last month he had to change the nonborrowed target I think that was the correct thing to do   I really think it's meaningless But if people get some solace from it, maybe it's all right   But it will dictate because we have a 3-month--   I think it would be a good idea   Mr Chairman, I have long felt that if we're going to have a reserve operating base, sooner or later we are going to have to move to contemporaneous reserves As one example, let's say that later on this year we get into a period where the money supply is not growing or is contracting That would mean that in order to hit our target of total reserves, the Desk would have to push in very large amounts of excess reserves at the expense of a pretty sharp reduction in the funds rate That might look a little funny if we're willing to do it, but it is one of the consequences stemming from lagged reserves It is very awkward to control reserves with a lagged system On the other hand, this is a very awkward time for us to make a change As far as I am concerned, it's only a matter of timing--of when we do it I don't think this is an optimum time, first because of the membership bill I wouldn't want to throw anything on the fire that could in any way interfere with that bill I'd want to hold off until it has been decided one way or the other Second, all of our computer systems people in the whole Federal Reserve System are [working] flat out We have the system automation program and we have the work going forward in connection with the pricing of Federal Reserve services At least in the Boston Bank, we don't have any capacity to do the work on [a shift from lagged reserves] And I think that is probably true around the System   I was told it would take us 90 days to implement it   Let sleeping dogs lie, I guess   Mr Chairman, we ought to be recorded as generally supporting the Board staff's projection and its numbers However, unlike most of the others, if the forecast is in error, I think it will be because the recession could be substantially more severe than they are projecting We had a miss in our forecast in the last half of 1979 because consumer behavior was much stronger than we were forecasting on the basis of income growth and so on This has led New York and Kansas City and perhaps some of the rest of you to look upon a 3 percent saving rate as a norm for the future I think it is also possible that when the unemployment rate starts rising the consumer will turn defensive and we will see the saving rate rise higher than the Board staff has projected and a bigger recession will result Also, the housing sector could be weaker than the staff has projected We don't really yet have a good fix on how the current housing rate structure is impacting demand But the Board staff has the weakest quarter at 14 million starts It seems to me that we could see at least one quarter substantially below that So, I think we have a risk of a much sharper recession in 1980 than the Board staff is projecting It's a risk, but I can't attach the probabilities to it  As far as defense spending is concerned, we've talked to the major defense contractors in the Boston area like Raytheon and others, and they say that for the kind of hardware the Defense Department is talking about most of the money will be going into long lead time items And while we may get a big effect on expectations in 1980, they don't see a big effect on employment until 1981, even if the program were to get geared up fairly soon So, it seems to me that we could see a different pattern a very sharp recession followed by a tax cut, an increase in the defense budget, and a big jump in 1981 That's another hypothesis that hasn't been stated around this table   Mr Chairman, last month I argued for alternative III, but on further reflection that seems a bit too tight, so I would move to alternative II I would keep the 3-point range, however, because I think it is important for our credibility that we end up with a result that's within the range I think the experience of the last few months may have led us to believe that we can control the money supply much more finely than in fact is going to be the case We have been very lucky, you know, in the last few months In this last month all of the misses in our estimates offset each other nicely; that is, the deposit mix estimates were offset by the excess reserve estimate Furthermore, even though we came in low on M1, we solved that problem by revising the seasonals We're going to run into times when we find we are not going to be able to control the money supply quite as readily; and if we move to a very narrow range, we may regret it   But only 1/2 of 1 percent were unhappy!   I think there's a lot to be said for stability from month to month in these directives, unless there's a major reason to change   I support the 18 percent, Paul, and I also support raising the lower limit to  14 percent After all, we're only talking about what we're going to do between now and the time of    3/7/80  the meeting It's not likely that we would ever use the [whole] range in the next week--that [the funds  rate] would be less than 14 percent It seems to me that a range of 11-1/2 to 18 percent is verging on  the absurd So I would vote for 14 to 18 percent   And we're not committed to buy them back from Treasury?   Peter, would you have been able to come closer to the total reserve path if we had contemporaneous accounting?   Isn't it true that the one-week bulge in the money supply practically made it impossible for you to hit the total reserve path in the last three weeks?   May I ask Steve a question? The advocates of contemporaneous reserve accounting argue that there would be less volatility in the funds rate than under lagged accounting Do you subscribe to that?   Mr Chairman, our staff has about the same economic forecast as the Board's staff I have a gut feeling that if the forecast is wrong, the result is likely to be a deeper recession I am thinking primarily in terms of the financial strains that the system will be under I think we've all been amazed at the willingness of consumers and businessmen to take on loans at extremely high rates And it seems to me the counterpart of this is that we may go into a recession [with] an awful lot of strains that are likely to lead to a deeper recession One sector in particular that is showing great strains even in a forward moving economy is the savings banks; the situation in New England is getting critical I was a little shocked yesterday to find out that they may be in a position to have ordinary access to the discount window within as little as two weeks If that's the case, we have an awful lot of issues to resolve As you know, in the past we have not loaned to organizations that were clearly insolvent The fact is that all the savings banks in New England probably are insolvent if their assets are valued at current market rates   It's true of banks, too, but it's much more the case with the savings banks, particularly in New England where the average yield on their portfolios is very much lower than on the West Coast That's because (a) we've been a slow growing region; and (b) New Englanders don't change their houses as frequently as people in California do That has led to a very old and very low yielding portfolio So, not only do they have liquidity problems but they have very serious earnings problems Most of the savings banks in New England will probably show a deficit in earnings this year There are other complications There is this new dual rate which was set up to deal with large commercial banks I think that is perfectly fine, in light of the fact that that's where the growth of credit has been most pronounced But some of the most seriously troubled savings banks in New England have assets in excess of $500 million And the question is Do we want to charge them the premium rate? Another problem is that most of the savings banks in New England are not insured by the FDIC We have a state fund which amounts to about $250 million What do we do when that fund is approaching its limits? We're going to have an awful lot of issues in this whole area of lending to thrift institutions coming down on us very soon that will need to be addressed  -22-    3/18/80   Well, I think our current posture is doing the job I would advocate the alternative B approach I don't see where the situation now requires a tighter posture We have to evaluate what needs to be done And I think we're going to see, as the staff is forecasting, a major collapse in housing in the next few months   I think that's appropriate, Paul My guess is that the big banks will back away from the window and try to preserve their flexibility   We just don't know how the big banks are going to react to this dual rate   Well, Mr Chairman, I think we have the first big test of our new operating procedure ahead of us It may be more severe than the staff has projected because we feel the second quarter is likely to be weaker than the staff forecast If at this juncture we begin to revise our money growth targets, then in effect we are back to managing interest rates again If we abandon, for all practical purposes, our money growth targets at the first occasion we find interest rates that are uncomfortable, then how is the market going to have any confidence that when we require uncomfortable interest rates on the up side we will not then also abandon our money growth targets? We would be right back to where we have been Now, to stay on the course, particularly if the economy is weaker than the staff projects, is going to be uncomfortable I think we're going to have to live through a period of weakness in the dollar because of the very short time horizon of the foreign exchange trigger And we will get talk--no matter how persuasive our Chairman is--about the Federal Reserve letting loose too soon But we've simply got to ride it through Rather than viewing lower rates as stimulative, as Henry does, I would view them as a force for mitigating the severity of the recession, because there is no question that we are in for a very sharp decline The issue is Do we want a monetary policy that is going to make the recession, if anything, sharper, steeper and longer than the staff has forecast? So, it seems to me, it is fish or cut    4/22/80  bait on our new operating procedure in the second quarter--whether it is at this meeting or some other meeting   That's not possible! [Laughter]   I don't have any problem with "B" And I think it would be desirable to move the top [of the funds rate range] down to 19 percent It's not clear to me what the consultation point is Is it 16 or 15 percent?   Well, we won't have a consultation, presumably, if the money supply is coming in weak   Well, Mr Chairman, I think one thing we should have learned in the last few months is that we are unable to forecast the volume of borrowing   But it is important that we make a decision fairly soon, because if we are going to make a change, both Reserve Banks and commercial banks are going to have a lot of work to do   But if we were to do it, the logical date would be September 1 when we bring in all of these new institutions, If we are going to make a change, if we could make a decision next month, that would give us five months to prepare   We couldn't hear Peter's response to your first question, Paul   Mr Chairman, this is Frank Morris I agree with Chuck Partee's analysis I think the weakness in the aggregates is a reflection of the dramatic and very widespread weakening in the economy I'm also concerned about the Committee moving back to the management of interest rates I think Peter has served us well [This operating technique] has turned the situation around a lot faster than would have occurred if we had been managing interest rates on the up side For us to turn around and try to manage them on the down side now, I think would be a mistake   Paul, this is Frank Morris I would support moving [the lower limit] to 10 percent I think 11 percent is a little tight, even for the [short] interval because the commercial paper rate is already below 11 percent So if we have to catch up with the rest of the money market structure, it seems to me that 10 percent is consistent with the rest of the market   Paul, this is Frank Morris I wouldn't object to adopting 11 percent, with the proviso that we have another meeting a week from today I just don't think that 11 percent is going to do it But if you want to proceed on that basis, that would be acceptable to me   Mr Chairman, one major problem I have with the funds range of alternative A is that if we were to vote for a 10 percent floor, after having given the Manager a 10-1/2 percent floor in our last telephone conference, I don't think we could honestly or with a straight face say that we are trying to control bank reserves Quite clearly, de facto, we would be moving back to controlling interest rates Now, if we are faced with a foreign exchange crisis,  -18-    5/20/80  then we ought to be honest and say that we are going to keep the federal funds rate where it is for the next month, hoping that the fundamentals of our balance of payments will improve and that, therefore, we are temporarily abandoning our policy to control the rate of growth of bank reserves As far as I can see, alternative A is out for that reason unless we are willing to admit that we are going back to controlling interest rates, as we have done before, though the results of that [operating procedure] were not terribly satisfactory So I would like alternative B, but I would like a funds rate range of 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent   [We would say] we're taking them off because our prior tight money policy was successful   But you also don't want to flex above 12 percent do you, Paul?   So why have a band higher than 12 percent if we wouldn't tend to implement it?   The advantage of your [proposed] checkpoint is that we will have a chance to observe how the foreign exchange markets  -37-    5/20/80  are responding and how the data are coming in And we do have a long period between meetings   [I thought] 7 percent growth in M-1A was the target   Also, an implication is that if the numbers come in higher, we are not going to push the funds rate up   I would, too   Paul, were you thinking of just a general slippage as a constraint or are you thinking of a really disorderly massive move in the markets?    6/5/80   Do you think Mr Proxmire knows the implications of this resolution with regard to real output and employment?   That's not what Messrs Humphrey and Hawkins had in mind, though   I think this balance sheet ratio page is telling us something It shows us very clearly that compared to 1974-75 the corporate sector is less liquid, the household sector is substantially less liquid, and the commercial banks are less liquid At the same time, we are going into a recession of about roughly the same scale as the one in 1974-75, but we are coming out with a much more sluggish recovery than we had in 1975 and 1976 And throughout the whole period debtors will be carrying substantially higher interest rates than they've ever carried through a recession This seems to me to add up to a much higher level of business failures and loan losses at banks than we've seen before Would you want to comment on that?   Mr Chairman, I don't think there is a compelling case to change the ranges this year, although I wouldn't object to revising M-1A down by 1/2 of one percentage point For next year, I disagree with most people who have talked so far I think we ought to give some numbers for next year If we fail to do so, we could generate some adverse psychology to the effect that the Federal Reserve is not willing to speak except in very vague generalities On  -33-    7/9/80  the other hand, the problems of setting ranges for M1 numbers for next year are really formidable I disagree with the staff recommendation that M-1B should be boosted by only 1-1/2 percentage points next year; that's much too low If in the current situation we are getting a boost of 1-1/4 points to M-1B and then we go to national NOW accounts, [the effect will be greater] The NOW account is a much more marketable concept than the ATS account; furthermore the S&Ls, since they do not have demand deposits, cannot [offer] ATS accounts So the 1-1/2 points seems much too low Now, if we go with 2-1/2 points, which is closer to where I think we are going to come out, then we will get some very strange numbers For example, for M-1A we will get a range of -2 to +1 percent and for M-1B, 5-1/2 to 8 percent I just think our ability to set ranges for M-1A and M-1B next year is so limited that we'd be much better off simply telling Congress that, due to this new technology change coming next year, we can't do a very good job at estimating and, therefore, we are only going to set a target for M2 next year Now, we could add M3 to that and set targets for M2 and M3 And I would say for M2 that we are going to scale down the range by 1/2 percentage point to 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent If we are not willing to make any commitment, even a tentative one, on what we are going to do in '81--particularly if you are [testifying] at a time when the foreign exchange markets are very turbulent--we are likely to get adverse psychological feedback I don't see any real hazard to [my suggestion] We are going to have to come up with some scaling down of the [ranges] and 1/2 percentage point is about as small as I can accept   I don't think 1/2 point is going to make very much difference, Mr Chairman   We ought to scrap wage-price policy I don't think it has contributed anything in 1980, and in an environment such as we are going to have in the next couple of years I think the marketplace could do a better job than presidential guidelines Presidential guidelines might end up providing a floor for wage increases in the kind of soft situation we are contemplating   Yes, I am, because I think we can affect expectations if we really demonstrate to the marketplace that things are changing, that we are doing things differently   Yes, but remember, 80 percent of the American labor force is non-union It doesn't [work under] any contract On  -34-    7/9/80  taxes, I would urge the Congress to set that issue aside until they come back in the next session and treat it as a tax reform issue rather than as a consumption stimulus issue One could make a good case for offsetting the increase in social security taxes for the consumer and one could certainly make a case for investment stimulus This, of course, is essentially what is in the package It seems to me, again psychologically, that it would be better to do this when the economy is turning up rather than having the Congress make a panicky, seemingly fine-tuning, effort before it goes out for re-election   It has been several billion dollars in the last couple--   M-1B is going to be increased   I question that proposition I don't think M2 is going to be any more difficult to control than M1   And these shifts in balances tend to take place within M2 rather than out of it into something else   It's not likely to recur in this period, though, Henry That occurred because we gave the manager specific instructions that if [money growth] was coming in on the high side to let it go I don't think we want to give him those instructions today   We can change that during the month if we find that to be the case   None is as [difficult] as April, though   Is this something we have to take a vote on?   Peter, with respect to the discount rate and your job of managing the availability of reserves, how would you    8/12/80  describe the optimum relationship of the discount rate to the funds rate under the new operating procedures?   [Preferably] on the high side of the band of your expected level?   Are you saying we should aim for a frictional level of borrowing--that that should be the norm?   If I interpret you [correctly], Paul, what you're saying is that it really doesn't matter what the discount rate is, as long as the level of borrowing is predictable   Back in the days when we were controlling the funds rate, it didn't make much difference where the discount rate was But now I think it does   I think we need a concept of what rate relationships make the most sense in terms of controlling the rate of growth in bank reserves   The difference is that in 1974-75 we had a V-shaped recovery For a short while we had very big gains in productivity, which were reflected in a big decline in the inflation rate If we don't get the V-shaped upturn, the rate of gain in productivity is going to be a lot less; I guess that's the reason why you're pessimistic on prices, as I look at this chart   Of course, that never happens when the judgment is unanimous that it's going to happen   Maybe we ought to move to L   It's also true of NOW accounts, even though there is a penalty, a quarter [point lower return] A lot of the NOW account total really, in a sense, represents savings accounts   I would support "A"   I find it hard to understand why we have a more liberal funds range with a more restrictive monetary growth rate   The Committee can specify anything   But we are starting with [borrowing of] only $75 million   Paul, this is Frank Morris I don't have a solution but--   Well, it seems to me that perhaps the third quarter is stronger than we were projecting Certainly all of the July numbers that have come in, including an increase in capital goods orders, were stronger than I had anticipated  SPEAKER(?) In one week?   Early in the period, Larry, the market was leading the funds rate in anticipation And I think that's the base period pattern   Well, I think it's because the economy is stronger than we are projecting, Paul   Nonetheless, I think the system is working, Henry, in the sense that the Desk has pushed the funds rate up 200 basis points, which I suspect is more than this Committee would have done if we had made an overt decision on it   It's usually at the end of the month   But you implied that if you had had the retail sales figure when you made the forecast that the forecast would show less weakness than was in the Greenbook   Yes, but what you're talking about is an unexplained residual that we can't forecast Isn't that really--   Well, it's the first time that the funds rate has been above the discount rate for a long time   Mr Chairman, to me alternative B defines the maximum growth paths for the aggregates that we can be satisfied with I'm perfectly willing to accept that I think the economy in the fourth quarter is likely to be stronger than projected and, therefore, we may see bigger rate increases than the Bluebook is contemplating, but I think we simply have to accept that However, I wouldn't go as far as Dave and shoot for something more stringent than "B"  -35-    9/16/80   We would be tolerant of errors on the lower side That's--   What do you mean by neutral policy--no change in interest rates?   But we had a lot more time in April [to reach our annual targets] than we have in October   If we're in a position where we don't think the guidelines make sense, I think we ought to change the guidelines  -53-    9/16/80   Scott, if they don't like either the dollar or the deutschemark, where are they going to go?   That much in sterling?   I don't think the issue ought to be decided on the question of whether we make more money one way or the other It seems to me that the terms of the present system reflect a period when we were reluctant interveners in the market Now that situation has    10/21/80  changed, and, quite apart from the dollars, it no longer seems appropriate for us to proceed with this kind of system   Well, if you have developed a convention that you only offset half of the overshoot in total reserves by a reduction in the nonborrowed path, what is the rationale for that convention?   So you come out with 50/50 [as your rule]  -14-    10/21/80   Mr Chairman, I hope we will keep this in mind when we set guidelines for next year Because if you think we have problems with the gap between M-1A and M-1B this year, next year--  -23-    10/21/80   That's correct   Mr Chairman, in looking back over this past year, it seems to me that the real product of our new operating procedure has been pretty good I think we turned the economy around much sooner than we would have under the old system If we had been managing interest rates, the expansion probably would have gone until July and we would now be in a recession of the magnitude of the one in 1974-75 And the unemployment rate at the end of the year would be substantially higher than it's going to be I think the resilience of the economy that we're seeing now reflects two things One is the fact that we did turn interest rate policy around so sharply But secondly, I think the economy shows signs of being able to live with higher interest rates than was the case in the past Nonetheless, I don't think any of us can have much confidence in the forecasts for the next couple of quarters because we've never been in a situation where we have come out of recession with interest rates at current levels So, I don't think there's anything our econometric models can tell us, based on history, as to how the economy is likely to perform in the next few quarters I find that there's tremendous skepticism about the Federal Reserve in the financial community They are watching us like hawks We clearly need, not only for the financial community but the business community, to get expectations working for us instead of against us And that's why I am supporting alternative A today Having made the commitments we have made, I don't think we can end the year and tell the public that everything else was higher, but M-1A was within the bounds and we declare that a victory I don't think that kind of victory is going to fly And since we don't know much about how the economy will behave coming out of a recession with high interest rates--and I talked to Lyle about this at the coffee break--we may find that in order to stay within our guidelines that we would have to produce absurdly high short-term money rates If that's the case, then it seems to me that we've got to change the guidelines But as long as we don't change the guidelines, I think our credibility requires that we stay within them That's all I have to say   I'm talking about monetary growth guidelines   Yes If we find in the fourth quarter, to take an extreme case, that we need a federal funds rate of 20 percent to  -28-    10/21/80  get the money supply growth within our ranges, then we will either have to change the ranges, which I think is the only way that we can handle it without losing credibility in the marketplace--   [Unintelligible] as they do We either change the ranges or--though I don't think we have this option--say we can't stay within the guidelines that we've established   Well, if we were to decide that we can't stay within the M-1B targets--   But if we are going to try to stay within the guidelines, we would have to move monetary policy in a direction that is consistent with trying to get inside the guidelines To me the adoption of alternative B would be [tantamount] to telling the public that we've given up on the guidelines   Because we would be telling the Manager to follow a reserve course which is only going to show a prospect of bringing M-1A within the guidelines And it seems to me that is equivalent to abandonment   I know, but that will be the only one   Well, that's why we don't have a C alternative!   Mr Chairman, I'd like to speak for the opposite position In picking $13 billion [in borrowing] you're contemplating that we would start out with about a 12-1/2 percent funds rate The rate has been there for a month, roughly, despite the fact that the early October money supply numbers have come in very strong, stronger than we expected It seems to me that what has happened to the money supply in October calls for some response on our part So I would advocate a level of borrowing compatible with a 13 percent funds rate as a minimum move We don't have much time left in this year   And, therefore, I don't think we should waste a week or two when we have so [few] weeks left to operate   Why was that an error if we mitigated the extent of the recession? I don't think it was an error at all  -47-    10/21/80   If your objective was a 9 percent unemployment rate, we made an error But I don't see--   Well, there's some logic to your [suggestion]; I'm not saying it's completely illogical But you talked about reacting if the aggregates come in high I'm saying they have come in high in early October and we have not reacted   Wouldn't it be a little more scientific, Paul, for the Committee instead of setting a borrowing level--we're not really concerned about the borrowing level per se--to establish an initial funds rate for the period? Why not express it that way?   That's the danger of talking about adjustments Then we might be in a position where we have missed them all, adjusted, whereas at least this way we have one--   But we'd still have Tony's problem, Paul, that we would be describing a growth path for M-1B that would be outside the upper limits   Perhaps in the next quarter   Well, Mr Chairman, I think we have all been surprised by the resiliency of the economy since July and we are concerned about the dip that the staff is projecting in the first quarter We'd all like to be able to produce a smooth 2 percent real growth rate for the next couple of years but I don't think that's compatible with our attempts to decelerate the rate of monetary growth gradually It seems to me that the rather small undulations in economic activity that are probably ahead of us, as much as we may dislike them, can't be avoided We have probably produced a great deal by our actions in the past months that is not yet reflected in the economic statistics or in the monetary growth rates Nonetheless, I like the alternative B growth rates for the aggregates simply because I don't think we can continue to raise our objectives for the quarter month after month in response to unexpectedly high increases in the aggregates We did it last month But I don't think we can maintain our credibility if we respond to bulges in the aggregates by raising their targets So I would stay with the growth path for the aggregates that the Committee voted for last month I would set a 13 to 17 percent funds rate range because I have a feeling that we can accomplish our objective within that If we find that we can't, then we can reassess it later   Well, I think we have to give the Manager up to 17 percent on the funds rate, which is roughly 2 percentage points above what we have already done But I don't see the necessity of pushing the top of the range to 18 percent   But given the run-up in interest rates we have already had in the last few months, it seems to me entirely possible   I think it's possible   Would you define "whack it too hard"?   But the reserve path is going to be drawn on "B" Is that what you're saying?   I don't think 17 percent is whacking it lightly, though   Yes, but we've only been there for a couple of days   Paul, this is Frank Morris I would go along with your 18 percent, but only very reluctantly I think that we have hit a level right now that [is inducing tightening] into the economy and that we probably are going to produce results in demand or markets beyond [unintelligible] The rise in this kind of business always leaves us [unintelligible] After that it's no longer necessary but, as I say, reluctantly I will go along with the 18 percent   We have in Boston   Paul, this is Frank Morris   Paul, this is Frank Morris Isn't this a bit academic? Given the lags, there isn't much we can do on December 5 to    12/05/80  impact the money supply in December But I would add that I think your "smell of things" is also supported by [the economic] statistics, particularly the evidence of a decline in housing and reports of a very sharp [slowing in] retail sales in November So I support your feeling   This is Frank Morris I suggest that we don't have a target for the M-ls because we don't have any basis for making projections   Confidence in [none], Chuck?   Well, I would certainly like to support Tony's position and Henry's One thing we haven't talked about very much and it wasn't discussed much in the memorandum is the fact that the foreign exchange markets are heavily influenced, as are all markets, by the psychology of the traders And it seems to me that a large DM position owned by the Federal Reserve would be a very stabilizing force for the psychology of the markets The only reference I recall in the memorandum is one I disagree with It says that if the United States were to hold a substantial portion of its international reserves in the form of foreign currencies, this might encourage some smaller foreign central banks to shift the composition of their portfolio out of dollars It seems to me the effect ought to be exactly the opposite If I were a central banker for a banana republic and I saw the United States building up a big holding of Deutschemark deposits, that would lead me to be less likely to diversify out of dollars   You should have had a footnote that you no longer believe that   I have been giving a lot of thought to this after reading that horrendous Bluebook, and it seems to me that the guidelines for next year ought to meet three criteria First, I think we have to keep it simple And having failed [unintelligible], that means immediately that we should not have guidelines for M2 because I don't think there's any way in the world that we can explain to a simple-minded monetarist press a 2-1/2 percentage point increase [from the tentative range] in the guideline for 1981   Well, I think it's because there is a large cyclical component in M2 because of its interest-rate sensitivity And that does not make it very suitable for [use as] a long-term guideline Would you agree with me on that, Steve?   But isn't it true that in the first year of a business expansion M2 typically grows much faster relative to M1 than in boom periods?  -30-    12/18-19/80   Well, that is my first principle anyway, Mr Chairman Keep it simple   Well, I'll explain The second criterion is that the '81 guidelines have to be lower than the '80 guidelines, if only marginally   Lower than the guidelines And third, we have to have something that we have a reasonable shot at hitting  SPEAKER(?) That's true   Those are my three simple criteria This leads me to the conclusion that we can only do two things One, have targets only for the M1 measures; or alternatively, go to a bank reserves target And with respect to the M1 measures, I think the targets should be exclusive of the impact of NOW accounts and we should explain the divergence later rather than try to put an estimate in the targets initially We've learned from the 1980 experience to date that we don't have a very good basis for estimating and I think we'd be in a stronger position to explain it later And particularly because one of the M1s is going to be lower and one is going to be higher, it seems to me that the explanation might be easier to make than otherwise  Now, I'd like to emphasize a point in reference to the New England NOW account experience [Our Bank is] about to publish an article, which is very relevant to this discussion, that shows the initial impact of the NOW account in New England by states The story is, as you wouldn't be surprised to hear, that the rate of penetration in NOW accounts is a function of the number of institutions that decide to offer NOW accounts and the terms upon which they are  -31-    12/18-19/80  offered In the case of Connecticut and Vermont for example, they both got NOW account powers at the same time At the end of the first year, there were about 8 NOW accounts per 100 households in Connecticut and only 4 in Vermont So the penetration rate in Connecticut was twice the rate of Vermont In Connecticut, 62 percent of the institutions were offering NOW accounts, but in Vermont only 27 percent In Connecticut, 27 percent of the institutions were offering free NOW accounts, and in Vermont no institution was offering a free NOW account So here we have a case of two states in New England whose NOW account experience in the first year was very different depending on the way in which the institutions decided to go about offering NOW accounts That is why I don't think the New England experience gives us any basis for estimating how rapidly NOW accounts are going to grow nationally; the differences within New England were enormous And that's why I think we ought to use the Mls as targets, exclusive of the NOW account effect   Yes, but that gives us an element of strength, Mr Chairman, because nobody else knows it either   Alternatively, it seems to me the only thing we can do is to go to a reserve growth target   I'm not saying these are perfect; I'm saying that they are the least bad of the alternatives   I think we're headed for a flat year In the first quarter, we are going to have a mini-recession and the money supply is not going to grow at all Did you want to get into what we are to do in the [short run]?   It's hard to answer that question without getting into the policy for the next four weeks   I think the implication of even a modest revision in the Ms, say 1/2 of 1 percent, would be that we would have to be willing to accept a year of no growth or very little growth in real terms   I would say that we have to establish the '81 targets on the basis of the '80 ranges and not on the basis of where we happened to end up at year-end   Well, that's the advantage of my proposal because one is going to be low and one is going to be high  -35-    12/18-19/80   That's a great quality, Paul, that no one can tell--   Are we going to bring sandwiches in here today?   I have a problem with this, Paul, because I think we have been in a corn-hog type cycle in monetary policy It has produced the volatility of rates in monetary growth that we have seen and that we're all disturbed about Now, some of it is inevitable from the fact that we are trying to impose a strict monetary guideline on an economy with a very high inflation rate So, I don't think we can eliminate these cycles, but I think we can dampen them But to dampen them we need to act before we get clear evidence that the economy is accelerating or decelerating It seems to me the problems of 1980 were 1) that we clung to a very tight policy too long; and 2) that we waited this summer and fall until it was very clear that the economy was accelerating before we started moving very vigorously against it It seems to me we are in a situation now where we're beginning to get some evidence that the economy is about to nose over [into recession] It's showing up in the money supply, in a jump in initial claims and unemployment compensation, and in projected cut- backs in auto production We know housing is going down now, even though it hasn't shown up yet in starts If we want to get out of this severe corn-hog cycle, we've got to act on the basis of what the data tell us right now I would buy this if the fed funds range were 14 to 18 percent In other words, I think we have to move now on rates If we don't, we will be back in the corn-hog cycle we were in during 1980, it seems to me   No, because this will mean that the Manager will stay with a 20 percent funds rate until we have had a very long period of weak monetary growth   But we're telling the Manager that shortfalls from the ranges are acceptable I don't know how long it would take Peter to move on this, but it could well be a month or two if we have the--   Down to 18 percent, yes  -71-    12/18-19/80   If we want to avoid another cycle like the one we had in 1980, I think we have to   I think the market is anticipating--   No, I disagree The action in the marketplace [suggests that] the market is anticipating that we are going to do something like this because they apparently think it's sensible   Could we ask the Manager, Mr Chairman, how he would interpret this directive? Maybe that would help Lyle and Larry   That's a month and a half we are talking about   Me, too   Mr Chairman, could I ask the Manager to define his understanding of this clause "some shortfall from the target ranges would be acceptable in the near term" as consistent with a modest reduction in pressures on money markets?   But Peter is going to be running [the operations]   Fine   That paragraph on page 5 really is critical   With the revised language?   Yes, but he ignored the fact that the statistical relationship between the broader aggregates and nominal GNP is much closer than the relationship between the narrower aggregates [and GNP] It seems to me--   I don't think that's true If you were to take, say, the pre-1970 data and estimate GNP in the past 10 years, there is no question that the broader the aggregate, the better estimate you would have made, no matter what kind of model you were using   Well, the principal tool the Manager has to deal with an overshoot or an undershoot of total reserves is his ability to adjust the nonborrowed path Last summer and early fall when I raised questions on this issue, you apparently had found a rule of thumb that you would adjust the nonborrowed path by half of the deviation of total reserves from the path on the grounds, I assume, that it was not clear whether this [deviation] was evidence that the economy was stronger or whether we had an increase in demand for money So, you split the difference Has the study developed some guidelines that would lead you to change that behavior in the future, or do you still think that splitting the difference is about the best we can do?   Well, I come out about the same way Chuck did except that I don't have any nostalgia for going back to controlling the federal funds rate I sat around this table for eleven years watching us always moving too little and too late And even though 1980 was not a model year of any kind, it seems to me that it was inherently a year in which any approach to monetary policy was going to run into serious problems If you tell me that we are going to have a year in which we have a one-quarter recession where the economy is declining at a 10 percent real rate, I can tell you that there is just no way we are going to avoid interest rate volatility So, I view the past year as a success story only because I think it was a success relative to what would have happened if we had stayed with the old procedure   I think what we have to do is go toward some rationing system Given that we need to have the banks borrow X amount of reserves, the second problem is Which banks are going to be borrowing X amount of reserves? And it seems to me a rationing  -40-    2/2-3/81  system, which we open to the thrifts as well as the commercial banks, could be designed to feed in that level of reserves; at least we know week-after-week that it wouldn't be the same banks that would be demanding that--   But that's not really a policy that we can live with   Well, the fact that they're not paying the surcharge means that the rationing can work because there's this reluctance to take the surcharge even though the surcharge rate is still way below the fed funds rate So, I think we have this new problem in that I at least don't believe that we're going to be able to have for long a different lending standard for the thrifts than we do for the commercial banks And, therefore, I think we've got to give high priority to figuring out how to go about rationing on a different basis than we customarily have at the discount window   But you're not, if there's a reluctance on the part of the bank to borrow at the higher rate, which I think will be the case   Yes   A lot   I've become increasingly disenchanted with M1 [in its various forms] as a monetary policy target, starting back in the fall of 1978 when for six months it was giving us misleading guideposts to monetary policy It seems to me that what we're trying to control with monetary policy is nominal GNP and that, therefore, we ought to use as our target something that is more closely related to nominal GNP I think the broader aggregates are more closely related So, I'm in favor of getting away from M1 because of its short-term instability--because the noise factor is so much louder in M1 than in the other aggregates And I think the fact that we have this NOW account problem this year provides us with an ideal opportunity for chucking M1   Well, sitting around this table today, we have heard discussions to the effect that we really don't control M1 with reserves--that we control it with interest rates If that's the case, it seems to me that we can control M2 or M3 as well with interest rates I am not persuaded that the broader aggregates are less controllable, in fact, than the narrow ones  -73-    2/2-3/81   Well, so is M1 fundamentally   Why?   The fact is that I asked my staff to give me a chart of M3 velocity compared to M1 velocity   Well, I think I understand what you're saying Nonetheless, the image in the public mind and in the mind of the  -74-    2/2-3/81  Congress of what monetary policy did in the last year, for example, is closely identified with the tremendously erratic jags in M1 We got some undulations in the broader aggregates, but we didn't get anything like that kind of movement To stick with a target that has as much noise as M1 does is not a very rewarding exercise   Well, I would be more inclined on the broader aggregates to use M3 than M2   I think 1981 is going to be a year when none of us is going to have the faintest idea what M1 really means   Or M3   Also, when we have conference call meetings and raise the rate, presumably we would have to announce that immediately, too, which is--   We can if we switch to M2 and M3 because [we don't have weekly data]   That would be one of the advantages of switching to the broader aggregates where we don't have weekly data   We don't have it  SPEAKER(?) It would cut down the reporting [burden]   Our forecast for the year as a whole is not so much different, but it's different in shape That is, we're more pessimistic for the first half Sitting here a year ago, we had all this financial restraint in place and we were wondering when we were going to see some response When we did get a response, we got a pretty big one I don't think it's going to be that big this year; I think we're close to another peak in economic activity, with a shallow recession coming in the first half That's what I would look for   I'd like to suggest, Paul, if we do go ahead with M-1A and M-1B guidelines for 1981, that we state the guidelines abstracting from shifts in NOW accounts In other words, I'd eliminate this bottom section because, with all due respect to the quality of our staff, I don't think they can possibly come close in estimating the shifts The prima facie case is the fact that they were off by $13 billion in the first week And the idea that we are going to see half of the total annual adjustment to NOW accounts in one month goes against the grain of all prior experience I just don't believe it  -111-    2/2-3/81   The problem with giving a figure is that that is what the press and the market will be taking as our target And to the extent that we deviate from it, they are going to say that we are again not meeting our guidelines It puts us in a very vulnerable position to establish guidelines on the basis of estimates that could have a margin of error of plus or minus 100 percent or maybe more   Not necessarily Right now, with the ceilings the same on demand deposits and NOW accounts, it seems to me that it would be in the interest of any banker to say to a customer "Look, if you want a NOW account, fine; but let's please close your savings account because there is no point in having two accounts" Maybe shifts out of savings haven't been so great in the first week, but that doesn't mean that they can't be great later on   Well, no I think the important thing is that whatever targets we establish be ex NOW accounts   That's why my position is that we should have no M1 targets but simply have targets for the larger aggregates   Right   I would take the lower ones, alternative II   Well, I would rather not raise them from this year's; I'd like to have the staff explain to me why we apparently must do that Obviously, I'd prefer to have a somewhat lower range   Well, after that explanation, Mr Chairman, I think I would stay with the tentative guidelines for M2 and M3 we established last year  -113-    2/2-3/81   I mean 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3   Steve says that he would expect [M2] to be coming in at the upper end of the range, but that our GNP projection is compatible with 8-1/2 percent on M2 If you want to make that 9 percent, that would be all right with me We can make it 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 If there's ever a year when we ought to have a tight monetary guideline, it's this year   At least we could do it for M2 and M3, Paul   But the staff's forecast assumes the 8-1/2 percent midpoint It seems to me, along with the Chairman's suggestion, that the 9 percent ceiling would certainly be--   It will be soaked up by the increased deficit   This is for what--M2?   I will accept the guidelines for M2, M3, and bank credit   No, can't we just have a footnote?   I'd buy going between "A" and "B"   I mean between "B" and "C," as Roger indicated, with a funds range of 15 to 20 percent With the economy softening, I don't think it would be suitable at this stage to indicate that we are moving the interest rate range up The only number I understand in that is the M2 number Assuming the economy cooperates with us, which I don't think it will, that would mean 8 percent on M2, which is not bad given the range   15 to 20 percent   It's 15 to 20 percent, so we wouldn't be making any change   Nobody will ever know what the number is, Paul   That's a decline related to the hypothetical numbers, though The actual reserve numbers would be growing, reflecting a shift out of savings accounts into NOWs If we get a large part of [the estimated shift from savings accounts], that's a lot of reserves from nothing to 12 percent   Sure  OTHERS Yes   Paul, this is Frank Morris I would support your position We have a conflict between the financial data and the economic data at the moment and my hunch is that it will be resolved in a softening in the economy Not only do we see the [low growth in the] M1 measures, but we see a flattening in business loans and steady weakness in commodity prices So, I think we've got to hold on until we find which way this ball is going to bounce, and I would support your position   I'm formal   I think I'm right, Steve, in saying that the Committee actually got a lower nonborrowed path in the second 4-week period because, in the absence of the [telephone] meeting, you would have been required to raise the nonborrowed path   Well, if we're going to continue to have $50 to $60 billion deficits, it's going to be an essential tool   I assume the purpose of this scheme is to reduce reserve requirements   Well, it's still smaller than the average noise factor in it   That's for M-1B, right?   Well, Mr Chairman, I have listened to all these concerns, which seem to be pointed in one direction But it seems to me that the scenario could be quite different in that the second quarter could turn out to be much weaker than the staff is projecting, and I'm inclined to think that that will be the case Not that it will be a second quarter such as we had last year, where we had a [GNP] drop at a 10 percent annual rate, but that it will be a sufficient drop to put us in the situation of having to decide whether we are going to follow a monetarist course and let interest rates drop substantially or whether we're going to decide that we will do things differently this year--maintain a relatively high level of rates in the face of a weak economy and perhaps produce a much poorer third quarter than we have projected as well It seems to me that this is just as logical a scenario as the ones that have been written so far The fact is that at the moment we just don't know to which of these to  -35-    3/31/81  attach the higher probability So, therefore, the staff comes out with zero, which I think is a commendable position if you have to come out with a number But I'm really concerned about facing exactly the same problem we did last spring   I think "B" is the one that I would support   Actually, Larry, the New England NOW account experience would indicate that we are not going to have a complete adjustment to NOW accounts for two years The idea that the country is going to adapt to this in a few months just does not jive with the New England experience Now, maybe the rest of the country moves a lot faster than we do in New England, but I doubt it   Well, it may be more rapidly, but to argue that the adjustment is largely over I think is just wrong   My concern, given my view of the second quarter, is whether, using John's range, we would want to allow the funds rate to go down as low as 11 percent before consulting That's why I would prefer a higher lower limit than a lot of you  -43-    3/31/81   Paul, this is Frank Morris It seems to me that the new numbers are a little more compatible with what we know about the real economy than the old numbers were, if that's any consolation   This is Frank Morris I would agree with Chuck and Tony One other element in the picture is that, while the M-1B figure may be near the middle of the range, the broader aggregates, which are probably more reliable guides now, are above the tops of their ranges   Paul, this is Frank Morris I had assumed that you were going to suggest changing the federal funds range Is it your judgment that the Manager can live with the federal funds range for the next two weeks?   Well, the last time we did this, Paul, it caused a lot of confusion in the street when the record of policy actions came out A lot of people were very much confused as to just what the devil did happen at our telephone meeting, since the range wasn't changed but at the same time the federal funds rate was 2 percentage points below the lower end of the range So, it seems to me there would be less cause for confusion if we just changed the range   Mr Chairman, if one looks at the current data coming in, one can't see any sign of weakness in the economy And with inventories as low as they are, the prospect of any major sharp decline seems fairly remote But at the same time, I'd simply caution that there hasn't been time yet for the data to reflect the impact of what we've done in the last couple of weeks We've had a major change in interest rates and that, I think, is going to show up in the months ahead I'm not concerned about the economy running away from us at the present level of rates, but--   Yes, but most of that [strength] was early in the period   Mr Chairman, I line up with Governor Partee on this one I think we ought to follow a middle course here We have had a major change in policy, as defined by interest rates, in the past four weeks We have seen the federal funds rate move up by 300 basis points There hasn't been enough time for us to see what impact that is going to have on the economy and monetary growth rates I think there's a tendency as we get near the peak of activity always to feel that we are not accomplishing anything--that the economy somehow is not sensitive to interest rates I think back to March, 1980 when that feeling was clearly dominant in this Committee We didn't know at the time that the economy had already been climbing for two months as we were sitting at the table and as Fred Schultz was about to lead us into a vigorous credit control program   Well, I think the evidence is that the decline had already started   It seems to me that one could make a case here, at least for the next few weeks, not to set too restrictive a course in the aggregates until we can assess the effect of what we have already done So, "B" looks pretty good to me   That's true in Boston, too    7/6-7/81   Does it make any difference?   I certainly do   Well, Mr Chairman, all this conversation, or much of it, suggests to me that we ought to face up to the fact that we do not know how to measure transactions balances in our present society M-1B is somewhat of a nostalgic attempt to maintain a concept of transactions balances and I think it's leading us into all kinds of problems First of all, we don't know what M-1B unadjusted is in the sense that we don't know how much of M-1B is really not a transactions balance For example, in the areas where there are very high minimum balance requirements for NOW accounts, people will shift assets into their NOW account in order to get the free services In Connecticut, for example, the average balance in a NOW account is $6,000 This is substantially higher than the average balance in personal checking accounts in Connecticut before the NOW account came into being The reason is that [banks] learned from the Massachusetts pricing of NOWs and put in very high minimum balance [requirements] So, some part of M-1B unadjusted is not a transactions balance Then we adjust the M-1B for shift adjustments, and I suspect this is done on the basis of--to put it mildly--incomplete evidence In addition to that we have the evidence just cited that some 4 percent of the money market funds are being used, at least to some degree, as transactions balances I suspect that percentage will rise over time We have overnight RPs, for example, that are used by a good many corporations as transactions balances, and RPs are not in M-1B at all I really don't think we will ever, from now on, be able to have a concept of a transactions balance in which we can have the same confidence we used to have in the old M1 At least we knew then that M1 was the store of money that people had available to them to make payments It seems to me that we could be splitting hairs on M-1B for a great many years and talking about these wild changes in velocity, about these changes in money demand, and so on, and all we'd be doing is covering up the fact that we simply don't have any basis for measuring what transactions balances are any more And that's likely to be [more] true in the future than--   There are a lot of transactions balances that are not in there, too   I think M2 is too narrow, too   That's right   Well, I wasn't proposing that we do that in '81 In general, in order to improve communications between the Federal Reserve and the public, we shouldn't change the guidelines unless there's a pressing need to do so I think it generates confusion And I don't see any pressing need to change the 1981 guidelines But I'm not sure I would do what you're suggesting, Paul, which is to suggest to the [Congressional] Committees that we're confident we are going to come in at the lower end of the range, because this M-1B monster is an extremely volatile instrument Last year half of the year's total increase in M-1B occurred in one week I think it would be fine to say that we want to be within the range, but I'm not sure I'd want to commit myself to coming in at the lower end even though we're way below it at the moment I thought Steve's remarks supported extremely well my view of getting rid of the M-1s as a guideline He only concluded that we should get rid of M1-A; I don't quite understand that But I would go beyond Lyle Gramley's position and use M3 and bank credit as guidelines rather than go to the halfway house of M2 If we were to do [as I suggest], we would accomplish one of the things that we're concerned about That is, we're concerned about a one-time shift in the demand for the narrow aggregates in the event of a sharp decline in interest rates, and it would no longer be a problem I just don't see how we could accommodate that with an M-1B guideline But if we had an M3 and bank credit guideline, we could accommodate it very easily There are two other advantages, it seems to me, of such a shift One is that there's a great deal less noise in the broader aggregates than in a narrower one The noise factor, which is huge in M-1B, gives the monetarists a shot at us several times a year They say the money supply is either growing too fast or too slow There's no way we're going to get M-1B growing at anything approximating a straight line because of the heavy noise content, which was even demonstrated recently in the [article published by] the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank  -52-    7/6-7/81   Another nice little problem it would solve is the weekly money supply problem because even though we'd be giving information to the market every week on the M1s, the market would not be weighing that so heavily since they would know we were no longer gearing policy to M1 but to the broader aggregates Now, assuming this advice is not going to be accepted--   --if we could get away with cutting the range for M-1B by 1/2 of one percentage point next year and with keeping the other ranges where they were, I think that would be an excellent outcome If we can't, then I would be willing to cut the whole batch by 1/2 percentage point And I would support Steve's suggestion that if we're going to have an M-1B target, we have solely a shift-adjusted target Having two targets for M-1B is also a source of confusion   I see   But it may not be completed   We could juggle the shift adjustment   You don't have much mania!  -56-    7/6-7/81   Well, Mr Chairman I would support alterative B I like the idea of having a plan to hit the lower level of the range or to get close to it by November I don't think I would want to publish that objective in the report we put out or, in other words, commit ourselves to being on that particular course, given the volatility of these numbers   The alternative would simply be to state that our objective for the June-to-September period is to produce the growth rates in alternative B, without stating explicitly that they are designed--   Oh, yes But I'd just not say that these are designed to get us to the lower end of the range by November Since I think the third quarter is going to be weaker than the staff is projecting, this can probably be accomplished without as much interest rate pressure as in the forecast, so I would support a funds range of 14 to 20 percent rather than the 16 to 22 percent shown   Except that Steve told us we can reduce M3 next year   Well, I'd like to put a [question] to Peter If you're following a nonborrowed path that requires a substantial amount of borrowing at the window, and if the surcharge on the discount rate is 18 percent, why should you expect the federal funds rate to fall below 18 percent? It seems to me that it has to stay above   Before this gets out of perspective, I should point out that if you look at the Boston Globe's business page today you'll see that most of the states in New England have a lower unemployment rate than Texas   Since we export a large part of our manufactured products, our people are very concerned about the big jump in the value of the dollar, which is hitting new orders very hard And they'd love to see that free fall that Sam talked about   [The Bluebook] is projecting 11-1/2 percent for the next two months under alternative A The proviso was in terms of the upper limit for the year as a whole, basically There was a chance that it would have an influence last month I don't think it did have an influence last month because M2 came in fairly low If it appears to be coming in high and persisting, it has an influence That's the purpose of the proviso   Mr Chairman, I think you are right We ought to keep the same directive for the reasons you suggested On this issue of M-1B and M2 and their divergent behavior, I think there's nothing in economic theory that suggests to us which one of these we ought to be pursuing Therefore, not having a theory, we are thrown back on common sense and I am beginning to think common sense suggests that we shouldn't be trying to control either one of those But that's a subject for the future, it seems to me If we are going to be governed by common sense, we ought to start looking at the state of the economy and the state of real interest rates And it's clear that the economy is flattening and that real interest rates, if we knew how to measure them, are at the highest level since the 1920s   That's not true?   When were they higher?  -38-    8/18/81   Well, if you look at nominal rates, I would have the same conclusion, because we have a flat economy and we have nominal interest rates at historic highs It seems to me that alternative B would suggest a deliberate policy of needing still higher interest rates, which to me is a policy that is pretty hard to sustain at the present time So, I think alternative A with the same directive, which you are proposing, is correct   A shift in the demand for money   Maybe the drug business is slowing down We're about to publish an article that indicates that a large part of the    10/5-6/81  net increase in currency is not related to any normal economic activity, but is--   That's right   I can confirm Ed's finding I've talked to a number of small and medium size bankers who have reported that just recently, in the last few weeks, for the first time this year they're looking at some loans that are turning sour It's a very recent development Bankers not only in Massachusetts but in New Hampshire and Maine have said the same thing But they've mostly been the small and medium size banks, not the big ones   Well, Mr Chairman, I think that the economy is already in a recession and that the fourth quarter is likely to be weaker than the staff has projected, which is not a very good climate  -32-    10/5-6/81  for inducing rapid growth in M-1B But I like the objectives of alternative B, and if we could come out with a result that showed us with a small shortfall in M-1B, a slight overrun in M2 and M3, and with bank credit in the range--and if I'm right about the recession bank credit should be well within the range--it seems to me that that package should be defensible to Congress and the public   What I mean is that if the economy is weaker than the staff projection, then we will have a run-off of big CDs, which should bend the M3 line down I would, however, change the Federal funds range to 12 to 17 percent It seems to me that before we go below 12 percent on the funds rate, we ought to have a conference call to discuss the state of the economy I would agree with Lyle I would be very reluctant to see us repeat the mistakes of the spring of 1980 and in our monetarist zeal allow interest rates to get to levels that produce the big reactions That's why I pick 12 percent as the floor   Well, Mr Chairman, until the last two people talked it seemed that I was perhaps one of the few people in the room who wasn't confident that I knew what we ought to be doing But I do sense a clear trend around the table that we're fighting last year's war, which of course is always a danger It seems to me that the latest Maginot line is that if the federal funds rate drops below 10 percent, the economy is going to turn on the dime and shoot up rapidly That seems to me, at least for the first half of 1982, to be highly unlikely Quite the contrary, I think there is a risk that if we're too rigid in following this particular [policy] line, we could well end up with a much deeper recession than we're projecting I don't have the confidence that that would be the case, but that risk is clearly there With that background, I tried to read some of the euphemisms that Steve Axilrod is now developing for the Bluebook I agree with him, looking at the options, that we're not going to affect the monetary growth rates in the last weeks of this year But he talks about a more restrictive policy producing a "smoother transition to targets for 1982" and that's the euphemism that I've been trying to interpret What I think it means--I'd like to ask Steve--is that we're going to have some very low monetary growth rates early in the year, which would be helpful in offsetting very rapid growth rates later in the year But if we set out to produce overtly very low monetary growth rates in the first half when the economy is very weak, we could generate a larger recession than any of us would think was constructive in the situation Have I interpreted you wrongly, Steve?  -22-    11/17/81   Finally, looking at the options for this meeting, two of the options call for a more restrictive policy than we announced at the last meeting It's hard for me to envisage what economic data have come in over the past five weeks that would lead us to support a more restrictive policy than we did the last time I could certainly buy "B" because we could still say that we're shooting for 7 percent growth through the rest of the year, which is a number we put out last time I find it very difficult to figure out how we would explain coming out with the 5-3/4 percent target under alternative C, after having given our sanction to a 7 percent growth rate before we knew how sharp the decline in the economy was going to be I should think that would take some doing   What we do in the next 6 weeks will impact what happens to the money supply in the first quarter   That we've gone completely monetarist?  -54-    11/17/81   Milton Friedman has finally won!   While noting it and ignoring it   I thought the chart in the Greenbook showed that we are already down to--   This is a revised one It says capacity utilization, total manufacturing--   All right Okay  -10-    12/21-22/81   Well, Mr Chairman, I am concerned about the assumptions the staff is making with respect to the NOW accounts in 1982 in that they assume that the adjustment is largely behind us That goes against the experience of the NOW accounts in New England, where it took several years to make the adjustment fully And it seems to me--   Well, if the Committee made it, I also question that I would call the Committee's attention to the recent rate of growth in other checkable deposits In November it was 462 percent In the second week of December, when total M1-B was up $800 million, other checkable deposits were up $29 billion To me, this does not lend a lot of credence to the idea that the adjustment is behind us Apparently it still does to you, Steve?   Well, there are two aspects that could get us in trouble One is that it is entirely possible that we could get continued shifts out of savings accounts into NOW accounts Certainly it would be at a slower rate, but it could be at a big enough rate to have a substantial impact on the rate of growth of the new M1 and perhaps lead us to set too low a target for M1 That is what I am concerned about for 1982   I think sooner or later we have to recognize that we can't measure transactions accounts anymore We ought to start looking at other things I think that is a clear message   Well, Mr Chairman, I think it is ironic that the Federal Reserve has switched to monetarism at the very time when our ability to measure the money supply has eroded dramatically and our ability to differentiate money from liquid assets is rapidly disappearing And, therefore, the relationship between what we call money and nominal GNP, which is really what we are after, is becoming increasingly unstable I think we've lucked out [this past] year We have one target below [our objective] and a couple above and bank credit barely within I hope we luck out this year, but I wouldn't know what set of numbers--   Yes, in 1982 I wouldn't know what set of numbers presented to the Committee would assure us that we will luck out in 1982 We are seeing very strange phenomena in both the numbers that we call money We had something happen in November that I think has never happened before in a recession We got a sharp deceleration in the economy accompanied by a sharp acceleration in our money measures That has never happened before, at least to my knowledge   Take all months where industrial production dropped by more than 2 percent   It is more than that, Larry If you look at M1-B last year, its relationship to nominal GNP is not what one would have forecast at the beginning of the year by any model that I know of And it seems to me that the situation is going to get more difficult in the future as banks begin sweeping consumer deposits into money market funds So, it seems to me, Mr Chairman, that the time is ripe to appoint a new committee on the directive That committee should be charged with finding some target for monetary policy which is more stably related to GNP than the targets we are currently struggling with   It seems to me it could be currency or what is left of it   Currency has become very unstable   Well, I think we could have given it a much better test 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, than we can now Monetarism does require that we are able to measure accurately the money supply That is absolutely essential to the monetarist approach And once you take the position that you can no longer differentiate money from liquid assets, you are in real trouble trying to pursue a monetarist course Now, if we don't find an alternative, then we are suddenly going to shift back to targeting on interest rates Looking at the short-term options the Committee has been presented with, I suspect very strongly that such a trend is already under way because of the fact that we had a shortfall in M1 in 1981, which we prized because it offset the overruns in the other aggregates We have an extremely weak economy and for December through March we are presented in alternative B with a target of 2 percent for M1 and in alternative C with a target of zero Now, it doesn't seem to me that either of those suggests any great determination to give a lot of priority to controlling M1 But there is something in the description of alternative B that makes sense to me We used to call it around this table "maintaining prevailing money market conditions" It seems to me that it says the case for a 2 percent growth rate as in alternative B is that it would be associated with maintaining roughly the present level of interest rates for another month Maybe I am reading more between the lines than Steve meant to write in there, but that--   But the less confidence we have in these numbers, the more we are going to drift back to controlling interest rates And I would prefer that we find some other option   Well, I would like to see the model that a year ago would have forecast the kind of nominal GNP growth we had in 1981 as being associated with the kind of M1-B growth we had   But do you believe in compensating errors as a basic--   The examples you gave were all relatively recent   Paul, how would that influence the money growth numbers?   Sounds like a Solomonic judgment!   I am the only one here who was at those meetings and I couldn't   That is a long time to remember what we said   I may have a feeble one   I think one of our problems is the assumption that we made at the last meeting--that the adjustment to NOW accounts nationally was over The New England data lead me to suspect that that may not be the case--New England being the only section [of the country] with mature NOW accounts I looked it up to see if we have had any bulge in NOW accounts and we have not They have been quite flat So, that at least is a little evidence that perhaps the problem is that the national NOW account adjustment is going to take longer than we had assumed   Well, maybe it's not the right explanation I thought it might be because it's not clear to me why New Englanders should feel more secure and not need to put more money into NOW accounts than people in the rest of the country   They go back to the middle of 1972   No, I don't think so   Yes, our demand deposits were up   I haven't seen [data for] the latest week when they apparently have fallen off nationally   We've just been comparing our nonseasonally adjusted data to the national--   The unadjusted data   Is there any evidence of higher minimum balances being imposed now that might have led to a change?   There's nothing like compensating errors!   Well, Mr Chairman, I still feel that we're in a period now where we can no longer measure transactions accounts And the problem, as Tony indicated, is going to get more difficult rather than less difficult in the future If you look at what happened in '81, we had a reasonably predictable performance in terms of M2, M3, and bank credit relative to nominal GNP But the real outlier was M1; the M1 number came in much lower than anyone would have forecast It's very clear from the earlier discussion at this very meeting that we really don't understand what the devil is going on with M1 So, I still feel that we should abandon the M1 target and go with M2, M3, and bank credit Beyond that, we ought to take a fresh look at how we're managing monetary policy because I think this whole concept of a transactions account, which is really the way the public focuses on what we're doing, is obsolete The monetary aggregates are obsolete We have to get some new models on the floor or the Japanese are going to take us over!   Well, I would be very upset if, without any evidence that the economy has bottomed out--I think the only evidence suggests the economy is still going down--we threw out any constraint on interest rates on the up side, as Mr Partee suggests   We have always had overshoots in the past   Fred Schultz's comments suggest that we should not make a change unless it is clear that if we don't, we are going to be following a policy that we really do not believe in   That would lead to not making a change until midyear If we find that we have to, fine, we ought to change the targets at midyear   Well, that could be   Using the Federal Reserve calendar rather than the standard calendar!   Wouldn't it make more sense to take the IRA accounts out of M2?   But they are not liquid assets Are you saying we cannot identify them?   But an IRA is not a liquid asset unless one is 59-1/2 years old or older   Not saying anything about rebasing, I think, would be the sensible thing That raises the imagery of manipulation It might cause some people to remember that we have not rebased in the past and this selective rebasing charge could be [unintelligible] It seems to me if we are going to--   I think eight weeks is a long time in the context that we are in   Second it   Very good machine!   I noted that the data available for March-- commodity prices, initial claims for unemployment compensation, and the stock market, all of which are leading indicators--showed an increased weakness in March That at least raises a question in my mind about whether the second quarter could be negative   Well, Mr Chairman, my thoughts are very much along the lines of Lyle's I'm more pessimistic short-term than the staff is, certainly I think the second quarter is going to be negative I have not seen any basis yet for expecting an upturn Certainly, the numbers we have in March so far don't support the proposition that the second quarter is going to show an upturn And it seems to me that we're going to have financial conditions that are going to mean a sluggish recovery--perhaps more sluggish than even the staff has estimated But there is one cushioning factor in the economy that no one has talked about thus far, and that is the tremendous upsurge in defense procurement, which is really beginning to develop a momentum That will impact the economy very unevenly Fortunately, in New England we get about three times our proportionate share of defense contracts, so it is cushioning most of our major corporations--like Raytheon and United Technologies and so on--that are in both the defense industry and domestic industry I asked them how they're doing and they said that their domestic business is lousy; their export business, which tends to be quite large, has been hit hard by the rise in the dollar But the defense business is booming and their only problem in defense is getting the production out So, that will cushion New England, California, Texas, the leading [defense contractors are in those areas] It's not going to do much for Si's Middle West, though  -28-    3/29-30/82   Well, Mr Chairman, I'm still having a little trouble reconciling the assumption that the adjustment to nationwide NOW accounts was completed in December with the fact that NOW accounts have been growing at about a 50 percent annual rate in the first quarter Somehow, those two things don't come together very well for me And the fact that most of this money bulge was in NOW accounts raised a question in my mind about whether this bulge means the same thing that a bulge in the old M1 would have meant This leads me to a question for Steve It's a hypothetical question, but I'll ask it anyway If you assume that we did not move to nationwide NOW accounts last year and that the NOW accounts were still confined to New England and New York, would you have expected, on the basis of what has happened, a 10 percent rate of growth in old M1 in the first quarter? Or is that too hypothetical to even--?   But in the absence of nationwide NOW accounts, these deposits would have been in M2 but not in M1   But it does raise a fundamental question as to whether transactions balances as we used to think of them actually bulged in the first quarter or not   Another answer to Larry's question is that the present growth ranges for M1 are fundamentally based on the old M1 That is, we wanted to show a progressively shrinking number Now the fact is that this new M1 is a different animal from the old M1 We are applying the old M1 yardstick to something that is different from the old M1 And that's the source of the problem   Yes   Well, Mr Chairman, there was a time when we had another man named Martin on this Committee   He used to talk about leaning against the wind If you want to know which way the wind is blowing right now, the wind is clearly blowing the economy down Therefore, we ought to have a policy which is conducive to a turnaround in the economy, even if we only get a sluggish upturn as I expect So, for all the other reasons that Lyle gave, I would support alternative A   I used to be   But the US Treasury has an interest in preserving the market for its securities when it's running a deficit of a hundred billion dollars plus I think that's the public interest in this market   And who may overreact to that situation    5/18/82   We do have the precedent of the Penn Central crisis where we did have to put in a lot of reserves through the window But a few weeks later that had washed out I think if we deal with a liquidity crisis early, we can--    5/18/82   In terms of the impact on reserves over a six- month period, there's very little impact left after three months, I think   That's right   Was that a Freudian slip, that 1930?   Steve, you assume that the impact of the sweep account is certainly going to be to reduce transactions balances I think that will be the effect in the long run, but it seems to me it is possible that in the short run it could have the opposite effect   The banks seem to be marketing them, at least initially, in a very conservative way, and people may still be willing to keep more in their NOW account as a price for the convenience of combining the money market funds with their deposit account In short, we could have an increase in M1 as a consequence   It could be very troublesome   Yes, one has to have a minimum balance   Well, let's say there's a fellow who normally keeps $2,000 in his bank account and $10,000 in a money market fund and the bank offers him a deal where he can consolidate them but he has to keep $2,500 in his bank account So, his M1 balance goes up by 25 percent And he's willing to do it because of the increased convenience If this is a typical account, then we could see a ballooning of M1, which could be very embarrassing to say the least   Competition will tend to bring those balances down over time, but in the short run they may be pretty high   Well, Mr Chairman, I attended a meeting of central bankers from around the world at the New York Federal Reserve Bank last week, and the various countries explained how they are controlling the money supply The fellows from the Bundesbank  -28-    5/18/82  criticized the Japanese for being too pragmatic in that they don't have any monetary guidelines or don't seem to have any rules that we know of and are just pragmatic And the Japanese said "Well, let us compare the inflation rates in Germany and Japan and let us compare the real growth rates in Germany and Japan They said, in effect, that maybe there is a case for pragmatism occasionally in central banking And I tend to feel that way at the moment We are in an unprecedented period in that we've never been in a recession with interest rates like this We've never been in a recession where our corporate sector was not only unable to liquify its position and to structure out its debt, but found itself needing to increase the level of its short-term debt during the recession So, it seems to me our ability to forecast the economy is pretty limited in this unprecedented period and that, therefore, a pragmatic case can be made for erring a bit on the side of ease at this juncture So, I would support alternative A   Well, Mr Chairman, we've been describing the M1 box into which we have woven ourselves rather tightly here I've heard a number of people say that they think our policy is too tight but we can't do anything about it And it seems to me that that is indeed an unfortunate situation to be in It has cleared my mind considerably to have arrived at a conclusion that M1 is no longer a reliable guide to policy and I would recommend that view to all of you or recommend that you at least contemplate it It clears one's mind on such issues as contemporaneous reserve requirements and many other things If you look at the situation, last year M1 ran low relative to the other aggregates and low relative to expectations We didn't understand why it ran low last year Although I don't recall debating it very much, we didn't decide to rebase our M1 guidelines for 1982   We did? Well, we came up with the wrong conclusion, obviously   Now M1 is running high relative to expectations and we don't understand that either And now we're looking at a situation for the last half of this year, according to our official projections, in which we are projecting a resurging economy combined with an--   Of course, but we are coming out of recession and going into positive real growth, a higher nominal GNP, and that is going to be accompanied by a slower rate of growth of M1 and a deceleration in interest rates There's nothing that is impossible in economics, but the probability of having those three things come together, based on historical evidence, is very low it seems to me   That was also very low But one cannot build a case for expecting an improbability on the basis of having suffered  -15-    6/30-7/1/82  through one in the past If we're going to get out of the M1 box sometime--and I think ultimately we're going to--why not now? So, I propose a range for this year of 8 to 11 percent in total liquid assets   Yes   Yes   Well, I think we could know the figure if we set out to get it If we decided it was an important number, we could get it fairly currently   And they were also stronger expansions--I'm pretty sure that's true--at least in real terms   Well, Mr Chairman, if I had to cloud my mind again by thinking about M1, I would support Governor Gramley's formulation While I sympathize with Governor Partee's general point of view, I think it would be a big mistake for us to announce that we were willing to peg interest rates again One thing we've learned in the last few years is that the presence of an intermediate target for monetary policy has sheltered the central banks--not only ourselves but the Germans said the same thing at that meeting in New York [as did] the British and the Canadians and others--from a direct sense of responsibility for interest rates, and I think that has contributed to a stronger policy posture To begin, even in a little way, to back away from that would be a serious mistake strategically And while I think we're following the wrong intermediate target, I believe it would be a big mistake to start doing without one   M1   The implication of the resolution is that the Federal Reserve is currently following a tighter monetary policy regime because of the very large deficits and, therefore, if the deficits are reduced, we should follow an easier monetary posture But that in fact has not been the case historically When we set this year's guidelines a year ago they were not set in anticipation of the kind of budget deficits that we're looking at now   I think it's obvious that there is no way we can continue to reduce the rate of growth in the money supply in the face of escalating budget deficits of that size We will run into an absolute financial wall   And we don't know what they have in mind   But if you're talking about the monetary/fiscal mix, you would have to conclude that fiscal policy is going to get more expansionary from this point on The question is How much more expansionary?   Just on the basis of any set of projections we now have--   Yes, but when the politicians--   But the issue for the Congress is not the rate of growth of the money supply; it's interest rates It seems to me we can tell them unequivocally that if they get the budget deficit down, interest rates will be lower than they otherwise would be And that clearly is--   I think M2 is being distorted by the fact that when interest rates go down, it pays the wealthy investor to move out of market instruments into money market funds   I'd like to suggest that we have a consultation if it appears that in following this directive the Manager would have to move the funds rate above 10 percent I'd preserve the form and keep [a fed funds band], but as we have done in the past when we planned to utilize the band or if there was such a possibility, we would have a consultation I think to move the rate above 10 percent in the near term could be very destabilizing   No, that's right   Yes, I don't see anything wrong with setting a 7 to 10 percent range specifically It's still 300 basis points It's not cast in stone that we have to have a 400 or 500 basis point  -30-    8/24/82  spread, and it seems to me foolish to have one that we don't plan to use   And 300 basis points is not managing interest rates When we managed interest rates we had a 50 basis point range   That's a Las Vegas range!   Paul, this is Frank Morris I think you're exactly right   Peter, is the surveillance limited to the recognized dealers?    10/5/82   Because that is where the problem has arisen thus far?   Steve, I think the answer to all your questions is "yes"   You ought to get your moat up and keep them out!   Is there any work being done by the staff in anticipation of the time when we will have to decide what to do with monetary policy when we finally admit that M1 is no longer a sensible target?   I'm talking about contingency planning   We love it We just can't find it!   Well, I find the same kind of attitude among US businessmen   No, no   I am seeing an attitude that I have never seen before, not even in the depths of the 1974-75 recession There is a feeling of apprehension, a vague apprehension that maybe things are going to get out of hand And it's leading businessmen to take a very defensive posture I talked to the head of a quite successful company that is being cushioned by a big increase in defense contracts But the firm's domestic business is off, and he said--and I thought this was a rather striking statement--that the objective of his company was to generate cash If that kind of thinking is very widespread--   So we shouldn't be surprised if liquid assets have grown relative to nominal GNP at a rate that is out of line with past experience   Absolutely   We're seeing in New England highly successful, very rapidly growing companies such as Digital Equipment being hit They have had traditionally a "no layoff" policy; so they announced    10/5/82  that in order to substitute for the cash flow improvement of a layoff they were going to have a wage freeze for 3 months This really hit Boston If Digital Equipment is in trouble, then the issue is Who is doing well?   Yes, but Bill, we've got to do what we think is best for the economy and let those comments go   Mr Chairman, it just so happens that we have opposite extremes finishing up this discussion I look upon it as a great step forward that we have gotten M1 out of the directive And I don't view it as a temporary phenomenon because I think our ability to interpret M1 is going to continue to be highly questionable for some time to come This is not a two- or three-month phenomenon as far as I can see But that remains to be seen Nonetheless, I support the move at this point in time and I would hope that borrowing is set at a level that would get the funds rate down to the 9 to 9-1/2 percent area as a start   The destruction of M1 bill   I would think the market would interpret this as a Federal Reserve concern about the backing up of interest rates   I think that would be very constructive   Mr Chairman, I think we've gone a long way toward dealing with our long-term inflation objectives That is not saying we won't have to deal with them in the future, but it seems to me that the immediate, imperative policy is to find the level of interest rates that is going to permit the economy to turn around I think the evidence at the moment is that the current level of interest rates is too high and that the economy is still sliding downward Quite clearly, the monetary aggregates are giving misleading signals Their strength clearly does not reflect strength in the economy, but quite the opposite It's a reflection of the weakness of the economy In large part, I think the growth in the aggregates reflects the fact that the business community has not been able to fund their debt in the long-term bond market in the normal cyclical manner And that has produced the unusual phenomenon of growing, indeed rapidly growing, business loans at banks all through a recession I can't recall that ever happening before Again, this sustained business loan demand, which has contributed toward the strength in the aggregates, as well as the liquidity preference factors are giving us very misleading numbers on the aggregates  It seems to me that at the moment we have to go for alternative A; it is the only alternative that makes any sense to me We have to set aside the aggregates as our prime objective at the moment But if we go for "A," and I hope we do, that does mean we will have to inform the markets in some way that it is not necessarily our objective to bring M2 and M3 within their ranges because, if we get the markets anticipating that the Fed is determined to bring M2 and M3 within their ranges by the end of the year, we could very well not have the kind of response that we want But that's a problem for you to figure out   It would take a cut in the discount rate, wouldn't it, to do something?   Somehow, Larry, that scenario doesn't fly with me I don't think that's the situation we're in   When it reaches maturity in 7-1/2 years then we could do it   What if we were in a situation where the economy had picked up for a while? If we had announced a 6 to 10 percent funds rate range after one meeting and we announced immediately after the next one that our range was now 8 to 13 percent, what sort of market reaction would you expect in that kind of situation?   Precisely   And we'd get to the point where we were back in the Martin years   If you eliminate both of those, you don't have an awful lot left!   But the kind of problem I'm concerned about is this Let's say that we're in a period of uncertainty   Well, suppose we think that whatever we are targeting on is going to strengthen greatly between meetings, but we're not sure So, we give the Manager a wide funds range in which to operate and he is supposed to use that range if the target shows great strength and not use it if it doesn't In that case we would be publishing a much higher upper limit, and the market would be likely to move quickly toward that limit Then if the events did not occur to justify the move, the Manager would not move the funds rate Then the market would be stuck up here, and it would have to come down again This would produce increased instability in the money market   There was a statement by the Secretary of the Treasury on Wednesday   Wednesday morning they were on the telerate   I think all one can have now is a very muted optimism I was at a meeting with the head of the National Association of Home Builders, [unintelligible] and Mike Sumicrast I was quite amazed how optimistic the home builders were   I checked this out with the local real estate people around Boston and they have seen quite a turn in the movement of residential real estate But, tomorrow, don't we also get new orders for durable goods?   You can't get that in the morning?   That's going to be a very key number I think we have to see a turnaround in new orders or this muted optimism we've seen so far is not going to stay with us   But at least there is some evidence that at the present level of mortgage rates it is possible to move some housing off the market, which hasn't been true for some time   To consider returning to M1 by mid-1983 is extremely unrealistic, I think Not only do we have the potential of these corporate accounts but we also have the experience that it takes a long time for people to adjust fully to changing their cash balances The New England experience with the NOW account was that it took three years to reach equilibrium with NOW accounts I never did believe the idea that the change would take place that much more rapidly in the country at large And the fact that NOW accounts have been growing over the past year at about a 35 percent annual rate leads me to question the maturity of this device So, I don't think we should expect that the public is going to adapt to these new accounts very rapidly It seems to me that goes against the grain of all our earlier history Neither should we expect that money market mutual funds are going to sit back and let the banks take all their money away from them I would expect, for example, that the next move by the money market funds would be to offer unlimited checking We already have unlimited checking with Merrill Lynch's cash management fund   No minimum size check and no limit on the number of checks One pays for the cost of processing with a service charge If the Super NOW account turns out to be very popular, which I think it will, it seems to me that the money market funds will respond by offering unlimited checking, which will open the ballgame again When the dust does settle sooner or later--I think it's unlikely to be by mid-1983--what we call M1 is going to be a very different animal, as Steve indicated, than the M1 of earlier years And it's going to take us 5 or 6 years of experience with the new animal to develop any consensus as to how it's going behave relative to nominal GNP and how we can control it Certainly, there is no scientific basis for expecting that it is going to behave relative to nominal GNP in the same way that the old M1 did  There is a lot of theology on M1 floating around at this meeting Steve mentioned a couple of things that raised some of the basic issues He talked about the vexing questions of cause and effect in using credit as a target, as if to suggest that there are no vexing problems of cause and effect with respect to money, a point about which I would raise serious questions I agree with Henry that what moves the economy is interest rates and not the black box Steve also raised the question of whether credit can be controlled independently of GNP I suspect that it cannot But I have not seen any demonstration in the last three years that we control M1 independently of GNP The idea that M1 is so interest-sensitive that we can control its rate of growth by interest rate changes so small as not to have any impact on the economy I find hard to believe I cannot reconcile that theory, that doctrine, that theology with what has happened in the past three years when we finally made very big moves in interest rates to get M1 under control and those big moves had very big impacts on the economy So, I find a lot of conflict between the facts and the theology in the case of M1  I think we need a proxy--an independent intermediate target-- for nominal GNP, or the closest thing we can come to as a proxy for nominal GNP, because that's what the name of the game is supposed to be If we have to target something that is not predictably related to GNP, which M1 has not been in the past two years, one of two things can happen One is that we can do as we did in 1981 and say the M1 shift adjusted, which was our target, is coming in too low and we are just going to let it come in low--we're not going to use it as a target de facto I think that was the right decision If we had tried to hit our targets for M1 in 1981, we obviously would have put too much money into the system I think the targets have misled us this year That is, up until October when we finally caught up with it, it seems to me that the monetary aggregates misled this Committee into following a much more restrictive policy than we intended And that is reflected in a nominal GNP growth this year, which we're now estimating at 36 percent, that I don't think any of us a year ago would have [favored] as a target for nominal GNP  It seems to me that the best proxy for nominal GNP in this world of enormous change is the rate of growth of debt Now, that may not be a perfect proxy, either But we certainly don't want to go back to interest rate targeting Politically, I don't think we could adopt a nominal GNP targeting approach even though theoretically that is what we ought to be doing I don't think we can do it We need a proxy for nominal GNP  -20-    12/20-21/82   Well, let's say the President comes out in January and says we are going to have 12 percent nominal GNP growth, and you go up before the congressional committee in your Humphrey- Hawkins testimony the next month and say we're going to finance a 9 percent nominal GNP growth It seems to me it is not well suited to the needs of the central bank to be that far out on a limb   I would merely submit that we've been getting away with this on the money supply for a number of years I'm quite amazed that we have But I think it's very clear that the intermediate target should not be politically sensitive And the wonderful thing about the rate of growth in the money supply, for all of its problems, is that it was never a politically sensitive item such as the unemployment rate, or interest rates, and so on Nominal GNP, if we were to use that as a target, would be a politically sensitive target, and we ought to avoid it for that reason But we need a proxy for it   I disagree with that statement that we have adjusted for NOW accounts I don't think we have at all   Well, I would submit that the rate of growth of Ml in 1982 would have been substantially less than it was--that a lot of the NOW account money would be in savings accounts   Could I add a point here? My staff has estimated that we can produce a monthly debt number two weeks after the end of the month We sent their analysis down to Steve Taylor and Steve said it was right   Well, maybe he told them it's right and he told you it's wrong   You started out talking about the flow impacts for M2 and how they are off the wall; it surprised me that you concluded that M2 is what we ought to be targeting on   If you use a velocity number, they can't prove you're wrong   I think Jerry is right The most scientific statement made yesterday was Lyle Gramley's statement that the staff estimates of the impact of the new account on M2 are off the wall And I think that's exactly right As long as the banks are paying an above-market rate on the new instrument--and I don't know how long that's going to go on--there is a tremendous incentive to shift out of market instruments into M2 At least with M3 there is the offset in that presumably the banks that take in a lot of money this way will be taking in less through large CDs I would differ with Jerry only to the extent that I wouldn't have an M2 target at all   Well, Paul, this is Frank Morris I don't have any new ideas but I have some old ones to state   Very simply, what we're doing here in trying to assess the significance of these numbers as they come in continues to suggest to me that M1 and M2 are no longer going to be reliable yardsticks for monetary policy, not only now but in the future In addition to these new accounts, we're seeing the money market mutual funds begin to respond--and I think that response will broaden--by offering unlimited checking on money market funds So, this will further confuse the situation I think we should not assume that once these new accounts settle down all further innovation in the way people manage their cash balances is going to come to a screaming halt and that, therefore, M1 and M2 will be useful guidelines for the future I think until we face up to that fact, we're going to have continued trouble   I would say "yes" with regard to M3, which I think is the only reasonably unimpaired monetary aggregate that we have left, although it is subject to shifts out of market instruments into the new accounts as well as the other aggregates But adding to that some measure of total liquid assets or total debt will get us away from these enormous shifts due to financial innovation   This is Frank Morris I would second Ed Boehne's diagnosis I think the economy is turning around here We're seeing a pretty widespread improvement in the leading indicators and, of course, continued strength in the housing sector But we're not going to get, at least on the basis of present evidence, the sort of strong cyclical upturn that we've seen in typical past recessions And I think it would be vulnerable to any backing up in rates   There is a new development that is relevant to that The Fidelity Fund is introducing a new money market fund that will offer unlimited checking There will be no service charge but the cost of handling the checking would be deducted from the revenue So it will have some [lesser] flow of yields than their present funds If others follow, then quite clearly they could force the commercial banks into competing, which they haven't done yet, on the Super NOW That would also force us, of course, to determine how we would treat this new money market mutual fund in Ml Presumably that would be open to businesses and that would give those in the business community a vehicle for having an interest-bearing checking account if they wanted it   My asymmetry is in the opposite direction I think a need for an intermediate target will really be important when we get to the point where we have to start pushing interest rates up to prevent an acceleration of inflation And it seems to me if there's one lesson from the last 3 years, it's that having an intermediate target gives us a good deal of political shelter that interest rate targeting does not I think the public did have a perception that it was appropriate to decelerate gradually the rate of growth of the money supply and I think we could generate a perception on controlling the rate of growth of credit But if we suggest [we are] sitting out there managing interest rates, we don't have that public perception going for us   I understood that Jerry thought the real problem of risk was on the down side I think in any liquidity crisis this Committee is going to say the heck with the guidelines, we're going to put enough liquidity into the system to take care of it And politically that will never be a serious problem The real problem comes when, say, in late '84 or '85 we have to push interest rates up If we don't have something we can point to that's demanding that we do this in the public interest, I think we're in trouble   Yes   I want to make the target meaningful in the sense that I think our problem in the last year or two was that we have been in a situation where we had to abandon the M1 targeting two times out two years We were presumably following the shift adjusted Ml in 1981 That came in very low and we decided not to bring it within the range I think that was a sensible decision, but it did mean that we were not targeting at the end of the year what we planned to target at the beginning of the year [Last] year we also made another sensible decision not to try to force Ml back [down to] within the top of the range, which I think would have been disastrous But we lose a lot of public [understanding] and strength from having an intermediate target when we have to keep abandoning it because the darn thing is getting the wrong--   I conclude from this that we should go to targeting some broad aggregate, which is not--   [Other than] Ml and M2 I don't think we could set a guideline for M2 I think the only one of the Ms that's left that has any validity--and by validity I mean something that is not going to be dominated by financial innovation--   M3, L, or debt   I think we can influence them just as easily as we can Ml There's a mythology around this table that we have an extremely tight control over M1 I think it's a lot of nonsense  -25-    2/8-9/83   I don't believe that I don't believe that   But the problem--   Mr Chairman, I think you ought to--   Yes, particularly because 6 to 9 percent is going to be too tight next year in 1984 We'd have to raise it   Well, in the first year of recovery we normally get more GNP for M3, or M3 velocity tends to rise in the first four quarters of recovery and to be essentially flat--no velocity change-- in the second year I think Steve would support me on this that we would have to raise it next year   I think if we forgot it, it would be a big step forward   But we're not targeting the flow; we're targeting the percentage growth   We're targeting this first set of numbers   Our analysis of debt indicated that a 7 to 10 percent range would be adequate for 1983 So, I think 8 to 11 percent is going to be plenty   And it has been declining since 1978   The velocity of debt in the first year of expansion tends to be about 2 percent So, if you had an 11 percent rate of growth in debt in the first year of expansion you should be able to finance 13 percent nominal GNP [growth]   Another way of looking at it is to look at the first column where you see that the highest rate in the whole period since 1960 was 13-1/2 percent So that 11 percent historically is--   13-1/2 percent in 1978 First column   All right; then it's 129 percent Therefore, it seems to me that in the first year of expansion, when business credit demands are not going to be all that strong, 11 percent is plenty high   That's exactly why I think we don't need 12 percent   To my knowledge, I don't think he's recommended a target for it   But a 12 percent rate of growth will not look very tight to those guys   9 to 11 percent   It's a more reliable number, so we don't need a wide range   It's responsive to nominal GNP, Henry, not just inflation   Keep 6 to 9 percent   Furthermore, the M2 number is based on sheer speculation on the part of the Board's staff that after the end of March--   --M2 is going to grow 8 percent   That is precisely the danger   My only problem with it, Mr Chairman, is that I don't see that we have a basis for differentiating Ml and M2 That is, M2's velocity is certainly as unreliable in this situation as Ml's   I would suggest "casually"   I don't have a vote   That could be specified in terms of M3, I think, but I don't know about Ml or M2 for this period   But relatively little We could pick--   I think that's too [unintelligible] What we're saying is that we're not going to allow them, even for a short period, to fall below the long-term ranges   I don't see how we can quantify this without causing more trouble than we have already   That sounds good   Was that Burt Lance who wrote that?   Has there been any change since Reagan [came into office]?   What I meant was Do you sense any change in the Treasury's stand on intervention?   Mr Chairman, I think it's a little too early to have any convictions as to how strong this expansion is going to be We have two sets of numbers, January and February The January numbers at face value looked very good, but probably the seasonal factors made them look better than they were The February numbers in general were quite disappointing If we're talking about triggering order books, they weren't triggered in February; the orders numbers in    3/28-29/83  February were really quite disappointing Again, that may reflect the fact that the January numbers were inflated But certainly, the range of numbers for February on retail sales, on personal income, and on new orders would have to be viewed as on the disappointing side I think we need another month of data to shake this out; I'd like to see a little more of that inadequate inventory phenomenon showing through in the orders It's not there yet   Certainly, Henry, in terms of the financial structure, we have a greater fragility than we've ever had before That is one area, and a very important area, where we have more vulnerability built into the system than we've had before   I'm talking about the quality of debt, domestic and international If we do abort this recovery, I think we would end up with financial strains of a sort that we would find very difficult to handle   One idea we had--I don't know that it has any merit or not--is that with the new discounts for cash payment in gasoline stations people are having a tendency to pay in cash rather than using a credit card and may be carrying higher balances than they used to in order to get the discount   Inappropriate?   Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with Roger that the major risk in the present situation is on the down side It's a risk of possibly aborting the expansion, and the risk of reigniting double- digit inflation is considerably farther down the road I think the broader aggregates do not confirm the proposition that our current policy is too expansionary They suggest that it ought to be adequate to a produce a sustained upturn, but they are not indicating an excessively expansionary policy I've been persuaded by Jim Duesenberry that the very rapid rate of M1 growth can be explained by the very sharp reduction in short-term money rates--that is, the cost of holding money in the form of a NOW account is now relatively low whereas a year or so ago it was extremely high and, therefore--   Yes   Well, I think it does Doesn't our equation indicate that you would expect that, given the sharp decline in rates? And one other thing--  -55-    3/28-29/83   But I wonder about the equation since it was based on historical relationships We've never had such a major decline in rates before   Well, so much for Ml I'm still uncomfortable with having an M2 target at this juncture because the second-quarter targets here are based on assumptions as to how rapidly the adjustment to the money market demand account is going to be completed The assumption may be good or it may not be good It seems to me that in this period of transition the case for having an M2 target is not very strong any more It seems to me we'd be better off with simply an M3 target, as Tony has suggested I think Until we get some further evidence to tell us how strong the expansion is going to be--and we should get that in the next couple of weeks when we get March employment numbers, which ought to be a pretty good indicator--it seems reasonable to hold to the present level of interest rates But I would agree with Nancy in the sense that I would urge the Manager, when he has to make a choice, to err on the side of a little more ease Lately we seem to have be erring on the side of a little more restraint, which I don't think is particularly appropriate at this juncture I would keep the existing directive language I don't think we're ready yet to move to a strict aggregates targeting approach   Why do we need anything about Ml at all, since we're not using it as a target?   Mr Chairman, this is Frank Morris I'd like to be recorded as supporting Tony Solomon's position as well If we look at the performance of the broader aggregates, we simply don't find the kind of enormous bulge that we have had in Ml and M2 Without being too repetitious, I simply don't think that they have been giving us a proper clue as to what policy ought to be doing   I don't understand why the market is not anticipating this   Well, Mr Chairman, I'm impressed at the breadth of the expansion that is underway I'm not depressed about it, as Henry seems to be I think we have plenty of room to get an awful lot of unused capacity on the scene; that decline in unused capacity is a very positive phenomenon But in reference to capital goods, I think we've overlooked the fact that in the months of March and April machinery orders exceeded the level of shipments, which I think is rather unusual for this early in the cycle As I read the numbers, I think the capital goods sector is doing better for this stage of the cycle than I would have expected   Well, Mr Chairman, you may not find it surprising that Mr Roberts and I differ rather dramatically   I think the staff paper on the behavior of M1 was very good in that it pointed out that not only is the velocity of  -22-    5/24/83  M1 not currently predictable but we have no basis for assuming that it will be predictable in the foreseeable future, because we have had a changed concept--one which blends transactions balances with savings balances in unknown proportions And I think our current posture of telling the market that we are not targeting Ml but are watching it is creating instability in the marketplace, which is counterproductive to our objectives I think we have seen responses in the marketplace to M1 numbers which, while they are not of the magnitude of earlier years, are certainly not very productive And it seems to me that the time has come to tell the market that, at least for the foreseeable future, we don't have any basis for confidence that we can predict the velocity of M1 and, therefore, we are abandoning Ml and are not going to watch it We will publish it weekly for historical interest only It seems to me that the time is right I thought it was right in February to get rid of Ml but it seems to me that the evidence since February should lend some weight to my case that we ought to start moving away from consideration of Ml as a target or as something that we watch--whatever that means   Operationally, we have target ranges for M2 and M3 and we can operate on those   At the last meeting I didn't have any confidence that the current level of interest rates would support a broad-based expansion but I think the evidence of the last month or so is that, at least for the time being, we can produce an expansion at the current rates I would design the instructions to the Manager to say maintain the current level of interest rates And if the $250 million borrowing level is what the staff says [would do that], I would accept that   Well, the real issue is what level of the funds rate we should be shooting for  -34-    5/24/83  SPEAKER(?) Sure   Given the instability in the relationship between the funds rate and borrowing, that's the issue That's where the action is going to come from in the marketplace   I think the use of "transactions balances" as you proposed is misleading in the sense that it assumes we can measure transactions balances Part of the problem with Ml is that it's now a blurring of transactions balances and savings accounts And how do we know transaction balances are up?   Sure Say that because that's what you mean   But I read the economic numbers and I was pleased Apparently some of you were displeased You have the idea the economy is roaring ahead in such an uncontrolled--   So you're really making a move based on Ml; you're not making a move based on--  SPEAKER(?) No, that's wrong   But we want it to gain some momentum, don't we?   We have more slack than we've had since the 1930s  -39-    5/24/83   I'd like to see us use up some of that slack for--   I think the analogy Jerry drew of 1976-77 is far from correct We are now in the middle of 1975 in terms of that   In either direction   Well, we say we don't pay much attention   And it also place more emphasis on Ml than on M2 and M3   Well, we're increasing reserve restraint when M2 and M3 are falling below their--   Why aren't we talking about increasing the funds rate to 8-3/4 to 9 percent? Isn't that really the issue?   Yes, but that's the understanding That's what we're voting for  -53-    5/24/83   It's to snug or not to snug  SPEAKER(?) It's under 9 percent or--   Not very much further   It's pension plans, which are carried in a state's budget as an expense   You're showing in 1984 a drop of 08 in the unemployment rate associated with a 42 percent real growth rate My staff suggests that that is a rather large drop in the unemployment rate historically for a 42 percent real growth rate Are you assuming labor force growth is dropping off sharply or what is it?   Really? As a matter of fact, our staff thinks it's high    7/12-13/83   I would agree with that proposition   One newspaper article I saw that I thought was rather interesting talked about the second quarter as the strongest quarter we've had since the first quarter of 1981--not that I'm suggesting the second quarter is going to be similar But it seems to me that the risks of aborting the recovery are still pretty high  -14-    7/12-13/83   Of course, most corporate bonds are bought by pension funds that don't pay any taxes   That excludes foreign borrowing; it doesn't exclude foreign investment   Mr Chairman, I think there's something new on the horizon as far as the aggregates are concerned, and that is the 5 percent capital limitation on large banks and the impact that may have once we get back to an era where we see strong demand for business loans occurring again at the large banks I think we will find a number of banks running into this limitation and doing what they did in 1969--packaging these loans and moving them out into the market So, what will happen is that we will get a slower rate of growth of bank liabilities and a larger rate of growth in market instruments, which might impact both M1 and M2 and have some relevance to the usefulness of M3 as a target Have you given any thought to this?   But would you agree that there is a further potential here for a different kind of bank behavior?   Yes, but in 1969, when we had a similar situation whereby the large banks were constrained by Regulation Q, we saw a big ballooning in open market borrowing by the corporate sector   But it could still change the percent of credit raised through the banking system as against the open market   I'd like to suggest, Mr Chairman, that the model has one basic flaw and that is that the character of M2 in 1983 and the years to come is radically different than the character in the years before And we have no reason to think that we can anticipate how the relationship of M2 is likely to behave relative to nominal GNP That is the thrust of Mr Lindsey's memorandum We could very well see a situation in which we push interest rates up and M2 responds by rising, depending on whether the banks want to fund themselves through money market accounts or large CDs It seems to me that the model simply doesn't have any rational basis   Yes   I would agree with that; I think that 11-1/2 percent is too high for 1983   I agree with lowering it for 1984 to 11 percent   I think a 1/2 point   But I think we ought to give some weight to the fact that we have a very optimistic inflation forecast in '84   Well, I think one has to make a judgment as to whether a 4-1/2 percent real growth rate would be excessive for '84 or whether we should allow perhaps for a little less favorable result on inflation than we're forecasting   I think we know a lot more about that than we do about the new M2 to GNP   The demand for credit is directly related to the level of interest rates The level of M2 may or may not be   But I think the 11 percent [top of the range] will give us plenty of leeway   You're right, Paul It is high relative to the ranges for M2 and M3 But that's because we are thinking about the midpoint with respect to debt and we're thinking about the target as the upper limit with respect to M2 and M3   Yes, but I think you overlook the fact that in the second year of an expansion the velocity of M2 normally drops   Some people are worried about a rapid expansion   Mr Chairman, in the last three expansions, in the second year of expansion the velocity of M2 declined on the average about 26 percent   But if [the premise] is that we don't know what the velocity is today, then we shouldn't have a target for M2 And that is my position   My position, Mr Chairman, is that we shouldn't have a target for M2, but--   But in any case we wouldn't want to see the rate of growth of debt exceed 11 percent in any scenario I can think of   In the second year in the last three expansions the velocity of debt declined by 12 percent and then it approached zero thereafter  -37-    7/12-13/83   I think one point would be acceptable   Same thing   That's faint praise, though   The market watches it because we watch it   For M1 it has been 27 in the last three expansions   That's the second year It's higher in the first year; it's 52 in the first year   And Ml has?   There's no doubt that we've moved in the market   It would force a change in the prime rate   I think we could very easily see the prime rate go to 9-1/2 percent   I would support the status quo policy of alternative A   So this is more generous than alternative B?   Alternative B is 9-1/2 to 10 percent   We're already up to 9-1/4 percent on the funds rate, so you're only talking about 1/4 point and that I think could be encompassed within the statement of no significant further move   But if we really would be concerned to see the rate go above 9-1/2 percent, it seems strange to me to raise the upper limit to 11 percent   A skewed median   Yes, that ought to come in earlier in the introductory paragraphs, not in this paragraph   We have second-year velocity expansion as high as 43   We could underline it even better by eliminating M1 guidelines   It would be too much   Some work I've done is supportive of your feeling on the capital goods sector I've compared the current expansion to the expansion of 1975-76 and in general the broad measures show that we're tracking very closely to that expansion One sector that is different, even though the capital goods people in the  -11-    8/23/83  Middle West may not appreciate it at the moment, is that capital goods orders are coming in much stronger than they did at the corresponding phase of the 1975-76 expansion   But doesn't that side hit the lag in any event?   We don't know   I would remind you, Ted, that we're not targeting Ml; we're only monitoring it   Net, I don't think it's a half point except for the prime rate and the funds rate; the bill rate went up 25 basis   Well, Mr Chairman, I've been looking for some signs of crowding out in the staff projections; I don't see any through 1984 Presumably, if nothing is done on the budget deficit, we will reach a point where the total demand for credit is going to require some reduction in housing, but apparently that is not going to take place in 1984 I assume it's because the corporate financing gap, which is projected to be negative this year, is very small next year Have you attempted to calculate when this day of reckoning is going to be if it's not in 1984?   Well, what I meant is the level of crowding out that would require a substantial reduction in housing from the current level   They show 18 million starts in the last quarter of '84   The answer is that they haven't looked into '85 far enough Pretty clearly, the problem is going to come when the corporate financing gap starts to grow, and that means a counter- balancing decline in housing to permit that financing to take place And the question is When does that process start?   Then you could handle that in a conference call We could make a directive based on an existing understanding that if we get the kind of--  -32-    10/4/83   Why not?   How many recessions can we assume?   I have an intuitive feeling that your 1 percent productivity assumption is too pessimistic just because I see so many structural changes that were made in the last three years in terms of reducing staff overhead and in terms of changes in work rules When we went through the 1970s with a lower rate of productivity growth than we could explain on the basis of the ordinary analytical factors, we got a big negative residual It seems to me that maybe we will start to see some bounceback; maybe we'll start getting a positive residual What was the basis for your 1 percent productivity assumption, which I think is 1 percentage point too low?   One thing clear from Chart 13 is that the consumer--   Well, I think a different model, like the one that Tony talked about that incorporates--   If you plugged in a couple of recessions in the model, you'd get different results   I think the answer is clear, Mr Chairman We have to get the productivity gain up to 4 percent That would take care of the whole thing!   The first two quarters of 1981--   Well, Mr Chairman, even though I believe in an activist monetary policy, I think there are times when the best thing to do is to do nothing It seems to me that the case that Lyle made is one which has a reasonably high probability of being right I think we have an environment for a strong surge in capital spending next year but the case is not that clear that we ought to be moving right now One thing that I think we learned from the May 24 decision of the Committee is that with the new mortgage market we really have a very powerful instrument in monetary policy in that the mortgage rate now is so responsive to changes in monetary policy We used to think of a six-month lag between a change in policy and the impact in real activity What we found when we pushed up interest rates in June is that we got a decline in new home sales in July, a decline in permits in August, and a decline in starts in September The textbook would suggest that we should not expect that prompt a response I think the reason we got it is that we now have a mortgage market in which the thrift institutions are mortgage bankers; they take in mortgage  -60-    11/14-15/83  packages and sell them in the market And they have to get a market rate on them if they're going to sell them So, that means that a fairly modest change in monetary policy can have a pretty big impact on the housing sector pretty fast   Well, there certainly hasn't been much of a firming in bond yields and the short-term money rate structure has been moving down   I think this is the tool we can use when we get evidence that the capital goods boom is really taking off I don't think the evidence is strong enough yet, so I would argue for alternative B   January of 1981  SPEAKER(?) January, 1982   January, 1982   We pushed short-term interest rates up 400 basis points in response to a rise in Ml   The beginning clause "Depending on the evidence about the strength of economic recovery and"--   But we could change it to read October through December Then we could put 7 percent   Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with the statements of Governor Gramley I opposed moving to contemporaneous reserve accounting on the grounds that it didn't make sense unless one believed that Ml was a sensible target for policy But now that we've made this investment, I think we ought to look upon it as a sunk cost and as something that we will have in place in the event we ever seriously want to go to pursuing Ml again I don't think the fact that we've made this investment should automatically push us into changing the way we're currently running monetary policy I agree with Lyle I think it would have been a big mistake if we had had this in place 6 months ago and had pursued a much more aggressively easy policy, which we would have had to do I don't think we can substitute this new system, in this context, for the good judgment we have been using   I think Ml is a random walk  -15-    12/19-20/83   Mr Chairman, I have a lot of problems with this, as you might surmise It seems to me that the only range that we can have much confidence is going to be predictably related to a 9 percent nominal GNP growth is the range for credit I've been arguing for a couple of years now that the changed character of M1 means that its relationship to the nominal GNP is not predictable And it seems to me that I have two years of pretty good evidence on my side To assume, as apparently is being done here, that we will get a more or less normal return to historical Ml velocity--I hope that turns out to be the case if that range is adopted--is an act of faith rather than an assumption with any scientific basis I think the ranges for M2 and M3 are even worse, because the history of the last 25 years shows that in the second year of expansion on the average M2 and M3 velocity declined by 2-1/2 percent Therefore, if one wanted to have the range wide enough to finance a 9 percent nominal GNP growth, the upper limit ought to be 11-1/2 percent I'm not persuaded that the staff has made a very strong case to the effect that M2 and M3 velocity are going to be so much different in '84 than in the past Also, this year being an election year, I would hope that we could adopt targets that we wouldn't have to be changing just before the election We abandoned the M1 target in mid-1982 and we rebased our Ml target in mid-1983 To do it in mid-1984 might generate the implication that the Federal Reserve was changing course for political reasons So, I think it's more important this year than in most years that we have some reasonable degree of confidence that the targets we're setting are compatible with our nominal GNP objective I don't think we can have that confidence for these ranges for Ml, M2, and M3   I don't know I don't know where to set a range for Ml or what base [period] to use for it I would rather eliminate Ml as a target As for taking the position to call it something else --say, a monitoring range--to my observation the market doesn't seem to notice the difference between a monitoring range and a target I think the Ml numbers there are probably sounder than the numbers for M2 and M3 I just am not persuaded that the performance of M2 and M3 is going to be that dramatically different from all previous second years of expansion in the last 25 years   Mr Chairman, in terms of the strength of the economy, I think one could make an argument for some snugging up at this point in time I think the evidence in housing is that that sector has adapted pretty well to the current level of rates I don't think there is room in the economy, given the strength of the capital goods sector, for any substantial revival in the strength of housing But at the same time I could accept alternative B as written or some snugging up; I don't feel a strong conviction as to which one is right  -59-    12/19-20/83   I think it could be eliminated if you tell the market we're following a fundamentally different policy   By the time they read it, it's too late We should say "Happy Valentine's Day"!   Mr Chairman, I have a feeling that the exchange market for the dollar is exhibiting all the characteristics of the top of a bull market and that when the turn does come it could be precipitous; the market could very well overshoot on the down side I understand the constraints placed on us by Treasury policy positions, but it seems to me that this would be a good time for us to begin stockpiling currencies to use if and when we get the kind of decline in the dollar that I feel is on the way   But for precisely that reason it may take a very sharp decline in the dollar to maintain the inflows   Yes, but if the market perceives a 20 percent drop in the dollar, a small movement in interest rates is not going to stop it   I have a question I don't know whether it's appropriate now or later, but one of the problems that I have with the forecast is that it doesn't seem to be compatible with the M2 assumption Would you prefer to defer that question until later on?    1/30-31/84   If I may comment, since I raised the issue of M2 ranges and the same thing also applies to M3 ranges Since 1960, in the second year of an expansion the rates of growth of both M2 and M3 averaged 2-1/2 percentage points higher than the nominal GNP, which is to say velocity declined by 2-1/2 percent We're showing targets here for M2 and M3 that are at or below the nominal GNP Now, I am not saying that Steve is wrong; he may be right But if he is right, I'm just saying that these ranges represent a marked departure from the historical [pattern] This does suggest to me the fundamental issue that the character of both M1 and M2 have so changed that we cannot have any confidence in our ability to forecast the velocity of either one of them And I would extend that now to M3 I've already seen the First National Bank of Boston at the end of the year make a decision--in a situation where the holding company capital was pretty strong but the lead bank capital was a little submarginal--to move loans out to their subsidiary banks to improve the lead bank capital ratio I think what is likely to happen, if we get into a tight money market and strong loan demand, is that we're going to see a repetition of what we saw in 1969 The banks are going to start moving the loans off their books entirely That will mean they will keep the risk but plant the paper in the market someplace, in which case M3 will no longer be a sensible indicator for monetary policy If we really don't have a good basis for knowing whether M2 velocity should be minus 1/2 or plus 2-1/2 percent--if the range of uncertainty is that big--it raises serious questions in my mind as to whether these aggregates are sensible tools for targeting monetary policy  -20-    1/30-31/84   Well, they had subsidiary banks whose capital position was okay   Well, sure They have to [unintelligible]   Yes Shifting the loans among the subsidiaries doesn't affect M3 I just pointed that out to note that the process has already started The first stage is that they move it to the subsidiary; the second stage is that they move it out of the bank's balance sheet entirely   Yes That's what they did in '69   Could I change that to read no M1, M2, or M3 targets?   Yes   But would you really want to raise interest rates if the nominal GNP was coming in at the 9 percent that you forecast?   I thought they were quite comprehensive!   When we talk about the objective of the Committee to move toward price stability, I think the concept of how we do that is important It seems to me that our objective in this phase of the economic expansion should be to keep the inflation rate from going up above the 4 to 5 percent range, not to try to decelerate the inflation during an economic expansion because I just don't think that's a reasonable objective But if we can keep it within a 4 to 5 percent range during this expansion, when we come out of the next recession it ought to be in the 2 to 3 percent range I think that's how we're going to get inflation down We're deluding ourselves if we think that we can so manage monetary policy that we can have both an expanding economy and a decelerating inflation rate I don't think in  -35-    1/30-31/84  history, at least in the American economic history with which I'm familiar, that that has ever happened   Farm prices, but not--   That's only if you're looking upon it as a possible range If you're looking upon the debt target as the midpoint--   Well, the debt range could be cut because I think 11 percent is too much   The normal relationship is that it should increase about 1 percent faster than GNP in the second year of expansion   The virtue of leaving it is that we would have something to reduce in the future   That would be a step in the right direction   Well, it says "continue to receive," which implies the same weight as in the past   In the reference to growth in debt, rather than "financial debt" don't you mean "nonfinancial debt"?   In the last paragraph it says "Growth in financial debt is expected to be within the range established for the year"   Apparently, it's too well!   I agree with Pres I think the weight of the evidence in the last month is that the growth rate in the economy is decelerating And the fact that the leading indicator series index was up 06 confirms that because that's a standardized index where the normal month's change is 1 percent So, the 06 increase suggests a slowing in the rate of growth   The trend norm for that index, Paul, would be a 1 percent growth rate   No, the index--   Maybe we ought to get a paper out on how we--   I'm quite sure I'm right that anything less than a 1 percent rise would suggest some modest deceleration in the growth rate of the economy   The market has matured   As far as the regulatory aspect, the New York Reserve Bank could still exercise some surveillance over the market even though we were not operating in acceptances as RPs Is that dependent upon--   Couldn't all that be brought over to Part I?   It was also a pretty lousy decade for corporate profits   Well, Mr Chairman, I have a question for Mr Kichline I've been going around New England giving speeches against the deficit and I argue that the problem with a deficit that doesn't decline as the economy expands is that at some point in 1985 we are likely to see a capital goods boom--which is clearly showing signs of developing great momentum now and by a year from now ought to have enough momentum so that the corporate sector will have to come into the credit markets to take a substantial amount of the total credit flows And at that point in time interest rates are going to have to go up enough so as to squeeze back the interest sensitive sectors of the economy--namely housing and automobiles--sufficiently to make room for the increased corporate demand for credit Now, I look at your  -41-    3/26-27/84  projection through '85 and I don't see any squeeze on the interest sensitive sectors Sure, housing starts come down a bit from what we have now but throughout '85 they are running at about the same level as in '83 And the automobile industry is projected to show a substantial continued rise throughout the period to a level substantially above the '83 level Paul Craig Roberts might look at this and say "Gee, that's not too bad What are you guys worried about the deficit for?" My questions is Should I revise my speech?   But the question is When do we reach a level of total demand for credit that will require a substantial contraction in housing? That's what I would like to know   I know That's right   The issue is that if rates go high enough, they won't be able to find enough customers who are eligible to borrow   May I suggest that Dallas is not the United States? Certainly, I don't see a lot of speculative building in housing going on in New England   I just have a hard time reconciling myself to this picture of another year and three quarters with no serious problem in either housing or automobiles I hope it works out that way, but it just seems to me too good to be true   Steve, I'm surprised at the very small estimate that you came up with on M2 with respect to the IRA accounts We are talking about an awful lot of money here   Do we have very good data on the IRA accounts?  -53-    3/26-27/84   Mr Chairman, I would support alternative B I don't have the confidence in the behavior of M1 that Steve suggests he has--that, after not having served as a very useful target in '82 and '83, it is somehow going to revert to its old historic norm in '84 But I think the rate of growth of debt is quite clearly excessive That growth plus the extraordinarily strong economic numbers that have come in tell me that we have to move now to moderate the rate of advance in the economy I think moving to "C" and having a funds rate possibly as high as 12-1/2 percent is a little overkill It seems to me that we need more feedback from the effect of interest rates than would be implied in alternative C, and the idea of returning to the old automaticity sends a chill up my spine I certainly would like to restrain the funds rate range to no higher than the "B" level   Except that you have promoted M1   Isn't what we're seeking a borrowing level that will be compatible with a 10-1/2 percent funds rate?   So we could see a low funds rate tomorrow?   And this would be revised to reflect any discount rate changes?   Also, Mr Chairman, with a 2 percentage point spread between the discount rate and the funds rate, I think a discount rate increase of only a half point would be interpreted by the market as acting a little tentatively   I'm talking about 1 point We have a 2 point spread   We've been using this language for quite some time   We don't sense in New England the kind of change in attitudes that I've heard from Philadelphia and Cleveland and other places I think the mood is still very buoyant and that may reflect the fact that we're primarily capital goods producers and the capital goods sector is doing extremely well I've compared the rate of growth of capital goods orders in this expansion to the expansions that began in '71 and in '75 and it is very much stronger We have a real capital goods boom underway, which ought to augur well for productivity in the future We think the staff forecast is a pretty good forecast but if it's wrong, that it probably is going to be wrong on the low side in terms of the growth rate   Right   Well, Mr Chairman, in the absence of the Continental situation I would have supported alternative C because I think the economy is still very strong Since it is a long time until the next meeting, I still don't have a high degree of confidence that we can get through with an 11-1/2 percent cap on the funds rate But I would assume that if the situation arose, we would have a telephone conference call anyway, so I would support "B"   The one piece of evidence we have that might lend some support to Pres's position--which I share, incidentally--is that we're seeing this enormous capital goods boom occur at a time when the cost of capital is extremely high We discussed this  who is the head of a capital goods producing company had this answer that we have been storing up technology in this country for the past ten years or so that hasn't been applied, and now when companies have the money to invest they find the productivity of the new technology is so high that they can afford it--that it makes sense to go ahead--even though the cost of capital is so high But the fact is that if our corporations are making rational decisions, they are expecting extraordinarily high productivity from the capital in which they are investing   But don't those numbers get very much bigger as you go out a few years?   Well, Mr Chairman, I have a difficult question to ask I don't know who to ask, but the staff is forecasting a $115 billion current account deficit in 1985 and a decline in the exchange rate of the dollar against foreign currencies of 15 percent My question is What levels of interest rates are going to be required to attract that amount of foreign capital to the United States in a regime in which the foreign investor may be contemplating further devaluation of the dollar, and what will be the implications for the economy of that level of interest rates?  -11-    7/16-17/84   I know That's what I don't understand   It seems to me that if there is something wrong with this forecast, it's in this area Can we carry this off neatly without any significant change in interest rates?   But we're also asking the rest of the world after investing $100 billion in the United States this year to come up with another $115 billion   But the fact that that has happened means that at the end of this year foreign investors are going to be sitting with a big accumulation of dollars And the question is whether we can finance this current account deficit without offering much greater inducements for them to hold more dollars   Yes, I understand that  -12-    7/16-17/84   The problem with raising the upper limit for debt is that we would be saying implicitly that we think a 12 percent rate of growth for debt is acceptable   That says it's desirable in this year to have something that's running above the range, it seems to me   It still is It's the only aggregate that predicted a 12 percent rate of growth in nominal GNP in the first half Certainly, M1 didn't and M2 didn't   In other words, if you were to have predicted a nominal GNP of 12 percent, you wouldn't be surprised to see a 13 percent rate of growth in total debt That would be fairly in line with past experience   But it does tell us that the monetary policy in the first half of '84 has been much more expansionary than M1 or M2 would indicate   It depends on the model one is predicting from   Those numbers are not very useful, if we agree to standardize an assumption on the value of the dollar Certainly, our number would be lower on that assumption by 1 percentage point   Yes   In regard to this year?   Mr Chairman, I think it's much more logical for us to be setting targets for '85 in February than it is in July the preceding year In the past we have typically--   Well, that is one reason that I like alternative I--that is, no change in the guidelines for the moment That's not with any conviction that we wouldn't want to change them in February but, obviously, we'll have a lot more information in February in setting these ranges than we do now That seems to me a good argument for staying with the present guidelines, with the understanding that we might, and probably would, want to change them in February I think that would be a better procedure than doing what we've done in the past when we have changed the guidelines at midyear and then felt that we were more or less stuck with those guidelines in February when we really ought to be doing our basic thinking   Well, I'm not saying that we don't present some numbers   Well, that's true, but the kinds of changes we're talking about here are not so dramatic that that is particularly operational   Well, the midpoint of that range would be compatible with an 8-1/2 percent growth in nominal GNP   Yes, but I think one would expect that in a third year of expansion   One thing we ought to keep in mind is that the staff assumes that the reduction of the minimum on the Super NOWs and money market deposit accounts from $2,500 to $1,000 is going to have no effect or a minimal effect Now, if that assumption is wrong, then we might need a larger M1 than we're currently contemplating   We have a little knowledge of what--  -47-    7/16-17/84   Mr Chairman, I support your position I think the evidence does suggest that the economy is decelerating The leading indicators available for June suggest a further slowing ahead of us If we were in the situation where the evidence clearly suggested the opposite, the decision would be a lot more difficult But, I would certainly support alternative B   Maybe that's how we can get the Susan B Anthony coins in circulation!    8/21/84   The one positive factor that you didn't mention, Tony, is that if you compare this expansion to the one of the late 1970s, the rate of wage advance is substantially lower now than it was at the same stage of that expansion   Not yet   I don't think we can really document that yet   Unit labor costs are doing much better now but primarily because the rate of wage advance is much lower   My question for Mr Axilrod is We're seeing a period of relatively modest growth in the monetary aggregates accompanied by a period of sustained, very excessive rates of growth in total credit How do you interpret these different growth rates and what policy implications do they have?   Well, put it this way, then Relative to the nominal GNP, the monetary aggregates have been running very low and the credit aggregates are about in line with what one would have now Put it in those terms   Well, Mr Chairman, I think I understand the advantage of keeping the same specifications as last time   No, without specifying exactly why, I think that's a good idea On the other hand, I think it would be a mistake to lower the borrowing guideline because the market has now caught on to how we are running policy If in following a $1 billion borrowing guideline we were to see interest rates drift down to where we thought they would be at the last meeting, then I think the market would understand that we were not pushing rates down but that rates were going down because of the smaller rate of growth in the economy--if that eventuates If we pushed the guideline down, then I think the market would have a great deal of difficulty understanding why we chose this particular time to move to an overtly easier monetary policy   Yes, exactly Also, if there's any risk of error in the staff forecast, I think the risk lies in the economy being stronger than forecast Therefore, even though the July specifications would seem to be incompatible right now, if the economy is a little stronger then they could become compatible So, I would go along with the same package we had last time   I think the pauses typically come about two years after the beginning of an expansion We normally go into a little slowing period   Mr Chairman, I came into this meeting feeling very optimistic because we've been able to move the economy to a slower growth mode without pushing interest rates higher than we did I was afraid a few months ago; I didn't know what level of the funds rate would be required to slow down the economy I have no concern about a prolonged period of stagnation, much less a recession, simply because I think the fundamental underpinnings to the economy are strong and I think the economy would be very responsive to even a modest downward movement in interest rates, which any prolonged stagnation would tend to generate The main thing I've been concerned about in the near term is the foreign exchange market because it seems to me that there is a speculative bubble in that market It's just  -18-    10/2/84  like the tulip bulb mania Whenever you see a market defying all the fundamentals, which it is doing now, you have to think the time is approaching when a correction has to be made And, obviously, I'm concerned about the interest rate effects of a decline in the dollar So, I think it is very fortunate that if the dollar should start declining fairly soon, it will do so in an economy that is moving ahead at a more reduced rate and the strains on the financial markets will not be as great as they otherwise would I see that as our major problem coming up--how we respond in policy to the financial strains caused by a weaker dollar   Well, Mr Chairman, I would support alternative B with the understanding, as during the last period, that the borrowing limit could be lowered if the aggregates come in extremely weak But I think an 8 to 12 percent fed funds range is no longer appropriate When interest rates were moving up, the lower end of the funds range didn't have much relevance When they start moving down, then it seems to me the lower limit becomes the more relevant one And to me an 8 percent lower limit is simply too low, certainly at this juncture I would hate to see us make the sort of mistake we did in 1981 of pursuing vigorously an M1 that was showing some weakness and pushing rates down and getting an enormous surge of response from the economy again I think that would be very unfortunate It seems to me that we need to probe down on interest rates and not let them move down too sharply   Well, in '81--   The context is different What I'm trying to say is that I don't think in the present context we ought to vigorously pursue a sluggish M1 if it means pushing interest rates down very sharply And, therefore, I think it would be a mistake to have the directive give the Manager leeway to move interest rates down that far I would suggest a 10 to 12 percent range on the funds rate as being much more realistic, and that would require the Committee to make another formal judgment before we went below ten percent   It just seems rather silly to me in this situation to have a number as low as 8 percent when the lower limit is the relevant one   I'm not sure I would have a problem with 10 percent, but certainly anything below 10 percent I think would be a little precipitous right now   I met yesterday with the chairman of the I asked him about the October retail sales He said  that their sales were lower than they expected and as a consequence that their inventories are up about 5 percent from where they thought they would be He attributes it largely to the fact that October weather was unusually warm and that people just don't buy winter clothing until the weather turns cold He is expecting a very strong Christmas selling season That, for whatever it's worth, is the  view   Yes But he thinks he knows why--the weather factor It wasn't something that alarms him   Mr Chairman, I would like to associate myself with the Lyle Gramley school of predicting where we are I think it's very typical toward the second year of an expansion to run into a slower rate of growth in the economy as the economy shifts to a lower rate of inventory accumulation And I think that is exactly what is going on right now I would assess the risks of a recession as close to zero I think the underpinnings of the economy are very strong The most surprising statistic of the last month was the 440,000 increase in employment That--particularly the 55,000 increase in durable goods manufacturing employment--was much bigger than I had expected These are not the kinds of numbers that one sees associated with an early stage of going into a recession Furthermore, we have had a big decline in interest rates I think this economy is going to be very responsive to that We haven't had enough time yet to assess the impact the interest rate decline that has already taken place will have We see one sign in the increase in new home sales and another sign in the strength of the stock market Another sign is [unintelligible] But I think we haven't yet seen the full effect on the real economic activity of the rate declines that have already taken place So, I find the pessimism that I have heard around the table from many sources hard to understand And I don't think this    11/7/84  comes from the fact that I am living in a state that has an unemployment rate of 37 percent   Mr Chairman, I would like to make a comment on our operating procedure It seems to me that the events of this summer uncovered a significant defect in our current operating procedure in that, as a consequence of the Continental situation, the banks' borrowing behavior was very much different than we had assumed at the time of our meeting They had a propensity to bid up the federal funds rate rather than come into the discount window and as a consequence we had a higher level of interest rates, which also fed into long-term bond yields, than the Committee had expected at the time of the meeting If we have an excessively--   Well, it was the July meeting [or perhaps] two meetings ago You recall we were not contemplating a federal funds rate that would go up to the 11-1/2 to 11-3/4 percent area I don't think anyone around the table was talking about that high a level   I would have to look back and find out which meeting it was But I think it is clear that there was a meeting in which as a consequence of this change in behavior we got a tighter federal funds market than any member of the Committee had talked about And it seems to me that if we have a slower economy than we want now, perhaps part of it at least could have been produced by that higher level of interest rates than we contemplated It seems to me that is the fact, and there may be a recurrence of this kind of situation in times to come I just wonder whether we shouldn't take that into account in how we structure the directive Since the  -29-    11/7/84  borrowing [level] is not a key factor in the implementation of monetary policy, if that borrowing [level] produces unexpected results in interest rates, it seems to me that perhaps we ought to have the Committee take a look at the situation by conference call rather than just staying with it and accepting whatever rate comes out of it   I recognize that there are a lot of hazards in targeting the federal funds rate I think the question is whether we ought to have a procedure under which, if the borrowing level is producing a significantly different level of rates than the Committee expected, the Committee should at least take a look at it   Sure That's precisely the point If it's coming from a strong economy and is expected, that's one thing If it's coming from a deviant behavior on the part of the banks, that's another thing It seems to me that our procedures ought to be able to differentiate these   I have a proposal that we ask the staff to take a look at this problem--if you agree that it is one--and to design a proposal for dealing with it in the future   No, I'm not talking about today's meeting  -30-    11/7/84   Beyond that, in line with my previous comments, I would prefer to stand back at the moment with alternative B until we get further information I would be perfectly willing to support a move to a still further lowering of interest rates if the incoming evidence suggests continued weakening in the economy But it seems to me that we ought to stop and take a reading with respect to what impact the rate declines we have already seen will have on the economy before we go further   A few weeks   [Unintelligible] initial claims, basic commodity prices--   Yes sir   Mr Chairman, I appreciate the memorandum that Steve wrote I'm not very enchanted with the idea of solving this problem through automaticity It seems to me that that would be a step backwards toward the kind of interest rate volatility we think we have gotten away from But I do think that in a situation where the Manager finds that he cannot attain his total reserve path and at the same time produce the assumed level of borrowings--which is the case we had this summer--there is an incompatibility in the instructions to    12/17-18/84  the Manager and it ought to be resolved not in some automatic way but by having a conference call to the Committee I suspect we may well have the opposite case in '85 at some point, with total reserves growing faster than the original projection because the Manager is just pushing in nonborrowed reserves at an increased rate in order to meet the borrowing projection I would have the Committee decide--on the basis of what is happening to interest rates, the economy, the money supply, the exchange rate, and everything else--how we should deal with this incompatibility in the instructions   The total reserve path comes from the Committee's objective with respect to the aggregates [Required reserves are] plotted out first and then the Manager puts in the [excess reserve allowance] and then the assumed borrowing level is subtracted to form a nonborrowed reserve path So, although we've [not] talked about a total reserves path, that's implicit in the whole operation The problem this summer was that the Desk couldn't hit the total reserve path because it was following a nonborrowed path that was related to a level of borrowing that the market was not doing   That was a product of the banks' aversion to using the discount window, which was reflected in a lower-than- expected level of borrowing relative to the interest rate   My thought is that we'd have a conference call and the Manager would say that we have a situation in which the banks appear to be averse to borrowing from the window and as a consequence they're [bidding] up the funds rate and we're not getting the level of borrowing that we expected to get The question to the Committee then would be Do we want to reduce the borrowing level or not?   I'm talking about in between meetings, if we have an incompatibility in the instructions by this definition   Yes, but there may be times when we might want to adjust the procedure and times when we might not, depending upon the circumstances I'm rather disenchanted with automatic adjustments    12/17-18/84  after our experience of recent years I'd be more comfortable with a judgmental assessment as to what we ought to do to reach our objectives   I forget which meeting it was, but we had an unexpected rise in the funds rate To my knowledge and my recollection, nobody on this Committee contemplated the funds rate going above 11-1/2 percent even though we had a 12 percent [upper limit on the] range That was not the expectation given in the Bluebook as to what the course of action chosen by the Committee would produce in the way of the funds rate The funds rate rose from 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent, not because of any overt decisions on the part of the Committee but because of the change in attitude on the part of the banks to borrowing Now, the question was Should we have responded to that by lowering the borrowing? That's my question   I think it's quite clear with hindsight that we should have said yes But that is clearly hindsight However, I would much prefer that sort of procedure to an automatic response on the part of the Manager in putting in a certain amount of reserves   Well, maybe I'm proposing something we're already following On the other hand, I think there is some merit in thinking of it in terms of a total reserves objective   Mr Chairman, I don't want to miss this opportunity I would simply say that several times around this table  -18-    12/17-18/84  in the past few years I've heard the statement that now M1 has restored its normal velocity relationship And I've always noted that this turned out to be a very temporary phenomenon   I also note that, beginning next year, the minimum deposit on Super NOW accounts drops down to $1,000 I don't know what impact that is going to have I don't see much of a marketing effort around New England to do this, although there's a lot of activity in the money market deposit accounts A lot of the banks have already announced that they're going down to a $1,000 [minimum] on money market deposit accounts But I think M2 could be impacted [Unintelligible] after a few months in which the gap between what we would have expected M1 velocity should be and the actual drops down to close to the normal range I think we ought to consider this, until we have a lot more evidence, as sort of a random distribution of velocity for Ml   All the anecdotal evidence I hear in New England indicates that it has had the effect in the short run of putting a lot of investment plans on the shelf until this is resolved I don't know whether that is true nationally or not, but that's the word I get from industrial people They will wait and see   What are the interest rate implications of an 8 percent decline in the value of the dollar in the short run?   Mr Chairman, I think the staff's forecast is too pessimistic on growth I would expect growth to be more like 4 percent than 3 percent, primarily coming in the first half, because I think we're going to get a very big response to the decline in interest rates that has already taken place I think we have to remember that the economy and M1 respond with a lag to a decline in interest rates We're already seeing some beginning signs such as the rise in permits We've already had a couple of months of increase in new home sales There is some auguring that the consumer is coming out of his summer lull, particularly the new car sales in the first 10 days in December The only sector I'm concerned about is capital spending because of the impact of the tax program--that is, the discussions suggest that the tax program will not go through I don't really think we have a very good fix now on whether we're going to get an impact--at least a short-run impact--on capital spending plans or not I would assume that that will be resolved pretty quickly by the President's State of the Union and budget messages He will have to take a position one way or the other on accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit And if he should take the position of rejecting the Treasury's program, I think the decline in interest rates will reinforce the extraordinary incentives and produce another great upsurge in capital spending So, I'm very optimistic about the first half--much more so than the staff   No I think we can handle a 4 percent growth rate The big problem, or the big imponderable, is what is going to happen to productivity growth I've been very optimistic on productivity, but I must say I haven't gotten much statistical comfort My optimism is relying on the intuitive rather than the statistical because the big jump in employment in the last two months in an economy that's not growing very rapidly surely leads me to expect very poor productivity numbers for the fourth quarter But I'm not sure that we're going to get in 1985 the pretty good productivity performance that would make a 4 percent real growth rate very easy to attain without putting inflationary strains on the economy If we don't get it--if we get a poor productivity record--then I'd have to change my mind on this   No, sir! As I say, I've concluded that M1 velocity is a random walk and I think we have to look at other things If we ever get back to a point where M1 velocity becomes reliable again, I'd be quite delighted But I think it would hazardous for us to make the assumption that that time is now   No, I think the ranges for next year are compatible with, say, an 8-1/2 percent nominal GNP rise, within which I think a 4 percent real growth rate would be comfortably encompassed So, if we're going to continue to have targets for the aggregates, I don't see any reason to change any of the ranges  -33-    12/17-18/84   Well, Mr Chairman, I think there is a danger of overreaction here I feel very much the way Lyle does We've had a declining period of interest rates here for only the last three months There are lags in the response of the economy and in the response of M1 to that change I think we ought to give a lot of weight to the fact that interest rates have declined substantially over a very short period of time and do a little more looking to see if we're getting responses from what we've done before we take a major further move   Here's another situation where there may be an incompatibility between the borrowing level and the path for total reserves I think there's incompatibility on the other side of this   Well, I agree with Ed Boehne only more so I think the staff is projecting a smaller real growth for 1985 than we're going to realize I put in a 4 percent number and I think that's a minimum; I really think we'll probably do better than that on real growth It's hard for me to document my position very well on the basis of the numbers that have come in since our last meeting  -18-    2/12-13/85  because they are a fairly mixed bag But one thing that has impressed me in the past few weeks has been the extraordinary strength in the stock market Since the 9th of January the stock market has put on a display of business confidence of a sort that is quite rare in our history I think that we're going to be revising up these real growth projections and by midyear, say, I think that is going to put us in a very difficult position with respect to the effects of our actions on interest rates So, it seems to me that our problems in 1985 are going to be the problems of a very strong economy and they are going to be just as difficult to deal with, and perhaps more so, than the problems we would face if the economy came in weaker   I think what you really mean to say is that the real world is fine but the financial world is terrible   Also, Mr Chairman, with the revised numbers that we soon will be putting out, the deviation from the midpoint is down to three-tenths of 1 percent   I think there's a good argument for not changing anything in that we don't have the faintest idea what the velocities are going to be anyway Therefore, why not--   And I don't see any point in changing the debt range because, historically, an 8 to 11 percent range for debt gives a lot of room for 8 percent nominal GNP growth   If there is a difference from the historical [experience], it's the fact that our total expenditures are running substantially above the GNP   Therefore, you could argue that you need more debt But don't you also need more money? Why do you need more debt and not more money to finance a greater level of expenditures? It's not immediately apparent to me  -32-    2/12-13/85   Well, I agree with Governor Gramley From the standpoint of the effect on expectations, I think it is wise normally not to change the guidelines unless there is a compelling reason, and I don't see a compelling reason to change the guidelines If we get trend velocity we can finance an 8 percent nominal GNP rise very comfortably within the alternative II guidelines I don't know whether we're going to get trend velocity or not If we don't--if we get an aberrant velocity behavior--we may have to change the guidelines within the year But I don't think we ought to assume anything other than trend velocity at this point in time And I think alternative II would meet our economic objectives very easily given that assumption   I think we ought to have a lot of humility around this table in forecasting velocity It seems to me that all we can do is assume that we're going to get trend velocity; anything else is pure speculation   Well, I would buy alternative B I think Roger has made a very good point that the borrowing target ought to be higher than $300 million--more like $400 million   It should read "the absence of reserve [pressures]"   Unless we rebase   We did   We eliminated it for one year  -62-    2/12-13/85   Well, Mr Chairman, when the Ohio situation broke, I was very concerned because in Massachusetts we have more non- federally insured deposits in savings banks alone [than in Ohio] and then another $5 billion in cooperative banks and credit unions   Right   I tried 10 years ago, in collaboration with the bank commissioner, to get a bill through requiring federal deposit insurance on all depository institutions in the state I didn't get very far I was afraid in this instance that we'd have a story in the Boston Globe to the effect that what is happening in Ohio is nothing compared to what could happen in Massachusetts and that the paper would list all of the uninsured banks and so on That hasn't happened While several of the banks substantially increased their currency orders to be ready for a run, the run has not happened But we have had one positive effect from it so far, and that is that about 25 of these institutions have applied for FDIC insurance Most of them are the larger banks and most of them are in pretty good shape, so I don't think there's any question about their getting insurance If we get enough of them signed up, I think the $400 million fund that we have will be able to take care of the smaller institutions and we won't have a situation in Massachusetts where the failure of one institution could absorb the whole fund  On the economic side, Mr Chairman, you're right that the computer industry is suffering a little slowdown here But I think that's a reflection not only of an economic slowdown in general but of the fact that this industry had enormous growth last year Whereas a year ago there was a shortage of semiconductors, now there's a glut; and there's a glut of computer hardware in general But I noted that in February there was a big increase in new orders for computers; it could be that we're coming to the end of that inventory adjustment problem A month ago I took the position that I thought the economy would do better than the staff projection I still feel that way, but the evidence coming in during the past month certainly has not lent any support to my position I had expected a much bigger bounce from the decline in interest rates than we have gotten The decline in interest rates may have increased the demand for money but it doesn't seem to have increased the demand for goods and services Just why we have had such a modest response to what was a fairly substantial decline in interest rates is not very clear to me So, I'm inclined to have the same view as Ed Boehne that despite the growth of M1, which has often not been a very good indicator for monetary policy in recent years, it would be wise for us to sit still until we see how the numbers for the real economy are going to go As I said, they have been difficult for me to understand in the light of the decline in interest rates, the strength of the stock market, and other  -18-    3/26/85  indicators that had suggested an upturn in the animal spirits That's not showing through in the market place, and maybe it will, but until then--   Yes, I think you're quite right You're also right in saying we are in an unprecedented situation here I don't think our economic history can tell us an awful lot about what the probable future is going to hold when the basic conditions are so out of line with anything we have ever seen before That again, I suppose, is an argument for not making any big move here   Well, Mr Chairman we have a conflict between M1 and the economic data It seems to me that the more sensible thing would be to stay where we are until we see how this conflict is resolved If we have a second quarter of strong M1 and relatively sluggish economic indicators, as we had for example in 1982, then I think we simply have to revise the target for M1 I think there is a real possibility we might have to do that But in the meantime, I think alternative B is the most sensible course   Do you think the Committee ought to hire a chaplain?   I want to applaud the Board for reducing the discount rate, although the timing I found a little surprising But--   I think [unintelligible] that the economy has performed in a much weaker fashion than I expected or than I think most of us expected a few months ago I am finding in the comments of businessmen--right across the board regardless of the industry, again with the exception of the defense industry--that they all tell me that orders are coming in at lower rates than they had contemplated And there is a very sobering mood developing Another phenomenon--I don't know whether it is confined to the New England area and I would like  -11-    5/21/85  to hear some other comments on this--is that a lot of businessmen are telling me that they have been waiting for the dollar to go down so that they can begin competing in world markets again They have about given up on that, so they are planning in a great many industries to expand their production facilities abroad That is the only way that they can compete in world markets; they can't do it from a US base In the past few years, the decline in US direct investment abroad has been an element of strength in the dollar But if we see a pretty widespread movement to build new production capacity abroad, that could very well put downward pressure on the dollar at some point if the movement got very far Has anybody else run into this phenomenon?   But they are beginning to plan to do it now That's the difference   Yes   We have observed in Boston that the only thing in the economy that is very strong is M1 I have distributed to all of you a chart that I thought was rather interesting entitled "Super NOW Account Yields" In the last six months more than a third of the growth of M1 has been in Super NOW accounts   Ten billion dollars out of the $26 billion growth in M1 has been in Super NOW accounts In the prior 6 months, instead of growing at a $10 billion rate, they grew at less than $2 billion I think the answer to why M1 exhibited slow growth in the middle of the year and very rapid growth in recent months is shown on this chart The interest rates on Super NOWs as administered by the banks tend to be rather sluggish relative to market rates When rates went up sharply in the spring and summer, the opportunity cost of holding Super NOWs relative to money market mutual funds rose substantially, so we had a very slow rate of growth in Super NOWs As the opportunity cost dropped--there's now only a one percent differential and I suspect in the weeks ahead it may drop below the one percent level--you would expect people to--   The difference between the [yields on] money market mutual funds and the Super NOW accounts is about 1 percentage point In the original that bottom chart was colored; the differential was about 1 percentage point as of April I suspect now it is probably down lower than that As the opportunity cost changes I think you would expect that the public's willingness to hold Super NOWs relative to money market funds would change; and it changes in precisely the direction that you would expect So, I think this explains a part of the acceleration in M1 growth--not all of it, but a part of it It also raises again the question that I have been raising for several years If a large, and the fastest growing, component of M1 is paying a rate very close to the money market mutual funds rate, should you expect the aggregate that contains that rapidly growing component to behave the same way as it has in the past? Quite clearly, it seems to me, the new M1 is going to be more interest sensitive than the old M1 as long as the stickiness of the Super NOW account rate persists; and the relationship between the new M1 and the nominal GNP is going to be as unpredictable as it has been during the past few years   But it does suggest to me that with rates coming down and the differential narrowing, if anything, we could very well see sustained strong growth in M1   It does suggest that if M1 keeps rising very rapidly between now and July that we might have to rebase it for 1985   Well, Mr Chairman, I think last week was an historic week in the evolution of the thinking of the Federal Reserve On Thursday we announced a $2-1/2 billion rise in M1 and on Friday we announced a discount rate cut, which shows that we're really learning from experience   As I read the numbers, it's clear to me that the US economy--and I think the world economy--needs a lower level of interest rates in the United States to the extent that that can be produced without jeopardizing our determination to control inflation It seems to me, therefore, that it's appropriate for us to probe a little on interest rates I'm not completely persuaded that what has happened already will be enough But I think we ought to sit back and assess things before we move any further So, I would support "B" with Jerry Corrigan's $350-$375 million on borrowing   I just wonder whether the weakness in M2 and M3 is--and we saw this at the same time last year--an IRA account phenomenon   Well, as I recall, didn't we have a similar kind of weakness last spring, Steve?   Well, Mr Chairman, I guess I am the optimist in this crowd The degree of pessimism I have heard around the table surprises me I think that what we have been seeing in recent months is fairly typical of what we see toward the end of the second year of expansion housing has run out of gas, insofar as an upturn, and we have had an inventory adjustment Go back to years like 1962, for example I remember; I was at the Treasury There was real concern that we were going into recession For some reason, after the Cuban missile crisis, consumers decided to up their spending Maybe they were happy to be still alive I don't know what the connection was, but the recession of '62 disappeared very rapidly I am encouraged by signs that I see in the financial markets in response to what we have done already There is strength in the stock market; I am very impressed at the response in the long-term bond market, where we have gotten more bang than I expected we would get And so far as the consumer sector is concerned, the Michigan Survey of consumer confidence, which had been tending to show some deterioration in the last six months, turned up again pretty substantially in the month of June So, it just seems to me that the level of pessimism around here is a little beyond what the situation merits, and that is one reason our forecast is significantly higher than the Board staff's forecast   That's me You didn't call on me Norm was supposed to tell you  -23-    7/9-10/85   I'd like to refer first to the table at the rear   We have been trying to describe the deviation of the aggregates from their traditional historical behavior in terms of two things one, financial innovations; and two, the decline in the interest rates This table suggests to me that there are other factors of major consequence involved in this situation that we don't understand I refer you to total liquid assets, L, and call your attention to the fact that the behavior--the deviation from the 1970- 1980 trend--is very similar for total liquid assets as it is for the monetary aggregates   This is a cumulative deviation of the velocity of these various aggregates   Right, from the 1970-1980 trend line Now, total liquid assets should not be affected by financial innovation because all of these new instruments are presumably included in the aggregate and switches among them really don't have any effect Secondly, I have not been able to figure out any reason why a decline in interest rates should lead people to want to hold more liquid assets relative to nominal income In fact, I think you could argue-- thinking back to my investment days--that you would get the opposite effect; that is, the decline in short-term rates should lead people to push into longer-dated assets in order to try to maintain their yields But the fact is that the movement of M1 velocity, although the amplitude is greater, is year to year very similar We have, I think, in the case of total liquid assets a deviation from historical experience that cannot be explained by anything that I have been able to think of, which suggests to me that from a philosophical point of view, something is going on here that we don't know much about This should lead us to conclude two things One, I think, is to try to explain to the public that we can't run a sensible monetary policy by blindly following any of these [monetary aggregates] because we don't know what rate of growth in them is going to be compatible with a reasonable economic performance The second is, that if we have to publish ranges, we should have a propensity to broaden the ranges, because I think quite clearly that we have a problem in trying to use any of these, blindly, as a guide to monetary policy  Now, my second point Steve's paper--and I thought the paper was very well done--argues that super NOW accounts have tended to reduce the interest elasticity of M1 My conclusion is quite the opposite that the way the banks have priced them in fact has led to super NOW accounts increasing the interest elasticity of M1 The  -24-    7/9-10/85  first graph shows that the banks have been fairly responsive in adjusting the money market deposit account rates to changes in the market rate I'm comparing them here to the money market mutual fund rate Therefore, I think you can conclude that M2 is now much less interest sensitive than it used to be And I think the behavior of M2 recently has suggested that If you look at the way the banks have priced super NOW accounts, you would have thought there was a Regulation Q ceiling of 7-1/2 percent on super NOWs because there was no response to this big run-up in interest rates Now, if the banks are going to continue to price super NOW accounts in this fashion, then you can expect that the super NOW is going to increase interest elasticity of M1 If you look at the last chart, the top shows the interest rate spread between super NOW accounts and money market mutual funds and the bottom shows the growth rates of super NOW accounts During the summer of last year the spread had reached around 3 percent against the super NOW; super NOWs were priced about 3 percent below money market mutual funds and the rate of growth of super NOWs dropped to a 3 percent annual rate These are over three month spans When the spread closed up again, with a decline in market rates, the rate of growth of super NOWs moved from a 3 percent to a 45 percent annual rate I submit that, at least until the banks start pricing their products differently, the super NOW account is going to increase the interest elasticity of M1 rather than reduce it   But if they were only adjusted downward, the effect is going to be much like the old Regulation Q ceiling If they don't respond when market rates rise, we should expect that the regular super NOW will drop very sharply   I think we are in a situation similar to 1982 where we looked around the economy and the only thing that we could find that was really strong was M1 We concluded at that time that M1 was not giving a proper signal and it seems to me that we ought to draw that same conclusion today   We wouldn't have if we had followed the M1 target   We would have had a world depression   I think we can afford quite a bit   I question the relevance of the experience of the postwar period I think the experience of recent years shows that it has taken more money, more liquid assets, and more debt to generate one dollar of nominal GNP The old relationships are not holding up, and at some point in time we've got to recognize that   My problem with setting new guidelines is that if we have every reason to believe that we are going to get still further lagged responses to declines in interest rates that have already taken place, that's a big uncertainty It, therefore, makes more sense to me to set aside M1 as a target variable for this year and reconsider it again for next year   Well, if M1 is too high because the economy is stronger, the other measures are going to be too high as well I don't see that retaining M1 is that critical   We did it in 1982   I just have one thing, Mr Chairman As I said, the evidence suggests to me that nobody knows whether it's a permanent change or not But the fact is that it does seem now to take more money, more liquid assets, and more debt to generate a dollar of the GNP Therefore, it seems to me that there is a strong case for maintaining the ranges and making no change for next year   I'm for [retaining them] where they are   I don't--   I don't see any case for reducing the M3 and debt ranges What rationale is there for that?   Yes, but I think there's going to be--  -52-    7/9-10/85   1986 will probably have a higher nominal GNP than 1985   They both seem unrealistic to me, Mr Chairman One is growth of 1/2 to 1 percent June to December and the other is 28 percent; and both of those seem improbable No, that's not right  -63-    7/9-10/85   I thought you were talking about 7 or 8?   I could take it; I was looking at the wrong numbers   Now ask about the other one   We could preface it, Mr Chairman, by saying in the light of the fact that in 3 out of the past 4 years we have set aside or rebased the M1 target   I have a technical question, Steve In the Bluebook you mentioned state and local government advance refunding borrowing Are they included in the net debt number?   Isn't that double counting?   So, that is a fairly major factor inflating the debt number now   Since interest rates are down, what they do is fund municipal issues and invest the proceeds in government [securities] and pick up the differential Or, I guess maybe the Treasury doesn't let them do that anymore   Yes So, I should think those should be netted out of the number   Presumably, we don't include bank liabilities and also include bank investments in short-term securities So we have tried to net where we can It seems to me that if we have an area where clearly we have double counting and can identify it, that it ought to be eliminated   The leading indicators showed a little firming pattern in May and June, but what sort of depressed me is that the  -11-    8/20/85  July numbers for the leading indicators that we have don't look all that great They reflect a definite weakening from the May-June number   No, I'm just looking at the individual [components that we have]   Do you also have double counting in the mortgage backed securities in the debt number?   Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with everything that Governor Martin said The outlook is extremely uncertain I don't think there is very considerable risk of a recession developing, but I think there is a considerable risk of a sub-optimal [economic] growth rate, more of the same that we have had in the first half And it seems to me that there is no need for even a moderate upward movement in interest rates until we have some conviction that the economy really is strengthening, and I don't see that in the numbers yet I see it in the forecast, but I don't see it anywhere else As to this credibility issue, it seems to me that if we were in a position where the credibility of the Federal Reserve was rather shaky, one could make a case for moving--despite the uncertainty about the economic outlook--simply because a loss of credibility would have very important consequences in the foreign exchange market, for example But I don't see that as I observe the foreign exchange market I don't see participants in that market worried about the Federal Reserve following inflationary monetary policies So I don't see that there is a need, in order to maintain our credibility, to do something that we don't think necessarily has to be done because of the state of the economy So it seems to me that a stand-pat policy is an appropriate policy here   It is not showing up in the bond market or the foreign exchange market   Even if we aren't there   Did we contemplate buying foreign [currencies] in a situation when the dollar is rising?   Why do we say "relatively rapid growth"? That sounds like it wasn't really very rapid growth at all--that it was sort of rapid growth And it was a heck of a lot bigger than that   Yes   Mr Chairman, I'd like to make two comments One is that we have been seeing, really since the beginning of the year, a divergence between the growth rate of M1 and the growth rates of all of the broader aggregates If you look at total liquid assets, debt, M3, and even M2, you'll see a deceleration in growth rates since early in the year M1 is the only one on the chart that we show accelerating I wonder if you would look back in earlier history, Steve, and find the periods where we had this kind of divergence in the past I don't think there were very many, actually But given that divergence, what weight should we apply to the M1?   I have another point, Mr Chairman I'd like to propose that a presentation be made by the staff at some future meeting on this whole issue that Steve raised in his presentation of what we're going to do if we're faced with a precipitous decline in the dollar To what extent do we let the pressure be borne by the exchange rate and to what extent do we let it be borne by interest rates? It seems to me it would be helpful, if we get to that point, to have had a thorough thrashing out of what all of the consequences would be I could tell you that my own bias at the moment would be to have a policy geared to letting the exchange rate take the pressure But I'd like to be better educated on that subject   So I guess the only thing we can do is pray for a gradual adjustment   Either that or we're in trouble either way   Mr Chairman, I too think that the evidence suggests that the economy is picking up a bit but I certainly don't sense in the numbers any strong forward thrust I think it is entirely compatible with the kind of modest growth that the staff is projecting In my area, I run into the same comments from business  -20-    10/1/85  people that Karen did they don't see things getting stronger; they don't see them getting weaker I think that reflects the fact that we are a capital goods producer essentially and the weakest part of the economy right now is the capital goods sector New orders for capital goods are no higher than they were a year ago But I think the uptick in the economy does suggest a no-change policy I was concerned that this might conflict with the G-5 program in the sense that I thought there was a possibility, anyway, that we would need somewhat lower interest rates to reinforce that declaration But at least so far the evidence is that we don't; we are getting a response at current rates and I am hopeful that a nice and orderly response will continue So I would propose no change, alternative B   The tightening of lending standards doesn't seem to have hit the commercial construction market How do you account for that?   What I don't understand is why the lending institutions are still lending for office buildings at the rate they are I don't quite comprehend   What are the chances, Jim, that you're too conservative on the net exports side? You don't show net exports as being a drag anymore but, certainly, we're not seeing any significant response to the fairly sizable decline in the dollar that has taken place Now, is this the normal--?   On your gradual depreciation path, at what point will we expect to get a real upward kick from net exports? Obviously, it's not in 1986   Well, I agree with your analysis, Mr Chairman, because I don't think we have much room to maneuver here If we had some evidence that the economy was softening, then I think we could go ahead and move to lower rates, despite the growth in the aggregates But I don't think we have anything to tie an easier posture to at this moment   That's exactly the kind of thing--something to hang our hat on--that we don't have now   I personally think that McGraw-Hill survey will reflect the decline in exchange rates That certainly has to be a plus for domestic investors   I can see the case for moving to somewhat lower interest rates, but I don't see that that necessarily means we shouldn't intervene also   If you attribute it solely to the program   We have had a bigger response than I would have expected solely from the program   The fact is, Chuck, that the markets that have a high level of speculative activity tend to overshoot, both on the up and the down side And that makes this not something to be concerned about in a [unintelligible] way   No   No I would think that one would describe what we are talking about now as hoping to avoid the necessity for that   Since we are having a wider borrowing range, wouldn't it make sense also to have a wider range for the aggregates-- maybe 5 to 7 percent?  -28-    11/4-5/85   I would hope so   To me, it's changing the targets because we clearly are not attempting to hit the targets   I recall in October 1982 we specifically stated that we were setting aside the M1 targets for the year, and that was in the minutes   Well, as I recall, it would have taken a zero growth rate in the last quarter to hit the target in '82   At the last meeting you expected that the market would test the resolve of the central banks Do you think that attitude has passed? Do you think the danger of a rising dollar is behind us?   My recollection is that we were very surprised at the strength of M1 in '82 I don't--   More than some, I would imagine   The difference, Paul, is that the old M1 was transactions balances; it's because people had a strong incentive to minimize the amount they held in non-interest bearing form The incentive, if not completely gone, is seriously impaired Therefore, if there are savings balances in those accounts, they are going to be much more sensitive to changes in interest rate differentials than pure transactions balances   Since 1982, M3 and L have had a better performance than the other aggregates  -15-    12/16-17/85   I think the answer is in the opposite direction of your assumption We have been looking at total financial assets as a percentage of GNP and that ratio has declined from the 1960s and reached a bottom around 1978; it has been rising since then, although it's still below the level of the 1960s But the percentage of financial assets comprised by checkable deposits and currency is lower now than it was in 1978, 1979   Yes, but the percentage of total financial assets held in deposit form has not been rising   It has been shrinking   That's why we have such a low growth rate for next year   How can we assume that zero has to be the floor?   You could argue that the norm for M1 velocity is going to be negative   One reason, as I understand it, is that they had been assuming that the price of computers has not changed over this period And they're substituting an assumption of a 10 percent per year decline   It's going to raise the growth rate [unintelligible] And that's fairly significant   What factors would moderate that?   Except, unfortunately, we don't know where we are   I think events since the Group of 10 meeting have been amazingly good in the sense that we have had a pretty sharp decline in the dollar and that has been accompanied by a decline in long-term interest rates And that is the combination that must be desired and I must say it's a little surprising It seems to me that we're still rather vulnerable, despite this, to any loss of confidence on the part of the foreign investors in the United States I think it's quite impressive that, despite the size of the decline in the dollar, I haven't been able to detect any nervousness on the part of foreign investors in the United States And that is a big plus for us But I think we still have to be alert to the possibility that that kind of thinking could change   Well, Mr Chairman, if ours were a closed economy, I would support some lowering of interest rates at the moment The forecast may be reasonable, but I don't think it's acceptable as a good target I would share your concern about a 4 percent pattern of real growth, but it seems to me that 2 percent is not acceptable as a target; 3 percent would be more in line with what I think we ought to shoot for But we're not a closed economy We have overhanging us a necessity to continue to finance a $140 billion current account deficit So we have to keep in mind what the gnomes of Zurich are thinking about us I hate to alarm, I hate to recognize--   I think the gnomes would look at our situation and would say "Well, the dollar is going down; the economic news is mixed but certainly not weak; and the perception is that monetary policy is very accommodative" What we actually have in the monetary numbers is a split decision M1 and debt suggest a very expansionary policy; M2, M3, and total liquid assets suggest a moderate policy If we could arrange to publish an M3 figure weekly and only publish M1 once a month, I think that people looking at the M3 numbers weekly would get a perception that US monetary policy is not terribly accommodative and that might be helpful to us But it seems to me in this situation that we ought to stick to a status quo policy until we get a trigger that will permit us to lower interest rates One trigger would be a sustained upward turn in the dollar in the exchange markets The gnomes, I think, would find it acceptable if we were to check that with a decline in short-term money rates The other trigger might be a serious weakening in the economic news, which I don't think is terribly likely; I think we'll float along in this continued mixed situation without any serious weakness I'm not thinking of that as a very great trigger And the third trigger would be if the monetary aggregates, and particularly M1 because of it's  -47-    12/16-17/85  signal value, should start coming in on the weak side So until then, it seems to me that it's a little hazardous for us [to ease]; I don't think we can really make a very strong case that a move at this time is compatible with continued emphasis on inflation control So, I think we ought to go with alternative B But there's a long time until the next meeting; and if the dollar should start strengthening in the exchange markets, I would lead off with a cut in the discount rate   I would like to point out to Mr Kichline that in 1985 we had a 5 percent greater rate of growth in M1 than we expected, which was associated with very slow growth and a declining inflation rate   I think the course of 1986 is not likely to be as steady as the quarterly projections [indicate] Looking at the numbers that we have gotten in the past months, it seems to me that we are likely to start out the year stronger in the first quarter--at least stronger than the 33 percent [forecast] The breadth of the strength in the numbers suggests to me that the economy is starting out stronger   Presumably, you would have revised the first half   Well, as I said, 4 percent seems much more likely for the first quarter Beyond that, I don't have any strong conviction I think 3 percent for the year is probably still about right I think what we may be seeing is the end of the inventory adjustment, as you mentioned; and that could lead to a stronger first half unless there is more inventory rebuilding than we're expecting at this time   I have had a proposal for a number of years about that [I would get rid of the M1 range] I think it has been a bit embarrassing that in three of the past four years we have not been able to set a range for M1 that is compatible with a reasonable nominal GNP outcome That doesn't seem to have hurt our credibility in the marketplace too much; but the fact is that we keep on setting targets that we don't meet And I think last year was particularly difficult because we rebased in the middle of the year and then we still couldn't bring Ml within the range Now, it may well be that M1 is going to be well behaved in 1986 and that we can get through the year and be within one of these ranges; but I don't have any confidence that we can be sure of that The other thing I would get rid of is the debt measure, but for a different reason I think it is pretty clear now that if we are going to use a debt measure, we better have some adjustments to eliminate debt that is clearly not related to economic activity--that is, the substitution of debt for equity which has been very big in the last couple of years There is this practice by state and local governments of putting out debt and investing the proceeds in government securities; we count both of those It seems to me that if we are going to use debt, it has to be an adjusted debt concept to take account of these things If we can't make that adjustment, I think we ought to drop the debt aggregate So I would propose, Mr Chairman, that we set a range of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2, M3 and total liquid assets   I am a little concerned about our practice of continually picking upper limits with the expectation that that's where we are going to end up It seems to me that it would be prudent to have a little margin, and if we say 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for these three measures I don't think we would get any negative feedback from the marketplace   I don't think the half percentage point is [critical]; 6 to 9 percent would probably work out all right I just like the idea of having a little extra margin   I think we need to be able to finance 7 percent nominal GNP growth An upper limit of 7 percent means that if velocity continues negative, we are going to miss the target again   May I remind you that a year ago at this time we were sitting around this table talking about the fact that there had been a one-time adjustment in the demand for M1 which was behind us When Steve talks about M1 in 1970, he's talking about a different animal We [now] are talking about an M1 that bears a market rate of interest It is an entirely different phenomenon and yet we keep on deluding ourselves that what we call M1 today is the same thing it was in the '70s It isn't And it seems to me that's the fundamental source of argument about how to forecast Ml   Mr Chairman, I think the employment numbers are not giving us a misleading signal on this occasion If you look at the leading indicators in December, there was very broad strength in them And, as I said yesterday, I think we are going to see a faster growth rate in the first half than we are now projecting Sometime in the first half I think we will have to move to a firmer policy, but I think it is a little early to do so now I would like to see the dollar come down a little further in the foreign exchange markets before we run the risk of halting that trend by moving interest rates up So, I think the stand pat policy is appropriate for this meeting; I would support alternative B   Well, Mr Chairman, I think the animal spirits are rising in New England Our computer industry went through a difficult adjustment last year We had a decline of 12 percent in employment in the computer industry in Massachusetts last year, but that seems to be turning around The companies are hiring again, in part because they're beginning to make sales in Europe again Asked if this is a function of the change in the dollar, the response is "no" because they haven't changed their prices in the European currencies; it reflects the improvement in conditions in Europe With respect to your conjecture about oil prices, I think that we have been waiting for a long time for the US bond market to begin to reflect the current rate of inflation Expectations don't change very readily in the bond market; but once they do, I don't think they change back very readily either I think the bond market could accommodate the kind of limited upward movement in oil prices that we are likely to see So, while I would agree with the general configuration of the    4/1/86  Board staff's forecast for a strong second half, if the forecast is wrong, I think it is likely to be wrong because it is too conservative I think the errors are likely to be on the greater growth side rather than the lesser   I don't think we can do much to reduce the rate of inflation in the services sector until the next recession It seems to me that if we are successful in preventing the inflation rate in the services sector from rising while the economy is still in an expansion phase, we have done pretty well   Mr Chairman, I think this is one of those times when we ought to gear current policy to where we expect the economy to be six to nine months from now Quite clearly, our expectations in general are as strong as, and in some cases stronger, than the Board staff's projections So, I think we should stay with our present policy, alternative B I think the market has overshot the current discount rate, and alternative B probably will require some modest upward adjustments in market rates But I don't think we should let that trouble us   If it really is a range, Wayne, it would have to be a lot wider than that   About 7 percent   We seem to have a worldwide phenomenon of rapid monetary growth associated with slow real growth; it's not purely American   But I think if you look at the trend in total liquid assets in the last two years, the trend is down   So, I don't think you can explain those two years--   I think we could import Texans if they can find a place to live   Mr Chairman, New England remains a fully employed economy Our regional unemployment rate is under 4 percent, despite the sizable decline in employment in the computer industry The decline in employment in that industry was more than offset by the rise in employment in construction and financial services As a consequence of a fully employed state, we find that wages are rising more rapidly, as you might expect, in New England than in any other part of the country In the financial sector, wages are rising more than are wages in general; in that sector the average wage increase this year is probably around 6-1/2 percent Within the financial sector, the mutual fund industry is in a boom condition and much of that is centered in the Boston area One other fallout of the fully employed state has been an explosion in housing prices Boston real estate on average is up by 75 percent in the past two years And companies are finding it difficult for the first time to transfer people into Boston from other parts of the country because of the cost of housing We are now at or slightly above the San Francisco housing market The prospects for New England in the year ahead could well be  -16-    5/20/86   Mr Chairman, I also support alternative B but for different reasons, it seems The stronger growth projected in the second half is really entirely a function of the improvement in the trade balance, and our ability to forecast the timing and magnitude of changes in the trade balance is not so great that we can have confidence that we can forecast it extremely well this time If we don't get a third-quarter improvment in the trade balance, I think we will continue to have a pretty sluggish forecast I don't see anything else that is going to pull the economy [up] very rapidly So, I don't think we can move on the anticipation that the third quarter is in the bag yet As a lot of people have said, we have to see the whites of the eyes of this narrowing trade deficit  I question whether we are in fact putting excessive liquidity into the system now I proposed, when we were last talking about the long-range targets, that we set targets for M3 and total liquid  -29-    5/20/86  assets; I assumed a minus 1 percent velocity for 1986 As I look at the fourth-quarter [and] the first-quarter rates of growth that would be compatible with a growth of 6 to 6-1/2 percent for nominal GNP I don't see that; the only thing in the picture that would lead one to think that we are building excessive liquidity is M1 I am not very sure that we understand the meaning of that growth of M1 for future economic growth  On the inflation front, I am more optimistic I think than many around the table, but I have been looking at what I call the "core" inflation rate and that is the price indexes eliminating food and energy If you do that, you see that there hasn't been any deceleration in the inflation rate in 1985; and if you look at the projected inflation rate for 1987, it doesn't look at all bad because it is not much different than the core inflation rate now It just depends on what set of numbers you have gotten used to looking at I think quite clearly the recent sets of numbers for the CPI and the wholesale price index had a lot of one-shot effects from food and energy that are not going to be repeated; we have to understand that this is an aberration And when the inflation rate gets back to the core rate, we shouldn't be too much alarmed because that was the fundamental situation all along  With respect to the directive, I appear to be the only one favoring draft directive I The reason is that it seems very clear to me that when we meet in July, we're going to look at the growth rate of M1 and either we will have to eliminate M1 as a target or rebase it again I think that is clearly in the cards And if that is the case, I don't see any reason to equivocate in letting the market know what they already know that we are discounting M1 in monetary policy I don't think we kid anybody if we think the market feels otherwise I don't think we can tell the market a different story with a [different] form of the directive than the former directive because I don't think we really mean it Are we really going to tighten up money and tighten up interest rates in a sluggish economy in order to get the M1 growth rate down? If we are not, then it seems to me it's time to recognize that fact; and it seems to me directive I is an ideal way of beginning to do that   Well, directive I is where we talk about the expected rates of growth of M2 and M3 and it has language, which comes in after that, to the effect that the growth of Ml is uncertain That suggests to me a downgrading of the significance of M1   Well, I would be happy to make that suggestion also If you accept the proposition that we are going to have to do    5/20/86  something in July, it seems to me to make sense to start doing something now   Perhaps I inferred that drafts II and III imply that we are going to give a lot more emphasis to Ml   Well, maybe these things are getting so obscure, Mr Chairman, that we ought to decide what they mean   The one big difference is that I read III to mean that we are reemphasizing Ml, because in last month's directive we emphasized M2 and M3 and then we noted that M1 was uncertain   Why don't we say "The behavior of M1 continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty"   Why don't we just eliminate that, Paul? Why do we need to talk about less reserve restraint? I don't think that is one of the options we are considering now, is it?   How about using the word "only"? "It would be acceptable only in the context of--" ?   In this particular market context, I think concerted intervention would have an impact--at least in my judgment, based on watching the market--whether it's sterilized or unsterilized   Mr Chairman, I remember that we went to controlling monetary aggregates very recently because we didn't know how to forecast what level of interest rates would be needed to get the nominal GNP growth that we sought Now I think we have come full circle because, as I hear Don tell it, in order to set a range for Ml we have to forecast interest rates for the year If that is the case, that raises a question in my mind whether it makes any sense for us to set a range for M1 when we don't know what interest rates are going to be in the coming year   What is the value of having the range and then announcing that we are not going to be within it?  -11-    7/8-9/86   Wouldn't it be more honest to say that the relationship between M1 and nominal GNP has become so unpredictable that we are dropping it as a target rather than say we have a range but we don't intend to stay within it?   My position is very simple, Mr Chairman I don't think we can measure money in the old transactions balance sense in the United States I don't think that we are going to be able to do it next year or the year after that or the year after that I think it is nostalgia that is reflected in all of these comments about M1 returning to its historical relationships; the probability of that, given the changed character of Ml, has got to be extremely low It seems to me that at some point we ought to say we can't measure money in the old sense because of all of the institutional changes that have taken place and, therefore, we are going to use liquid assets instead of money as a target I would have M2 and M3 and, since we always have three targets, I would add total liquid assets   I know it; and it's not incompatible with what's going on in the economy either It has been decelerating since mid- 1984; and if you look at the rate of growth in nominal GNP, that has been decelerating too   I think I tried to unsell debt some time ago    7/8-9/86   We will need a predictable relationship for an extended period of time You don't take one six-month period of experience or a year's experience and get predictable relationships   Well, I think the biggest mistake we could have made would have been to follow Ml the last 4 or 5 years I think we would have set this country right on its ear   I think Manley's idea is the right one We should say we are going to monitor M1 and we are going to monitor debt, but we are not going to set ranges for either of them We are not going to set any monitoring ranges   What I am suggesting is that we say we think we may be able to learn something from the M1 data and from the debt data and we are going to continue to monitor that data but we are not going to set a monitoring range   Or it could be like 1976, when Ml came in very low   Well, Mr Chairman, the New England economy is still growing extremely well as exemplified by the fact that McDonalds is offering $495 an hour and is still having trouble finding people to flip hamburgers But my reading is that the national numbers are very disturbing I have been very optimistic that we were going to see an acceleration in real activity in the last half of the year, certainly on the basis of what the broader monetary aggregates have  -30-    7/8-9/86  done in the first half That suggests that we ought to be seeing about a 7 percent nominal GNP growth, and I thought that was just about right But the staff is now forecasting 5 percent instead of 7 percent And I am inclined to agree with Mr Boehne and Mrs Horn that if there's something wrong with our forecast, it could be that the forecast is too optimistic I see a sense of contrast between [the economy and] the financial numbers If I were sitting on a desert island and had only the financial numbers, I would say there is a tremendous boom going on in the United States But if you look at the numbers for real activity, the last month gives no encouragement that we are going to get a faster rate of growth in the third quarter The new orders figures certainly don't suggest it The deceleration in the rate of payroll employment gains doesn't suggest it I really don't understand what is going on out there The system is not responding according to the rule books that I would follow So, I find this very disturbing For months I have been thinking that monetary policy has been doing everything it could to produce a healthy economy I am less confident of that today because of the seeming failure of the real economy to respond to what the financial economy has been doing   I prefer to keep it unchanged I think that we would hope to have substantially larger nominal GNP [growth] next year  -42-    7/8-9/86  than we're going to get this year This year, with a projection of 5 percent nominal GNP [growth], we have M3 in the middle of the range It doesn't seem to me there's much of a case--if you take those two key situations--to shrink the ranges   The other argument is that it doesn't make a heck of a lot of difference, Mr Chairman   I question whether we're going to have any better basis for setting a range next February than we do today   I recognize my mistakes, which is not true of all of you!   "Such rapid growth"   Well, we don't know The projection is fairly close   We could drop M1 on the same basis   Ben Friedman sold the debt/income relationship to me; and then it immediately went [off track] That's why we may be better off not taking up total liquid assets, because I'm afraid--   I think the foreign exchange market has already discounted, largely, a 1/2 point reduction A one percentage point reduction would surprise them Gretchen, what is your view on this?    7/8-9/86  Certainly, a one percentage point reduction would be a surprise in the foreign exchange market; but what about a 1/2 point reduction?   If there were a major decline in the dollar, wouldn't that put very heavy pressure on the Germans and the Japanese to go along with this reluctantly?   Couldn't we have a sentence in there saying that we interpret the same level borrowing with a lowered discount rates to mean a lessening in reserve pressures?  SPEAKER(?) We have a reserve--   There might be times when the market would be supportive of a policy to sell some along the [unintelligible] I think of October '79 when we had a 2 percentage point increase in the discount rate; that attracted a lot of attention In a situation like that where we want a big response rapidly it seems to me that a relatively small sale of coupons issues could have a rather big impact And there might be times when we want a big response   One of the problems, Mr Chairman, is that the lags are so long that I, too, am a little pessimistic about our ability to turn the situation around I looked at the last two periods of decline in the dollar since 1970 and in those two periods the lag before we got a substantial change in net exports, apart from a bottoming out process, was 7 to 8 quarters If we get this kind of sequence again, that means that we shouldn't expect to see much before the fourth quarter of this year or perhaps not even until the first quarter of next year--unless something in this cycle is going to shorten the lags And I suspect that's not going to be the case The lags are long and I think we have to be a little patient   I feel that the tax change is so comprehensive that we're just going to have to play it by ear I don't think we have any idea what the effect will be Given all of the interactions in this bill and the dramatic changes, I don't think we're in any position to forecast what the effect is going to be on investment, on consumption, or on anything else I think it's just beyond us It's one thing to have an incremental change in one tax, but it's quite another to have a wholesale revision of the whole system It seems to me it's just unpredictable   I've had a number of businessmen tell me that they think just resolving the tax issue and eliminating the uncertainty as to how investment is going to be taxed is going to exert some stimulus on investment, including multi-family investment A guy who is running a lot of tax shelters says his firm is regearing and is going to start building projects on an economic basis    8/19/86   They'll build in areas where the vacancy rate is still lower   Why is it a one-time spurt?   Typically in our banking system, when we are pumping in reserves greater than are needed to finance loan demand the banks naturally put the remainder in the securities markets The question is Why is it going to be different next month?   Well, Mr Chairman I would like to associate myself with the Stern and Melzer camp I have an intuitive feeling that 1987 could be significantly stronger than we are now thinking for two reasons (1) I don't think we know much about the timing or the amplitude of the decline in the exchange rate; and (2) I don't think we know much about the economic impact of the tax bill That could cut both ways, but I think it does mean that there is a possibility that we could have a significantly stronger 1987 than we are now thinking, even though I can't give any numbers to document my gut feeling I am also impressed with the fact that we are generating a lot of liquidity in the system Maybe Don is right that we had a one- shot jump in July But even though I haven't been known to be a slavish follower of the aggregates, I am concerned about the buildup of liquidity in the system Sooner or later that could cause problems So I think we are in a situation where we ought to exercise a little patience, at least until the next meeting, and adopt a "status quo" policy here, which I interpret alternative B to represent I would like to see us wait a little longer before we move on the discount rate   I would be more inclined to support a one-sided proposition that we stay with the $300 million And if we cut the discount rate then I'd move borrowing to $400 million   You are asking for votes of members?   If the discount rate gets cut, there is no point [unintelligible]   I was told by a knowledgeable source that the reason the dollar did not go down when we cut the discount rate was that the long rate did not go down with it and that the exchange rate is more sensitive to long rates than to short rates Is that a plausible explanation to you?   It does raise questions about our ability to influence the exchange rate at this particular juncture   You wouldn't think so On the surface we seem to have a perverse reaction The domestic market is saying this is inflationary and the international markets have a different view But this is the only concept that I've heard that has tied the two together I don't know   I think the idea that we control a long-term position by not rolling over completely all of the maturing issues--   Is that something that the Treasury would be upset about?   But you could generate that leeway very easily by just failing to roll over part of our holdings   If the Treasury doesn't object, it seems to me that would be the answer You could have your cake and eat it too    9/23/86   But presumably we learn something about the functioning of the long-term market by seeing a response to our operations I assume that's where Peter--   It's not a matter of oiling the machinery; it's really having a test that we participate in to see how the machinery is working  SPEAKER(?) But in general the Treasury market is very broad and very deep If you just keep--   The Michigan people also say that the index is very sensitive to changes in interest rates, particularly the mortgage rate, and the backing up of the mortgage rate may be [a factor]   Jim, if I could ask you You mentioned that nondefense capital goods orders were down somewhat What about total durable goods orders?   So we didn't get any confirmation of the employment numbers in manufacturing?   Yes I was told by one computer company that they are selling a lot to Korea and Taiwan, so maybe we'll--   Mr Chairman, I have sensed a change in the spirit of my directors and businessmen in New England in the last month There is a much more upbeat feeling than there was in the summer I find some evidence now that some of our high-tech companies have begun to say that maybe the yen has gotten to a level where they can compete with the Japanese and they are planning to try to get back some of the market that they have lost to the Japanese in the past few years It is the first sign of that sort that I have heard    9/23/86  who has a very unusual company called and their sole business is making equipment and special  He said that on what he calls his consumer products, are a very good economic indicator; and he has noted that in the past two weeks they have had a big increase in orders for the   American products But he also sells abroad and his European orders are going up, too, for whatever that is worth Boston seems to be the one exception in this downward trend in commercial office building Our boom is still going on I went to a meeting a week or so ago on new office buildings and hotels planned for Boston and, despite the fact that we have a lot of space coming on stream in the next six to eight months, we still have a tremendous array of office buildings and hotels planned It is sort of like Dallas and Houston used to be I figure we're going to have our glut but it is a ways off For people renting space in our building we have a new program in which we are trying to stretch out leases to nail down today's high rental values because we would like to have everybody locked in when the glut hits   Well, I have a little nuance, Mr Chairman I agree with you that we are sort of locked into a no-change situation here at the moment, but I am concerned about the increase in liquidity that we are building into the system here If you look at the security holdings of the commercial banks over the past four months, they have risen by $31 billion of which $21 billion is in government securities So, with loan demand so weak, we actually are pumping in reserves and the banks are placing them in fairly liquid form It seems to me that if we ever do get the economy reaccelerating that we are going to have to lean against this liquidity growth at a fairly early stage At the moment I would support alternative B   One way of doing it, Mr Chairman, using last month's directive, is to change "somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint" simply to "somewhat greater reserve restraint," indicating a bias   We would have but one direction of ooze   The deviation is trivial    9/23/86   I think we need an asymmetrical statement this time   I question, Mr Chairman, how many people would really want to support the condition of lesser reserve restraint I don't know; conceivably there could be conditions that would generate--   I would rather leave it out now and have the Chairman call a telephone conference   Well, they have real wages growing at about 5 percent in Germany--   --at a time when the unemployment rate is almost 9 percent I would think that if we had that situation we might be a little nervous about expanding too much as well   That's true But they still settled for the 5 percent wage increase at a time when the unemployment rate was very high I should think that--   So they're like the British in that sense   Exactly    11/5/86   So moved   I agree with Bob Parry I think the evidence we're looking at today suggests that the economy is strengthening We have the new orders in durable goods and capital goods; we have strengthening in basic materials prices We've been looking for a decline in the trade deficit to really carry the economy next year and we're getting very strong anecdotal evidence that this is taking place When we had the Beigebook survey I found that every company that was interviewed that does a significant export business reported an increase in export orders--aircraft engines by GE, computers, medical instruments, and so on Right across the board, there were very widespread increases in orders for exports We always get very impatient waiting for this two-year lag to take place, but the turn seems to be coming on schedule   [Unintelligible] phenomenon for the last couple of months And so we shouldn't expect to see them recorded in the actual shipments for another 6 months or so   Also, the big recent increases are in the Northeast where the vacancy rates are very low   Well, as long as you are not driving interest rates [up] at the same time   We don't even have a swap line with Brazil   Mr Chairman, I think that we have come a long way on this subject in the last [few years] A few years ago, we were sitting around here talking about M1 as if it were synonymous with transactions balances I should hope that that concept may be seriously damaged And we were talking, either directly or indirectly, about the causal relationship between the rate of change in transactions balances and the rate of change in nominal GNP As you know, [I have been] arguing that we can't measure money anymore and that we really should start to think in terms of gearing policy to the rate of change in liquidity In that connection, I think one indicator that we might want to use--if you think there is safety in numbers and in the past that has proven to be the case--is total liquid assets, if you can displace Ml I would certainly strongly urge that we use total liquid assets if we want a third [target] Last year its behavior relative to the nominal GNP was less defective than any of the other indicators It wasn't too great, but it was less defective   Well, there was one year when it was [unintelligible] but so did all the others--everything did well--and that was 1982 Since 1982 its velocity has been less than tranquil, I see, but the deviation as compared to M1 trend velocity is very small I am not saying that any of these is anything that we should tie our [unintelligible] to in any rigid way What we have learned is that none of these monetary aggregates has an extremely stable relationship to nominal GNP But the fact is that in four out of the last five years we have not met our initial M1 target, and I think that is something we ought to pay a little attention to Despite the deviation of the relatively broader aggregates from trend velocity, we generally have been hitting the [targets for] the broader aggregates We have had ranges wide enough to encompass them And we have done that this year If we are forced to go with these, and under current law we are, then I think it makes sense to go with--I wouldn't call them targets--but indicators of monetary policy that we are more likely to hit And I think the situation with M1 now is such that M1 velocity is completely unpredictable We need to forecast Ml velocity, as Mr Kohn's paper indicates But first we need to know what is likely to happen to interest rates, what the relationship between nominal GNP and interest rates is, and also how the bankers are going to respond to any change in interest rates And it seems to me that all that adds up to the proposition that the current M1 velocity is not predictable   I am just saying that I have no objections to using M1 for whatever information you think it may be giving you What I do object to is using it as a published target of monetary policy when the uncertainties are so enormous   Even if you do that the New York Times is going to publish a picture of it every Friday showing M1 way [outside]--   What if the banks continued to pay the current rate when the market rates really went down by one percentage point? Then Ml would balloon   May I object to that argument? We cannot control M1 unless we do not have an interest rate policy In other words, if we want to have a strict monetarist regime and decide we are going to produce X amount of Ml, we can do that, but we have to surrender any influence over interest rates You really are going to have to add that to your operational--   What's always the case?   I would argue that we are never going to give up some kind of interest rate policy Nor should we And, therefore, the idea that M1 is controllable has no merit whatsoever   The broader aggregates would do the same thing   Do you know if the additional growth is almost entirely in business accounts?   My proposition was that L would be a suitable swap for M1 but only if we wanted to stay with three targets   My thinking is that it is probably a better measure of liquidity than M2 or M3 If I had to choose only one of the three I think I would take L   But they don't have to If we wanted an early estimate we could get it, I am sure   Mr Chairman, if I read Mr Corrigan and some of the others who have spoken up for a monitoring range correctly, it reflects a feeling that at some point in time we may face another 1979 situation and that at that point we will be able to resurrect M1 again and pursue a more restrictive policy than we otherwise would have been able to do because of the mystique attached to Ml I think that's not a very realistic proposition I think Ml did have that kind of mystique in 1979 but it certainly doesn't have it now If we go to the Congress and say we can't have M1 growing more than 9 percent, they are going to say Well, you let it grow at 15 percent in 1986 and in 4 out of 5 years in the 1980s you didn't meet your target and nothing happened Why do you think you have to meet an M1 target this year? I don't think you can put M1 back in the box and pull it out that easily anymore   No sir   Plus or minus one percent?   I have been trying to think about why it is that the broader aggregates, including L, have been growing more rapidly relative to the nominal GNP The only thing that I have been able to come up with is that in recent years, with the decline in interest rates, we have had a big increase in the value of financial assets in the hands of consumers and businesses--a big increase in stock prices and bond prices also In fact, financial assets have been growing more rapidly than nominal GNP So if an investor wanted to maintain liquid assets at a constant proportion of his portfolio and the other financial assets were growing more rapidly than GNP then his liquid assets would have to grow faster than nominal GNP as well Now, whether that is the answer to it, I don't know, but--   They would, certainly; if we had a great depression then liquidity would go down   [Unintelligible] What Paul is talking about is a great crash   Well, a stock market crash would lead to a reduction in the rate of growth of liquid assets, even if people tried to improve their position or maintain it If incomes are dropping, that's going to be difficult to do But if that theory has any validity to it--and I am not sure it does--it means that when the financial assets start growing at about the same rate as nominal GNP,    12/15-16/86  you would expect that the liquid assets would go back to their prior growth rates relative to nominal GNP I don't know whether this makes any sense to you, Don, or not   It leads me to conclude that we probably should not reduce the ranges for the broader aggregates My tentative idea was to cut half of one percent from the 6 to 9 percent range for this year I don't see that there is any case for doing that   Not, I think, while interest rates are still high relative to the inflation rate If you promise that interest rates are going to continue to move toward their normal relationship to the inflation rate, and if that stays low, then you would expect the value of financial assets to continue to rise relative to GNP for a while   Well, maybe that's something that we need to get further counseling on from Mr Kohn--[whether his work] indicates that half of one percentage point is not a matter of major consequence    12/15-16/86   What about building permits?   How much of that is attributable to the oil  price increase assumption?   I would favor alternative B without asymmetry, too, because the market, in a context of the federal funds rate going up, read a lot more--at least temporarily--into the last directive that we published with asymmetrical language in it than we intended For that reason I would favor symmetrical language   Take the sentence out   Can we spend an hour talking about symmetry?   I think we started, maybe a year or two ago, to get tougher with the big banks We instructed them that they could come in on Wednesday, on a settlement day, if they really had a case And that was it My impression is that, at least in our District, we had more borrowing from the big banks before that--before we started this Wednesday-only routine   [We haven't] as far as the smaller banks   I don't know what the numbers would show, but I have a feeling that the big bank borrowing is less now than it was a couple of years ago   That's true   This would make them more reluctant to use the window   Well, Mr Chairman, before I talk about the forecast in general, I thought I would tell you about some interesting numbers I came up with Ninety percent of the New England high tech manufacturer exports are flown out of Boston Airport because of the low weight to value ratio, so I thought I would ask the port authority to give me some figures on air freight exports and imports I thought it might be an indicator of how this high tech industry is doing because I have been getting a lot of optimistic feedback and I wanted to see if it was confirmed by the numbers The numbers are in pounds so you don't have any exchange rate problem What they show is that our air freight exports bottomed out in the first quarter last year and have been rising pretty substantially In the three months ended in November of 1986 they were running 29 percent higher than the same months of 1985 Air freight imports, which are still larger than exports, were running 7 percent higher than a year ago Now that's pounds and that can be misleading because I know that we shipped a lot of tuna Lobster don't weigh much, but we ship a lot of tuna to Japan We don't eat fresh tuna and we ship the whole fish in a specially prepared box because they like fresh tuna It could well be that a good part of this increase reflects a 40 percent decline in the cost of fresh tuna to the Japanese But I think it does tend to confirm the idea that the high tech industry is doing a lot more business overseas than it has been So, I will keep watching those numbers and see what intelligence I can get from them  I am inclined to think that if the forecast is wrong on real growth it's going to be wrong on the low side I had a long argument with my staff about what number to give you They wanted me to give you 2 percent real growth I thought that was a bit on the low side I hated to offend them because their forecast has been better than mine in recent years, so we compromised at 2-1/2 percent after they saw the January employment numbers I am impressed with the very  -17-    2/10-11/87  widespread strength in the leading indicators in November, December, and January Three months back-to-back strength of this sort leads me to think that at least the first half may be considerably stronger than we are projecting So I come out on the optimistic side of the risks   I have looked in two [publications] that said exactly the opposite   I vote for alternative II as well One thing we ought to keep in mind is that the elimination of IRA accounts is likely to drive up M2 relative to income That's why I'd be concerned about moving the M2 target down to 8 percent We may need a little more room for that The Bluebook says you don't expect much effect in 1987; I'm not sure why you feel that way   The last one   But in 1988 it clearly would be a factor   This assumes that we know what the normal relationship of M1 to income is  -33-    2/10-11/87   I think we still persist under the delusion that there is a normal relationship between M1 and nominal GNP that is going to reassert itself at some point The mistake in this kind of thinking is that this is a brand new aggregate It's not like M1 was; interest is being paid on these deposits And I think it's going to be a number of years before we know what the normal relationship of this new aggregate is to nominal GNP So I still think it just does not make sense to set a range, given this level of ignorance about this new aggregate I don't think we know any more about it now than we did last year and we had a miss of more than 7 percentage points I think that's a testimony to the fact that this new aggregate, which we call M1, has behavioral characteristics that it's going to take us a long time to understand To set any kind of a range for it for 1987 would be a mistake   Yes   And the 7 percent could turn out to be much too high   It doesn't sound very restrained to me   I think a 7 to 13 percent range would be telling the market that we don't intend to push interest rates up this year no matter what happens, because as soon as there is a little rise in interest rates the growth of M1 has got to swing pretty rapidly   Go to April   I thought we agreed to make this [asymmetric]   I would like to make it even more asymmetric and not mention the possibility of lesser reserve restraint because I can't see that as a possibility for the next six weeks unless the business numbers come through very much differently than we expect   While we have a little time here, Paul could tell us about this story about Mr Baker pushing target zones for currencies   We are not thinking in terms of a formal system   With price pressures   All of this suggests that the relationship of nominal GNP to M1 is indeterminate The stronger the economy the lower the growth rate of M1   And the problem with the corporate debt sector, anyway, is that we have had, in large part, no corresponding growth in corporate assets The offset to the debt has been a decline in equity; so we haven't had an increase in assets   I wouldn't go on to admit that the more [unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I have been getting anecdotal evidence from our New England manufacturers that their exports were doing pretty well But when I looked at their employment numbers, the last four or five months of 1986 showed pretty quiet employment in manufacturing The non-manufacturing economy is doing well; the unemployment rate had drifted below 4 percent, and now it's running about 3-1/2 percent So I asked our manufacturers If you are doing so well in exports why isn't this showing up in manufacturing employment? The answer was that domestic capital goods demand is so  -17-    3/31/87  weak that it has been offsetting the strength in the exports sector In January we had an uptick in manufacturing employment at a 7 percent annual rate Now, one month in these numbers is not enough to give a signal, but at least it supports the proposition that maybe the improvement in exports is going to try to [unintelligible] the first time on the employment side My Boston airport indicator is still looking pretty good In the three months ending in January, air freight exports in pounds were up by 16 percent over the year-earlier numbers, and air freight imports declined for the first time on a year-to-year basis It was down one point, so the numbers are still confirming the anecdotal evidence The employment numbers still haven't shown through to any great extent, but we may be at a turning point in manufacturing employment, depending on the export side   I am told that about 90 percent of the high-tech exports go by air freight, because their value-to-weight ratio is high   Mr Chairman, I think the economy is strong enough that there's certainly no case for pursuing an easier policy even if the aggregates should come in for the next month or so below the projections indicated I'd like to call your attention, though, to the fact that we've already had some tightening in the last few days We've had the long-term government bond yield go up about 30 basis points If that should stick, we should expect to see a similar rise in corporate bond and mortgage rates As far as moving to a higher borrowing level and a tighter policy, I think that depends a lot on the nature of the overall circumstances I'm inclined to take the same position that Governor Heller did that with the world economy growing so slowly, if we're going to stay on a path of improving our balance of payments position we've got to be able to increase our market share in a world that's not growing very fast And I'm not sure we can do that at the present level of the exchange rate I don't know where the equilibrium rate is but I suspect the dollar has to come down somewhat further before we get enough momentum going to begin to restore our balance of payments position So it seems to me that if we're going to raise the borrowing level we ought to have a conference call so that the members of the Committee really can appraise the situation in the light of what's going on domestically as well as what's going on in the foreign exchange market If we're getting a modest, gradual, downward drift in the dollar I don't think we ought to be concerned about that If we get a sustained number of days [of weakness], as we've had recently, of course, that's another matter It depends on the conditions, and I think they're kind of hard to describe in advance That's why I suggest that we should have a conference call   If we move we reduce their incentive to take action   For the benefit of the newcomers at the Federal Reserve, I should note that the first statement Willis Winn made when he came to an FOMC meeting and we were talking about the directive was, "This is the largest editorial committee I have ever sat on"   Wait a minute Are you talking [unintelligible] the workweek number of--   Mr Chairman, I would like to reinforce the comments of Bob Black and others who have argued that the inflation hysteria on Wall Street is greatly overdone We have manicured the numbers and we cannot find in the numbers any increased inflation other than that which we would have expected from the agricultural and energy areas 6 or 9 months ago If you look at the broad indexes, the producer price index excluding food and energy, for example, was up at a 22 percent rate in the past 6 months ending April For the past 12 months, it was up 26 percent I don't see yet in either the consumer price index or the producer price index any evidence of increased  -18-    5/19/87  inflation outside the agricultural and energy sectors That's not saying it may not be coming at some point I don't see yet in the numbers any significant impact of the decline in the dollar in the aggregate price indexes   Pardon me?   That may well be, but I don't see it showing up in the broad indexes What we are going to see, I think, is a decline in the volume of imported products and a lesser share of imports in retail sales   I was talking about the producer price index, excluding all food and fuel I would expect it to show up there first if there is going to be an increase in prices on the part of our producers in response to the greater market opportunities stemming from higher import prices I am not saying it may not be coming down the road, but it is not there yet It just seems to me that the Wall Street hysteria primarily reflects the losses that bond dealers have taken in their bond portfolios; that was a function of the decline in the dollar rather than any real change in our inflation outlook  On the manufacturing side, I have the sense that New England manufacturing is rising It certainly is showing up again in my Boston airport numbers The first-quarter export air freight shipments were up 35 percent and import air freight shipments were down 3 percent This is the first quarter since the series began in the first quarter of 1984 where the physical volume of export air freight shipments exceeded the physical volume of import shipments But what I don't see is any reflection in the employment numbers for manufacturing, which have flattened out; that has been essentially unchanged in New England since the middle of last year That suggests to me that we are getting some pretty big gains in manufacturing productivity and that perhaps we are not going to see sizable gains in manufacturing employment but rather more sizable gains in productivity than we have seen That is a tradeoff that I find quite acceptable, if that turns out to be the case   But that index was at least that high in the first quarter of 1986   Mr Chairman, I would support alternative C because, despite my earlier statements, I think if we were to go for alternative B, we might give the market an impression that we were easing policy and that could, of course, be very troublesome I think "C" is more in line with what, in fact, we have been doing and, as was indicated earlier, represents more of a no-change policy than "B" With respect to the discount rate, I think we ought to keep that in reserve for use when we have the next downward fall in the exchange rate I don't know when that is going to come, but it seems to me rather than raise the discount rate in a period of stable exchange rates, we ought to hold that to have something in our armory for use on that occasion   There is also the question of how much the discount rate is raised, if it is raised   Well, if the funds rate is at 6-3/4 percent, it seems to me a half point is a little [unintelligible] Normally, one would expect a 6-1/4 percent discount rate If we are doing it to get some impact on the foreign exchange market, which still makes sense to me, I think an increase above a half point might attract a little more attention And it would certainly align the discount rate better with the funds rate than a move of a half point   Yes, assuming it stays at 6-3/4 percent That speaks for itself   Yes--only because I like to have something in the closet Otherwise, the only alternative response is a still tighter monetary policy   The number that I find rather depressing, and I want to make sure I understand it, is your projection that the Federal deficit next year is going to be about the same as in fiscal 1987 After $25 billion of deficit reducing actions and after what I recall was a fairly sizable increase in the Social Security surplus--which I assume is in these numbers--we still end up with no change in the Federal deficit And on top of that you're projecting a wiping out of the state and local government surplus, a low consumer saving rate, and some decline in the inflow of foreign capital associated with the reduction of our current account deficit To me, all of this adds up to the possibility that we will see much higher interest rates, as a consequence of all of these forces, than you have been suggesting Now, perhaps you didn't want to scare us but--   I suppose what could really cause us trouble would be if the improvement in our trade picture should lead to a larger increase in business investment expenditures than we're projecting here That would put an awful lot of strain on the capital markets with the government deficit not declining   The increase in the Social Security surplus is not a very big factor for 1988 Maybe I was--    7/7/87   Yes   But you do have an absolute decline in the foreign capital inflows in 1988, right?   Not only as a percent of GNP but in absolute terms so that--   No, I'm talking about 1988   I don't think this is a world-shaking issue, but I have a slight preference for a change to a lower range We have a number of times gone before the [Congressional] Committee when we have been in a little embarrassing position of having the targets, particularly M1, running over the top It seems to me we might pick up a couple of minor credibility points by revising the M2 guidelines down I don't see any harm that could come from it So I say, why not?   I would go for alternative II as written, Mr Chairman I don't have the concern that Tom Melzer expressed that we are going to lock ourselves into a range for M2 that is going to be too low I can't foresee in the years ahead when we would want nominal GNP growing faster than 7-1/2 percent So that doesn't trouble me   Yes, but we have never had an M2 or M3 target come in this much below, or even above, the range   The big capital gains tax payments--was that a factor in the slow growth of M2 and M3?   [Unintelligible] I think there is some language on page 16 of the Bluebook that says "The depressing influence of the previous increase in market rates should begin to wear off reasonably promptly since offering rates on many components of M2 seem already to have adjusted to the current structure of market rates" The impression is it's a temporary phenomenon or at least is thought to be   Milton Freidman predicted an explosion of inflation in 1984   I have a gut feeling that the economy in the last half of this year and going into 1988 is going to be stronger than we have projected, and I've been examining numbers trying to figure out where the greater strength will come from It seems to me that it could well be from the producer durable equipment sector where you show a continued rise in manufacturing capacity utilization throughout the period In recent months, we've seen a very strong trend in new orders for capital goods Yet in your projection, after the current quarter, you show only a very modest growth rate Do you view this as an area of vulnerability in your forecast?   [Unintelligible] with respect to the aggregates, not interest rates   Well, Mr Chairman, I would support Mr Corrigan's formulation of a modest tightening--a $600 million borrowing level I think that we might need to move further in the event we get a period of pronounced weakness in the dollar There has been so much talk in the foreign exchange market about the inevitability of a further leg down in the dollar that that seems to be the conventional wisdom For that reason, this recent weakness in the dollar has the potential, I think, of generating a test of the earlier lows; that's just potential; I am not forecasting that If that should turn out to be the case, we probably would have to make another move prior to the next meeting But I think the evidence of greater strength in the economy would certainly support a modest move at this time of the sort that Mr Corrigan outlined   I agree   You also have the authority, of course, to call a telephone conference meeting to reconsider the borrowing level in the event, say, we get extreme weakness in the dollar, which I think is a possibility   I think they are very much concerned about too much intervention increasing the German money supply as it did in 1978; and they want to avoid that   Peter, during most of the year, the bond market has been very sensitive to the foreign exchange rate, but in recent days we have seen the dollar under a lot of pressure and that has not been transmitted significantly to the bond market How do you appraise this?   Mr Chairman, yesterday I talked to Tom Jester of the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan and he said that in a survey taken after the stock market decline, that decline turned out to have had a very sharp effect on consumer  -10-    11/3/87  confidence He said they think the big effect is not going to be the wealth effect on consumer spending but the uncertainty He thinks consumers' reduced confidence level as to the future, generally, is likely to produce a major slowdown in consumer spending He thinks the confidence index they report will be showing about a 10 percent drop when it next comes out   Mr Chairman, I too agree that the outlook is extremely difficult to forecast because we are in a fairly new situation here But, it seems to me that the events of recent months suggest that the Louvre Accord was an agreement to maintain the US exchange rates at levels that were not sustainable We have had difficulty financing the deficit this year with private capital inflows In the first quarter of this year, that reluctance of the private foreign investor to keep on providing money at the pace needed was reflected in the downward movement in our exchange rate; but that was stopped by the Louvre agreement Subsequently, it seems to me, the pressure generated by this reluctance of foreign investors to put as much in as they had so willingly in earlier years was reflected in rising interest rates We had marvelous stability in the exchange rate but our bond rate was under upward pressure because of reduced foreign demand And that is what ultimately led to the big drop in the stock market The market had become extremely overvalued relative to bond rates of return Standard & Poor's 500 was yielding 27 percent at a time when intermediate-term governments were yielding almost 10 percent That was the biggest spread between dividend yield and intermediate-term bond yields in history So it was clearly an unsustainable situation Now we have to try to figure out how we permit the dollar to adjust downward without that being transmitted into upward pressure on the long-term bond markets And I think that's going to be a very tricky proposition for us But there is no doubt in my mind that we have to go to a much lower level of the dollar The question is How can we keep the domestic economy moving ahead even at a relatively modest rate in that context? I attended a  -23-    11/3/87  meeting at the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank where a couple of bright young people from the Board presented a superb paper I hope that it has been distributed at the Board because it tells a lot about why we have not had any more adjustment in our trade account than we have had thus far And the reason is that the import price levels have gone up at an amazingly low rate In the most recent period, reported yesterday I think by the Bureau of the Census, import prices went up in the third quarter by less than 2 percent; I think that reflects, and the paper supports this, that foreign producers who have gotten into this market are very reluctant to give up markets here and are going to try to hang in here as long as they can It seems to me that it is going to take a level of the dollar well below any long-term equilibrium level to begin to make the kind of progress I think we have to make in reducing our foreign deficit So our problem for the next few months is going to be a very tough one How do we handle this ball of wax on the declining dollar and avoid not putting all kinds of pressures on long-term bond rates that are going to be very destabilizing for the domestic economy? If we have another runup in rates, we are going to see a new low in the stock market I don't think there's any question about that So, I think it's a most unstable financial situation I wasn't around in 1929--at least I was not old enough to know what was going on--but I can't recall a period when we have had such an unstable financial system as we have right at this moment   I have an impossible question for you, Don If the dollar goes down significantly in the next couple of months, which I think is going to happen, how do we prevent that from spilling over into a rise in bond yields? That is the conflict we are going to be faced with in the next month, it seems to me   Mr Chairman, I might request that we eliminate that last sentence in Variant I, because we are talking about stabilizing the funds rate for a short period It is a temporary policy, and I don't think it makes any sense to talk about a range of 4 to 8 percent or 5 to 9 percent I think we ought it admit that we have temporarily changed the operating procedures; and that would imply that we ought to get rid of that last sentence and not talk at all about ranges that way   I think I've already said my piece, Mr Chairman I have nothing to add to it   Are there any advantages in your mind to making it more difficult for the market to understand the significance of the borrowing levels? In other words, would there be any disadvantages to publishing a special situation borrowing number?   But how would they know there are only one or two institutions?   I see   In that case, it doesn't make any difference whether we publish it or not   Well, it's hardnosed in the sense that we have certain standards that they have to meet   Also, the Treasury doesn't collect any revenue when balances buy services   Yes, but if it's not reliably related to income, the fact that you can control it is not very relevant to policy I've been sitting around this table for 19 years now, and I've concluded that the search for an indicator for monetary policy that will overcome this yearning is a complete waste of time I think history shows that there is no suitable indicator for monetary policy that is going to give you reliable nominal GNP results It's a waste of time to look the world is too complicated; the world is just too complicated What we really have to do is go back to the kind of thinking that was around the table when I first came to the Federal Reserve under Bill Martin, and that is leaning against the wind And I think the--   Really, leaning against the known wind when nominal GNP is really the target, except we don't want to admit that in public for very good reasons   But you know what direction you want monetary policy to move The amplitude is where the problem of judgment comes in   Well, if interest rates are going down, you're going to have an expansionary movement in the economy regardless of what your money supply does   But it was a politically determined structure of reserve requirements   I don't think that's the reason The reason was that, in order to get the thrifts to sign onto the Monetary Control  -35-    12/15-16/87  Act, we had to have a system that didn't generate [unintelligible] with reserve requirements on the thrifts And, that's the reason for the structure It had nothing to do with--   The weight of currency is much higher in the monetary base and that's--   That's a major difference   Mr Chairman, told me last week that their new problem loan area is in loans to which suggests that maybe some of these countries are beginning to hurt in trying to maintain their market share in the US market   Well, Mr Chairman, after looking at the surprisingly strong October-November employment gains, it would seem that when the stock market decline hit us we had an economy with a very strong head of steam, particularly in the manufacturing sector Perhaps the stock market drop will turn out to be a blessing in disguise in that it has taken at least a little of the speculative euphoria out of the system The only impact we see in New England from the stock market decline is changed expectations as to the growth rate of the financial services industry, which had been growing very rapidly in New England, particularly the mutual fund business Looking at the forecast, it seems to me that the risk is that the economy will grow more rapidly than we are forecasting, particularly in the business fixed investment sector I know that the current quite modest projection is in line with the forecast, as Mike Prell said But if we keep moving in the direction of greater utilization in manufacturing capacity, which I think is in the cards, I wonder whether the rate of growth of business fixed investment in 1988 may turn out to be substantially higher Then we could have a situation in which the economy is growing faster than we can afford to see it grow Maybe we could grow at a 2-1/2 percent rate without generating acceleration of wage increases But if growth is much beyond 2-1/2 percent, I think we run the risk of making a fundamental change in this benign wage environment that we've had So, I don't see that we have a lot of room to maneuver here And I think the risk in the forecast is that we forecast too low a rate of growth in business fixed investment   Mr Chairman, I think you're right that, at least temporarily, we're really locked into a no-change policy, which I would interpret as alternative "B" I would make the directive symmetric With regard to operating procedures, I would stay with our current stance of trying to stabilize the funds rate over the next few weeks in the 6-3/4 - 6-7/8 percent area But once the Desk has concluded that the year-end adjustment is over and the relationships appear to be moving back toward normality, I would move to option (4), our pre-October 19 operating procedure, with a borrowing level of $300 million   I have two questions, Mr Chairman One, the part of the forecast I have a problem with is business fixed investment [Given] sustained strength in the manufacturing sector, except maybe in automobiles, the staff is showing the manufacturing industry operating at higher levels of capacity That is going to produce, unfortunately I think, some price strains as the year goes on The staff projection shows a deceleration in business fixed investment against last year Now, I find that hard to reconcile not only with normal cyclical patterns but also with the orders figures for the past four months The projection has real plant and equipment spending up at a 29 percent annual rate and nondefense capital goods up at a 35 percent annual rate These are unusually strong increases; it would lead me to conclude that I should discount the plant and equipment surveys as being a bit out of date and [not] factor in a bigger increase in fixed investment this year   Mr Chairman, our forecast is higher than the staff forecast in both real GNP and inflation, primarily because we think that capital spending is going to be higher this year than they're projecting I think we have a data system in the United States that is pretty oriented toward the idea that the United States is an island--here we sit not knowing how much of this increase in inventories is imported goods and how much is domestic The conclusion [with respect to one's forecast] obviously is very different But we don't know  SPEAKER(?) I think Mike Prell knows but he won't tell us   There's also this issue that was stressed earlier--that we don't know how much of the durable goods orders are from domestic origins and how much from foreign It seems to me that we, as an institution that works on these data--perhaps you [Mr Chairman] might use your good offices to try to see if we could expand this kind of differentiation in the data, because I think we are going to need it in the future   But I think that was at a time when it wasn't really as important to us to have these data as it is now The Germans and Europeans in general seem to be able to generate numbers like this   I was kind of [unintelligible] by that as a proposition The occupancy rate of the New Hampshire hotels is 100 percent this week because all of the national press and many political people have invaded the state The vacancy rate will start to grow next week and they will again be thinking about whether we are going to get enough snow to bring the skiers up to New Hampshire But for the moment it's booming and you couldn't get a hotel room in New Hampshire As I've indicated before, we have had a downtrend in manufacturing employment in New England since December 1984, reflecting a mini-recession in our computer industry That downtrend has ended October-November show the first increases in manufacturing employment in New England in our computer industry since the end of '84 Given that our unemployment rate is 3 percent, I think the only question is Where are they going to find the labor to generate a further increase in employment? I had thought for a while that perhaps a slowdown in defense contracting might spin off some skilled labor that the high-tech industry could use; but I've been disabused of this notion by our defense industry people who point out that what's happening in the Pentagon now is that they're focusing on slowing down the increase in the number of what they call, in Pentagonese, platforms--ships, aircraft, and so on--and focusing on increasing the electronic capabilities of existing platforms We're not much on platforms except for nuclear submarines, which are made in Connecticut Our primary defense product is defense electronics and the outlook for that has not been impacted at all by the slowdown in real defense spending in general In our area we are still having an office building boom [I saw] a big sign saying 75 percent committed I inquired as to whether that could possibly be true and I was told it really is  SPEAKER(?) Boykin needs to know about that   My concern is When is Boston going to turn into a Dallas or a Houston? It has to happen sometime, but it appears that it's still some time off   Mr Chairman, I would go for alternative III, but for different reasons than have been expressed I don't see the near-term downside risks that Mr Corrigan talked about I looked at those new orders figures for December, and not only were they exceptionally strong, but the fact that they were that strong two months after the stock market crash suggests to me that our manufacturing sector is really going to be on a roll in the first half of this year And that is highly likely to generate higher spending on plant and equipment than the staff forecast is indicating So, I think by the time we reach midyear, our problem of softness in the economy is going to be way behind us and our concern is going to be the price pressures generated by a manufacturing sector that is really booming And I think having a slightly lower upside limit on the aggregates might be very helpful for us in that kind of a situation   Well, you didn't get much of a bond market response to the 6-1/4 percent fed funds rate yesterday   Mr Chairman, I agree with Mr Corrigan that we tackle our policy as if we are controlling the funds rate I don't feel upset by this, however I think there are only two things we can control--the funds rate or the rate of growth in reserves And what we have found in recent years is that there is no stable relationship between the rate of growth in reserves and the objectives of this Committee So let's face it that leaves us only with making judgments with respect to interest rates Even though we find it's difficult to follow, because of the experience of the 1970s, I think it's much better to face it than to build sand castles based somehow on relationships between borrowing levels and our objectives I served on this Committee when Bill Martin was Chairman For 19 years he controlled monetary policy through monitoring the federal funds rate [or other money market rates] And that 19 years was a period of extremely successful monetary policy I think the idea that we cannot have a successful policy controlling the funds rate is simply wrong I think we have a lot of history to suggest that we can So, I don't share Jerry's concern about calling a spade a spade  Therefore, my recommended policy would be alternative B, by which I mean that we keep the federal funds rate around 6-5/8 percent--I think that's what Don described--until such time as we think it ought to be moved lower or higher As far as the long-term range, Mr Chairman, I would prefer alternative III; but as a practical matter I see absolutely no difference between alternative II and alternative III and I'd follow your discretion as to which one you think would be politically superior, because from my experience, a half of one percent over a year is nothing that we ought to quarrel about   One other aspect is that I don't think we--I was around this place in the 1970s--sufficiently understood that the inflation psychology had become so strong in this country that small moves in interest rates were shrugged off Moves in interest rates that previously would have had a big impact on the market had no discernable impact at all And we were very slow to recognize that   As I said at the last meeting, I think that what we're really doing under the current procedure is targeting the federal funds rate The reason is that if you target borrowing, that means that you are automatically supplying nonborrowed reserves to the extent the market demands it And that means that if the demand for reserves is strong, we'll supply an increased rate of reserve growth in order to have the effect of keeping the federal funds rate from  -22-    3/29/88  rising If the demand for reserves is low, we will reduce the amount of nonborrowed reserves and that will keep the federal funds rate from falling I didn't mean that we're pegging the funds rate the way we were back in the 1960s and the 1970s What I think we are doing is keeping the fed funds rate within a certain range I think that is a desirable thing to do I don't agree with Bob Black that we should publish a range for the federal funds rate--if he meant that I think politically we're a lot better off with the present form of the directive, because if we get back to a period where we need to raise interest rates in sizable chunks, we're going to be a lot better off having that form of directive than having to announce a federal funds range of 50 basis points or something like that On the other hand, I don't think we should kid ourselves about what we're doing I think there's a good reason for staying with the present procedure, but we should recognize that we're not controlling the rate of growth of reserves--we're controlling the federal funds rate within a band  So, I think that when we have problems with borrowings--if banks are reluctant to borrow for some reason, or there's some other technical reason why the borrowing is getting out of line with the range of interest rates the Committee is talking about--the range of interest rates ought to be dominant and not the borrowing target And I think that is precisely what Peter's been doing, and that's why you get these zigs and zags I think those zigs and zags are very productive and we shouldn't worry about it It would be a lot less productive if we were getting that kind of movement in the funds rate; if there's some technical reason for it, I'd much rather see it reflected in--   They're more productive than--   If we tried to just keep it at a level--   The funds rate would be dropping all over the place   And I think that would be undesirable So, I think de facto, controlling the borrowing is a functional equivalent of controlling the fed funds rate But at the same time I think it would be unwise for political reasons to change the format at this time   I think what we learned in the 1970s--and we should keep it in the back of our minds--is that publishing a funds  -23-    3/29/88  range at a time when we need to push the funds rate up would pose a hazardous duty And we should never get back to doing that   Publishing in the directive that the Manager should keep the funds rate within a small range I think it would be unwise for us to go back to that   Bob, the interim can turn out to be a long time   I think that one of the critical issues for this year is the ability of our manufacturing capacity to deal with the demand that is going to be placed upon it Looking at your numbers that show only a very modest increase in capacity utilization, is this a consoling factor to you, as far as being able to exert some restraint on the ability of manufacturers to raise prices? Or should I read something else into it?   Steve McNees reminded me yesterday that the average miss in GNP forecasts made in the first quarter is plus or minus 1-1/2 percent It seems to me that if we miss on the upside this time, we could have some really serious problems with price pressures in manufacturing  -38-    3/29/88   But it is a sobering number We don't really have much room It seems that the forecast you are giving us is 27 percent real growth; that's probably as much as we can stand without generating some serious price problems   Mr Chairman, as I indicated earlier, I'm still concerned about the potential for the economy overheating this year, particularly in the manufacturing sector I think later on this year we are going to be running pretty thin margins in a lot of manufacturing industries, in terms of capacity utilization And one thing we have learned from the 1970s experience is that if we are going to stabilize the economy and prevent inflation from blowing up again, we have to be willing to act before it is clear that inflationary pressures are here If we wait until we see wages escalating or prices escalating on a broad scale, we will have a momentum that is going to be very difficult to turn around And I think we ought to keep that in mind when we rule on a policy today  -51-    3/29/88   Well, Mr Chairman, I think in about 95 percent of the meetings I've attended in the last 20 years it would have been perfectly appropriate to make a proposal for no change in the existing policy, in the light of uncertainties that existed at the time And I think that's one reason why we've always tended to lag I'm particularly concerned, given our present structure of meetings We went to this eight-meeting system back at the time when we were supposedly controlling M1 and, therefore, there was less need for frequent consultation I think that ought to be reconsidered if we are really on an interest rate control system, even though there was a lot of sentiment against it expressed at the last meeting To have our next meeting at the end of June involves a long intermeeting interval in this kind of situation That doesn't mean that I disagree with your recommendation that we sort of hedge our position here--go half way, with the idea that we'll look at the incoming data in the next couple of weeks, and perhaps decide to go whole hog I would suggest that the proper time would be to have a meeting after the new orders figures are out If my thesis is right--that we have a head of steam building in the manufacturing sector--then that ought to be reflected in pretty strong orders figures And if they're not strong, that would be a signal for--   That's right; if you wanted to wait two weeks you'd pick that up   In terms of approaching it this way and hedging our position--moving half way and reconsidering in a couple of weeks-- that makes good sense to me But, if we weren't going to reconsider, I would prefer to go whole hog right now   Whole hog means "C", yes   Well, I have a contrary opinion I think what we have learned in our adventures with M1 is that, if a monetary aggregate is not predictably related to nominal GNP, it is not a useful indicator for monetary policy We went through a number of years with M1 in which the Committee had to set aside M1 as a target, then later reinstate it, hoping that it would again become a predictable indicator of nominal GNP And then we finally removed it entirely I think if you look at Tom's chart at the back of his memo, it's pretty clear to me that, if we had had a monetary base target in 1980, we would have had to get rid of the monetary base for the precise reasons we had to get rid of M1 as a target If you look at the growth rate of the monetary base in the fourth quarter of 1982 and the first quarter of 1983, you'll see that it was running around 12 percent--3 percentage points above the top of the limit Given the fact that the ratio of currency to reserves is about 2-1/2 to 1, it would have taken an extremely tight monetary policy to push that rate of growth back within the 9 percent ceiling And I would point out that the fourth quarter of 1982 was the bottom of the worst recession we've had in this country since the 1930s It's inconceivable to me that this FOMC, or any other FOMC, would have thought it sensible to have followed a much more restrictive policy in the fourth quarter of 1982 and the first quarter of 1983 We already had classically high interest rates I don't know what federal funds rate would have been required to push the monetary base growth back to 9 percent, but it obviously would have been a lot higher than 20 percent, because 20 percent was not doing it   All right; but your system would require us to react at this particular time   Well, let's take a look at 1986 then In the years immediately preceding it, we were within the band; we weren't way below except for one point in 1984 So, you can't argue in the case of 1986 that we would have been making up for a big shortfall, because there wasn't a shortfall Yet, here again, this constraint would have required us in 1986 to have followed a substantially more restrictive monetary policy Now, 1986 was the year in which the average unemployment rate was 7 percent; the rate of growth of nominal  -21-    5/17/88  GNP was 22 percent; the rate of growth of the GNP deflator was 22 percent I submit that anything that indicates that we should have followed a severely more restrictive monetary policy in 1986 does not meet my requirements for a common sense monetary policy And I think the Committee would have abandoned it again in 1986   And that is because M1 was growing very rapidly These two are closely related indicators and they have the same components You have currency plus the reserves against transactions deposits as against currency plus transactions deposits And they're going to tend to move in a fairly similar fashion The weight of currency is different But, as you argue, where the base departs is typically where you have unusual growth in deposits So, you can't expect M1 to be something we had to get rid of as a target, and the monetary base, which is so closely related, to be something that would have given us a good guide to monetary policy during this period It's hard for me to conceive that we would have gone through this period and not have been faced with a situation of either discounting the base as an indicator, or following a policy which, given the economic conditions, would have been a policy that was much too restrictive for the situation   But doesn't your system require that you try to get below 9 percent once you get above it?   Well, I just think your own evidence suggests that it's not a workable guide to monetary policy   We would have voted differently today   But the problem is that the character of M2 has changed quite dramatically in recent years   It used to be that M2 paid a below-market rate Now it pays a market rate And there is no way that you can take the old data on M2 and come up with any conclusions that will permit you to forecast the M2/GNP relationship in the future   I'd say we won't break 1979, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, this is a minor matter, but I find it rather curious that Lloyds, at about the time they're recognized as a primary dealer in the US market, dropped out of the gilt market I wondered what the--    6/29-30/88   Well, Mr Chairman, I think the data for the last two months are pretty close to ideal We've had a slowdown in consumer spending and an increase in exports, and we've had moderation    6/29-30/88  in the growth of orders since December I was quite alarmed at the rate of growth of new orders for durable goods and capital goods last year That was clearly something that was not sustainable And so the inflection toward slower growth that we've seen since December is welcomed  We're seeing the first signs of the impact of a slowdown in military spending General Electric laid off 800 people from a defense electric factory It's the first layoff in the defense industry that I've seen So I think that the military budget stimulus to the economy has peaked and will probably be a somewhat negative influence in the next few years And that will perhaps give us a little more breathing room in the industrial sector--breathing room we need very much I think we're at a point now where the economy really can't sustain a growth rate of more than 2 percent without generating inflationary pressures And I think we've got to lean against any period of growth in excess of that I sense that there has been a deceleration in recent months and I hope that continues  I've been going around New England on a private campaign to avoid a future commercial building glut in our District We have the kind of euphoria in commercial building now that they had in Texas in earlier years And I think there's not a proper recognition that the New England economy from this point really is going to be a very slowly growing economy That's the speech that Mr [unintelligible] referred to yesterday We're at a 29 percent unemployment rate In addition to that, we've got a slower natural growth rate of the labor force than the rest of the country because our birth rate has been relatively low That's compounded by the fact that our labor force participation rate is substantially higher than the national rate We're running about 2 percentage points higher in the participation rate for men and about 3-1/2 percentage points higher for women So, the only way we can grow as fast as the national economy is by having a very large in-migration of population  So the arithmetic of the New England economy is very clear We're going to be a slow-growing--prosperous, but slow-growing-- economy for the next decade But I see the commercial developers making plans on the assumption that we're going to grow as fast as we have in the past 15 years That's why I'm out trying to generate a little caution among the lenders, because I think the history of Dallas and every other place is that as long as the lenders will provide the developers money, they're going to build I can remember very well the time a couple of years ago when Bob Boykin expressed his dismay at the fact that a new office building was just getting started in Dallas despite the drop in the price of oil and despite the fact that the vacancy rate was over 20 percent So we're trying to do what we can to have a building boom that doesn't end in a glut I'm not sure we'll be successful, but we're trying  In the regional area, we have an expectation of a rising rate of wage increases for which we can't provide any documentation either Steve McNees generated a wage forecasting model a number of years ago and it performed very well until the last few years where the model says that wages should have been going up much faster than they have been   Yes And I think that is really the basis for our concern, because you really can't look at the data and say we're at an inflection point I think that may be the basis for concern generally Wages should have been growing more rapidly for a 6th year of expansion than they have, and ergo, they will be growing a lot faster I think quite clearly our job is to keep a sharp eye out for the growth rate in the economy and to lean against it if it gets [too high] I don't know whether the 2 percent guideline is the proper one; I'm inclined to think that, given the arithmetic on productivity and labor force growth, we can't come out with a number a lot higher than that I really question, unless we get a much better productivity performance than we've had, whether the 2-1/2 percent the staff is using is not too high--whether two percent may be more realistic But I think we're at a point now where we've got to lean against any rate of growth in excess of 2 percent   I've always been uncomfortable with setting a range for the year in the middle of the preceding year I am very sympathetic to the idea that we keep the present range at this point for 1989 and tell Congress that, if we are thinking in February as we think today, that we'd probably reduce it But I think our ability to forecast velocity is so limited, that to try to set a range for 1989 in June of 1988--that is something We've always done it that way; but, at the same time I know that once we set it in the middle of year one, it is difficult to revise it in the middle of year two It develops a certain inertia and people get concerned about what would happen to our image, and so on It seems to me that if we get into a pattern of keeping the existing range, and telling the Congress we'd be more comfortable setting the subsequent year's range in February, that we'd be better off in the long run   I will too, Mr Chairman I would add on the discount rate that it seems to me that we ought to reserve action on the discount rate to have something in the closet that we can bring out to cope with a sharply declining dollar I'd remind you that the last rally phase for the dollar lasted six weeks Maybe this will be more prolonged; I rather doubt it   Yes I think it's a very useful instrument for that kind of a situation because it's an instrument that's very visible to people abroad And I think we could act without really fundamentally changing our monetary policy and still get some bang to the buck Whereas if we go on aligning the discount rate to the funds rate and we do run into such a period, we don't have anything to use in that kind of a situation except intervention I think we could support intervention with a rise in the discount rate; that would be very useful in that context if it happens   And then it does--   Mr Chairman, Frank Morris I also agree for the reasons stated Also, it seems to me that, given the June employment figures--even with the seasonal adjustment problems--and given the strength of purchasing orders, the economy is stronger than we thought it was at the time of the FOMC meeting   Mr Chairman, I want to compliment the staff for giving us these drought-adjusted GNP projections because I think these really give us a more realistic appraisal of the pressure on resources that we are likely to see during the rest of the year than    8/16/88  the ordinary GNP numbers The decline from the drought is hardly a usual source of decline in the GNP because it doesn't generate any resources that you can shift into other uses in the economy So, if you look at drought-adjusted growth rates for this past quarter and the next two quarters, you get 36 percent for the second quarter--a number I got from my staff--38 percent in the third quarter, and 28 percent in the fourth And I must say that this adds up to two full years now of running the economy substantially in excess of our long- term growth potential We have a real barn burner of an economy on our hands That's the only thing I can see   Mr Chairman, the New England economy appears to have moved into a new phase at the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year For 13 years we were an economy that was growing faster than the economy as a whole, and about 40 percent faster in terms of the rate of growth in personal income Since September of last year, we've seen a situation in which the rate of growth in New England is running a little over 1/2 the rate of growth of employment for the country as a whole and about the same rate of growth of personal income I've been analyzing this and I've concluded that the reason for the slowdown is simply sheer shortages of labor The unemployment rate is 28 percent for New England as a whole And there's just no way that we are going to be a growth area in the next decade, it seems to me This is causing some embarrassing spinoffs The governor of Massachusetts has found his revenues coming in well below projections And, of course, the reason is simply that Massachusetts is fully employed; we can't grow the way we've done in the past  -19-    8/16/88  The only state in New England which is doing better than the national average in terms of growth of employment and income is Maine And that's the state with the highest unemployment rate and with a lot of people underemployed in the labor force But the rest of New England is flat out If you look at the areas of employment for this fully employed economy, there are only two occupational areas where we are doing better than the national average One is finance, insurance, and real estate, and the other is construction I find this rather alarming because the reason, of course, is that we still have this big commercial office building boom going on we are starting to see signs around Stanford of surplus space But I just got a report from and they're projecting that the current vacancy rate of 11 percent in Boston, which is still low by national standards, is going to drop to 8 percent by the end of 1989 I think this is baloney And I think what it means is that by the end of 1989, the real estate business-- and I'm afraid some of our bankers are going to find themselves having invested in some of these buildings--will be taking on the characteristics of Houston and Dallas So, I think we are definitely in a turning point situation, which stems sheerly from the fact that we just don't have any labor for growth any more I see state spending in Massachusetts being projected--, they're projecting a rate of growth of revenues next year of 83 percent It's not going to happen It can't happen in the slow-growing environment that we are going to have   I think something has to give there It's not going to be before the election I think the euphoria is going to be disappearing and we'll be facing a lot of the problems of a slow- growing economy   we are getting some in-migration, but the problem is our housing is so scarce that the price of residential housing has just ballooned in the past few years It has gone to astronomical levels, we are up to New York and San Francisco levels And it's very difficult to move people into Boston; they get sticker shock when they see our residential real estate prices So I think the prospect of more than a modest in-migration is very, very dim   On page 12 of the Bluebook you say that the tightening of reserve positions under alternative "C" immediately following the discount rate hike would be somewhat surprising to market participants I find that statement surprising It seems to me that the market is anticipating us to follow-up the discount rate increase with a firmer policy and that they'd be surprised if we didn't   I find myself with Mr Hoskins I think we are moving too slowly We've had in the past month evidence showing that the economy is much stronger than we thought a month ago We've had this dazzling--more than 800,000--increase in payroll employment in two months, we are seeing the producer price index, excluding food and fuel, break out on the upside of the range that it has been in in recent years, we are seeing a rising trend in labor compensation  -43-    8/16/88  Granted, most of that reflects medical costs and not necessarily all wages, but it still shows the beginning of a rising trend in labor costs in the United States  I view this present situation as being asymmetric in this sense that given the powerful [unintelligible] in time, if we were to move to a policy that was too restrictive we would have plenty of time to correct it as we did in 1983, 1984, 1987 But if we make the opposite mistake and have a policy that's too accommodating, we may find ourselves way behind the curve and facing a situation in which we only have two choices--accommodating an accelerating inflation or pushing the economy into recession And it seems to me that is the real danger of moving too slowly in the face of evidence that the economy is picking up very strongly  Steve McNees reminds me that the average forecasting error four quarters out is 1-1/2 percentage point, plus or minus If the error is plus, meaning that our forecast is on the downside, I think four quarters from now we will have only that choice Do we accommodate a further acceleration of inflation or do we push the economy into recession? And that is the kind of choice we ought to be trying to avoid at all costs The cost of moving now, running the risk of following too tight a policy now, is a lot less than the cost of being forced into making one of these two bad choices And the only way you can avoid making one of those two bad choices, as we learned in the 1970s, is by taking a risk early in the game During the 1970s we were doing exactly what we are doing here We were moving policy in the right direction, but we were never moving it enough to stay ahead of what was going on in the system I feel that we are making exactly the same kind of mistakes today I would buy Hoskins' suggestion of moving initially to $700 million with the idea of closing up at an $800 million level I think that sounds sensible rather than doing it all at once But I have a very strong feeling that we are moving policy too slowly here   I have a question for Mr Truman I note that you're expecting a better than $25 billion deterioration in net investment income this year as compared to last year But you show no further decline in 1989   Mr Chairman, we in Boston agree very strongly with the staff's long-term conviction that the economy is so strong-- its strength stemming from net exports and capital goods--that the job of the Federal Reserve would be to try to keep this economy from going beyond capacity levels and generating a new inflationary cycle And we agree that substantial increases in interest rates are likely to be required to produce that  We're seeing a little evidence of a slowdown recently, but this is the kind of flow that you often get in a very strong economy I don't think we ought to get it in our minds that we've reached a level of growth which from now on is going to be compatible with price stability I think it's a very short-term phenomenon we're talking about And I think our financial markets have been impacted in the last couple of months by a very special factor--a nonsustainable special factor--which is that private foreign capital inflows have been coming into this country at rates substantially in excess of the amount of our foreign account deficit Of course, the counterpart of that is very large sales on the part of central banks, including ourselves This I think has greatly strengthened our bond market; but it's not a factor that we can count on being sustained for very long We've seen foreign exchange markets in the past couple of years turn on a dime And I suspect that sometime in the next few months the appetite of private foreign investors for US assets is not going to continue to grow at the present rate And when that happens, you're going to see many long-term bonds go up by 50 basis points, and  -18-    9/20/88  perhaps more, overnight I think we're living in a special financial world here which is not sustainable  Could I comment about the meeting schedule for next year since I can do so in an objective manner since I won't be here? You know we--   We set up this eight-meeting schedule at the time we went to targeting the monetary aggregates And the idea was that, since we're controlling M1 and presumably not paying attention to anything else, why do we have to meet every month? It seems to me that the Committee would be well advised to go back to a once-a-month schedule because we're in an environment in which I don't feel comfortable that we're not having another meeting until November 1st It's such a rapidly changing world that we live in that I think an eight-meeting schedule is too few It's true that we can handle problems in conference calls, but that doesn't quite substitute, in my mind, for the discipline of gathering around this table I know the staff won't like it because it increases their work load, and a lot of the presidents won't like it because of travel requirements But I don't think those considerations should be paramount And I would strongly advise you to at least think about going back to the once-a- month schedule because it seems to me that the volatility of the world we live in isn't well suited to this Committee meeting every five or six weeks  As far as the New England economy is concerned, we're continuing to grow at about half the rate of the national economy, simply because of the shortage of labor The only state in New England which is growing as fast as the national economy is Maine, which has a very high unemployment rate of 4 percent And it's the only surplus labor area in New England, so manufacturing industries are tending to push farther and farther north into Maine and threaten our little enclave at Lewiston, Maine That's a very low-wage RCPC; it has the lowest unit labor costs of any check processing center in the country, and my successor may not have that distinction for very much longer   Mr Chairman, I agree with Mr Parry that the Committee is going to have to be taking other moves toward tightening in the not-too-distant future, but the timing is not right for the moment And I would agree with your position   No, that has to be a record Even with Bill Martin   Well, Mr Chairman, most things have already been said, and I certainly agree and I think most economists agree that in the long run the price level is a function of the long-run rate of growth in the money supply I think for that reason it would be useful every six months for this Committee to take another look at the last chart [in the staff study] On the other hand, if you look at chart 2, exhibit 2, you see that in the third month M2 velocity is extremely unfavorable and therefore we've got to think in terms of the long-run trend of M2 while at the same time recognizing that any rigid targeting of M2 is not going to produce a desirable outcome with respect to nominal GNP So, I think it has a value but not a value in setting monetary policy in the short run   I just wonder, though, whether it's safe to say in retrospect, [given] the very large rate of growth in M2 since 1986, that a much tighter policy would have been desirable in 1986 I don't have that sense I think that in certain contexts that may well be true, but it seems to me that this exhibit 2 dominates, and I'd hate to see us think if we had had a slow rate of growth in M2 for a couple of years that this would give us the feeling that we can be a little looser now because we don't have to worry about inflation in 1989 I think that would be a completely wrong--   I know, I know   I'm just saying that it's very tough to tighten monetary policy, and I wonder whether just occasionally the model may not give us a rationale for not doing what we ought to be doing; that's the only concern I have Two years of slow M2 growth I think should not under this set of conditions lead us to conclude that we need to be a little less alert to inflation than we otherwise would be; I think that would be a wrong conclusion I'm not saying you are drawing that [conclusion], but I think there's a danger in being tougher I remember back in 1975 we had this slow rate of growth of M1 and this was the [period when] monetarism was [gaining prominence]; the broader aggregates were growing very rapidly; M1 was not And this Committee took a little comfort from the fact that M1 was growing fairly modestly and that comfort turned out to be costly So I just wonder whether in the short run such a model might lead us as much to error as to success   Mr Chairman, I expected the decline in the dollar after the [unintelligible] Treasury issued in the past three months which suggested the improvement in our trade position was fizzling out We've really been stagnating with respect to any improvement in our trade position in the last three months Furthermore, we've had an exchange rate in the third quarter which produced a net decline in import prices Even if you take out the decline in oil prices you have a decline in import prices Now, I don't see how we're going to make much further progress on the trade deficit unless we have a further decline in the dollar I think we should intervene to make sure that it's an orderly decline But it seems to me the evidence is pretty strong that with exchange rates at their third-quarter level we are not going to make much progress in reducing the trade deficit   It accentuates it That's one of the reasons why I have to classify the staff inflation forecast as the best possible scenario I think the inflation rate in 1989 has got to be higher, but I was going to talk about that later   I was talking with a visitor from about countries diversifying their reserve assets, and he said  that keeps asking why they keep all their reserves in dollars So we are beginning to hear the kinds of things we heard in 1978-1979   The term "bridge loan" has taken on connota- tions that it didn't use to have   It seems to me it ought to be a term that we avoid because it now means in the financial press highly speculative loans undertaken in connection with leveraged buyouts   Certainly not too great any more  SPEAKER(?) Real estate gets it, too   Well, Mr Chairman, as I said earlier I think the inflation projections look much too optimistic I would use them as a best case projection There are a lot of very optimistic assumptions embodied in the projections One is what will happen to unit labor costs--because it has been in a rising trend since the middle of 1987 The projection assumes that they will level out at 4    11/1/88  percent throughout 1989 I would think this would certainly be the best case projection I can't imagine anyone coming up with a lower number I would say that more probably we will continue to see some continued rise in unit labor costs   Compensation   I mean labor costs   That's what the projection shows through 1989 and leveling off around 4 percent unit labor costs   Yes And I hope that's the outcome, but I think in the seventh year of an expansion with very tight labor markets and growing tighter that could well be off on the low side   I really don't know I think we've been blessed in this situation with the remarkable behavior in wages I think you can attribute some of it to the decline in organized labor, some to concern about being competitive with foreigners which we didn't have in the 1970s But I'm not confident that it's going to continue   No, it's all right I would like to think that it will level out at 4 percent But I think that the odds are that it's going to start to get higher I think we're more vulnerable next year since I believe that the dollar has started another leg down The value of the dollar is likely to average significantly lower next year than this year, and therefore import prices are likely to rise more in 1989 than they did in 1988 And the third thing is that they are projecting lower oil prices and they may well be right I wouldn't know how to forecast oil prices, but I think there is a possibility they may not be as low as they are talking about   Okay The fact, nevertheless, is it reflects back from the projection for greater growth   And you're also forecasting, I take it, a normal agricultural year which again I hope turns out to be the case But if we have a second bad crop year, then I think we can see some very big increase [in food prices] I'd prefer to [be optimistic] on this but two [poor crop] years back to back could mean very big food price increases Now, that's more reason why I look upon this as the best case projection because everything has to go right to keep the inflation rate down in the range that we're talking about I haven't been accustomed to everything turning out right that often So, it seems to me it's important if we're thinking about monetary policy for next year to hope that we get this result but have in the back of our minds that maybe the "best case" projection is not going to be the one that's realized   I guess that's right Yes   Well, Mr Chairman, I support your position despite my longer-term concerns I think at the present juncture there's no basis for changing monetary policy
