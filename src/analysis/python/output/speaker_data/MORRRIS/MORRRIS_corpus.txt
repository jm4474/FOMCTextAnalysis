 I have a gut feeling that the economy in the last half of this year and going into 1988 is going to be stronger than we have projected, and I've been examining numbers trying to figure out where the greater strength will come from It seems to me that it could well be from the producer durable equipment sector where you show a continued rise in manufacturing capacity utilization throughout the period In recent months, we've seen a very strong trend in new orders for capital goods Yet in your projection, after the current quarter, you show only a very modest growth rate Do you view this as an area of vulnerability in your forecast?   [Unintelligible] with respect to the aggregates, not interest rates   Well, Mr Chairman, I would support Mr Corrigan's formulation of a modest tightening--a $600 million borrowing level I think that we might need to move further in the event we get a period of pronounced weakness in the dollar There has been so much talk in the foreign exchange market about the inevitability of a further leg down in the dollar that that seems to be the conventional wisdom For that reason, this recent weakness in the dollar has the potential, I think, of generating a test of the earlier lows; that's just potential; I am not forecasting that If that should turn out to be the case, we probably would have to make another move prior to the next meeting But I think the evidence of greater strength in the economy would certainly support a modest move at this time of the sort that Mr Corrigan outlined   I agree   You also have the authority, of course, to call a telephone conference meeting to reconsider the borrowing level in the event, say, we get extreme weakness in the dollar, which I think is a possibility   I think they are very much concerned about too much intervention increasing the German money supply as it did in 1978; and they want to avoid that   Peter, during most of the year, the bond market has been very sensitive to the foreign exchange rate, but in recent days we have seen the dollar under a lot of pressure and that has not been transmitted significantly to the bond market How do you appraise this?   Mr Chairman, yesterday I talked to Tom Jester of the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan and he said that in a survey taken after the stock market decline, that decline turned out to have had a very sharp effect on consumer  -10-    11/3/87  confidence He said they think the big effect is not going to be the wealth effect on consumer spending but the uncertainty He thinks consumers' reduced confidence level as to the future, generally, is likely to produce a major slowdown in consumer spending He thinks the confidence index they report will be showing about a 10 percent drop when it next comes out   Mr Chairman, I too agree that the outlook is extremely difficult to forecast because we are in a fairly new situation here But, it seems to me that the events of recent months suggest that the Louvre Accord was an agreement to maintain the US exchange rates at levels that were not sustainable We have had difficulty financing the deficit this year with private capital inflows In the first quarter of this year, that reluctance of the private foreign investor to keep on providing money at the pace needed was reflected in the downward movement in our exchange rate; but that was stopped by the Louvre agreement Subsequently, it seems to me, the pressure generated by this reluctance of foreign investors to put as much in as they had so willingly in earlier years was reflected in rising interest rates We had marvelous stability in the exchange rate but our bond rate was under upward pressure because of reduced foreign demand And that is what ultimately led to the big drop in the stock market The market had become extremely overvalued relative to bond rates of return Standard & Poor's 500 was yielding 27 percent at a time when intermediate-term governments were yielding almost 10 percent That was the biggest spread between dividend yield and intermediate-term bond yields in history So it was clearly an unsustainable situation Now we have to try to figure out how we permit the dollar to adjust downward without that being transmitted into upward pressure on the long-term bond markets And I think that's going to be a very tricky proposition for us But there is no doubt in my mind that we have to go to a much lower level of the dollar The question is How can we keep the domestic economy moving ahead even at a relatively modest rate in that context? I attended a  -23-    11/3/87  meeting at the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank where a couple of bright young people from the Board presented a superb paper I hope that it has been distributed at the Board because it tells a lot about why we have not had any more adjustment in our trade account than we have had thus far And the reason is that the import price levels have gone up at an amazingly low rate In the most recent period, reported yesterday I think by the Bureau of the Census, import prices went up in the third quarter by less than 2 percent; I think that reflects, and the paper supports this, that foreign producers who have gotten into this market are very reluctant to give up markets here and are going to try to hang in here as long as they can It seems to me that it is going to take a level of the dollar well below any long-term equilibrium level to begin to make the kind of progress I think we have to make in reducing our foreign deficit So our problem for the next few months is going to be a very tough one How do we handle this ball of wax on the declining dollar and avoid not putting all kinds of pressures on long-term bond rates that are going to be very destabilizing for the domestic economy? If we have another runup in rates, we are going to see a new low in the stock market I don't think there's any question about that So, I think it's a most unstable financial situation I wasn't around in 1929--at least I was not old enough to know what was going on--but I can't recall a period when we have had such an unstable financial system as we have right at this moment   I have an impossible question for you, Don If the dollar goes down significantly in the next couple of months, which I think is going to happen, how do we prevent that from spilling over into a rise in bond yields? That is the conflict we are going to be faced with in the next month, it seems to me   Yes, I think it would be desirable to do that   Mr Chairman, I might request that we eliminate that last sentence in Variant I, because we are talking about stabilizing the funds rate for a short period It is a temporary policy, and I don't think it makes any sense to talk about a range of 4 to 8 percent or 5 to 9 percent I think we ought it admit that we have temporarily changed the operating procedures; and that would imply that we ought to get rid of that last sentence and not talk at all about ranges that way   I think I've already said my piece, Mr Chairman I have nothing to add to it   One other aspect is that I don't think we--I was around this place in the 1970s--sufficiently understood that the inflation psychology had become so strong in this country that small moves in interest rates were shrugged off Moves in interest rates that previously would have had a big impact on the market had no discernable impact at all And we were very slow to recognize that   As I said at the last meeting, I think that what we're really doing under the current procedure is targeting the federal funds rate The reason is that if you target borrowing, that means that you are automatically supplying nonborrowed reserves to the extent the market demands it And that means that if the demand for reserves is strong, we'll supply an increased rate of reserve growth in order to have the effect of keeping the federal funds rate from  -22-    3/29/88  rising If the demand for reserves is low, we will reduce the amount of nonborrowed reserves and that will keep the federal funds rate from falling I didn't mean that we're pegging the funds rate the way we were back in the 1960s and the 1970s What I think we are doing is keeping the fed funds rate within a certain range I think that is a desirable thing to do I don't agree with Bob Black that we should publish a range for the federal funds rate--if he meant that I think politically we're a lot better off with the present form of the directive, because if we get back to a period where we need to raise interest rates in sizable chunks, we're going to be a lot better off having that form of directive than having to announce a federal funds range of 50 basis points or something like that On the other hand, I don't think we should kid ourselves about what we're doing I think there's a good reason for staying with the present procedure, but we should recognize that we're not controlling the rate of growth of reserves--we're controlling the federal funds rate within a band  So, I think that when we have problems with borrowings--if banks are reluctant to borrow for some reason, or there's some other technical reason why the borrowing is getting out of line with the range of interest rates the Committee is talking about--the range of interest rates ought to be dominant and not the borrowing target And I think that is precisely what Peter's been doing, and that's why you get these zigs and zags I think those zigs and zags are very productive and we shouldn't worry about it It would be a lot less productive if we were getting that kind of movement in the funds rate; if there's some technical reason for it, I'd much rather see it reflected in--   They're more productive than--   If we tried to just keep it at a level--   The funds rate would be dropping all over the place   And I think that would be undesirable So, I think de facto, controlling the borrowing is a functional equivalent of controlling the fed funds rate But at the same time I think it would be unwise for political reasons to change the format at this time   I think what we learned in the 1970s--and we should keep it in the back of our minds--is that publishing a funds  -23-    3/29/88  range at a time when we need to push the funds rate up would pose a hazardous duty And we should never get back to doing that   Publishing in the directive that the Manager should keep the funds rate within a small range I think it would be unwise for us to go back to that   Bob, the interim can turn out to be a long time   I think that one of the critical issues for this year is the ability of our manufacturing capacity to deal with the demand that is going to be placed upon it Looking at your numbers that show only a very modest increase in capacity utilization, is this a consoling factor to you, as far as being able to exert some restraint on the ability of manufacturers to raise prices? Or should I read something else into it?   Steve McNees reminded me yesterday that the average miss in GNP forecasts made in the first quarter is plus or minus 1-1/2 percent It seems to me that if we miss on the upside this time, we could have some really serious problems with price pressures in manufacturing  -38-    3/29/88   But it is a sobering number We don't really have much room It seems that the forecast you are giving us is 27 percent real growth; that's probably as much as we can stand without generating some serious price problems   Mr Chairman, as I indicated earlier, I'm still concerned about the potential for the economy overheating this year, particularly in the manufacturing sector I think later on this year we are going to be running pretty thin margins in a lot of manufacturing industries, in terms of capacity utilization And one thing we have learned from the 1970s experience is that if we are going to stabilize the economy and prevent inflation from blowing up again, we have to be willing to act before it is clear that inflationary pressures are here If we wait until we see wages escalating or prices escalating on a broad scale, we will have a momentum that is going to be very difficult to turn around And I think we ought to keep that in mind when we rule on a policy today  -51-    3/29/88   Well, Mr Chairman, I think in about 95 percent of the meetings I've attended in the last 20 years it would have been perfectly appropriate to make a proposal for no change in the existing policy, in the light of uncertainties that existed at the time And I think that's one reason why we've always tended to lag I'm particularly concerned, given our present structure of meetings We went to this eight-meeting system back at the time when we were supposedly controlling M1 and, therefore, there was less need for frequent consultation I think that ought to be reconsidered if we are really on an interest rate control system, even though there was a lot of sentiment against it expressed at the last meeting To have our next meeting at the end of June involves a long intermeeting interval in this kind of situation That doesn't mean that I disagree with your recommendation that we sort of hedge our position here--go half way, with the idea that we'll look at the incoming data in the next couple of weeks, and perhaps decide to go whole hog I would suggest that the proper time would be to have a meeting after the new orders figures are out If my thesis is right--that we have a head of steam building in the manufacturing sector--then that ought to be reflected in pretty strong orders figures And if they're not strong, that would be a signal for--   That's right; if you wanted to wait two weeks you'd pick that up   In terms of approaching it this way and hedging our position--moving half way and reconsidering in a couple of weeks-- that makes good sense to me But, if we weren't going to reconsider, I would prefer to go whole hog right now   Whole hog means "C", yes   Well, I have a contrary opinion I think what we have learned in our adventures with M1 is that, if a monetary aggregate is not predictably related to nominal GNP, it is not a useful indicator for monetary policy We went through a number of years with M1 in which the Committee had to set aside M1 as a target, then later reinstate it, hoping that it would again become a predictable indicator of nominal GNP And then we finally removed it entirely I think if you look at Tom's chart at the back of his memo, it's pretty clear to me that, if we had had a monetary base target in 1980, we would have had to get rid of the monetary base for the precise reasons we had to get rid of M1 as a target If you look at the growth rate of the monetary base in the fourth quarter of 1982 and the first quarter of 1983, you'll see that it was running around 12 percent--3 percentage points above the top of the limit Given the fact that the ratio of currency to reserves is about 2-1/2 to 1, it would have taken an extremely tight monetary policy to push that rate of growth back within the 9 percent ceiling And I would point out that the fourth quarter of 1982 was the bottom of the worst recession we've had in this country since the 1930s It's inconceivable to me that this FOMC, or any other FOMC, would have thought it sensible to have followed a much more restrictive policy in the fourth quarter of 1982 and the first quarter of 1983 We already had classically high interest rates I don't know what federal funds rate would have been required to push the monetary base growth back to 9 percent, but it obviously would have been a lot higher than 20 percent, because 20 percent was not doing it   All right; but your system would require us to react at this particular time   Well, let's take a look at 1986 then In the years immediately preceding it, we were within the band; we weren't way below except for one point in 1984 So, you can't argue in the case of 1986 that we would have been making up for a big shortfall, because there wasn't a shortfall Yet, here again, this constraint would have required us in 1986 to have followed a substantially more restrictive monetary policy Now, 1986 was the year in which the average unemployment rate was 7 percent; the rate of growth of nominal  -21-    5/17/88  GNP was 22 percent; the rate of growth of the GNP deflator was 22 percent I submit that anything that indicates that we should have followed a severely more restrictive monetary policy in 1986 does not meet my requirements for a common sense monetary policy And I think the Committee would have abandoned it again in 1986   And that is because M1 was growing very rapidly These two are closely related indicators and they have the same components You have currency plus the reserves against transactions deposits as against currency plus transactions deposits And they're going to tend to move in a fairly similar fashion The weight of currency is different But, as you argue, where the base departs is typically where you have unusual growth in deposits So, you can't expect M1 to be something we had to get rid of as a target, and the monetary base, which is so closely related, to be something that would have given us a good guide to monetary policy during this period It's hard for me to conceive that we would have gone through this period and not have been faced with a situation of either discounting the base as an indicator, or following a policy which, given the economic conditions, would have been a policy that was much too restrictive for the situation   But doesn't your system require that you try to get below 9 percent once you get above it?   Well, I just think your own evidence suggests that it's not a workable guide to monetary policy   We would have voted differently today   But the problem is that the character of M2 has changed quite dramatically in recent years   It used to be that M2 paid a below-market rate Now it pays a market rate And there is no way that you can take the old data on M2 and come up with any conclusions that will permit you to forecast the M2/GNP relationship in the future   I'd say we won't break 1979, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I want to compliment the staff for giving us these drought-adjusted GNP projections because I think these really give us a more realistic appraisal of the pressure on resources that we are likely to see during the rest of the year than    8/16/88  the ordinary GNP numbers The decline from the drought is hardly a usual source of decline in the GNP because it doesn't generate any resources that you can shift into other uses in the economy So, if you look at drought-adjusted growth rates for this past quarter and the next two quarters, you get 36 percent for the second quarter--a number I got from my staff--38 percent in the third quarter, and 28 percent in the fourth And I must say that this adds up to two full years now of running the economy substantially in excess of our long- term growth potential We have a real barn burner of an economy on our hands That's the only thing I can see   Mr Chairman, the New England economy appears to have moved into a new phase at the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year For 13 years we were an economy that was growing faster than the economy as a whole, and about 40 percent faster in terms of the rate of growth in personal income Since September of last year, we've seen a situation in which the rate of growth in New England is running a little over 1/2 the rate of growth of employment for the country as a whole and about the same rate of growth of personal income I've been analyzing this and I've concluded that the reason for the slowdown is simply sheer shortages of labor The unemployment rate is 28 percent for New England as a whole And there's just no way that we are going to be a growth area in the next decade, it seems to me This is causing some embarrassing spinoffs The governor of Massachusetts has found his revenues coming in well below projections And, of course, the reason is simply that Massachusetts is fully employed; we can't grow the way we've done in the past  -19-    8/16/88  The only state in New England which is doing better than the national average in terms of growth of employment and income is Maine And that's the state with the highest unemployment rate and with a lot of people underemployed in the labor force But the rest of New England is flat out If you look at the areas of employment for this fully employed economy, there are only two occupational areas where we are doing better than the national average One is finance, insurance, and real estate, and the other is construction I find this rather alarming because the reason, of course, is that we still have this big commercial office building boom going on we are starting to see signs around Stanford of surplus space But I just got a report from and they're projecting that the current vacancy rate of 11 percent in Boston, which is still low by national standards, is going to drop to 8 percent by the end of 1989 I think this is baloney And I think what it means is that by the end of 1989, the real estate business-- and I'm afraid some of our bankers are going to find themselves having invested in some of these buildings--will be taking on the characteristics of Houston and Dallas So, I think we are definitely in a turning point situation, which stems sheerly from the fact that we just don't have any labor for growth any more I see state spending in Massachusetts being projected--, they're projecting a rate of growth of revenues next year of 83 percent It's not going to happen It can't happen in the slow-growing environment that we are going to have   I think something has to give there It's not going to be before the election I think the euphoria is going to be disappearing and we'll be facing a lot of the problems of a slow- growing economy   we are getting some in-migration, but the problem is our housing is so scarce that the price of residential housing has just ballooned in the past few years It has gone to astronomical levels, we are up to New York and San Francisco levels And it's very difficult to move people into Boston; they get sticker shock when they see our residential real estate prices So I think the prospect of more than a modest in-migration is very, very dim   On page 12 of the Bluebook you say that the tightening of reserve positions under alternative "C" immediately following the discount rate hike would be somewhat surprising to market participants I find that statement surprising It seems to me that the market is anticipating us to follow-up the discount rate increase with a firmer policy and that they'd be surprised if we didn't   I find myself with Mr Hoskins I think we are moving too slowly We've had in the past month evidence showing that the economy is much stronger than we thought a month ago We've had this dazzling--more than 800,000--increase in payroll employment in two months, we are seeing the producer price index, excluding food and fuel, break out on the upside of the range that it has been in in recent years, we are seeing a rising trend in labor compensation  -43-    8/16/88  Granted, most of that reflects medical costs and not necessarily all wages, but it still shows the beginning of a rising trend in labor costs in the United States  I view this present situation as being asymmetric in this sense that given the powerful [unintelligible] in time, if we were to move to a policy that was too restrictive we would have plenty of time to correct it as we did in 1983, 1984, 1987 But if we make the opposite mistake and have a policy that's too accommodating, we may find ourselves way behind the curve and facing a situation in which we only have two choices--accommodating an accelerating inflation or pushing the economy into recession And it seems to me that is the real danger of moving too slowly in the face of evidence that the economy is picking up very strongly  Steve McNees reminds me that the average forecasting error four quarters out is 1-1/2 percentage point, plus or minus If the error is plus, meaning that our forecast is on the downside, I think four quarters from now we will have only that choice Do we accommodate a further acceleration of inflation or do we push the economy into recession? And that is the kind of choice we ought to be trying to avoid at all costs The cost of moving now, running the risk of following too tight a policy now, is a lot less than the cost of being forced into making one of these two bad choices And the only way you can avoid making one of those two bad choices, as we learned in the 1970s, is by taking a risk early in the game During the 1970s we were doing exactly what we are doing here We were moving policy in the right direction, but we were never moving it enough to stay ahead of what was going on in the system I feel that we are making exactly the same kind of mistakes today I would buy Hoskins' suggestion of moving initially to $700 million with the idea of closing up at an $800 million level I think that sounds sensible rather than doing it all at once But I have a very strong feeling that we are moving policy too slowly here   No, that has to be a record Even with Bill Martin   I have a question for Mr Truman I note that you're expecting a better than $25 billion deterioration in net investment income this year as compared to last year But you show no further decline in 1989   Mr Chairman, we in Boston agree very strongly with the staff's long-term conviction that the economy is so strong-- its strength stemming from net exports and capital goods--that the job of the Federal Reserve would be to try to keep this economy from going beyond capacity levels and generating a new inflationary cycle And we agree that substantial increases in interest rates are likely to be required to produce that  We're seeing a little evidence of a slowdown recently, but this is the kind of flow that you often get in a very strong economy I don't think we ought to get it in our minds that we've reached a level of growth which from now on is going to be compatible with price stability I think it's a very short-term phenomenon we're talking about And I think our financial markets have been impacted in the last couple of months by a very special factor--a nonsustainable special factor--which is that private foreign capital inflows have been coming into this country at rates substantially in excess of the amount of our foreign account deficit Of course, the counterpart of that is very large sales on the part of central banks, including ourselves This I think has greatly strengthened our bond market; but it's not a factor that we can count on being sustained for very long We've seen foreign exchange markets in the past couple of years turn on a dime And I suspect that sometime in the next few months the appetite of private foreign investors for US assets is not going to continue to grow at the present rate And when that happens, you're going to see many long-term bonds go up by 50 basis points, and  -18-    9/20/88  perhaps more, overnight I think we're living in a special financial world here which is not sustainable  Could I comment about the meeting schedule for next year since I can do so in an objective manner since I won't be here? You know we--   We set up this eight-meeting schedule at the time we went to targeting the monetary aggregates And the idea was that, since we're controlling M1 and presumably not paying attention to anything else, why do we have to meet every month? It seems to me that the Committee would be well advised to go back to a once-a-month schedule because we're in an environment in which I don't feel comfortable that we're not having another meeting until November 1st It's such a rapidly changing world that we live in that I think an eight-meeting schedule is too few It's true that we can handle problems in conference calls, but that doesn't quite substitute, in my mind, for the discipline of gathering around this table I know the staff won't like it because it increases their work load, and a lot of the presidents won't like it because of travel requirements But I don't think those considerations should be paramount And I would strongly advise you to at least think about going back to the once-a- month schedule because it seems to me that the volatility of the world we live in isn't well suited to this Committee meeting every five or six weeks  As far as the New England economy is concerned, we're continuing to grow at about half the rate of the national economy, simply because of the shortage of labor The only state in New England which is growing as fast as the national economy is Maine, which has a very high unemployment rate of 4 percent And it's the only surplus labor area in New England, so manufacturing industries are tending to push farther and farther north into Maine and threaten our little enclave at Lewiston, Maine That's a very low-wage RCPC; it has the lowest unit labor costs of any check processing center in the country, and my successor may not have that distinction for very much longer   Mr Chairman, I agree with Mr Parry that the Committee is going to have to be taking other moves toward tightening in the not-too-distant future, but the timing is not right for the moment And I would agree with your position   Well, Mr Chairman, most things have already been said, and I certainly agree and I think most economists agree that in the long run the price level is a function of the long-run rate of growth in the money supply I think for that reason it would be useful every six months for this Committee to take another look at the last chart [in the staff study] On the other hand, if you look at chart 2, exhibit 2, you see that in the third month M2 velocity is extremely unfavorable and therefore we've got to think in terms of the long-run trend of M2 while at the same time recognizing that any rigid targeting of M2 is not going to produce a desirable outcome with respect to nominal GNP So, I think it has a value but not a value in setting monetary policy in the short run   I just wonder, though, whether it's safe to say in retrospect, [given] the very large rate of growth in M2 since 1986, that a much tighter policy would have been desirable in 1986 I don't have that sense I think that in certain contexts that may well be true, but it seems to me that this exhibit 2 dominates, and I'd hate to see us think if we had had a slow rate of growth in M2 for a couple of years that this would give us the feeling that we can be a little looser now because we don't have to worry about inflation in 1989 I think that would be a completely wrong--   I know, I know   I'm just saying that it's very tough to tighten monetary policy, and I wonder whether just occasionally the model may not give us a rationale for not doing what we ought to be doing; that's the only concern I have Two years of slow M2 growth I think should not under this set of conditions lead us to conclude that we need to be a little less alert to inflation than we otherwise would be; I think that would be a wrong conclusion I'm not saying you are drawing that [conclusion], but I think there's a danger in being tougher I remember back in 1975 we had this slow rate of growth of M1 and this was the [period when] monetarism was [gaining prominence]; the broader aggregates were growing very rapidly; M1 was not And this Committee took a little comfort from the fact that M1 was growing fairly modestly and that comfort turned out to be costly So I just wonder whether in the short run such a model might lead us as much to error as to success   Mr Chairman, I expected the decline in the dollar after the [unintelligible] Treasury issued in the past three months which suggested the improvement in our trade position was fizzling out We've really been stagnating with respect to any improvement in our trade position in the last three months Furthermore, we've had an exchange rate in the third quarter which produced a net decline in import prices Even if you take out the decline in oil prices you have a decline in import prices Now, I don't see how we're going to make much further progress on the trade deficit unless we have a further decline in the dollar I think we should intervene to make sure that it's an orderly decline But it seems to me the evidence is pretty strong that with exchange rates at their third-quarter level we are not going to make much progress in reducing the trade deficit   It accentuates it That's one of the reasons why I have to classify the staff inflation forecast as the best possible scenario I think the inflation rate in 1989 has got to be higher, but I was going to talk about that later   I was talking with a visitor from about countries diversifying their reserve assets, and he said  that keeps asking why they keep all their reserves in dollars So we are beginning to hear the kinds of things we heard in 1978-1979   The term "bridge loan" has taken on connota- tions that it didn't use to have   It seems to me it ought to be a term that we avoid because it now means in the financial press highly speculative loans undertaken in connection with leveraged buyouts   Certainly not too great any more  SPEAKER(?) Real estate gets it, too   Well, Mr Chairman, as I said earlier I think the inflation projections look much too optimistic I would use them as a best case projection There are a lot of very optimistic assumptions embodied in the projections One is what will happen to unit labor costs--because it has been in a rising trend since the middle of 1987 The projection assumes that they will level out at 4    11/1/88  percent throughout 1989 I would think this would certainly be the best case projection I can't imagine anyone coming up with a lower number I would say that more probably we will continue to see some continued rise in unit labor costs   Compensation   I mean labor costs   That's what the projection shows through 1989 and leveling off around 4 percent unit labor costs   Yes And I hope that's the outcome, but I think in the seventh year of an expansion with very tight labor markets and growing tighter that could well be off on the low side   I really don't know I think we've been blessed in this situation with the remarkable behavior in wages I think you can attribute some of it to the decline in organized labor, some to concern about being competitive with foreigners which we didn't have in the 1970s But I'm not confident that it's going to continue   No, it's all right I would like to think that it will level out at 4 percent But I think that the odds are that it's going to start to get higher I think we're more vulnerable next year since I believe that the dollar has started another leg down The value of the dollar is likely to average significantly lower next year than this year, and therefore import prices are likely to rise more in 1989 than they did in 1988 And the third thing is that they are projecting lower oil prices and they may well be right I wouldn't know how to forecast oil prices, but I think there is a possibility they may not be as low as they are talking about   Okay The fact, nevertheless, is it reflects back from the projection for greater growth   And you're also forecasting, I take it, a normal agricultural year which again I hope turns out to be the case But if we have a second bad crop year, then I think we can see some very big increase [in food prices] I'd prefer to [be optimistic] on this but two [poor crop] years back to back could mean very big food price increases Now, that's more reason why I look upon this as the best case projection because everything has to go right to keep the inflation rate down in the range that we're talking about I haven't been accustomed to everything turning out right that often So, it seems to me it's important if we're thinking about monetary policy for next year to hope that we get this result but have in the back of our minds that maybe the "best case" projection is not going to be the one that's realized   I guess that's right Yes   Well, Mr Chairman, I support your position despite my longer-term concerns I think at the present juncture there's no basis for changing monetary policy
