3258,1987-09-22," Turning first to the regional economy, we may have the strongest regional economy in the nation, and I think a good monetary policy for the New England region would be an alternative D When you get together with our businessmen, all they can talk about is the labor problem--that they can't get the labor they need We hear scattered reports that people are spinning off their operations in eastern Massachusetts or Connecticut and putting them in the depressed areas of northern Maine, or they are talking about putting them in other parts of the country They are not moving their entire operation, but are moving pieces of it However, I don't think New England is typical We have an overall unemployment rate of 3 percent, and in New Hampshire, it is 22 percent And that is not typical of the nation, which is 6 percent So, you can't really look at the world through our eyes  In our view, the Greenbook forecast for the US economy in the next 15 months is almost the ideal scenario If we have a sufficient guiding system to accomplish what that forecast suggests, that is almost as good as we can expect, considering the constraints It is showing a real growth rate of something like 2-1/2 percent with the overall employment rates and capacity utilization rates only slightly different than they are now, which would suggest we would have only this minor uptick in inflation next year And that is an ideal scenario So the question is Can we get there? At least as we read it, there is not much risk on the downside any more The new orders that are coming in, the industrial production statistics, and the probable greater strength from foreign orders, suggest that the dangers of a recession, at least in the next 18 months, are pretty well washed away On the upside--the possibility of having something faster than a 2-1/2 percent real growth rate--we have set in train two actions just in the last 25 days which provide us some insurance [against that] And the staff talks about additional actions during the next year that--it is our best guess--would provide additional insurance Our hope is that we can achieve the forecast that the Greenbook so optimistically puts forward I don't think I have anything to contribute to what other people have said on the long-term bond rate  -28-    9/22/87   Well, wage rates are moving up faster   Well, you would have to talk about pieces If you talk about the price of housing, we used to be--   When you talk about rental housing, it doesn't show up that much But, in fact, when you're trying to bring in professional people, you can't do it All the businessmen we talked to say they can't bring in anybody to buy a shack that costs $250,000; so there is no labor mobility in view of the housing shortage Eventually, we will not have that housing shortage, as we didn't have it in the long run in California It may be three years away So there is not much mobility, despite the fact that we pay somewhat higher wages, because the real cost of living for someone moving in and buying a house is almost impossible   I support you, Mr Chairman $600 million and a symmetric directive "
3563,1988-12-13," If I could start off with the exception, which would be the New England economy, we've had the tightest labor in the United States during the last two years, and we are beginning to see some of that soften In the Connecticut area, they have moved operations to the one remaining area which has some soft labor markets--Maine And as Bob Boykin just mentioned, GTE is going to move to Texas Our relative wages have moved up rapidly, and I think that's one of the reasons we may still be the hottest labor market in the United States, but the gap between us and the rest of the country is diminishing What's happening I think is that the tightness is spreading throughout the country; it's not getting any tighter in New England I would agree with Mike Prell's conditional forecast, which I also think is consistent with Bob Forrestal's and Gary Stern's forecasts, which are unconditional; and what we see if we move toward restraint is more modest growth next year, which would appear to be desirable The only issue on which we might disagree with the Board staff is that even with that move toward restraint, we are a little more pessimistic about the inflation rate next year We don't see many indicators yet of price pressures; they aren't creeping up very fast But the compensation figures are increasing very rapidly; there has been a big uptick in compensation And that does pass through to prices with not too long a lag   Yes, we are talking about what has happened during this last year, and we are talking about three quarters--   If you mean unionized wages, no I was referring here to the figures on the employment cost indexes   Yes   And then, no matter how you measure it--one two, or three quarters--it appears to be consistently greater this year than it was last year I guess for the last two years many of us have underestimated the growth rate of the economy We've always been a little surprised that it has been a little faster than we anticipated The latest figures suggest we are going to be a little surprised with the fourth quarter so that we always lag behind a little on the real growth that has come through So, I guess that would tend to bring about a little support for Mike Prell's assumption on a move toward restraint, or else we won't have that slower growth that he has built into this conditional forecast I sat in this room on the outskirts with a lot of my former research colleagues during the late 1960s and the early 1970s; and in retrospect we saw, year  -42-    12/13-14/88  after year, that we ran on the ragged edge of full employment--on occasion a little overfull employment--and then gradually the uptick in prices got imbedded in an inflationary psychology in the economy And we can only wipe that out at incredible expense in the labor markets in the United States and throughout South America and the world, and once that inflationary psychology gets embedded it's very expensive to get it out I don't know if we'd ever do it again; the medicine for that is to take some prevention, and this way we don't get the same kind of environment embedded in the economy that we did gradually during the late '60s and '70s  Well, I think I would prefer to move a little faster than you have proposed, but it's a mild preference  As  -62-    12/13-14/88  far as the discount rate is concerned, that is a determination for the Board anyway They might wish to do it, but not do it immediately--do it toward the end of the year "
