7,1987-08-18," I'd like to explore a couple of areas You made the point that 6 percent unemployment, more or less, is getting into the kind of full employment zone where you start to get inflation pressures It seems to me that as you look across the country, and even within regions, there is such a variability of unemployment rates that this average can be awfully misleading Take my District, for example We have a number of areas where the unemployment rate is around 3 percent We also have a few areas where the unemployment rate is 8 percent And I would guess that across the country, you would find unemployment ranges from 3 percent to, maybe, 10 or 12 percent Doesn't a lot depend on where the additional growth comes from? For example, we're going to see the growth coming in manufacturing Does that 6 percent mean what you would think it would mean, on average? It seems to me that is the kind analysis which, while it has an appeal, is greatly oversimplified, given the variability That is one area you might talk about   The other area I'd like to explore is the trade numbers You made the point that, in the forecast, we count on improvement in foreign demand to more than offset the weaker domestic demand And yet, if we're moving sideways in terms of real exports-- in a context of weak activity in Germany and real doubts in Japan--how does all that fit together? How do you get a boost from the foreign side when real net exports are moving sideways and you have weakness?   So you expect the improvement in real net exports to continue Is that--   But out beyond that?   No, I have none "
8,1987-08-18," Mr Chairman, I think that there is a case to be made for some tightening for all the reasons that have been stated the risk of inflation in the economy and also the history of probably waiting too long I am not ready to make that move at this point I have enough doubts, and I think there are enough uncertainties, about the outlook for inflation and other aspects of the economy The sentiment around this table has fluctuated a good bit in recent months, and I think we very well may be heading into a period where some tightening is appropriate; but I think it is premature at this point I would favor a directive that would maintain the $500 million of borrowing, something along the lines of alternative B However, I would give the directive an asymmetrical tilt indicating that if policy needs to be changed in the intermeeting period, that we would more likely lean in the direction of some snugging than some easing So, I would be for no change, alternative B, with some asymmetrical wording that would tilt it in the direction of some tightening, should a change be necessary   I'm sorry, Mr Chairman, I guess I don't understand the point that you are making   I agree with that, Mr Chairman I don't think we ought to downplay it We may be feeling more comfortable about the dollar just now, but it wouldn't take very much for us to find ourselves in a very uncomfortable position And six weeks from now it will be more attention-getting if we change the emphasis than if we leave it alone   That makes a lot of sense   Keep it the same "
60,1987-09-22," I would like to follow up on Bob Forrestal's question Basically, the US strategy for turning the trade deficit around is to shrink the value of the dollar and to get our trading partners to grow faster than we are growing We have done fairly well on the dollar, but we haven't done so well on growth abroad It's an appealing strategy, but it strikes me as being somewhat novel if you look at the history of these kinds of adjustments What has happened most often is that the country that has the deficit ends up with a recession In other words, you reduce domestic demand below what is happening abroad and you also get downward adjustments on the currency And I would think that the longer it takes for us to make a turnaround in the trade deficit--as we get month after month of these disappointing trade figures--that it would put additional downward pressure on the dollar And it might also begin to raise expectations that, well, as nice as it sounds to try this rather novel strategy, in the end, the US is going to have to go through kind of a wringer, as most other countries do My real question is How much of a novel experiment are we really running in light of what is happening in other countries and what has happened over history? I am having a hard time thinking of a country that hasn't turned around this kind of a trade deficit without a fair amount of suppression of domestic demand And the question is not aimed at [criticism]; I like the approach that we are on But it does strike me as somewhat novel on the broader stage of history I would just like to see if that is right or if we have had lots of company with this experiment   Are these sizable countries?   I don't have a question I would just like to comment on the outlook   Let me just comment on the Philadelphia region It continues to perform well above the national experience New Jersey, Delaware and eastern Pennsylvania continue to have very low unemployment rates As a matter of fact, I think that if there's a drag on growth in these areas, it is that there's a labor shortage and business firms simply can't keep up with production needs Even the traditional manufacturing areas in our District are showing improvement, and unemployment is coming down in those areas as well Both residential and nonresidential construction are very strong; retail sales are healthy, except for autos; loan growth is running about twice the national average; and real estate lending is growing about three times the national average So, we have a rather bullish region that is being constrained mostly I think not by a lack of aggregate demand, but labor The concern that I have picked up in the last couple of months, mostly in the business community, is a concern about inflation And I think it's being triggered by these labor shortages that people report, particularly at the entry level If you look at the help wanted ads in the newspapers, and just the help wanted signs generally, they are at pretty high levels While wage increases have been reasonably moderate, I think a lot of people in the business community are concerned that this is just the kind of situation that triggers a wage-price kind of spiral  On the national scene, I think the Greenbook numbers look reasonably good In terms of the risks--and I am being influenced by where I sit and the people that I talk to--it seems to me that whatever risks there were of having too weak an economy, or even a recession out through 1988, have shrunk considerably I see the risks now on the side of triggering some kind of a wage-price increase There is one point, however, in the outlook that I think bears mentioning, and that is that both the fundamentals and the trade situation indicate a continuing downward movement in the value of the dollar Indeed, this is reflected in the Greenbook forecast We are in this ""inflation/dollar"" box, as you aptly put it a moment ago But I think that fundamentals have a way of winning out, even over central bank policy So, as we deal with these bouts of a falling dollar and falling bond prices, we have to bear in mind that this is really what we expect We expect the dollar to go down And I think we have to be careful that, as we deal with these episodes, we don't lose track of the fundamentals That leads to the question that you posed, which is a very good question I don't have an answer, but I have a suspicion that more of this increase in long rates is real than it is  -15-    9/22/87  inflation I say that because, if you look realistically at the fact that the US is going to have to import lots of capital over the next several years, as we have the last several years, I think that calls for a certain premium over foreign interest rates What we may be seeing here is some adjustment to what it takes to attract the kinds of funds that we need "
61,1987-09-22," I support your proposition   You have only begun, I might say "
118,1987-11-03," I have a question that may be broader than for Mr Cross A week ago, we were talking about walking a thin line between the dollar and the domestic economy and I get the feeling that that thin line has broadened out some since a week ago How wide is it and do we have a policy or don't we have a policy? Is it the Treasury that's making US policy or are we just kind of letting the market take us where we go or do we have some sense of where we want to go with the dollar? There have been a lot of changes in seven days   Do you have any insight as to why Karl Otto Poehl was so blunt last night? In one sense, they had a lot to lose with a weaker dollar, and the sense I got out of his remarks was, if the dollar weakens, so be it This strikes me as-- "
119,1987-11-03," Well, there haven't been any actual changes that I can see in my District It's more that the worry level has risen What I sense is that the psychology is more important than the wealth effect; if we have another shock in the market I think we would have a real tumble in psychology; if we continue to mend without another shock I think the effects may be minimal This psychology is apparent in some of the conversations that we have had with regional retailers    11/3/87  Their merchandise for the Christmas season is already on hand, so they are stuck with it one way or another While no one we've talked to has observed any decline in sales yet that they can attribute to the financial markets, their view is that if Christmas sales do run below plan, then they are going to run their inventories much lower than they ordinarily would, and that would affect their spring ordering So, I think they just don't know They are thinking beyond the Christmas season if that turns out poorly The same attitude is apparent in manufacturing as well, where I think most manufacturers feel that the orders that they have on their books are there and they are going to fill them What they are concerned about is six months out But, overall, my sense is that the risks have changed in the economy Whether they have changed a lot or a little remains to be seen; but they have changed in the direction that real growth will be lower than we thought If we are wrong, then we'll probably be wrong in the sense that we'll have still lower growth And I think the risks have shifted, too, on the inflation side; to some extent, concerns that we had about inflation six weeks or so ago are alleviated I admire the bravery of Mike Prell and the staff for forecasting precise numbers and I think their numbers are reasonable-- not because they are necessarily right, but because I can't improve on them They seem to be broadly reasonable Just one other point I do keep hearing some very favorable news on the export side At my last full board of directors' meeting and other meetings around the District, people spoke almost with one chorus the news coming in from their salespeople is that they are able to compete in the export market, both by selling abroad as well as by competing with the imports that have been coming in "
120,1987-11-03," Well, Mr Chairman, you're very persuasive in terms of keeping things where they are, but I have a somewhat different interpretation of where we are It seems to me that we are somewhere between alternatives ""A"" and ""B""; we may be closer to ""B"" than to ""A"", but I think that we are in the ""A"" - ""B"" range for policy, with a federal funds target of something under 7 percent,  -30-    11/3/87  perhaps 6-7/8 percent or just a touch higher It strikes me, therefore, that if we go with ""B"" that we will, in effect, be tightening somewhat even though it's a subtle tightening And I sense that if we deviate at all from where we are, that it might be better to ease just a touch So I come down being in the alternative ""A"" column It's true that we have a lot of uncertainty and we don't know what's going to happen But I do think there have been enough changes, at least in terms of shifts in the direction of the risks, that it is important for us to help anchor the lower rates that we have achieved the last couple of weeks And it seems to me that something closer to ""A"" than ""B"" helps to do that, because those lower rates that we have had are important for offsetting the effects that we are going to get from the stock market I think that it ought to be clear that the Federal Reserve is trying to do that; and I think that alternative ""A"" does that less ambiguously than alternative ""B"" Clearly, there is a risk in the dollar but, as I judge the situation, we're not talking about very much of a change in rates and it seems to me that the environment is such that we could probably absorb that risk at the moment I would prefer Variant I of the language because I think it says more clearly what we are doing, and I think it's important that the directive that we put out says what we're doing Even though the language is different, and we have words like ""being flexible"" and so on, that's exactly the situation that we are in So it seems to me that's what we ought to go with If we go with alternative ""A"", then I think some symmetrical language is appropriate, with ""somewhats"" and ""mights"" on both sides Now, we are effectively operating on a federal funds strategy When we were on a federal funds strategy in the 1970s, we tended to have Open Market Committee meetings every three or four weeks As we moved more into a reserve-based strategy, we were able to lengthen out the meeting intervals to every six weeks or so So it seems to me that wherever we set the funds rate today, we are going to have to look at it very frequently And I would think that we ought to plan at least one telephone meeting two or three weeks hence, simply because if you're going to operate on a federal funds target, by necessity you have to have more meetings   Well, rather than say alternative ""A"", ""B"", or ""C"", let me say that I would prefer to have the funds rate centered on 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent rather than around 7 percent Now whether that's ""A""--   But we are talking here about alternative ""B"" delivered--   Right, but as I read the Bluebook, under alternative ""B"" we're talking of a funds rate centering more around 7 percent   That's what ""B"" says, yes   Well, I'd like to round it to 6-3/4 percent, if that's current policy I'm for current policy; if that's ""A"", I'm for ""A""   Well, I am not very concerned about the borrowing figure I want a 6-3/4 percent funds rate   If that takes $300 million in borrowing, I'm for $300 million; if it takes $400 million, I'm for $400 milion    11/3/87   That's right, so I don't think--   I want to do the funds rate; that's what I want to do   I think that's right "
173,1988-03-29," It seems to me that the larger issue, aside from things like the Japanese fiscal year, relates to times when we see these exchange relationships coming unglued Are we dealing with something that we can put a little more glue in there through intervention and move forward, or is it something more basic--like changes in economic growth or inflation or domestic economic policies or that the adjustment process isn't moving as fast as it should I would think that, while it is an impossible question to answer, you have to ask it nonetheless when you are talking about what the appropriate response is going to be If we think that it just needs some more glue, then we can achieve some good through intervention; if    3/29/88  we think that it is more basic than that, then by intervening we sort of throw good money after bad It may mean that we have to seek a new exchange rate alignment, or it may take a more fundamental change in US domestic policy As I say, it is a question that there is no obvious or easy answer to; but it seems to me that we have to ask it rather than continue intervening willy-nilly and hoping that will solve the problem I'm not against the intervention--it just seems to me that we have to think the thing through a little more carefully than to just say ""Well, let's intervene and see what happens""   I think that's a good point I guess mine goes even beyond that It may mean that there isn't much that we can do if there is a fundamental misalignment here Or if we're going to do something, it may take this more forceful intervention coupled with a noticeable change in monetary policy I'm getting ahead of the discussion but I think that--   It does in this sense, Manley--I think this continuum idea is useful   If you think of reserves and the money supply as being a ""10"" [on a continuum], and you think of the federal funds rate as being a ""1"", say, the more problems you have with the monetary aggregates through reserve targeting, the more you want to move toward the federal funds rate And the borrowing is a point along that continuum between total reserves and the federal funds rate It's not that borrowing per se is important; it's the degree of compromise you make between the federal funds rate and the reserves procedure And the borrowings thing is skewed in the direction of the federal funds rate   Well, I think just about everything has been said in this conversation It's a question of emphasizing points The first point is that we can debate this theoretically, conceptually, now and forever, and it's very frustrating because it involves compromise We are trying to take two different approaches and compromise them and that's not very satisfying It seems to me the choice, then, comes down to what works My own preference would be to get back to where we were before October 19th, which is what I think we have been doing I don't think we're quite back there, but we're almost there  I have a couple of reasons for that preference One is that it does seem to have worked reasonably well But the point was made earlier that no matter what procedure we have, it's always easy to ease; that's not a problem We've never had any trouble there The real day comes when we need to tighten I'm sure everybody around this table now is much stronger and much more forthright, has more courage and guts than anybody else in the history of the Fed, but I think there are some lessons from history And the experience has shown that the more you focus on the federal funds rate, the more difficult it is at the time when you need to tighten, to do it So, I think we need to keep a bit of fuzziness there I would, on very practical grounds, stay about where we are  On the other issues I agree with the point that the Chairman needs some discretion I have not in any way been upset by the way that discretion has been used Maybe I would have used it a little differently, but I think on the whole it has been done rather well And I don't think we ought to hem the Chairman in with numerical kinds of constraints There is a way, however, that perhaps communication can be sometimes improved I don't mean to suggest that this needs to be done every time the Chairman uses discretion, but we can have telephone conferences These conferences do not have to be official meetings; they do not have to be decision-making meetings They can simply be held to exchange views--a kind of meeting that really never gets on the record if there aren't any decisions made So, it might be possible, in the right kinds of situations, simply to have these telephone hookups   If no decisions are made   Yes, I think over the longer run Norm Bernard is right; we had more that weren't recorded than were If decisions are made, votes are taken, obviously it has to be recorded If not, there's some discretion I agree as well that we don't need any more FOMC meetings, as delightful as these gatherings are "
174,1988-03-29," My District continues to be characterized by high levels of activity The most common comment that one hears is that labor markets are very tight it's hard to attract unskilled workers; turnover rates tend to be rising; local help-wanted indices are high compared to the nation When you talk to manufacturers, and some retailers, and even bankers, there is a dichotomy between what they say and what seems to be going on underneath If you sit around a luncheon table and have an informal discussion, you would think that we were heading into a depression and things were terrible, in terms of the general conversation But then when you ask them what they are doing, what their orders are, what their plans are, whether they are hiring people, whether they are expanding, you get a wholly different picture I find this dichotomy in their minds about what's going on to be fascinating  On the national economy, it seems to me we are in a period of evolving risks in November-December, the risks were on the side of not enough growth; the last time we met, I think the risks were about evenly balanced; and at this meeting, I think the risks have shifted more toward the inflation side That's all I have, Mr Chairman "
223,1988-05-17," I think we have to balance the notion of where we have to go, which I think is some tightening, without being disruptive to the markets The best balancing, from my point of view, would be to raise borrowing $100 million now When I say now, I don't mean tomorrow; I would think that we would have to give the Desk some discretion to work it in over the next week or 10 days I would have an asymmetrical directive that would stack the deck some in the direction of tightening, but still wait to see incoming information I guess that puts me at kind of ""B"", ""C+"", with an asymmetric directive   Mr Chairman, I guess it all depends on how one listens to things, but I had the sense that there was a majority of people who wanted some tightening, say, in the next couple of weeks And it would seem to me one way to do that would be to say in the implementation of policy etc, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions in the immediate weeks ahead  -13-    5/17/88   But it's not immediate; it's spread over the next couple of weeks   Oh   But I think if you counted the people who wanted a tightening immediately, plus those who are willing to have some flexibility over the next week or two, you would have a majority And, therefore, if you are a little vague about whether you do it right away or within the next--   Well, I didn't keep that accurate a score   I see   All right   Oh, it is captured; it just makes it a little stronger It puts it right up front that you intend to tighten within two weeks  -15-    5/17/88   I think most of the useful things that can be said about this really quite excellent paper have been said My bottom line is that I'd like to find a rule that would keep us on track in terms of good policy I don't know what that rule is I don't think the base is it, largely for the same reasons that I think M1 is not it That doesn't mean we shouldn't keep working at it But I don't have enough confidence in this to give up much discretion at all in terms of policy So, whatever we would like, I think it simply isn't a reality; so I think we have to continue much as we have been "
249,1988-08-16," The District economy continues to operate at very high levels, with increasingly tight labor markets The only part of the District where I'm hearing complaints about the pressures on wages is from the Jersey shore; and that's largely, I think, from the Second District's garbage floating down there   As I say, there's nothing new As far as the nation--I think it has been said a variety of ways--but the bottom line is that we are in a territory of accelerating inflation and we have to resist that growth The only questions are timing and magnitude As far as the components of risk, I agree that the risks are on the upside on capital spending But we may get more restraint on consumption this time around than we have in the past, largely I think because of the increase in variable interest rates on consumer- type loans, both home equity loans and also variable-rate mortgages If people have to spend an extra $50 or $100 a month on mortgage payments, that gets right into consumption fairly quickly I think the shorter lags on consumption really are what we want because, as you look at the profile of the expansion, we are getting personal consumption growing 2-1/2 percent and what we really would like to do is get it down in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range to be able to bring about the shift toward the external sectors So I think that we really do need to watch this consumption We may find that we'll get quicker restraint from monetary policy tightening than we have in the past "
250,1988-08-16," Caught me drinking   On the issue of whether we have this hybrid, or borrowings or a federal funds target, there is no right answer here And at different times one will be better than the other But there are some lessons I think to be learned by both the successes and the mistakes of the past You laid it out, Don, as kind of three choices a federal funds, borrowing, or hybrid But really the choices are over a much broader kind of a continuum If you think, for example, at one end of that continuum you have a pure reserve targeting and at the other you have a pure federal funds targeting, and you think of reserves as a 10 and federal funds as a 1, this borrowing approach that we have been using the last few years is probably a 3 It's pretty close to federal funds rate targeting It is a compromise toward taking account of the federal funds rate If we compromise it further along the lines that we've been doing, we really move very, very close to a federal funds rate target And there are advantages, and there are disadvantages  But I think that if we look back over our history, if you have an approach that--as we had with the borrowing figure--has a wiggle factor, it does allow the market to tell you something It does allow the market to tell you that there is a greater demand for reserves It also avoids the trap of pegging a federal funds rate Now, I know that there is no one around this table who would ever, ever get caught up in the problems of pegging the federal funds rate However, that risk is there for lesser mortals and I think one has to keep that in mind The other thing is that it's easy around this table to ease There's no trouble for a central bank to ease; that's very easy The hard part is what we've been doing the last few months, to tighten We need all the help that we can get when we find ourselves in that situation And I think that the give that the borrowing approach allows in that procedure has been very helpful in the snugging up that we've been doing since March And I think the more we move over to a federal funds rate, the more difficult it would be to follow that kind of snugging up It's true that the market has led us sometimes; sometimes it was good, sometimes bad We ought to be making decisions, not the markets Nonetheless, when you get to the practical side of it, I think this technique was helpful for us to get out in front of the inflation curve earlier than I ever recall doing it And I think this procedure helped  The other thing is--and I think this is an issue that one can talk about--that this procedure does give the Chairman a little more leeway than a federal funds target And I think that, when we meet every six to eight weeks, it is important for the Chairman to have some leeway in this Maybe everybody around the table will not agree every time he uses that discretion But the way the markets operate, the way they're fast changing, and timing issues and all that, I for one think that it's important for the Chairman to have a little leeway So that's where I come out Even though there are disadvantages to reserve targeting or borrowing or whatever, I would  -33-    8/16/88  not like us to move any more in the direction of the federal funds extreme I would prefer to be pretty close to the borrowing rather than this hybrid that we've backed into the last six weeks   I think, Manley, he could I think he could in theory I think in practice that this borrowing procedure gives him a little more flexibility and gives us a little more ability to move sooner than we might otherwise I can't prove that's the case   Right That's my point   If the Chairman calls up and says I've upped the borrowing $50 or $100 million that's one thing If he calls up and he says I've upped the federal funds rate a quarter percentage point, there's a difference   Right   I think if you're completely logical, Manley, you come out where you do I just don't think human beings and human nature are completely logical   [I favor] alternative ""B"" with an asymmetrical directive I would keep the ordering on the language the same  -42-    8/16/88  However, I think a legitimate point has been raised about M2 and I think we probably ought to take a look at it at the next meeting to see if the case for it has improved If it has, then I think at that point it would make more sense to put it higher up on the list But I think it would be premature at this point   Promote it to three "
299,1988-09-20," Mike, you've made I think a rather persuasive case both in your written comments and your oral comments this morning that we will need some additional restraint to hold aggregate demand to the level that's more consistent with reducing inflationary pressures I wonder if I could get you to put yourself on the other side of that question I wonder if you could help a slow mind this morning and articulate the case that maybe we won't need the kind of restraint that you're talking about to get the job done In other words, I wonder if you could admit to where the cracks might be in your argument and the things that might happen that would say that while we might need a touch more restraint, maybe we've done much of the job that we need to do   Thank you   The region continues as it has been It's operating at high levels, although there is some moderation; labor markets are very tight; and, wage rates are higher than the nation as a whole  As far as the national economy, I subscribe to the view that the economy is moderating, but that more moderation is needed and additional restraint is probably also needed While the risks are on the side of too much demand, I think we need at this point to keep a very open mind and shouldn't rush to judgment on it for the reasons that were articulated nicely by Mike Prell I'd like to watch the economy closely and be prepared to tighten if necessary But I wouldn't rush into it at the moment, just because I have enough doubts to think that a little patience is in order "
300,1988-09-20, Second the Chairman's suggestion   Call the roll 
354,1988-11-01," I don't think this is a very important issue, so what I'm about to say should be kept in that context I don't think it makes much difference one way or the other I think the reasons that have just been expressed are logical and have some merit But the argument on the other side is that permanent members constitute two-thirds of the FOMC I've always thought of the FOMC as a continuing body The press tends to make an issue, whenever we have this rotation, that the Committee is going to change or is not going    11/1/88  to change, but it seems to me it really has not Our deliberations have tended to be collegial, and there has been something permanent about the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve If you have a change from the Philadelphia District to the Richmond District on the FOMC, that in itself should not lead to expectations that there might be a significant change in policy There is more stability to the Federal Reserve than that, and even though not all of us vote, we do all participate in these decisions While the vote is clearly important and of legal significance, it has always seemed to me that the collegial spirit of the discussion has been more important, and 99999 percent of the meetings that I've ever been a part of [have been of this nature] I think this kind of change tends to emphasize the individual members of the Committee over the Committee as a whole, and the System as a whole, and the collegial spirit While I don't think this is a very big issue, on the whole I would prefer not to make a change   It's true, too!   Looking at me?   Well, I have a higher level of discomfort for the change If it comes down to 18 people around the table who want to do it, I'm not going to stand in the way But if I were going to do it, I would not make it effective at the end of this year I would do it down the road, to get away from the point that Martha makes There is, unfortunately, this business in the press about presidents versus governors--which is a lot of nonsense, but it's there In that context--that's not my main reason--but I think that it is supportive to my concern If I were going to do it, I would make it effective a year from now, or something, just to get away from any immediate concern about policy   The other thing is, if we made it effective this year, we'd have to go back to all of our Boards of Directors and get them to change those resolutions of elections because I think it says in there that the terms run from March 1st to February 28th, or whatever it is It might be better to do it on a pro forma basis rather than go back and change the terms that are already in existence "
355,1988-11-01," Well, I think there is an element of Santa Claus in the outlook, but I don't think that's something that we ought to snicker at Some of it is luck, but some of it is our own doing We did anticipate an economy that was overheating We took a series of gradual steps over a period of months And I think that we ought not to be all that unhappy that it's bringing forth the results that we set out to achieve So, while I think we have to be watchful and maybe a little skeptical, I don't think that just because something is falling our way that we ought to say that it isn't a realistic outlook I'm reasonably pleased with the outlook My own sense is that the risks are still on the side of inflation, but I think that there's nothing in the immediate scene that would require us to take any significant action So I'm prepared to say hello to Santa Claus a little early "
356,1988-11-01, I agree with your recommendation 
480,1989-05-16," Sam, what is the sentiment in Germany and Japan about intervention? Are they cooperative, are they reluctantly cooperative, or are they more than cooperative? What's the feeling?   This is more of a question than a comment I view this as follows If we are going to play this game we need the ammunition and this is just a way of storing the ammunition If we're going to go from $12 billion to $15 billion, is an increase of $3 billion enough? Would it make sense to go to $18 billion or another number? I ask that because I'm not sensitive enough to know what will be read into increasing the limit from $12 to $15 billion So, if we're going to raise the limit might we not just raise it enough to last a while? Or do you think that $3 billion will last a while and that it doesn't make any difference whether we raise it once or twice or whatever?   I can't vote I'm sorry; you hooked up with wrong guy Try next year "
481,1989-05-16," There has been some definite slowing in the Philadelphia District I think the economy there is slower than it is in the nation Until the last few months that slower rate was mostly due to supply constraints--tight labor markets and that sort of thing But in the last several months I think there has been a slowing on the demand side as well Housing is clearly weak; retail sales and manufacturing are flat Capital spending is slower in the second quarter than it was in the first, although it's mixed by industry Housing-related petroleum, gas, and electric utilities are still not going very far on new projects whereas chemicals and pharmaceuticals continue to have some expansion projects The steel industry--at least that part in my District--seems to be feeling a little better than a couple of months ago I think they feel better now that some of the labor negotiations are behind them And they feel that they'll get this voluntary restraint package on steel renewed in Congress, so they released some projects that they were holding On the whole, I think capital spending is definitely slower now than it was three months ago As for the future in the District, I think the outlook is for flat to slow growth with unemployment rates still on the low side  As far as the nation, I think what's happening is about as good as we could hope for We ought to be reasonably pleased with what we're seeing on the growth profile My sense is that the risks between recession and inflation have shifted Until fairly recently, I was thinking that the risks were clearly on the side of more inflation I think the risks are more even than they were The most likely outcome is a period of slow growth with inflation higher than we would like but not accelerating significantly But if we're wrong, I think we have about as much chance of being wrong on the inflation side as on the too-slow-growth side "
482,1989-05-16," I find your suggestion, Mr Chairman, eminently sensible It reflects what's going on in the economy And I think the timing on moving to a symmetrical directive is just right I think our success to date has been that we have stayed ahead of the risk curve When the risks were heavily on the side of inflation we moved in a series of small steps And I think staying ahead of the risk curve at this point does mean taking that small step to symmetry; it's quite consistent with what we've done over the past year   You're really broad minded! "
538,1989-08-22," I would characterize the Middle Atlantic states as being flat to down a touch Retail sales are running about even with a year ago; manufacturing is down some The most serious problems developing are in real estate And there, I think New Jersey has the biggest problems; they are showing up in the loan portfolios of banks I think that we have just begun that cycle--[which will] run for a period in the Middle Atlantic region--where we're going to see increasing real estate loan difficulties On the positive side, in the Delaware banks, which are very large in consumer credit through credit cards, I think the portfolios are better than they were a year ago The banks there have been quite responsive to regulators' cautions and they do look better Despite the slower growth rate in the region and the nation, labor markets remain very tight-- particularly at the lower end Our Bank, for example, has made much greater use of temporary help this summer and we are almost grateful that we've been able to get them That, I think, has as much to do with demand as a shrinking labor force, particularly in the 18-24 year old area And I think that's going to continue well out into the '90s  As far as the national economy, I think we are doing about as well as we could hope to do We are achieving the subpar growth with a reasonable risk of recession It seems to me that that risk, if anything, is a touch less than it was the last time we met The imbalances that normally lead to recession are not there On the inflation side, I think that what we have done is to contain the growth of inflation If you look at the basic rate, I don't think we have rolled it back Maybe that's all we can hope to achieve with this subpar growth strategy Whether we can actually reduce the rate remains to be seen I think our challenge today is to gather up enough strength that we'll leave well enough alone "
539,1989-08-22," Alternative B; I prefer symmetry, but could live with asymmetry "
601,1989-10-03," I'd like to pursue this conversation along a somewhat different line If I were in the market and saw this kind of intervention--and the dollar has come down--one of the reasons I might think it would come down is that if governments are going to spend this kind of money, they must have a second act And the second act might be some understanding as to some basic policy changes So, my first question is In these discussions about intervention, is there some kind of understanding that the intervention will be followed up with more fundamental changes in economic policy, whether on the monetary side or the fiscal side?   I think the market would think so, because most people probably would agree that intervention, except in rare situations, has a rather temporary influence unless it is followed up with something more fundamental   Well, that leads into my next question; I think you touched on it Is the United States leading the charge on this or is it more a consortium of finance ministers who are leading the charge and central bankers are acting as their agents? Or is there a lot of enthusiasm on the part of central banks? I'm just trying to understand   In your judgment, what will it take to get a message to our Treasury and the Japanese that-- I guess what I'm saying is How long is it going to take for them to tire of this?   I think we have talked about most of the issues Clearly, you are in an awkward position Just as one person around the table, I think the worst thing this Committee could do is to leave you hanging, given the awkwardness of where you are Despite where we are on the fundamental policy issues and the difference with the Treasury, my question is Given the situation that we are in, how can we be the most helpful to you as a Committee in this very awkward predicament that you find yourself in?   It probably will be in The Wall Street Journal next Monday, given the minutes to be released this Friday afternoon   I would think that Manley and Wayne better take a walk   That's what we--  [Laughter]   I'm not asking   Well, if we have to reply to this letter over the next month, and if we're going to have a two-day meeting in December anyway, this idea of price stability isn't going to go stale between now and Christmas   So, I think we ought to let it flow into our natural schedule   I agree   On the other hand, if you think you're going to get this like a free lunch, that's not realistic either  -47-    10/3/89   I'd rather Congress be debating this about monetary policy than a whole lot of others things they could be debating   Right, I agree with that   But I think it's also a good opportunity, even though fiscal policy is in a state of paralysis, to remind people about what good things could happen if it weren't   It probably is   That's probably right   The truth is we don't know We can have our biases but we don't know   And what you have is an array from the most optimistic and least costly all the way over to something that would be fairly costly   Right But, with the exception of Lee here, probably few people would be willing to precipitate a recession to pull it off But, if one occurred, we'd be willing to take advantage of it "
602,1989-10-03," Well, I think the bearishness in New England is contagious; it's moving down the Atlantic coast There clearly has been a shift in sentiment in my District away from one of optimism toward more concern about the economy That is particularly true in the real estate business Residential construction is very soft and, looking out over the next several years, it's likely not to strengthen  -27-    10/3/89  a great deal Just looking at the underlying demographics, I wouldn't be surprised, for example, if a good year for housing starts might be two-thirds of what we have been used to in recent years There is some pessimism in the manufacturing area, partly because of what has been happening to the dollar The retailers are very cautious on inventories inventories aren't going anywhere; they are essentially flat People in capital spending still have fairly good back orders and I think are feeling good Nonresidential construction is quite weak in New Jersey and Delaware Pennsylvania tends to lag those states and we're going through an office building boom which I think will leave us in a glut position I think we clearly are in a slowing position With the national economy perhaps growing 2 to 2-1/2 percent this year, I would guess measured GNP in our District would be about flat The unemployment rate, which has been well under the national average and still is under the national average, is nonetheless rising It's still tight at the entry level and that, too, I think will carry forward given the demographics But it is beginning to loosen up further up the ladder  As far as the national economy goes, I think there is this dichotomy between what I'm seeing in my District and the national economy It seems to me that the Greenbook is about right One point, however, is that the change in the composition of demand, as shown in the Greenbook, does seem to have some implications for risks Essentially, what we have is a move away from exports and a move away from capital spending in that we're counting on consumption and, to some extent, housing I have some doubts about housing picking up and that leaves consumption So it seems to me that we could end up with significantly less growth and perhaps even more growth But my sense here is that the change in the nature of the composition probably leads us to a slightly greater risk on the down side going out into 1990, given the mix of output that we have had over the last year "
603,1989-10-03," Alternative B, and I think asymmetrical is fine I could also live with symmetrical I should say that while this makes good economic sense, I think it is going to be somewhat confusing to observers of this whole process in that we have been intervening to drive down the dollar and, if the Germans raise interest rates, there will be an expectation that this is a coordinated effort And if we don't follow through--I agree we should not follow through, that's not my argument--I think it will raise a number of questions and will sire a number of speculations about where the Fed is in all of this That's more politics and public relations, but it is nonetheless part of the world "
662,1989-11-14," In an overall sense, I think we ought to be generally pleased We're trying to steer the economy through a narrow channel and we're doing that However, I must say that when you are in that narrow channel it looks even narrower than it did before you got there What I'm sensing is that the risks are more on the side that the economy is going to grow too slowly rather than faster And I think the Greenbook numbers are too bullish; I think we will see slower growth over the next six months I'm not running into the same emotion that Bob [Forrestal] is running into But the sentiment clearly runs between one of concern to bearishness Real estate people are very bearish; construction--in the residential area--is down and we're going to run into some bankruptcies there We are headed toward some over capacity in terms of nonresidential construction and I think it's going to take us several years to work through that Manufacturing is softer in the Third District than it is in the nation as a whole The retailers feel reasonably good about Christmas, but I don't think their expectations are all that high So  -15-    11/14/89  I [wouldn't describe] the retail area as much more than flat I make these comments in the overall context that this is what we set out to achieve in terms of steering the economy But nonetheless, I have more concern that we're going to overdo it on the soft side rather than underdo it And that will have some effect on my policy prescription in the next part of this meeting "
663,1989-11-14," I agree with alternative B and the asymmetrical directive It comes down to risks--and I think the risks are on the down side--and how much you're willing to take a chance on the economy going down to get some gains on inflation I think we have to view inflation in this current sensitive context in a longer-term view So, I support where you come out, Mr Chairman   I realize it's getting late "
718,1990-03-27," When is the last time that the Fed did not share in intervention with the Treasury?   I have a question Peter, I thought that your Annual Report on Operations for 1989 had considerable food for    3/27/90  thought, and there were two points in that report that leaped out at me One was your concluding comment, which I suspect you wrote with your own hand, in which you talk about how essentially we have moved back to federal funds targeting, even though we don't call it that, and an almost wistful philosophizing about how there ought to be a way to move away from that I'd appreciate any comments that you might have on that The other point that leaped out at me was the collateralization of currency You made the really rather astounding point that for the first time since 1957 the System portfolio actually was reduced and that our leeway on collateral is really rather thin I think that would be worth talking about But beyond that, I think that is a sensitive political issue Some years ago--I forget whether it was in '82 or '83--there was considerable Congressional interest in the use of foreign exchange as collateral for the US dollar We made some pledges, as I recall I think Chuck Partee and some other people testified on that If you link that issue with what was just talked about a moment ago--in effect, the first split with the Treasury in a long time, and the issue as to who is the senior and who is the junior partner, which was a very sensitive one Congressionally in the '73-'74-'75 period--it just strikes me that we may have a major issue developing These two volatile issues were sensitive separately and I would think that when you put them together it could be a major issue I don't want to step into the topic [on our agenda] later, but it does seem to me that we're opening ourselves up to bringing back some of those issues that we have fought in the past If they come back together, we could have a big fight on our hands   Okay Then I will go back to my first question about the comments [in your Annual Report]   Well, I just can't let this pass First of all, I think you are to be complimented for putting together in one place a review of this complex issue Even if not much change occurs, I think the study is worthwhile and it is a well-done record I've never approached this [issue] from a particularly ideological point of view  -46-    3/27/90  I've always tended to be fairly pragmatic in terms of the politics as well as the economics about whether we ought to [intervene] or not However, I must say that over the past year just the sheer amount of the transactions has struck me as being well beyond what is a reasonable number I feel that we have just sort of slipped into this for good reason or bad reason The number is something like $20 billion It goes well beyond a narrow, or even a moderate, interpretation of disorderly markets; it goes well into trying to manipulate exchange rates And it's difficult to see what we have gotten out of it I personally don't think we can continue for another year with that kind of volume It might be helpful as the Committee looks at this to try to draw a distinction between intervention to counter disorderly markets--as ambiguous as that is-- and intervention aimed at manipulating the level of exchange rates I, for example, would think that intervening to counter disorderly markets is a fairly routine, even technical, kind of thing over which the Desk, the Chairman, and the Foreign Currency Subcommittee ought to have fairly wide discretion But when we get into the issue of whether we're going to intervene to manipulate the level of exchange rates and we commit the magnitude of dollars that we have, it seems to me that that kind of decision ought to be laid on the table as explicitly as when we change domestic policy rather than just come to the point where we ratify transactions So, what I get out of this is that we ought to try to draw this distinction If we're talking about anything that comes close to what we've been through, we ought to have a procedure in the Committee where that policy decision is aired and discussed and we either ought to go on record as favoring it or not favoring it   I'm not prepared to make a decision for all time and in all circumstances that says what is or isn't It seems to me that the case for this narrow definition of intervention to counter disorderly markets is well within the bounds of what a central bank ought to do I think it's fairly routine business [for a central bank] On the broader issue, I think one would have to look at the circumstances in which we were trying to do it It's more than economics involved here When we start to commit billions and billions of dollars, as we have this past year, for the clear purpose of trying to manipulate exchange rates, I think that is a decision that ought to be made consciously Maybe we would do it and maybe we wouldn't I would just have to wait and discuss whether I would be for it or not for it depending on the circumstances And I wouldn't make any [prior] judgment   I think in some circumstances it might make sense for us to do it And those circumstances may go beyond economics I'm just not prepared to close the door on its potential effectiveness for a broad range of reasons We ought to face up to that head on when the time comes   Well, first of all, $20 billion is a lot of money to spend even for a central bank Second, I think that there are some political accountability issues here, one of which we're going to run into on this currency [collateral] business, I would think, some time this year We at least ought to have thought through what we're doing and why we're doing it before we commit to that kind of money   Well, just to comment on your overall proposal I think it's a reasonable proposal, given the realities of the world  -71-    3/27/90  that we live in It may not be as easy for everybody around the table to digest as they would like, but I think it's reasonable and I'm supportive of it   Yes, there's a lot of good to say about it,   Well, I think all of this business with the collateral is really rather fortuitous because we agreed that if there were a confrontation between the Treasury and the Fed that the Treasury would win In fact, we promised the Congress in the '70s that we would be supporting it  -80-    3/27/90   [We] also promised the Congress that before we use foreign exchange as collateral, we'll let them know And at the right moment we'll let them know and it seems to me that we will air the whole issue We've kept our word on both and now we can air it and it's aired in a way that's not confrontational If we get turned down, that's not all bad   My concern about that, Wayne, would be that the Treasury won't do that   They won't do that and, in effect, that gets us to the same point And we don't have to try to get them to do something they're not going to do anyway   It does not require a vote, but it's the most important part   Second   With all due respect, I think we've milked this one for a while I think we have [addressed] those other questions implicitly We talked about what the implications are for domestic policy; you've already agreed to keep us informed about G-7 meetings; and there's the other one-- "
719,1990-03-27," My question has already been answered, or at least commented on   I think our District is moving at odds with the nation, because various sectors are weakening and weakening relative to the nation as a whole Manufacturing is quite weak and taking on some of the characteristics of previous recessionary periods for manufacturing Housing is down and I don't see much happening there Nonresidential construction is still growing but I think that's more of a pipeline effect of finishing the projects that already have been started Out beyond that I think one sees a fair amount of excess capacity Financial services, which have been leading the Mid- Atlantic region for some years, are characterized by layoffs Retail sales are flat Job growth is essentially nil and unemployment is rising; it now is about where the nation is as a whole and I would guess 5 or 6 of our various cities and towns are seeing unemployment rates of around 7 percent or exceeding 7 percent  I think there is some basis to this bank lending phenomenon that we were talking about; it's more than smoke I have talked with just about every major bank in our District in recent weeks and particularly in those that are examined by the Comptroller there is a  -21-    3/27/90  definite scaling back Part of it is that people who are running the banks as well as the lending officers do not have that long a track record Most of their top-level experience is in times of expansion and they're not quite sure how to react [now] The other part is that the Comptroller's examiners really haven't done a very good job of examining banks lately They are coming on like gangbusters I have heard more than once the comment ""They're scaring the heck out of us"" Some of that I think is useful and constructive, but the risk of overreaction is there I ask myself where some of these small and medium-sized businesses are going to go for their money We have had about 40 or so new banks start up and many of them are state banks I suspect that in their eagerness we will see some of those loans shift over there and they probably will not do as good a job in distinguishing between the good and the bad  So, I think the District is out of phase with the nation Inflation has begun to moderate and come down As I look at the nation, clearly the inflation outlook has worsened; it's disappointing We're not getting what we want; there's no question about that When I look at the risk of recession, I would have to say that, yes, the risk is down I think Mike did a nice job of summarizing the various national sectors in the Greenbook But even taking his own analysis, except for personal consumption, one does not see much of a forward thrust You don't see it in housing; you don't see it in [non]residential construction; you don't see it in exports The only area in which you see fairly modest growth is consumption While that is the biggest chunk of the economy by far, I would like to see a little more support than that one sector for me to say that we're out of the woods as far as the economy moving ahead So, I think we find ourselves in a bad box The inflation situation is worsening; and while I for one think the odds of a recession are down, I'm not willing to say we're out of the woods I think we need some caution in making that assumption as far as policy goes "
720,1990-03-27," To move now on policy would be premature on domestic grounds and counterproductive on international grounds, I think So I prefer a continuation of current policy On the issue of symmetrical or asymmetrical, I prefer symmetrical It turns on the question of what kind of burden of proof we want in order to make a policy change I think a policy change over the next several weeks would be a major move, and there ought to be some burden of proof to make such a move; and that leads me in the direction of symmetrical "
781,1990-05-15, The change in sentiment in the market was an extraordinary swing in mood Yet I found that in the previous couple of months or so the national statistics that we were getting didn't seem to coincide with what I was hearing from the business community The current numbers seem to me to be more consistent with what I hear from the business community My question is Is the marketplace so dependent on these published statistics or is it also relying some on the kinds of ad hoc information that it gets from the business community generally? What a difference one number made! It just struck me as extraordinary 
782,1990-05-15," I have a couple of questions On page 4 in the Greenbook, you have laid out the monetary policy assumptions about bringing inflation down over the next couple of years We have an environment in which there is not very much support--certainly no national support--for this kind of firming in monetary policy, as best I can tell But even besides that, going all the way out to the end of 1991 we have a 6-1/4 percent unemployment rate and then that slack continues into 1992 You don't indicate what the unemployment rate is in 1992 I presume it goes up another half point or three-quarters of a point?   But even after we have done all of that [firming], we have not done much more than keep inflation from accelerating, at least in terms of the numbers that you have There is some deceleration, but inflation is still largely in the 4 to 5 percent area that we have been talking about Now, presumably, if you carry this [forecast] out to '93, '94, and '95, you begin to get some results But to me that calls into question the whole logic behind this approach that we can gradually squeeze inflation out, as desirable as that goal is Somehow this paragraph brought home (1) the difficulty of it, and (2) how unreasonable it may be even to think that we can pursue something like this in the kind of world that we live in I don't know if that's a question or a comment, but I guess I'd like you to disagree with me    5/15/90  My second question has to do with this credit crunch phenomenon We've all looked into it; we've put together these anecdotal reports, and every report suggests that there's less of a credit crunch than is talked about popularly in the general press I'm just wondering if you have any insights as to why we have this dichotomy between what is said loosely and what we find when we try to zero in on the extent of it It doesn't seem to be the same problem that is often reported   In the District, commercial real estate varies a good bit, but on the whole I think it's a major drag on the economy in some areas I think the risks in the District are on the down side In retail sales we're seeing some small increases, and capital goods continue to be a positive Manufacturing generally is still slumping, but there's some sense that that slump may be bottoming out Overall, I'd say we have modest growth  On the national economy, I come out about where Tom Melzer just did I think our ""steady-as-you-go"" policy has served us well We've resisted being jerked around My own sense is that the risks to the economy continue to be about even There is a risk that inflation may accelerate, but I think there is a risk that the economy may not be as strong as it is currently I sense that the business community still feels that we will avoid a recession, but I must say that I think it would not take a lot of monetary tightening to change that My sense is that we ought to push the ""steady-as-you-go"" policy another couple of months "
783,1990-05-15," I favor ""B"" symmetrical I think the risks are about even I'm not willing to concede at this point that the next move is up It may very well be, but I think we're in an uncertain enough situation that I'd like to stay symmetrical and make a judgment as the information comes in and as we learn more about the kind of situation that we're in "
830,1990-08-21," Let me compliment you on your report I think you and Ted did an excellent job on what is a difficult situation to get a hold of Our whole approach has been one of gradually opening up some excess capacity and hoping that that will dampen prices To date, at best we've kept prices from accelerating But if we disaggregate prices, we find more progress in the goods sector than we do in the services sector; and the goods side of the economy is more responsive to monetary policy That raises a very fundamental question as to how much excess capacity one really has to open up in the economy to generate the kind of anti-inflation progress [we hope for] on the services side I'm wondering, now that we are, say, a year and a half or so into this strategy, if the staff has given any thought to whether the whole thing is just more complicated than this fairly simple notion of opening up some aggregate excess capacity-- that it may not be all that simple and that the fundamental strategy may have some flaws to it   Well, there's a fair amount of history in this country and other countries [suggesting] that a recession will bring noticeable relief on inflation But there is not a lot of evidence that suggests that this gradual approach of opening up slack but not having a recession will result in very much   Right   Well, since we met in July there has been some further softening in an already soft Philadelphia District economy The sluggishness is widespread, including manufacturing, retailing, construction, and capital goods Some areas of the District that have experienced labor shortages for the last several years now report the number of job applications rising And in banking, I sense that our loan problems, which heretofore have been concentrated largely in New Jersey, are now floating across the Delaware, much as George Washington did some years ago And I think we're going to see some of those loan problems in Pennsylvania as well The chemical and plastic firms are the two that I have talked to most, and both of those industries already report substantial cost increases from the Middle East problems I also noted that attitudes have turned very, very cautious For the first time in a number of years I'm hearing more talk about recession in the outlook and, although I think that is still a minority view, it's a growing minority view  On the national outlook, my sense is that we probably will see some negative real GNP by the fourth quarter Before the Middle East shock, we had increasing downside risks stemming from weakening demand in most sectors and tighter credit conditions And with the Middle East problems, I think we'll have still worse downside risks My hunch is that the Greenbook is underestimating the negative impact on consumption I think that consumer confidence has been on thin ice  -19-    8/21/90  for a while and with the cumulative impact of economic concerns that were building, and as this Middle East situation drags on, I think we will see more of a negative impact there And that's going to affect business confidence as well I think the key issues for us are How much slack is enough and how much downside risk are we willing to tolerate to provide a reasonable prospect of keeping the impending bulge in oil-related prices from working its way into the core rate of inflation? And that's the next part of the meeting   Good idea  [Coffee break] "
831,1990-08-21," I think we shouldn't do it today   I think we have to have some confidence in our Chairman to use his discretion, particularly in periods like we're in now   Well, doing nothing so as to do no harm is one side of the coin The other side of that coin is paralysis I think it might freeze us into avoiding opportunities to make some positive contribution And I think we need to be aware of that paralysis risk as we go through the next several months I agree that at this point we cannot change policy, if for no other reason than what's going on in the financial markets, both the bond and foreign exchange markets But I feel that the real economy is going to need some help; it's going to need some help from us in the coming weeks and months and I think we ought not to shy away from providing that help So, I prefer an asymmetrical directive in the direction of ease but I think I would be more active with that asymmetrical directive than I sense you would be I would look for opportunities to ease in the intermeeting period when financial markets would be more favorably disposed to accept such an action I view this as a tactical maneuver rather than an abandonment of our basic strategy of restraint to bring down inflation My expectation is that whatever easing moves we make in the coming months will likely have to be reversed once the economy begins to strengthen  We hark back to the lessons that we learned in the 1970s, but I think we learned lessons on both sides In the first episode in 1974 we underestimated the amount of weakness in the economy that was in the background when we had that first oil shock, and we ended up with a very, very deep recession On the other hand, in the later one in 1979, we wanted to avoid the first mistake so we tended to err on the side of ease and we ended up with one big inflation that led to recession So, there are lessons on both sides And while I agree with you that this is not the time to move, let's not get an inferiority complex in this big world and get paralyzed into doing nothing when opportunity knocks at the door "
885,1990-10-02," Sam, could you elaborate some on your comments about the dollar being less of a safe haven, which certainly has been true in this latest Middle East crisis? Do you see that as something that has been evolving over time and the Middle East situation brought it to a head? Or do you see it as something that is more transitory? What are your thoughts on it?   I'm not sure, Martha, that it makes the case to release the minutes It makes the case simply to say what the fed funds target is, much the way we say what the discount rate is I think the minutes are so ambiguous that they don't tell you very much    10/2/90  But if we say the target is an 8 percent funds rate, people know what an 8 percent funds rate is just like they know what a 7 percent discount rate is   If there's a case in all of this, that's the case I don't see it on the minutes side   If we say, for example, what the funds rate is, then they will try to figure out what it is we look at when we are about to change the funds rate  SPEAKER(?) Yes   And if we release that, then they'll go back-- it's an impossible situation "
886,1990-10-02," The District economic indicators are generally weak and, as elsewhere, business and consumer confidence is low and I think deteriorating Employment is falling in the District; manufacturing is slumping; construction is off; retail sales fell in August and the first part of September; and bank lending is declining And at the anecdotal level, there is more concern on the part of the ordinary public and the business community about the soundness of banks It's hard to measure, but I think it's there and I think it's growing I'm also hearing anecdotal evidence about the slowing payments of accounts receivables Again, it's hard to measure, but they seem to have slowed a good bit One businessman told me at a meeting that he doesn't even hear ""the check is in the mail"" anymore; people just say that the money isn't coming, which I think is a major change  At the national level, I think the risks are on the down side My hunch is that we're facing a recession that will be more pronounced than contemplated in the Greenbook I think business and consumer confidence are likely to get worse and the stresses and the cracks in the financial system are likely to weigh more substantially on aggregate demand during the coming months than is built into the forecast  We talk about a cumulative downturn and we say we don't see the evidence for a cumulative downturn I think we're probably looking for the kind of evidence that was typical of recessions that we had when the economy was more dominated by manufacturing We tend to look at sales and orders and inventories and that sort of thing We have a different kind of economy and I think the cumulative  -26-    10/2/90  downturn may have a different kind of anatomy this time We had a demand side softening of the economy coming into the summer The economy had slowed a good bit Then on top of that we had the supply shock, which has caused it to slow more Now we have the financial fragilities And it seems to me that that's the cumulative set of forces that will take us into a recession rather than having business people misjudging sales, seeing their inventories build up, and then cutting back on their orders I think we're in a different kind of economy It's important for us to resist inflation in this kind of environment and to reduce inflation over time; but it's also important to buy some insurance against too deep a slump in economic activity where we would then find ourselves in a situation--if the economy starts to get away from us--in which we're forced to ease too rapidly in a very short period of time I think we've bought a lot of credibility in recent years by trying to stay ahead of the economic curve, and I think we should continue that approach to policy even in the face of the uncertainties that we're experiencing at the moment "
887,1990-10-02, You wait until Tuesday! [Laughter]   I support your proposition   Let's hurry up and vote 
946,1990-11-13," In the current market environment, do you sense that the exchange market would react differently to a change in the funds rate versus a change in the discount rate?   It never is   I think this discussion shows that we really don't want to face up to the major issues that confront us, because it strikes me as being clearly a minor issue on our agenda today It's also full of irony because if you look at the operational paragraph, it's the only reference to the federal funds rate yet we essentially peg the federal funds rate and we are [talking about] eliminating that reference I don't think it makes a lot of difference whether we keep it or not I would think that the most accurate sentence to put in would be what John LaWare just suggested because that does explicitly keep in [language regarding the Chairman's] discretion to call for Committee consultation and it does refer to what we've been using all along, and that is a fairly wide range of economic and financial variables But I'm prepared to support practically anything because I don't think it makes a lot of difference   I'd like to make one comment I wonder if there might be some merit in making this effective at some future date, such as the beginning of 1991, so that it takes away from it having any immediate significance   Yes, but here it is November and we're talking about doing it January 1st "
947,1990-11-13," I think almost everybody in the Philadelphia District is dressed up in a bear suit because it's hard to find any optimistic note The manufacturers still talk about downturns, which we have had for months There is a hint that maybe the rate of descent is slowing, but that's not much consolation for them Attitudes among retailers are just terrible; they're very pessimistic In fact, they're so pessimistic and are following such conservative Christmas inventory policies that even if in the Christmas spirit there were a rush to buy, I'm not sure they would have the kind of stocks that could really turn it into a good season for them The real estate market remains very soft and much of this is spilling over into the banking system I think we have some significant problems ahead of us there  On the national scene, I think in some sense what we're seeing is a typical pattern We've been debating around this table and around the country for several months about whether we're going to have a recession or not Now most people are convinced we are having a recession and the debate is about how bad it is going to be The Fed's job--and we've talked about it around this table--is to buy some insurance against a deep and long recession All that is fairly typical; what I think is different, however, is the condition of the financial system, because I think that makes the need to buy some insurance against a deep downturn more important than usual If major cracks develop in the financial system, we're going to end up in a pretty bad economic downturn So, what I see here are some real discontinuities Either we're going to get away with a mild recession and the financial system is going to hold up generally, or we're going to end up with a financial weakness and with a very deep and long recession It's hard to envision a lot in between If it weren't for the constraint of the dollar, I would be favoring today a more    11/13/90  substantial move toward easing than I think we prudently can do, given the dollar's condition But we're dealing here with a situation that I find increasingly scary because the risks of a really deep downturn, given the condition of the financial system, strike me as much larger than I recall [in my years of] sitting around this table   We have some company coming along from the Big Apple "
948,1990-11-13, I support your least-worst policy 
1009,1990-12-18, Will we need to use foreign currency as backing during this period?   Will there be some announcement of this or will it just happen mechanically? 
1010,1990-12-18," I would say that the sentiment is increasingly pessimistic or if it's not pessimistic, the level of concern is rising Retailers are still hoping for a season-saving finish They have a long weekend just before Christmas and there's still some hope; but there has been so much price discounting that even if sales do pick up, their profit margins are going to be poor Manufacturing has been weakening longer in our District than it has in the nation, so it's at a very low level But a number of manufacturers are building into their 1991 plans some pickup for the second half of next year There is extreme pessimism in construction for obvious reasons Bankers are worried to scared, depending on how close they are to retirement   The District's unemployment rate, which had been below the nation's, has caught up with the nation's and I suspect will rise above it And for the first time in a long time we now have areas in the District with unemployment rates of 7, 8, and even 9 percent The state and local fiscal situation is very serious, particularly in Philadelphia, but it is not limited to Philadelphia Now that the state elections are over, I think the state of Pennsylvania will have to face up to a large deficit New Jersey, which has had huge tax increases, still has a deficit And a number of municipalities that probably won't make The Wall Street Journal nonetheless are having very serious problems  On the national economy While the Greenbook forecast of a relatively mild, short-lived recession is plausible, my guess is that it's wrong and that we will have a longer lasting and a more serious recession Even if one is optimistic about how the Middle East situation will come out and about oil prices, I doubt very much whether consumer spending will bounce back with the same amount of  -14-    12/18/90  vigor by spring as envisioned in the Greenbook Consumers just feel chastened after a number of years of some fairly loose spending habits And I think they're going to remain cautious Even if the optimistic assumptions on oil and the Middle East are realized, we still are going to have high and probably rising unemployment The consumer still has these high debt burdens, and delinquencies are rising Also, the worries about bank safety, which are all over the talk shows and in the newspapers, just weigh on people and I think they are going to weigh on people even more So, my guess is that we're going to see a fairly bearish consumer for longer than envisioned in the Greenbook "
1011,1990-12-18," If the discount rate were to go down by 1/2 point but the Committee only wanted the funds rate to go down 25 basis points, how difficult would it be to communicate that to the market, given the fact that we haven't done this much in the past and given the normal churning that goes on at year-end? It might take a while for this to occur and we may find ourselves in a situation of having to-- I guess the miscommunication risk is what I'm driving at   Don, what do you think it would take to get the prime rate to come down?   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I think the Federal Open Market Committee ought to vote for a 1/4 point reduction in the rate today with an asymmetrical directive, and I think you and your colleagues ought to do what you will tomorrow   Get it in writing "
1067,1991-03-26," I think the people who did the paper did a pretty good job We should not be too technical in how we divide this up, and I think if we err, we ought to err on the side of more communication Just in the last few months we've seen [a case], at the last FOMC meeting, where the discount rate came down just before the meeting That clearly is going to rub some people the wrong way, although in the meeting before that the FOMC essentially precluded what the Board needed to do   And the Board had to change the discount rate that day or the day after--I've forgotten how it worked I think we're just going to find ourselves in these kinds of situations, and the way to minimize the unhappiness that shows up from time to time is to err on the side of talking rather than not talking   Of course, those words are more like what we would wish the case to be rather than what it is [Laughter]   If this warehousing arrangement with the Treasury were unwound, how much would that reduce total US balances?   Assuming for the moment that we want to be a major player in the foreign exchange market and have enough ammunition to play those type of wars, what [amount] of reserves do we need to have a credible balance? Setting aside the amount we have now, if you were starting out as a strategist, what amounts do you think we would have to hold to get respect from the market?   You don't have to be precise   $50 billion, $20 billion, $100 billion?   As a practical matter, I think we around this table are going to find that we have to intervene from time to time, and that means we need a war chest And it would be best if we could arrive at some rough amount that we feel comfortable with, intellectually or conceptually But we aren't getting very far in that direction, and perhaps we won't If your brain doesn't lead you somewhere, then you've got to go with your gut feeling My gut tells me that we ought to unwind this warehousing arrangement as best we can I think $48 billion is on the high side and my sense tells me that we ought to look for some opportunities to lower that number I don't know how far we ought to lower it but a lower number would make me feel more comfortable; I doubt if we need $48 billion So, in the absence of some conceptual framework, if Sam is looking for advice, I would say Talk to the Treasury and reduce the warehousing and take advantage of some opportunities to reduce the $48 billion in other ways "
1068,1991-03-26," The District economy is still declining, but there are some straws in the wind that a recovery may be in the making There has been a shift in attitudes toward the positive side  -30-    3/26/91  Even in a state like New Jersey, which has some of the characteristics of New England, I think they are beginning to feel better And I had the same experience with my board as Bob Black did with his I really don't recall such a dramatic shift in attitudes on the part of nine people over a one-month span There are a few signs at banks that loan demand may be picking up Bankers are not as willing as they once were but there is willingness to lend; but these are more at the ""nibble"" level rather than anything very major Home buying has clearly picked up and the real estate people are--euphoric is too strong, but they are feeling very good That has not spilled over into automobiles, although there is more traffic at dealerships Nonetheless, when you look at the hard numbers, sales are still down The retailers, particularly department store people, say that sales haven't picked up except that right after the end of hostilities there was a pickup for a week or so; but they haven't seen it more recently Now, some of the specialty stores report that business has picked up Manufacturers, while they are hopeful about the second half of the year, say their numbers are still bearish; and the people who transport manufactured goods report business is still bad As for the commercial real estate market, I think we're not talking months but several years to get that turned around in the middle Atlantic states So, I would say, with the exception of what is going on in home sales, that the recovery is mostly hope and attitude at this point But that's an important change and is probably a harbinger of things to come  My judgment on the national economy is that the risks are in the process of shifting from a decidedly downward direction toward a more evenly balanced outlook for the economy And I think that we ought to pay attention to that shift as we move into the policy discussion later this morning "
1069,1991-03-26," ""B"" symmetrical   Oh, sorry! I apologize   I yield to President Keehn! "
1122,1991-05-14," In the District, the signals are mixed but on balance I think the overall District economy is still down like that for the nation As in the nation, commercial real estate and retail sales are generally negative There are some indications that manufacturing is beginning to bottom out The only clear area of upturn is in home sales Loan demand is still weak Bankers say that there isn't demand; the business people--or some of them, anyway--say that the bankers won't lend With regard to state and local  -12-    5/14/91  governments, Philadelphia is about to go broke; the states have deficits So, I think that situation is fairly general  I would say the attitudes vary from cautious optimism, with more emphasis on ""cautious"" than ""optimism,"" to a lot of concern on the part of business people about when a recovery will occur and what kind will occur I find more people who are just about writing off 1991 as a bad year and they are beginning to look to 1992 I sense, and I don't think it's particularly unusual at this stage of the business cycle, a dichotomy now between those who analyze the economy and those who manage it I think most of those who analyze the economy see signs that the economy is beginning to pick up, whereas those people who have annual meetings to chair--whether they want to downsize the company another notch or they are going to meet the financial analysts--want to be reassured that there really is a recovery out there; they don't really yet feel it in their bones We're at a fairly critical period in that, if we don't begin to see some tangible evidence on a broader base that we are indeed going to get a recovery, we could see confidence really drop off and we might have a double-dip in terms of the downturn I do subscribe to the notion that the economy is going to pick up, but I think we're playing with some tender attitudes out there I would say that the risks are probably even to maybe marginally on the down side But I [agree with] those who are concerned about the outcome If we don't get a recovery or if it's postponed, I think there will be some real costs and it will be quite difficult to try to get the economy turned around  On the inflation side, my sense is that financial markets may be somewhat behind in appreciating what is going on in most of the economy We're making better progress on inflation than I would have expected a few months ago and that's positive I think the long bond market has some catching up to do there As for the Greenbook forecast, I think it's reasonable I would probably have more of a saucer shape kind of recovery--perhaps a little weaker--but it's hard to quarrel with the basic analysis there "
1168,1991-08-20," What I sense around the table is that most of us are still keeping the faith about a modest recovery, but we have increased doubts about it and see more downside risk I certainly agree with that What one would like to see at this point is more convincing signs of a cumulative upturn--self-feeding kinds of factors in the economy Yet in every one of those critical junctures, I think caution and doubt are diluting their effect What we count on is the inventory kick and yet what we find there is a great deal of caution People are more into a ""just-in-time"" kind of inventory policy We're still getting liquidation; surely, at some point we will get accumulation but it just doesn't seem to have the potential thrust to the economy that one might expect At the next juncture, at the hiring juncture in this linkage, we see the same kind of caution Most of the jobs have been created in the services sector in recent years and we're already beginning to see much more caution and layoffs in that sector The next linkage is the consumer spending area; we see caution there A linkage further out is investment I must say in talking with the business community that I hear more and more talk that '92 is going to be an extension of '91, and there's more caution there So, what bothers me about this emerging recovery is that I just don't sense that these cumulative self-feeding forces are going to have the [usual] impact Add on the financial fragility and perhaps that's part of the explanation So, I share the view that while a modest recovery is still likely, the downside risks have increased significantly in recent weeks Also, whenever you see more downside risk I think you have to ask yourself what the consequences are And while I don't think a double-dip is likely, I think that a very slow recovery or something that approaches a double-dip really could have some major consequences on getting the economy going because basic confidence is in need of healing with these financial fragilities So, I think we're in a situation now where the risks are fairly significant and we have to deal with them   Well, I think what that survey is showing is the same thing that we're seeing in industrial production A lot of that seems to be auto-related and auto supply I find that we get those survey results--and they are very accurate if you look at them over the last 20 years--and yet if you talk to people who run the companies you would get a different story I find it difficult to reconcile that That survey shows more optimism than any other anecdotal information I'm picking up I can understand that early on in a recovery but that survey is in its fifth month now of showing some  -28-    8/20/91  increases, which is consistent with the national industrial production [data] But it doesn't fit the mood that one senses It doesn't translate into hiring, for example, and it's not translating into improved capital spending plans   Well, I haven't gone back and done that detailed a look We have called back a number of these companies to verify the numbers And, you know, it is a diffusion index; it doesn't actually measure the level of output It just is another example of this gap between people who are running firms, and-- I think Jerry may have said it right Things are not as bad as the business community thinks they are, but they're probably not as optimistic as their economists are forecasting things are going to be "
1169,1991-08-20," Well, I think your recommendation makes sense I came to this meeting, before the Russian developments, thinking that we ought to ease now; but there is something to be said for waiting But I wouldn't be overly patient about using the asymmetry I have a slight preference for version II but not a huge one "
1221,1991-10-01," It's all up hill from now on!   One question, Sam What are the real prospects for off-market sales of marks?   Well, I think the understatement in your comments is that this Committee and others in the System have some interest in all of this This is probably not the forum, but I have some strong interests, and perhaps other people do too, not only in the implications for the financial markets--and I think you've given us a hint by talking about swaps just what some of the implications and some of the contingencies are--but also, closer to home, just how vulnerable we are as an institution in all of this Again, this is probably not the place to talk about it, but I think it is important to talk about it in some forum "
1222,1991-10-01," Mike, that was really an excellent opening statement about the economy and where we are I think it really summarized it quite well I have a question about the profile of the recovery The profile in the Greenbook is essentially a real growth rate of about 3 percent, give or take a few tenths in either direction, starting in the third quarter and going out through the forecast period Yet, I think the typical historical pattern has been that in the initial quarters--the first two or three quarters--we tend to get a more rapid growth rate and then it begins to slow I'm wondering in your analysis of past recoveries if you think that there is anything in the sort of jump-start dynamics earlier in a recovery that we have to have a faster growth to get it going and then it tends to slow and whether, if we only get 3 percent in the initial quarter, that's enough jump-start action to keep the recovery going in subsequent quarters   Except for manufacturing, there are few signs of growth in the middle Atlantic states There's continued weakness in the labor markets and joblessness--the number of people who are out of work--is still rising The word from the retailers in the District, and the statistics do back it up, is that retail sales are fairly flat, with not much expectation of a Christmas season that they will feel comfortable about The banks and the financial sector generally are still quite sluggish and the overhang of commercial real estate is still there and will be there for some time On the whole I sense that the District is somewhat weaker than the nation and attitudes are at best cautious  As far as the national economy goes, I hope the Greenbook is right I always feel better when I hear Mike The trouble is that when I get back home, it doesn't last long; it's a quick fix and I need more of it to overcome what I keep running into But I think the risks are on the down side both for growth and for inflation And then I ask myself the question that Dick raised earlier If we miscalculate, nine months or a year from now which miscalculation would we rather have? If this incipient recovery should slip away from us--though I don't happen to think it will--I think it would be very difficult for us to rev it up again I would prefer to try to slow down a faster recovery than to try to speed up one that isn't moving along So, I think the risks are on the down side and the costs of the downside risks are higher than coming out on the up side   Northern Jersey has more excess than south Jersey But Jerry's point is that probably in relative terms there's more excess space in the suburban areas than in the central cities   I sense that rental prices are still coming down but that sale prices in the Philadelphia area are in the process of flattening out   Commercial buildings   The new lease prices are still very weak "
1223,1991-10-01," Well, Bob, you adjusted when you lost Ml   ""B"" asymmetric   I imagine we ought to have little ambiguity! "
1272,1991-11-05," In these kinds of situations where you have something of a trade-off, I think you have to ask yourself a question If I had to defend the actions to the whole world, which side would I rather be on? And I would rather be on the side that said we had a scheduled meeting and we made a decision; there was speculation pro and con but we implemented that decision in the market so that everybody would find out about it at the same time I'd rather say that than that we delayed it for three days or five days or six days because we were afraid a few people would get hurt selling short In the whole context of what our role is as a public institution, we have to go with the side that meets our standards and with which we feel comfortable   As soon as the market opens? "
1273,1991-11-05," Well, this is all getting a bit much, I must say, with all the gloom and pessimism around the table But I think it is quite reflective of what one hears in conversations almost wherever one goes--in business, socially, and otherwise And my District is no exception to that I think the economy has deteriorated over the last couple of months, and certainly sentiment has become sharply more bearish Manufacturing had been a relative bright spot in our area, but it has slowed rather dramatically and I think the sentiment is in the process of changing about 1992 I would guess that as our future surveys come in they will reflect that, judging from the conversations one has Retailers are about as pessimistic looking toward this Christmas season as they have been probably since the '81-'82 recession Our commercial real estate market is typical of what you have heard elsewhere in the country And loan demand is still declining at banks I do sense, however, that price pressures have diminished and I think that is an optimistic part of all this  As far as the national economy is concerned, I think the risks are decidedly on the down side We have an anemic outlook at best and I suspect that if I'm wrong it will be on the down side Clearly, we have something going on here that is more than a normal cyclical downturn; you can have your own list of favorites My sense is that we're going to see a longer period of weakness in the economy, but I think most of us are going to be surprised at how much progress we're making against inflation In this kind of situation where the resiliency of the economy is under stress, I think we're quite vulnerable to some kind of shock I don't know what the shock will be; if we knew, it wouldn't be an unpredictable shock But we're in a situation where some event could really turn this from a bad situation into something more serious  There are not very many good policy options out there, but the way I look at it the only available policy tools are in this room And I think that we simply have to ring the monetary ""gong"" to demonstrate that somebody somewhere is at least trying to do something  -15-    11/5/91  positive to try to arrest this sharply deteriorating sentiment I don't sense any real cost in doing that In the unlikely event that we ease too much, I think we can reverse course We tightened in 1980; we tightened in 1988; we can tighten in 1992 if we have to But now we need a loud and clear easing signal to try to undercut this deteriorating sentiment that we have out there, which is making us quite vulnerable "
1274,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, I just have a technical question before we proceed We do have this even keel [consideration] in [the face of a Treasury] financing but is it an open-and-shut case that this change could not be done tomorrow morning? After all, we have the shortest maturity being auctioned today, which isn't as affected by these fluctuations If we did it tomorrow, both the medium-term and the longer-term bidding would still be ahead of us And I am thinking, given the risks--and while we are an honest organization-- that that's a long time to go I'm just wondering what the pros and cons are   Yes   Okay   I favor this ""A to B"" 4-3/4 percent funds rate with an asymmetric directive for this body, and I think it ought to be accompanied by a discount rate reduction by the other body The logic is that we have a reasonable prospect of doing some good with this package and I think we have very little chance of doing harm And even if we find it is harmful, we can undo it So, in that situation, it seems to me we ought to do it "
1327,1991-12-17, What is the status of the notion that the Treasury would rely less on long-term bonds?   Is this a variation of the Operation Twist idea? 
1328,1991-12-17," In the Philadelphia District, I'd say [activity] is flat to down, with little prospect for an upturn on the horizon Manufacturing, which had been a relative bright spot earlier in the year, has turned down--and rather sharply--in December Some of that is auto-related but it's broader than that Construction, which had seen a modest improvement in housing, is down; there's a lot of gloom in the construction industry, with very little near-term prospect for improvement Retail sales are about even with last year; but the number of people that the retailers are hiring is down, so there's a negative effect on employment I still see a slippage in loan quality at banks It's particularly evident--though it may just be because I've spent more time on it in the last few weeks--in de novo banks, which seem to be running into some additional problems In terms of attitudes, I don't sense that there has been a deterioration in attitudes so much as a ""hunkering down"" kind of sentiment--a view that what we have may last a while  Turning to the nation, the Greenbook forecast is certainly reasonable, but I think the risks are still on the down side, perhaps more so than six weeks ago when we last met It's difficult to find a sector to lead a recovery And having gone through this so-called inventory cycle, I have less confidence in that the second time around than the first I think this hunkering down attitude just reflects less confidence that we will have a recovery There's also a second downside risk and that is that monetary policy will continue to have less of a stimulative effect than one might ordinarily think This could very well turn out to be one of those recessions--and we've had them before--in which we have to push the fed funds rate below the inflation rate in order to get the kind of forward momentum to the economy to bring the Greenbook forecast about In any event, with inflationary pressures subsiding--and they clearly are--I think this double-downside risk provides room for some additional monetary easing, and I would prefer it sooner rather than later "
1329,1991-12-17," I would prefer alternative A I think there still is a positive role that monetary policy can play both in terms of healing some of these structural wounds as well as providing some cyclical uplift And given my reading of the downside risks and the cost of being wrong, I prefer to get on with it "
1384,1992-03-31," Developments in our District are broadly consistent with what is going on in the rest of the country There is noticeable improvement in the residential area, including the construction of new houses The retailers feel better and the sales data are there But when they look at their sales it's year-over- year, and last year sales were very weak So there's concern about how these retail sales will look a couple of months from now The manufacturing area has shown some strength In the nonresidential area, the District really has a long way to go before it digs its way out of the hole; I think that sector is just going to be a drag for some time to come Bankers report essentially flat loan demand outside the residential area, although more of them are reporting that the share of new financing is rising and the share of refinancings is falling I think that's consistent with the data we're getting on the residential side Employment growth is still flat to down, and I think it will be some months before we see any improvement there In terms of attitudes, I think ""optimism"" is too strong a word I would say ""cautiously hopeful"" describes business sentiment more [accurately] I think [business executives] see a turn, but they just are not optimistic yet In terms of consumers and rank and file citizens of the District, the mood is certainly not optimistic but more one of frustration than of pessimism How that will play out in consumer sales I'm not sure But there is this dichotomy, I think, between hopefulness in the business sector and a very deep-seated frustration on the part of most other people  As far as the nation goes, I think we do have a modest pickup in the making The issue, as we've talked about around the table, is whether it is sustainable I think the risks are less on the down side now than they were six weeks ago, but on net I still have more concern that this modest recovery will peter out rather than be significantly stronger than the Greenbook forecast But my forecast would be very close to that in the Greenbook I think a modest recovery is the most likely outcome "
1440,1992-05-19," I'd say the District is mixed Manufacturing has been up for several months running but there is some slowing in the pace of advance In retailing, there just isn't much of a trend either up or down; it seems to be fairly stuck Residential [construction] is growing but not robustly  As to your commercial real estate question, I have the sense that the District is either at or approaching the bottom of the hole but that there is not much sign of a pickup The general [view] is that this is a three-to-five year problem to work our way out of before we get vacancy rates at the point that they will stimulate much  -19-    5/19/92  construction The bankers, I think, feel that the worst surprises are on the table; but the most optimistic feeling is that we may be at about the bottom  The bankers see some evidence of a pickup in loan demand, although not much in the hard numbers; it's more at the inquiry stage Attitudes, in contrast to this mixed view of the real sector, are more upbeat than the hard numbers would support underneath There just is a sense that things are going to move, and that's an improvement over a couple of months ago But I suspect that this sentiment is not firmly based and that one or two months of poor sales or shrinking orders would change the attitudes Nonetheless, I think the attitudes are better  For the national economy, I think we do have a moderate recovery; if anything, it's faster than expected And it's hard not to feel better about the sustainability issue and feel that we have a sustainable recovery The money supply issue strikes me as one of those things we can argue about day-in and day-out We have some good reasons not to worry about it, but it is a shadow that hangs over us I think the only way to settle it is not to worry about it as long as it's an outlier and the economy picks up But if we start to see some weakening in the real sector, then it's going to mean something It's almost an agnostic approach in terms of how we should deal with it  On the inflation side, my sense is, much as Si just expressed, that it's awfully hard to see upward pressures in prices The other side of that is that, particularly in large cities, the unemployment problem looks as if it's just stuck There is an attitude both from the business side as well as those people seeking jobs that there just isn't going to be much improvement How all that will play its way out through the warm summer months in these cities is something that one has to be uneasy about "
1441,1992-05-19," I think your proposition is reasonable and I support it I must say that it's hard for me to imagine a set of circumstances that would be convincing to tighten policy in the next five or six weeks, given where the economy has been and where it is likely to go and all the uncertainties about the money supply Maybe [that view] reflects the fact that Philadelphia is in the northeast part of the country "
1493,1992-08-18," I think ""economic anemia"" is how I would diagnose the Third District economy Retailing is listless; manufacturing growth seems to be slowing; bank lending is soft There is some activity in residential housing at the low end but not a lot in other areas Commercial real estate has several more years of adjustment ahead The District economy has settled into a slow-growth rut and the attitudes reflect that People seem to think things will improve at some point, but the economy is just in that slow-growth pattern  At the national level, it's very hard to find a sector that is going to act as an engine for a faster recovery It's certainly not in exports; it's not in investment; it's not in consumption; it's not in government I think we're just in a long, slow, corrective phase to the credit excesses and overbuilding of previous years Clearly, as all forecasters are aware, this corrective phase will give way to faster growth at some point, but I think we need a lot of humility in forecasting just when that is going to be My own gut feeling is that this corrective phase is going to last even longer than the Greenbook expects and that inflation correspondingly will be less than the Greenbook expects I think the role of monetary policy in this environment is quite limited; we can stretch out the corrective phase, but we can't eliminate the need for it If we get even slower growth than we have now or if growth appears to be heading negative, I think we would have little choice but to respond But our options are really not all that plentiful at the moment  -15-    8/18/92 "

1546,1992-10-06," You ended on a note about staying alert to early signs of a run on the dollar But there really isn't much one can do in terms of contingency plans Essentially, we have interest rates to deal with that and we have foreign exchange operations to deal with that, and foreign exchange operations have shown that they're not effective in [countering] these kinds of massive movements in capital flows Domestic concerns would make an interest rate movement not a good course That exhausts my list What else is on that list that one can do if this kind of situation should materialize? "
1547,1992-10-06," Mike, would you elaborate some on your comment about going from 3 percent to zero--and presumably we could [even] have a negative real [federal funds rate] It's an article of faith for anybody who has taken one or certainly two economics classes that lower interest rates are going to be a positive [for] growth, and I'm not quarreling with that orthodoxy But when one goes out and talks with people in the business community and consumers, one almost invariably runs into the view that lower rates are not the [solution] If I probe that, an answer I frequently get is ""If I thought interest rates were going to stay down, then lower rates would help But if you lower interest rates now, I know you'll have to raise them a few months or a year down the road Just knowing that rates are going to be down for a short period doesn't help me because I'm going to have to finance whatever I'm going to buy with this [loan] for 5 or 8 or 10 years"" I find increasingly that the view in the business community is at odds with what most of us have accepted as a good [economic] relationship I wonder if you could help me through some of that "
1548,1992-10-06," Thanks   It also isn't true There are numerous examples of this Committee tightening within a month of an election, not just easing   Conditions in the Philadelphia District are mixed, but on the whole I think they've deteriorated some in recent weeks The major source of that deterioration has been in manufacturing Manufacturing was a source of some uplift to the District economy in the first part of the year, but in the last couple of months manufacturing activity has slowed and I think it has now become negative Despite continuing employment declines, which have been sharper than for the nation as a whole, particularly in New Jersey, retail sales have held up fairly well They are not great but they are probably running a little over a year ago In the construction area, I have nothing to add; nonresidential construction continues to decline and [sentiment] is very sour There is some improvement in residential construction  One of the additional changes, besides what is happening in manufacturing, is that while I would have summarized the condition of our banks until fairly recently as marginally bottoming out with some hints of improvement, I wouldn't be comfortable saying that now I think more of our banks are deteriorating than improving If we probe the bankers on that, we hear a number of reasons For one, they say that a number of small and medium-size businesses that had held on through this period of slow growth are running out of string and are just dying That is showing up in loan delinquencies and loan defaults Some of the banks are able to cover [the resulting losses] because of their spreads; and they've lowered their other costs But the deterioration is clearly showing up, and I think we're in for a period of some additional deterioration  -25-    10/6/92  Attitudes, I think, are worse than the underlying conditions The Mason-Dixon line makes a big difference! Our September meeting was about as pessimistic in terms of director attitudes as I have seen, reflecting this cumulation of slowness and not much prospect of getting better As with other Districts, inflation outside the health care industry and the regulated industries is largely a non-issue It is just hard to make price increases stick  As far as the national economy goes, its growth is basically stagnating I think we have about as much chance of getting some modest declines in growth as we have of modest increases There just are no sustainable drivers The employment-income-consumption dynamic is missing and it's very hard to see where we're going to get the thrust Despite that, I have found this current period more difficult in thinking through monetary policy I believe any of us sitting around the table, if we're at all objective, could come up with some good reasons to ease and some good reasons to stay where we are I come down on the side that some good would come from some additional easing So, I'm in the camp that thinks we ought to ease monetary policy--not that I think it will do great things but because I think at the margin it will be positive Also, it's important that the Fed as an institution be viewed as doing whatever we reasonably can to help the economy get out of the swamp Some additional easing in monetary policy would fall into the column of something we can do that is reasonable and I don't see a lot of downside risks in that   I think we all feel the ambivalence that you talked about; there clearly is uncertainty I find it difficult to believe that any of the new data that are going to come out in the next couple of weeks will make this any clearer Jerking the markets around--first they think we will ease and then they think we won't and then we try to come back and do it again--may have a cuteness to it or too much cuteness to it, but I think that undermines our credibility There are times when you step up to the batter's box and you try to get on base We've had a good discussion but I think this discussion is probably ahead of the data I would prefer to make the decision and do it--and not try to second guess this event or that event or this statistic or that statistic--by sticking to the fundamentals And I think the fundamentals call for lower rates "
1591,1992-11-17," I think the distinction between the deliberative process and the timeliness is a useful distinction What we need to preserve is the deliberative process If we go to detailed minutes or videotapes or that sort of thing, we will basically destroy or greatly undermine the process that we have Timeliness, however, is an area on which I think we are on the weakest ground And there is a carryover affecting this issue of accountability For example, how many times has the Board of Governors been asked for detailed minutes of discount rate decisions? How many times have you had a request for a videotape of discount rate deliberations? That [doesn't happen] because you basically have a free discussion and you issue a statement and that's the end of it Those statements don't talk about the future; they simply talk about what decision has been made My sense is that if we could somehow speed up the process of releasing the information, we would convey a greater sense of openness and accountability; and doing so would enable us to make a stronger case for protecting the deliberative side of it Where I come out, bottom line, is that we really ought to fight and resist anything that cuts away or undermines the deliberative process But I for one am willing to talk about how we might improve the timeliness because I'd rather do that ourselves than have it forced upon us and in the process compromise the deliberative process   Suppose the Committee decided--it would be a rare, shocking event--to move the funds rate at a meeting Would we announce it that day or when would that be announced?   You go into the market at something like 1130 am, don't you?   So, it would work something like this When you go into the market, essentially simultaneously there would be an announcement made by the Fed that the Desk has now eased or tightened reserve conditions and we expect the federal funds rate to trade at a certain level That's the proposal?   I just wanted to make the point that I don't see this as an issue between federal funds rate targeting or aggregate targeting It seems to me we could have more timely release of both; I don't see that it's a tradeoff or that it in any way compromises the future decision that we might want to go to some aggregate [target]   Implicit in your comment is that we're going to have one Committee reply to Mr Gonzalez? "
1592,1992-11-17," Economic activity in the mid-Atlantic states continues to be slow and uneven There is modest growth in retail sales and, while retailers are not overly optimistic, there is some hopeful sentiment about the holiday season Manufacturing appears to have picked up some during the past month after a couple months of downturn There is some growth in residential construction The nonresidential side is weak Loan data, when you cut through them, show some hint of better loan demand but the hard numbers grossly overstate the improvement Looking at our District loan growth, it shows an increase in C&I loans That's really because one bank in Delaware decided to book some loans in the District rather than someplace else If we factor that out, we really see a continuation of declining loan demand However, anecdotally one does get the feeling that loan officers feel a little better The real weakness is in the labor market For example, we've just done a survey of our manufacturers and, while it shows a pickup in activity, it continues to indicate that manufacturers are cutting their payrolls That seems to be true even in areas where we're seeing some improvement [in activity]  On the national side, I sense a better tone from the same data that other people read The issue is one of sustainability Is it for real or is it another false start? Basically, we don't know I think it's one of those times when we have to watch the data and keep an ear to the ground anecdotally "
1593,1992-11-17," I mostly agree with where Governor Angell comes out on both these issues Looking back, there was a good case for easing [last] time but I think that time has passed for now To ease into a better tone of statistics would be counterproductive I think  -35-    11/17/92  the risks are more symmetrical than they have been for several months So, my preference for the short run is ""B"" symmetrical  On the long-term ranges, Wayne's logic was especially persuasive First of all, I really don't think we have a choice; we need to cut the range And we ought to be very careful to underscore the fact that this is a technical cut So, if we are going to do it, I would do a whole point rather than a half point It would give us some additional margin for error It's difficult enough to do and it's not going to cost much more to reduce it a whole point rather than a half point But I think it is important to emphasize the technical part  As to now versus February, I can't believe that a February climate would be better If you just want to look at it from a political point of view, we will have a new Administration with a new [fiscal] proposal, a new Congress, and lots of energy I think in that context it would be more difficult to do We've done a study, we have some good reasons, and we can explain our action in a letter In the letter I would emphasize the technical aspects; I would say we believe that this is a technical adjustment and that the 1-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range is consistent with growth without giving up on the inflation [goals] There is no foolproof way to do this; there are risks in doing it But I suspect that the political fallout would be less if we did it now rather than wait "
1656,1992-12-22," Great confidence building!    12/22/92   That really clarifies it!   The District is generally better both in tone and activity but still is lagging the nation There's something about that Mason-Dixon line which seems to make things go faster below it and more slowly above it!   Right The shift in tone is more pronounced than in activity I agree with someone else's remark at the table that people are more optimistic relative to activity than they were before when in my view they were too pessimistic given the level of activity In terms of the sectors, manufacturing is up and retail sales are up--I don't think as much as in the Atlanta District, but our retailers are generally happy about the Christmas season We hear more comments about improvement in residential activity And bankers keep talking about improvement in loan demand--if not in loans booked at least those in the pipeline But having said that, there still are some clear areas of weakness Job growth is generally quite soft in the District The reports from heavy industry, notably steel, are quite weak I haven't really done this in any scientific way, but it seems to me that if we have a group of small and medium-sized business people and a group of big business people, the big business people don't share the same kind of better feelings that the smaller business people have The commercial real estate market is still quite flat I had a group of people from that industry in and I suggested it might take three years, perhaps five years, to get the District turned around, and I was told that that was considerably too optimistic They were talking well out into the decade  On the national scene, I think the key issue--and it has been underscored already--is whether we now have a self-feeding moderate recovery going I feel better that we do have one going at this point I would put the risks at about even on the up side and the down side The key continues to be employment growth If we get some moderate employment growth in the months ahead, then I think [the recovery] will be self-feeding If we do not--and I think that is potentially the weakest link--then we could still have some difficulty Also, the downward pressures on inflation rates continue It is difficult to make price increases stick The layoffs that are reported in the newspapers help keep wage increases down And I  -13-    12/22/92  suspect we may do better on the inflation front than the Greenbook suggests "

1708,1993-03-23," Modest growth in the District continues While there is a lot of caution and we still lag the nation, there are signs of a somewhat better underlying tone Commercial and industrial loan demand is rising modestly, and I'm hearing more reports from bankers that small and mid-size businesses are using their credit lines more  -12-    3/23/93  than in recent months They tend to want to go ahead and get the projects under way whereas several months ago that was not the case Manufacturing, which had slowed earlier in the [quarter], may have picked up some later, judging from rail shipments and other anecdotal information Some executives in sheet steel think they should be able to make more price hikes stick given the strength in their order books And that's the first indication of that sort of thing I've heard in a long time Hiring is still sluggish, particularly in New Jersey, but one does hear more reports of firms adding workers They're adding them even if they're adding them cautiously In real estate, residential sales were up before the snow storm, as was the demand for industrial space The office market continues to be quite weak and likely will be for a long time I hear very little talk these days that the expansion will grind to a halt; and that's a different tone than was there several months ago But there still is a lot of caution about just how fast the expansion will proceed  Turning to the nation, the national profile as laid out in the Greenbook looks about right to me I continue to think that job growth is the key indicator as far as the durability of the expansion goes Job growth I think is both an indicator of business confidence and it's a necessary ingredient in building consumer confidence So while in theory we can have an expansion without job growth, I think in reality it's a critical ingredient The recent price numbers strike me more as an aberration than as signalling a new round of inflationary pressures I think the lack of robustness in the US economy plus really quite favorable unit labor costs and weaknesses in a number of other industrial countries argue for a continuation of subdued rather than increasing inflationary pressures "
1709,1993-03-23," I think we have moderate, not robust, growth We still have structural drags on the economy in the financial system; we have slack in labor markets and subdued labor costs; and we're facing a restrictive fiscal policy While we need to be vigilant on inflation and avoid the mistakes of the past, we also need to look at the fundamentals when statistics are mixed And I think the fundamentals still point toward an outlook of moderate growth and slowly declining unemployment and a still fairly persuasive case that inflationary pressures are likely to be held in check When I add all these up, I come out with a constant monetary policy at this point, and I have a strong preference for keeping an even hand regarding what our next move might be   The alternative is fine with me "
1763,1993-05-18," In the context of what the market views as good news and bad news and how it might move the market, how would the market react to a tightening of Fed policy in the near term? "
1764,1993-05-18," Most of the business people I talk to feel deprived in terms of price increases They feel they are owed price hikes if only they could make them stick If you look at it from an individual business person's point of view, their sales growth for the most part has been slow, competition has been tough, they have cut costs and lowered their break-even point, and they still feel very squeezed So it's not surprising that they would jump at whatever opportunity they can to raise prices, whether it's a streak of good orders or a weaker dollar and foreign competition that isn't quite as tough or an attempt to get ahead of the regulatory or tax changes It's not surprising that that is happening and that that's the way they feel The question is whether it is broadly sustainable or cumulative, and I don't think any of us really knows But my hunch is that it's not, given the generally sluggish economy, the underlying competitive situation, plus what is going on in money and credit  -23-    5/18/93  Looking at the District economy, growth is very modest, very modest indeed Retail sales are going up negligibly Industrial production, while still advancing, seems to be advancing at a decreasing rate We have sluggish loan demand, or flat loan demand really, and slow job growth And, as has been mentioned almost by everybody, there is slipping confidence and building anxiety in national leadership and all the uncertainty about taxes Every day in the paper some other tax that might [be enacted] is mentioned, and that has really pulled the rug out from any kind of increases in spending There is just a strong desire to hold tight and steady and to put on hold everything that one can  My sense on the national economy is that, yes, we are going to get somewhat more inflation than we thought earlier this year And I think we're going to get somewhat less growth But my basic conclusion is that at this point it's more a matter of degree rather than a fundamental shift "
1765,1993-05-18," The purpose of an asymmetric directive is to give the sense of the Committee to move in that direction And if we're going to meet frequently, then the notion of tilting it one way or the other seems to me to lose some of its merit   If it's too important a decision to move without making sure you have the Committee's agreement, then you can decide it then We don't need to bias it   The cost of an asymmetric directive, I think, is not insignificant If, for example, this turns out to be an inflation bubble--if it turns out not to be a problem and goes away--but the real sector because of all the uncertainty about tax policy and so forth turns out to be a good bit weaker than we [anticipate], we're going to look pretty trigger happy So I think there is a cost involved I don't know if it's going to come out that way but we have a very uncertain environment The situation can go either way both on the inflation front and on the real growth front I think we need to watch it very closely and we need to show that we have an open mind as to which direction policy is going to go If circumstances warrant a tighter policy, then let's tighten I think deeds, not words, speak to expectations I just don't see that asymmetry buys us very much There can be a plus to it, but there can be a negative to it And I don't think we need to take the chance We're going to meet frequently "
1815,1993-08-17," The District economy continues to muddle along I could almost ditto my comments of a month or so ago The pattern is essentially the same sluggish manufacturing, soft retail sales, some improvement in residential construction, nonresidential in a deep hole, and slow employment growth This attitude of not adding workers if we don't have to is very strong Wage increases are probably in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range; that is what one hears from most companies in the area  On the national level, I think the moderate growth theme is the right one; 2-1/2 percent is the number if one wants to pinpoint it It's hard to see major risks that would cause a significant break-out on the up side Likewise, it's hard to see a break-out on the down side that would cause a cumulative downturn Nonetheless, we have had this pattern, as Bob Forrestal just pointed out, of starting out the year more optimistically and then scaling down our growth forecasts I think there is a business attitude that if you have a good quarter, you take it but you don't think it's going to continue at that pace; and if you have a bad quarter, you say well, maybe we ought to scale down the forecast While we're not talking about major risks on either side, I suspect that if we're wrong we may have somewhat more sluggish economic growth On inflation I think the numbers that we are seeing now do understate the underlying rate of inflation just as the numbers earlier in the year overstated it My sense is that we're not likely to see an acceleration of inflation from the underlying fundamentals just as I doubt that we'll see much of a deceleration I think we just are kind of stuck where we are with inflation So, it's pretty much a no change, unexciting, and not particularly satisfying outlook "

1869,1993-09-21," The Philadelphia region has improved a little but it continues to grow modestly and still, I think, lags the nation Employment growth is sluggish and attitudes remain cautious, neither optimistic nor pessimistic Where there has been some improvement is in the manufacturing sector, which has been a major drag on the economy It's not that it's going up so much; it's that it has tended to stabilize after several months of decline Also, New Jersey, which has been one of the hardest hit states in the country, appears to be improving The weakest sector there was construction, and both residential and nonresidential are showing some signs of growth  -17-    9/23/93  although from very low levels Also, New Jersey had a good tourism summer and that has been a positive More generally, I'm picking up the same kinds of vibrations that Si is in the commercial real estate market That investment in real estate is beginning to look relatively attractive because other alternatives aren't so good It has been a long time since I've heard the term REIT in our board room but I'm now hearing it again, which isn't all good news We went through the REIT problems of 20 years or so ago But this noise we hear about some improvement in commercial real estate is not for this year or next year so much as later in the decade  District bankers report weak commercial loan demand However, when we pursue that a little more, they are beginning to wonder how they will finance a pickup in loan demand when it comes And that's a new kind of attitude They're worried about the runoff they've seen in deposits and whether they can get enough deposits back to fund what they think someday will be an upturn in loan demand  On the national economy, I think the fundamentals are about the same and will likely continue to be the same moderate growth, subdued inflationary pressures, employment growth insufficient to cause a significant drop in unemployment, and cautious attitudes I don't believe there's very much that monetary policy can do to alter that outlook even if we wanted to But I think the respite from criticism that we've had in recent months is likely to come to an end Impatience is going to be our greatest foe in the next few months And I suspect that we will increasingly have to defend a no change policy as the restlessness over this rather disappointing employment growth continues to build   It certainly does in Philadelphia   Larry, I think those observations are especially insightful I wonder if you wouldn't mind just dictating some of those and passing them out   Well, maybe it could come from that Also, some of that ought to be in your public remarks at the appropriate time I think those are things that need to be said "

Going forward would that same policy then hold for a memorandum of discussion?   And what is the logic of the distinction between going forward and going back?   I see   I see Thank you   No, I don't have any comment   I have just a couple of general points We've talked a lot about the deliberative process this morning and how important it is for the quality of the decisionmaking process I think it's important to underscore that this deliberative process evolved over a long period of time; it was not made in a day or a meeting or one generation of Open Market Committee people And one can undermine that and weaken that process much more quickly than it took us to get it to the point where it is So, we all have to look not just at our short-run issues but also at this longer-run view of our effectiveness  The second general point is that the deliberative process is not unique to the Federal Reserve The Executive Branch and other independent agencies have to have an effective deliberative process for every major public policy decision I make this general statement, and I'm sure others are more factually aware of it, but I suspect that the kinds of things we are talking about today if they were applied to the rest of the public policy decisionmaking units in this city throughout the Executive Branch would give them a great deal of trouble also in carrying out the kinds of quality decisions that they have to make I think one can make the case that central banking is different, but we don't want to be different on the side that we have less of an environment to be deliberative than [others making] public policy And I think it would be helpful to us if we compared the practices elsewhere in Washington to our own; we may not be as much of an outlier as we think we are And the way that we are moving may in fact result in our short-changing our ability to deliberate compared to other agencies  Having said that, we have to deal with the [issues at] hand In general what you proposed, Mr Chairman, makes sense to me I think going back five years with a lightly edited transcript is the way to go I would not go back and ask everybody who has been a part of this to sign off That would be a time-consuming and probably not very effective process The document ought to say that the staff did it and used their best judgment; there may be errors in it, but here it is And we ought to move on releasing these as quickly as we can, given the resources  Going forward, again I think your general proposition makes sense Nevertheless, when I went back for the first time in a long time and actually reread parts of a Memorandum of Discussion and then compared it to the lightly edited transcript, there was not a great deal of difference My recollection of the Memoranda of Discussion was that they were somewhat shorter and somewhat more summarized, but after just going back and reading one it seems to me there isn't a lot of difference And while I can support the Memoranda of Discussion going forward, since a lot of our problem is one of perception--and we almost surely will have to defend this in a FOIA suit at some time in the future--I wonder if we ought to err marginally on the side of more openness So I could easily accept, and in fact have a marginal preference for, going with an edited transcript instead of the Memorandum of Discussion going forward But I don't feel that  -30-    11/16/93  strongly about it and I can certainly accept your proposition if that's the majority view of the Committee  One other point This is not the time to consider it, but going forward I think this Committee ought to keep a very open mind about the kinds of minutes that we now put out--whether they ought to be enhanced and how they could be enhanced I also think we ought to keep an open mind about the schedule on which we formally release our decisions   My first choice is light editing without annotation but with a note on the [cover] page that says this was done by the staff and it may or may not be accurate My second choice would be a raw transcript with some annotation   Five, first choice; three, second   Edited transcript first choice; MOD second choice   The deliberative process at work here!

1918,1993-11-16," Let me be briefer than usual in light of the hour Although the Philadelphia District continues to lag the nation, the improved trends that I noted at the last meeting continue largely for the same reasons that we're seeing nationally Manufacturing is stronger; the orders there are better Residential construction is  -75-    11/16/93  stronger And the retailers, who usually are never happy, seem less unhappy; and I think that's a positive sign for the District Attitudes are still cautious largely because of the employment situation--employment growth is flat to very modest--although I do sense that people seem to be more receptive to good news than they did a few months ago  On the national scene, we have a sawtooth pattern that has prevailed in this recovery now for several years When we see a blip upward, as we're seeing now--4 percent growth seems likely in the current quarter--there's a tendency to expect that that may continue, just as when things soften it tends to go down My sense is that we are still largely locked into a 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth pattern overall with this sawtooth trend line that we see, largely I think because of the slow employment growth And my sense is that what will keep the economy from growing much faster than that is that the [strength in] consumption, which has [supplied] a big upward push, is not sustainable [without] faster income growth, and I doubt that we'll see the faster income growth that would be necessary So, I think we do have a stronger second half but I don't expect that trend to continue; next year I think we'll be back into the 2-1/2 to 3 percent [growth] area On inflation I might just echo what has been said There just is no sense out there that there's an inflationary problem or that prices are rising; it's quite to the contrary I might also say that the subject of interest rates is a non-topic "
1919,1993-11-16," ""B"" symmetric "
1984,1993-12-21," On balance I support your recommendation   I've already commented   No [Unintelligible]   It made a great impression! [Laughter]   Well, if we plan to spend the weekend, Don, I'd appreciate knowing!  END OF MEETING     "
1985,1993-12-21," Well, the same upward momentum is apparent in the Middle Atlantic states as well We've been a region that has lagged the nation; I think that is still true, although clearly attitudes and aggregate demand are stronger We're seeing it in many parts of the District and we're seeing it across industries, most notably in manufacturing The same is true in retailing and in residential construction, although we still have problems in the nonresidential side Having said that, there is still a tentativeness that is present not only in the way business people are looking ahead --in some respects they are having trouble believing things are improving because it has been a tough period--but also in their actions We are not seeing the kinds of increases in employment that appear to be the case in other Districts And while I think this  -16-    12/21/93  improved attitude has more substance than what we saw a year ago, it is still going to need some more nourishing for it to take hold and produce this cumulative forward momentum that we need for a really strong economy In terms of pricing, I keep hearing over and over how difficult it is to raise prices and that the only way to protect margins is still on the cost side There's a lot of pressure on suppliers, and it's very difficult to make price increases stick  As for the implications for the national economy, I don't think we know the answer to the bottom line question How similar is this to a year ago and how much of a takeoff are we really seeing in the economy? I think one can make a fairly good case on either side of that My sense is that we will not see the kind of weakness that we saw a year ago I think there is more to this [improvement] going forward But it's just too early to tell, and we ought not be goaded into a tightening that some of our hawkish friends might urge on us Nor should we be timid; we need to be willing to tighten when the time comes I think this is not the time There's still enough uncertainty I would call this a period of watchful waiting; I'd be prepared to do what we need to do but not be precipitous about it "
1986,1993-12-21," I think the days of this degree of accommodation are numbered It's likely to be sooner rather than later that we'll have to reduce the level of accommodation I do think, however, that we're in a period of wait-and-see And when we do move, I believe that this Committee should vote explicitly to make that decision because it's so important And for that reason I think we ought to have a symmetrical directive and face up to the issue squarely when the time comes and everybody will be on the record as saying ""This is what we're going to do"" "
2050,1994-03-22," What are the consequences of not approving this request?   Well, there are these two issues One is the wisdom of swaps in general and how well they've been used Then there is the question of whether Mexico ought to be treated differently The $6 billion is in line with trade flows and various other economic ways of measuring these things So really it's the second issue of whether Mexico should be treated differently; I think we are not really talking about the wisdom of the overall swap arrangements today So then my specific question is--and I don't think you really answered the question, Ted--what are the consequences of treating Mexico differently? What are the consequences of nonapproval? I'm not clear in my own mind what those consequences are I don't come to these discussions on intervention and foreign exchange markets and swaps with any ideological baggage I just want to know what the practical implications are of our actions or lack of action   What are the consequences of something less than $6 billion?   All right   So this is really the price of admission to a bigger show?   Well, this was a very wise subcommittee and I want to concur with its recommendations [Laughter] "
2051,1994-03-22," The tenor of the Third District's economy has changed during the last several months Economic growth now resembles the type of growth typical of an expansion rather than the lackluster performance that we have been experiencing in the mid-Atlantic region Manufacturing is clearly strong in the District, with much of the strength of the fourth quarter carrying over into the first quarter, and expectations seem very positive for the remainder of the year New orders are up; steel and auto production schedules are strong One major railroader told me that his company is running flat out and adding locomotives and crews as fast as possible And for the first time I heard from a sheet steel maker that they plan a significant increase in their inventories because they are concerned about the reliability of deliveries  Residential real estate sales remain strong and industrial properties are selling well Although commercial real estate remains soft in Philadelphia, it has become very strong in the suburbs, with a noticeable improvement in south Jersey I would say that strength is coming on sooner than most of us had thought One of the major real estate firms told me that they are hiring additional commercial real estate agents and not all that long ago they were laying them off and didn't expect to be hiring them back for some time And there is sufficient demand to warrant new commercial construction in the suburbs starting, I would say, within the next year or two  As for retail sales, autos and other big ticket items are selling well Where there is still a note of caution is with smaller retailers and smaller items They clearly have been hurt by weather Their feeling is that their sales will pick up, but there is a natural worry because their expenses have been continuing and they haven't been selling They feel pretty good, but they'll feel better when the customers start coming back in when the snow melts  Labor markets clearly have strengthened in the District I see more help wanted signs in retail stores than I've seen for a while But there are few, if any, signs of wage pressures developing On the price side, I have not seen any general price pressures  -20-    3/22/94  although most business people tell me that the demand is strengthening to the point now that they think there may be some opportunities for price increases in the next few months They always talk about how long it has been since they've had a price increase and their optimism for getting one to stick, I think, has increased One can sort of see it in their eyes!  As far as the national economy goes, there are always uncertainties in these kinds of forecasts There have been very few meetings where somebody has said, here it is, the economy is either going to go down or up and there isn't any doubt about it There are always risks I think our job is to assess those risks My sense is that the greater risk to sustainable growth is too much strength rather than too little demand I feel that way for several reasons The most important thing in any economic expansion is not pinpointing this item or that item, it's the cumulative momentum that carries us from one quarter to the next And I think that momentum is very well entrenched We also have a highly stimulative monetary policy Most of the drags to demand that we have been trying to get over in recent years are largely behind us And there seems to be an attitudinal change now which looks at sales and other data as a sign that things are going to get better rather than worse I think that psychology is an important part of this momentum "
2052,1994-03-22," Well, I think the case for a less accommodative policy today is quite persuasive We did press hard on the monetary accelerator to get the economy moving, and now as the economy approaches cruising speed we have to ease off the accelerator to avoid having to slam on the brakes down the road The real issue--the major issue as you point out, Mr Chairman--is how much to move I prefer a 1/2 percentage point increase in the federal funds rate compared to 1/4 because I think we have some distance to go to get to a neutral policy, and it's better to cover that distance earlier rather than later Also, I think a 1/4 point increase is so small, given where the economy is, that it will set off almost immediate speculation about the next move So we will just repeat what we have gone through in recent weeks I think a more decisive 1/2 point increase can reduce uncertainty, especially if accompanied by an appropriate announcement  Now, there are always risks to decisive action One risk is that we might be overestimating the strength of the economy, and a less accommodative monetary policy might damp its growth too much Given the underlying strength that we see, that appears to me to be a small risk, and the best protection against that kind of risk is a willingness on our part to reverse course if need be I think the greater risk is that we may have gone too slowly in raising rates for  -45-    3/22/94  this stage of the economic recovery Historically, waiting too long to adjust rates has been a greater risk, and I think it's the one that we need to be especially sensitive to in this current environment I am sensitive to the financial risks that you point out, but I must say that in one form or another that has been the argument around the table for not moving in the past when we should have moved It also may be that this point is significantly different from other points historically, but my guess is that if we push on this economy, we will get inflation and we will end the growth So one can come up with lots of arguments, some subtle, some not I think the important thing is to stick to the basics and go to the heart of the matter We have an economy that is telling us that we need a less accommodative monetary policy, and in my view we ought to move in that direction decisively It's surprising , but when people do things decisively, they end up getting better results than if they try to outsmart themselves and consider all the angles in the curve So, I think we ought to go to the heart of the matter "
2110,1994-05-17," There has been a fair amount of discussion about capacity--how much of it we have left before we have inflationary pressures--and about the growth potential of the economy Most of    5/17/94  these estimates, particularly the growth potential, can change with seemingly small changes in assumptions, like labor force participation rates, productivity increases, and that sort of thing I presume that you are thinking of a capacity growth rate of maybe 2-1/2 percent or maybe 2-1/2 to 3 percent Do you have a view as to whether we're likely to be on the high end of a range like that or on the low end, given the recent trends in labor participation and what appears to be fairly strong capital spending, especially equipment spending?   The District continues clearly to be a part of the Northeast--its growth trend is positive but somewhat slower than the nation Manufacturing continues to grow, but the pace of growth has flattened out some The bookings for the future also have gone up rather substantially but that too seems to be flattening out I suspect it may have to do with some capacity constraints A major railroader in our District reports what others have said in the railroad business they're operating flat out They can't get cars fast enough to ship the goods Residential construction has made a good-sized rebound, although I think some of that is clearly seasonal Once that part is out, I think we will have moderate growth Nonresidential construction is mixed Some areas are still dead and likely to be that way for some time Other areas are beginning to show some signs that there will be additional construction, probably more so next year than this year Retail sales clearly have picked up The automobile business is strong, and it's clearly a seller's market at this point except for a few lines Bankers, who heretofore have not seen a whole lot of growth in commercial lending, are now reporting modestly rising demand Business loans, both to finance inventory accumulation as well as capital equipment, and consumer and real estate lending continue to pick up In our labor markets the rate of unemployment for the District as a whole is about the same as for the nation, although it varies quite widely around a relatively small District However, the growth in new jobs has been on the sluggish side despite the improvement in the economy Consequently, wage pressures are well contained On the price side, there clearly  -20-    5/17/94  is a desire and a wish to raise some prices, but I'm still hearing mostly that it's very difficult to make those increases stick  As far as the national economy goes, I don't have a lot to add I think at this point in an expansion the risks tend to be for faster growth rather than slower growth Perhaps it's just my own District and the influence that that has, but my sense is that the odds pretty strongly favor moderate growth and that there is not a lot more upside risk to the economy than downside risk  On monetary policy, because the District is improving but not as fast as the nation, the increasing interest rates and our actions have been more justifiable on a national basis than a District basis I am running into what has just been echoed across the table Do what you have to do and get it out of the way so that we can get this uncertainty behind us "
2111,1994-05-17," I support a 1/2 point increase, the symmetric directive, and I like the draft statement the way it is "
2163,1994-08-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Philadelphia District economy continues to grow modestly, although still less than the nation as a whole Retailing, bank lending, and manufacturing reflect this general assessment Employment growth in fact has strengthened some in the District The perception, however, is still one that jobs are hard to get, and high profile layoffs are a major contributor to this perception There is a fairly widespread feeling that the second half will be slower than the first There is also some anxiety about how much slower There is in addition some of the skepticism that Cathy has picked up about the durability of the expansion Our survey of manufacturing is picking up stronger price pressures, particularly in the metals area More generally, however, wage and price pressures remain largely contained with most firms still emphasizing cost containment to stay competitive  The national economy, while slowing, in my judgment is still growing solidly The growth in employment plus strength in equipment spending and a stronger outlook for exports are major pluses Negatives or question marks are in construction and inventories On balance, while slower-paced growth is likely, the risks do seem to be more on the up side than the down side Likewise for future inflation, the risks also seem to be more on the up side than the down side The capacity utilization relationships, I think, point toward a skewed upside risk for inflation, and also the signs in the pipeline-- commodity prices, prices paid, prices received--and the attitude in some industries that one can indeed pass along some cost increases, I think, are blinking caution at this point   But it's a bank down the street; they are not doing it; it's a bank down the street "
2164,1994-08-16, I support the package 
2215,1994-09-27," The Third District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, less strongly than the rest of the nation Total employment is growing, although slowly Retail sales are expanding with strength notably in durables, particularly in autos Residential construction on the whole is flat--down a little in some areas, up a little in others Manufacturing continues to do well; it is growing, but not quite as fast as earlier in the year Banks are reporting increasing loan volumes including increases in lending to small businesses There also are reports of a fairly general slippage in underwriting standards--always the bank down the street, not the bank you're talking to The outlook suggests that the pace of growth in the District will continue to moderate, although I must say I am hearing more concern about what rising interest rates might do to business prospects We clearly have gotten people's attention; higher rates are on their minds, and they are talking more about it Wage pressures remain subdued Except for input prices, inflationary pressures have not changed much in the District The competitive environment stressed over and over by business people seems to be making it difficult to pass on higher input prices  My reading of the national economy is that the expansion is slowing but that we are likely to get more growth than we expected for the next quarter or two rather than less The strength in retail sales coupled with that in business equipment and faster growth among our trading partners provide the underpinnings for continued growth in demand and job creation And with excess capacity dwindling, the  -15-    9/27/94  inflation risks are clearly in view The major uncertainty, however, is what lies beyond the next quarter or two when some of the slackening of pent-up demand and lagged effects of previous interest rate hikes will be felt more fully The skewing toward greater upside risk may well continue beyond this year or there may develop more of a balance between too much or too little demand going into next year For that reason, it strikes me that this is a time where we ought to have additional monitoring of economic developments as the preferred course "
2216,1994-09-27, I agree with your recommendation 
2274,1994-11-15, Move approval  SPEAKER(?) Second 
2275,1994-11-15," The profile that you have for growth over the next 15 months or so I find somewhat puzzling The economy has a fair amount of momentum, and yet you have a rather significant falloff in the rate of growth out into next year with a yield curve that is still sloping upward I think that you would have to have more flattening of the yield curve to get this dramatic a slowdown That's one piece that is puzzling The other part of it, even if you are right, is reminiscent of the late 1980s If you take growth down to 1 to 1-1/2    11/15/94  percent, if it really does get that weak, you open yourself up to any kind of a shock I'm puzzled on both sides one, that we will get this amount of slowing with the kind of increase in rates that you talk about; and on the other side, if we actually do end up with this kind of slowing, then you can argue that we are vulnerable on the down side So I have two opposite concerns   Anecdotal reports suggest that the Philadelphia District is catching up to some extent with the rest of the nation Manufacturing in particular is showing strength and the outlook is positive Steel and auto products are notably brisk Retailers generally report a pickup in sales, especially in apparel and appliances, and the mood is upbeat about holiday sales Realtors say home sales are strong in the Philadelphia area but uneven in the rest of the District The supply of homes is high, however, and selling prices have been steady Commercial real estate activity varies a great deal around the District from weak in south Jersey to strong in some parts of central Pennsylvania There is a pickup in the Philadelphia area, especially in the Pennsylvania suburbs Lending activity is on an upswing around most of the District and lending terms are easing, but I don't think we ought to be surprised at that; that's typical Bad loans are made in good times, and there is a bandwagon effect that human nature just cannot resist despite changes in legislation, better supervision, and so forth There are no general signs of price pressures, although I hear more reports about tightness in skilled labor markets and the demand for professional- type jobs Some manufacturers seem more confident about selected price increases sticking, but most still talk about tough competition holding prices down All in all, the District economy is less of a laggard and the tone is better, although feelings of insecurity are just below the surface and sometimes on the surface, depending on who is doing the talking  At the national level, we are seeing what we have seen before Once the economy gets going, we tend to underestimate the strength of its forward momentum and the level of interest rates needed to achieve moderate growth with subdued inflation Now  -20-    11/15/94  fortunately, if we have fallen behind the curve, we are not all that far behind With timely actions going forward, we have a good chance of keeping inflationary pressures in check and the expansion on track "
2276,1994-11-15," Earlier in the year when we knew that we had to begin to tighten, I think there was a case on real sector grounds that we probably should have moved by more than we did I think you argued rather persuasively, Mr Chairman, that we had a bubble in financial markets and that we had to deflate that rather slowly Otherwise we could take a big hit In hindsight, I think that was wise We may have a similar bubble now in the nonfinancial sector of the economy Sentiment and the outlook for the economy have improved Inventories, as you have noted, are a positive influence on the economy However, while we talked a lot today about financial markets and the foreign exchange markets, we talked very little about sentiment in the nonfinancial part of the economy We run a risk with the 75 basis points of making a pretty big hole in that nonfinancial bubble out there It is going to hit those in the nonfinancial part of the economy with a big bang; they are going to be quite surprised; they are going to think that either we know something that they don't know or that this move is going to bring about a significantly slower 1995 My own preference would be to go 1/2 If we had to go another 1/2 in December, I would go another 1/2 But just as we had to be careful about deflating the financial bubble earlier in the year, we have to be careful about deflating the nonfinancial bubble at this point "
2384,1995-03-28," Mike, when Hoosiers see something that is too good to be true, they know it probably is [Laughter]   There are some clear signs of moderating growth in the Philadelphia District Manufacturers in particular indicate a slackening pace that is apparent in new and unfilled orders as well as current shipments Retailers report a slowing pace of sales, especially in autos and other durables, although I think there is considerable uncertainty among retailers as to whether this is just a temporary slackening to be followed by a pickup or the beginning of a slower trend Residential sales and construction are in a lull and there likewise I think most realtors are not sure whether this is just a lull that will pass or the beginning of a long, dry spell Commercial real estate conditions are soft, but the cycle seems to have bottomed out in areas of the District that show more strength Looking across the District, even in those areas where economic activity is stronger than in others, there really is an absence of wage and price pressures They just remain subdued and are a nonproblem Increasingly in the District, the outlook for moderating growth is becoming the conventional wisdom, following the fast finish of last year, which temporarily raised spirits that 1995 might be a very strong year Since the Philadelphia District has been a laggard during this expansion, there is some feeling that the good times could have lasted longer--the same view that Cathy Minehan finds in New England  For the nation, I think we need more than the usual amount of humility about our assessment of the outlook To be sure, there are  -29-    3/28/95  increasing signs of slowing growth, but we could be surprised either on the up side or the down side Areas like inventories or net exports or consumption expenditures all strike me as having more potential than usual for surprises for reasons that have been discussed How much inventory accumulation is intended or unintended? Certainly, the net export outlook has a number of crosscurrents Since the lull in consumption expenditures has been mainly in the durables side, just how temporary is that or is it more permanent?  We are likely to have some increases in inflation in 1995 We need to try to distinguish between cyclical increases that are likely to moderate as the cycle matures and increases of a more underlying or core character In this context, a slowing of economic activity makes credible the case that we may see more of a cyclical increase than an underlying increase But here too, we need to keep a few upticks in inflation in the context of a cycle This comes back to the importance of gauging the strength of economic activity, and I think this is a time for monitoring "
2385,1995-03-28," I support alternative B because this is a wait- and-see time, and I support an asymmetric directive for the reasons that were well articulated by Bill McDonough "
2440,1995-05-23," Looking at the available statistics, the Third District economy clearly has slowed in recent months across a broad front, including manufacturing, retailing, and residential construction Looking beyond the statistics, however, I think what we are seeing is a downward adjustment in the rate of growth rather than a cumulative decline in economic activity Both business and consumer attitudes in the District still seem positive Rail transportation activity, often a good indicator of manufacturing activity, seems to be bottoming out except for autos The slowing of office leasing seems to be more from short supply than weak demand in the District, a positive sign for future building, and lower mortgage rates are a positive for housing activity  On the inflation front in the District, I think we need to look beyond the current statistics as well Although there is some uptick in the rate of inflation, I doubt that what we are seeing is a cumulative upturn in the rate of inflation, but rather a temporary cyclical upturn that is not sustainable in the current climate of moderating demand pressures, stiff competition for sales, and subdued wage and benefit increases  Turning to the national economy, my views are similar to what is happening in the District The national economy in my view is making a downward adjustment in the rate of growth rather than going through the early phase of a cumulative downturn And the economy is experiencing a temporary uptick in inflation rather than the beginning of a cumulative upturn Nonetheless, while I am still reasonably confident about the prospects for a soft landing, I think we need to be very sensitive to incoming information "
2441,1995-05-23," I support ""B"" symmetric "
2492,1995-08-22, I support your proposal 
2493,1995-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman Most of the recent anecdotal and statistical information suggests that economic growth is resuming in the Philadelphia District Manufacturing, which has been a major drag, appears to be bottoming out and the outlook is positive Retailers report the usual summer slowdown, but the underlying trend is favorable and retailers are upbeat about the fall Bankers continue to report that consumer lending is rising Auto dealers are maintaining positive sales trends, although extensive incentives are underpinning the sales rate Residential sales have picked up in response to falling mortgage rates as well as effective price reductions by builders There are some indications that the pricing of office buildings may be firming, although prices are low and vacancy rates are only steady at high levels The employment situation is mixed, with the jobless rate still high in parts of southern New Jersey and the old industrial and mining regions of Pennsylvania Other parts of Pennsylvania and Delaware have tighter labor markets Wage and price pressures remain contained  On the national level, the inventory adjustment appears to be proceeding reasonably well Final demand appears to be holding up and inflationary pressures appear to be subsiding There are always risks to any outlook as has been pointed out, and there can always be surprises At this point, however, the outlook is favorable for sustainable growth and further progress toward reducing inflation over time "
2494,1995-08-22, I support your proposal 
2545,1995-09-26," In many ways the Mack bill conforms to how we have carried out policy in recent years So, I see it as legislation that is catching up with the experience and the progress There are some advantages to the bill I think it is useful to formally make price stability the primary objective over the long run The proper way to look at it from my point of view is that price stability is a means to an end, not an end in itself The ultimate end of all economic policy is higher standards of living and growth and that sort of thing So, as we explain our role, and I think the Mack bill does this, we need to focus on price stability as the primary objective but as a means to a larger end I also like the flexibility that the Mack bill gives the FOMC in the pursuit of this longer-term objective It realistically allows us to take into account short-run factors like  -43-    9/26/95  fluctuations in demand, recessions, financial shocks, etc, but the short-run actions need to be anchored in this longer-run objective In other words, whatever we do in the short run ought to be consistent with this longer-run objective, and I think the Mack bill does give us that latitude It does open up the question of what the strategy is It is easier on paper to explain that we are going to move toward stable prices year after year until we get there In practice, I think we have to take into account the business cycle in getting there We got ourselves into this inflationary problem cycle to cycle We have gotten out of it marginally cycle to cycle, taking advantage of cyclical developments So, as we go forward, if this bill becomes legislation, we need to take into account the cycle-to- cycle progress even though it can be more difficult to explain So, as a general proposition, I would support the thrust of this proposed legislation   Ambiguity is necessary for flexibility  -51-    9/26/95   I must say that I didn't read it that way I read it that we had flexibility during the transition and that we had flexibility thereafter  SPEAKER(?) I agree   The ides of November [Laughter]  END OF MEETING  -52-     "
2546,1995-09-26," Recent data and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy in the Philadelphia District is growing, but not strongly; growth continues at less than the national pace Manufacturing has reversed course after a weak first half and is growing again Residential construction has stabilized after a period of weakness earlier in the year Nonresidential activity is up some around the District, driven by distribution and retailing facilities plus some hotel and entertainment-related construction Retail sales are up a little Banks report that loan demand generally is flat; where there is some increase, it tends to be on the consumer side rather than the commercial side Employment levels that had been declining earlier in the year have stabilized and are rising, particularly outside manufacturing--in the service areas  Turning to the national economy, of the three broad categories of slower, faster, or moderate growth outlined by Mike Prell, I am in the moderate category I think that we are likely to head into a period where sales and production will grow at a sustainable pace in 1996 I must say, however, that as I travel around the District--and I do a lot more listening than I do speaking --I sense that the better business confidence is probably broader than it is deep If one just listens, one gets more of the tone that it's to the slower side Now perhaps that's the District If one probes, then, yes, things are better; the third quarter is better than the second; the fourth probably will be still better, and 1996 looks okay But one does not get the same sense of optimism in the business community generally as when one listens to economists and professional forecasters Phrases like ""it doesn't get much better than this,"" just don't ring true, I think, in the business community Maybe it's just human nature; maybe it's our part of the country; but there just isn't that underlying enthusiasm about the future that one would hope to see "
2547,1995-09-26," I support ""B"" symmetric I think we indeed have to take into account the fiscal side, but I don't know what to take into account at this point So, we ought to wait on that Almost surely we will have to adjust policy at some point in coming months, but I don't sense any pressing need today So, I think your basic arguments are correct and I support them "
2609,1995-11-15," The regional economy in the Philadelphia District is mixed It is performing in the range of steady to improving slightly Manufacturing continues to grow, although the pace appears to be waning Retailers are disappointed with sales and concerned about the outlook for holiday sales Even discount stores are now seeing smaller increases than earlier in the year Auto sales have eased with the end of incentive programs on '95 models and slow deliveries of '96 models Real estate activity has been running at a nearly level rate Office vacancy rates are coming down only slowly if at all, and residential sales are flat Commercial and industrial lending is moving up some, with a slowing of credit card lending Employment gains are anemic but still better than earlier in the year, and wage gains continue to be in the 3 to 4 percent range Attitudes appear to be more cautious than upbeat  -24-    11/15/95  Turning to the national economy, it just does not have the feel of a 4 to 5 percent growth rate The statistics appear to be telling us a relatively fast growth story, and the anecdotal information indicates a more moderate growth story I'm inclined to give more weight to the anecdotal evidence Consumer spending appears more consistent with the more moderate growth path, as does manufacturing I would view the 4 to 5 percent growth that we seem to have had as more of a statistical aberration than a basic underlying trend The outlook for inflation is probably in the 3 percent range for next year While I believe we are all committed over time to a stable price environment, I think we have to be realistic about this We are in a very mature phase of the business cycle and it would be a major accomplishment by historical standards just to keep inflation from rising at this point in the cycle I think there will be opportunities to have further disinflation, but my expectation is that we will have to wait for a more conducive phase of the business cycle for that to be achieved "
2610,1995-11-15," I support the ""no change"" in ""B"" I think there is enough uncertainty in the economy, and it is on a moderate growth, low inflation kind of track My sense, and it's entirely judgmental, is that the federal funds rate is on the high side of where we will want it going forward and that we will need to adjust it downward within the next several months However, at this point, given the uncertainties about the outlook, I would be inclined not to prejudge policy in any way and, therefore, I would go for a symmetrical directive "
2664,1995-12-19," It's in times like this that we wish we had measures of the money supply and reserves that would accurately reflect the stance of monetary policy I think if we did, it would clearly show that there has been a tightening of policy But we don't have those measures, and we are stuck with the federal funds rate There is a long history around this table of using and abusing a federal funds rate target I think what we are doing today is the right thing in terms of using the fed funds rate and making discretionary adjustments when it is necessary to avoid the pegging problem that we have had so often in the past So, I think what we are doing here is the right thing This is not the time to be tightening policy Your admonition about referring to the budget is well taken I must say, as others have said, that I have been increasingly uncomfortable in recent months about the perception that there is a tight link between what we do in the Fed and what happens on the fiscal policy front I think it's important that that link be broken I also agree with you that this ought to be a cautious move There is enough uncertainty about the economy I think the asset inflation problem, the bubble effect, is one that we ought to take into account Our announcement ought to be couched in terms of a reduction in inflationary expectations I agree that our action should be a 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate with a symmetrical directive and no discount rate change  On the issue of opportunistic versus deliberative, I think it should always be clear in this discussion that whether one takes the opportunistic road or the deliberative road, the commitment to achieving price stability is absolutely firm I don't think there is any difference in the commitment between those who adhere to one process or another We need to be clear about that My own view is that the opportunistic approach is the preferred one mainly because it  -47-    12/19/95  works There is a practical history to it, and I think that there is a practical future to it While we are independent, what we do has to make sense to the country as a whole I think the opportunistic approach will get us to price stability, and I think it will be a more acceptable approach broadly "
2712,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman What is remarkable about the economy in recent months is its resiliency Despite government shutdowns, severe weather, and strikes, the national economy is still on track for moderate growth and low inflation The economy is also experiencing what could turn out to be its greatest restructuring since the Industrial Revolution, with all the attendant insecurity that comes at the personal level from change of this magnitude That, I think, makes this resiliency all the more remarkable My sense is that the upside and downside risks are about evenly balanced for the period immediately ahead The inventory correction appears to be well along The consumer, while somewhat stretched in terms of debt, still appears to have ample purchasing power for sustainable spending growth And the strengthening in residential construction reflects positive consumer sentiment One major builder told me, for example, that some of his strongest sales are in areas heavily impacted by the layoffs at AT&T  On the wage/price front, I think we need to be watchful, but we also need to keep in context where we are We are more than five years into an economic expansion We have seen little if any acceleration in inflation I must say as I look back through the pipeline, there really are few signs of an acceleration of inflation at this point The positive aspect of this expansion is that after more than five years we have not had any acceleration of inflation My sense is that we are not at the point where that is likely; I think inflation will continue to be subdued for the period ahead  Turning to the region, the Philadelphia District economy continues to lag the nation Pennsylvania in particular is a major laggard New Jersey growth rates are more promising, and I think the outlook there is brighter Delaware continues to be the little jewel that it is in the regional economy What has impressed me most in recent weeks is the surge in new housing sales in the District For the better builders, this surge has been apparent for a couple of months Even in the dead of winter, the traffic into showrooms was very high, and people were more than looking; they were signing contracts Now, if you talk to the builders who are not the most competitive or the leading builders, they also are feeling the upturn in activity It is difficult to find a builder in the District who is not feeling that I think low mortgage rates and the perception that mortgage rates have bottomed out have been a stimulus But at least for the Philadelphia District, with existing home sales much slower than new home sales and population growth slow in the mid-Atlantic region, I think one has to be skeptical about the sustainability of the rapid increase in new home sales Nonetheless, for a District that has been rather sluggish for a long time, a spur in residential construction is welcome at this point "
2713,1996-03-26," I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2755,1996-05-21," I think the discussion would be quite useful But starting it with a number doesn't strike me as the way to do it We ought to have a broader discussion on the issue of price stability, what we mean by it, and how we can get there I think that if we have the substantive discussion, then numbers will fall out But if we reverse the order, I think we will end up with a heavily philosophical discussion So, I support the notion of having a discussion and focusing on the substantive question, and I would leave the issue of numbers for a later date  -47-    5/21/96 "
2756,1996-05-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in the Philadelphia region is showing signs of improvement across a wide range of sectors including manufacturing, retailing, and construction Growth is uneven across the District, however, and overall the region lags the rest of the country I would still categorize the overall growth rate as probably modest Some areas in the District have low unemployment rates while others still have quite high levels of unemployment Wage pressures, while firming in a few areas, generally are not accelerating General price inflation also is still subdued, but some commodities like metals, fuels, agricultural commodities, and textiles show some firming tendencies  The national economy appears to me to be in reasonably good shape I think the downside risk of late last year and early this year has subsided While we see clear signs of firming in the national economy, I really do not see a high probability of a break- out on the up side The outlook for moderate growth is therefore well founded in my judgment Developments on the inflation front clearly need to be watched going forward The economy does seem to be somewhat less inflation-prone than in recent decades, witness the experience since 1994 where we have had an unemployment rate of 5-1/2 percent and the inflation rate has stayed more or less constant To what extent and for how long this favorable experience will last we don't know, so we have to be cautious about what we say concerning the future We are, however, better positioned now than we were in 1994 to deal with inflationary pressures, should they arise Then, we had a clearly stimulative monetary policy and a considerable distance to go just to get to a neutral policy stance Today, we certainly are closer to a restrictive policy stance, should we need to get there, so we have more time to engage in watchful waiting "
2757,1996-05-21," Several issues have been talked about around the table, and in the end people have to make their own judgments With regard to the issue about the economy and the structure of the economy, most of the models, which I think the Greenbook reflects, clearly indicate that we should have had accelerating inflation over the last couple of years and are likely to have accelerating inflation going forward But the actual experience in the last couple of years has not been particularly consistent with forecasts based on those models So, our dilemma really is one of being open-minded to the possibility that there are some structural changes going on versus getting caught up in wishful thinking because tightening policy is always more difficult than easing It is easy to fall into the trap of finding excuses for not tightening, but my sense is that there is enough evidence over the last year or so to cause us to be more open- minded about the prospect that the economy may indeed be less prone to inflation I think there is something to that hypothesis, but we have to be very careful about getting carried away with it  On the stance of policy, if the federal funds rate were a couple of percentage points lower or even a percentage point lower, I would be more persuaded that now is the time to act But I don't know whether current policy is a little restrictive or a little stimulative My sense is that it is probably broadly neutral and therefore that we are fairly close to wherever we need to go Based on those reasons, not out of any overwhelming conviction that I am right but after trying to weigh the evidence and making judgments that are a matter of both logic and intuition, I come down on the side of no change at this meeting, alternative B  On the issue of symmetry or no symmetry, I could support either I don't have strong feelings On balance, I prefer symmetry mainly because I can't imagine that you, Mr Chairman, would make a decision to move toward tightening in this particular environment without a consultation with the Committee Therefore, I think the operational value of asymmetry in these circumstances is essentially worthless Looking ahead, since we do have a lag on releasing the minutes, I think asymmetry could convey the wrong impression of where we are when the minutes are made public six weeks from now I would prefer to keep our policy options very open, debate policy again in July, and make a judgment then without having the added issue of an  -35-    5/21/96  asymmetrical directive at this meeting exert any influence on that decision So, I come out with ""B,"" symmetric "
2813,1996-08-20," The economy in the Philadelphia District appears to be on a modest uptrend that has tilted down from a somewhat faster pace earlier in the year Manufacturing is growing but at a somewhat slower pace Delivery times, while lengthening in the spring, have shortened more recently Retail sales growth, quite healthy in the spring, has eased during the summer months Nonresidential construction is flat and the pickup in residential construction appears to be decelerating Employment growth is improving slightly and some labor markets are tight while others still have slack Price and wage pressures on the whole still seem to be reasonably contained in the District  Turning to the nation, at the last meeting in early July we hoped that more information would help settle two questions--whether growth would moderate to a more sustainable pace and whether wage inflation indeed is beginning to accelerate On the sustainable growth question, I think the bottom line is that the weight of the data suggests a moderating growth trend but how much moderation is far from clear On the wage question, the larger first-quarter gain was repeated in the second Once again, however, sizable wage gains were offset by a small rise in benefit costs so that total compensation has  -18-    8/20/96  been rising at essentially the same rate in 1996 as in 1995 On the whole, price pressures remain remarkably subdued for this stage of an expansion Reasonable people can easily come to different conclusions about the outlook at this point My hunch is that we may see appreciable slowing in growth because of subdued personal consumption, more modest growth in business fixed investment, and some slackening in residential construction At the same time, upward wage pressures will not likely bubble up into upward price pressures as much as one might think because of continuing offsetting smaller benefit costs and strong competition for products and services Nonetheless, in this environment I think we need to continue to monitor demand and price pressures very closely "
2862,1996-09-24," I understand the issue of trying to get some of these holdings off the Bundesbank's balance sheet What are our alternatives in terms of doing that? Is this proposal the only option? I can think of some theoretical alternatives, but I do not know whether they are worth much For example, we could diversify into some short-term nongovernment securities instead of extending the maturities of our German government securities holdings Or we could reduce our position in D-marks I am just wondering if you have thought about other alternatives and what the pros and cons might be   What does extending the maturity of our foreign currency investments do in terms of exposing us to greater loss? This comes to mind because we have this issue of our surplus, and that gets us into potential foreign currency losses among other things,   I think the case for moving toward a somewhat more liquid portfolio makes a lot of sense I don't know whether it ought to be 60 percent bills, or 2/3 bills, and the rest coupons, but I think Peter rather persuasively laid out the case that we need to move in that direction Perhaps the way to do it would be to move to, say, a 60/40 split and see if we like that If we feel that we need to move more than that once we get there, then we could move further How long do you think it would take to move to a 60/40 split portfolio?   I think we ought to move in that direction and then take another look at it We might not wait five years but might look toward getting a progress report two or three years from now to judge if the 60 percent makes sense I don't think there is an absolutely right number, but I think we know the direction in which we ought to be moving, and we ought to get started  -49-    9/24/96 "
2863,1996-09-24," The Philadelphia District economy is growing, but not booming, and attitudes are generally positive Some labor markets are tight while others still have significant slack There is some upward pressure on wages but downward pressure on benefit costs, especially health care costs There are some examples of upward price pressures related to steel and plastic inputs One also hears, of course, that prices are being raised indirectly For example, fitness equipment suppliers are raising the minimum order required for free delivery Some auto dealers are giving smaller discounts Overall, however, price pressures are still subdued in the District, with businesses reporting strong competitive pressures that continue to make it difficult to pass along price increases; they also report better productivity gains than in the published data  Turning to the nation, there is something for everyone, depending on what story one wants to tell, but not all is murky Clearly, there is a risk of accelerating inflation because of an overheating economy The risk, however, is more one of an upward creep in the rate of inflation than a breakout of inflation Actual inflation rates are still remarkably subdued, and most of the pipeline indicators are quiescent as well The case for a moderating pace of economic growth, while not completely convincing, is nonetheless substantial We do a fairly good job of forecasting the direction of growth We do less well forecasting the timing and magnitude of change But the expansion of consumption appears to be slowing and the rate of GDP growth likely will be substantially less during the second half of 1996 than in the first half There is a tension between data on the supply side of the economy and the demand side, which usually says something is going on in inventories Labor markets are taut but final demand, notably consumption, is moderating Although industrial production rose 1/2 percent in August, capacity utilization in manufacturing actually declined slightly, suggesting less risk of bottlenecks in production Also, the rate of unemployment consistent with stable and low inflation rates has varied over the last several decades; it is not constant Finally, monetary policy is broadly neutral We almost surely will not have far to go whenever an adjustment is decided upon In short, we still have time for watchful waiting, if we want to take advantage of it, without letting down our guard against escalating inflation  -14-    9/24/96 "
2864,1996-09-24," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2918,1996-11-13, Second 
2919,1996-11-13," Economic activity in the Philadelphia District continues to expand, although the pace of growth has slackened some since the summer Manufacturing overall reflects this trend Some industries like rubber, plastics, chemicals, primary metals, and machinery are relatively stronger than textiles and furniture Retailers are having a better year to date than last year, though there has been some slowing so far this fall compared to the summer A number of retailers have told us that sales volumes hold up only when prices are cut Construction activity generally has edged down, with nonresidential construction well under the levels of a year ago and housing permits somewhat above Labor markets remain mixed, with some areas very tight and others reporting slack In general, employers report increased difficulty in finding qualified entry-level workers A major reason is that some minimal level of computer skills is required for many entry-level jobs, especially for clerical workers There is also a shortage of truck drivers and of skilled tradesmen in construction In the job categories where shortages exist, there are notable upward wage pressures Generally, however, wage increases are in the 3 to 4 percent range  On the national front, the economy is performing according to a script of more moderate, sustainable growth and subdued inflation The best-bet outlook is for more of the same, though something can always go wrong There are always uncertainties, and there is always room for improvement At the same time, the macro economy is performing rather well, and monetary tinkering at this point would be likely to do more harm than good "
2920,1996-11-13," Central bankers worry a lot That is a requirement for the job But difficult as it is for us, I believe we ought to take good news when it comes Therefore, I think staying where we are with an asymmetric directive is more than desirable at this point "
2969,1996-12-17," Peter, I have a couple of questions on your planned changes for Desk Operations As I understand this, you have operations for customer accounts and you have operations for System account Is my understanding correct that on System operations you are now going to announce the amount after the bids have been accepted? You already announce the size of customer transactions, but on that side do I understand correctly that you announce the amount of bids that you are looking for and not the amount accepted?   My question does not focus primarily on the customer side Are there any advantages or disadvantages when you are doing System operations to announcing the amount of bids that you are looking for?   That seems like a reasonable tradeoff If you are planning to go in earlier, and I presume this is just a way station to entering the market still earlier as more information becomes available, that opens up the possibility, or maybe the likelihood, that you can come into the market more than once during the day    12/17/96   Yes What are the kinds of things that you look for--you have talked about this some, but could you elaborate--in deciding whether to go into the market a second time? Do you look at reserves; do you look at the funds rate; do you look at both; or do you in a sense put your hands over the market to get its feel? What happens?   Thank you "
2970,1996-12-17," I am reassured that President Broaddus is standing firm in his commitment to price stability I was getting worried about that!  The Philadelphia region continues on a modest growth trend, with most sectors reflecting this trend Attitudes are positive and the outlook is generally positive as well Labor markets are generally snug, although places like the southern-most part of New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania still have relatively high unemployment rates Getting ""qualified workers"" is becoming an increasingly familiar refrain among business people It is something that one hears almost regularly Average wage increases, however, still remain in the 3 to 4 percent area, although I think they probably are concentrated more in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range Almost everyone trying to sell something, from large businesses to street vendors, still reports stiff competition, which tempers the tendency to raise prices in this kind of environment  There is not much to be added on the national economy I think the key points are that the economy appears to have successfully made the adjustment downward from unsustainable growth rates earlier; it appears to be on a more sustainable track, and I think that is the  -19-    12/17/96  outlook On inflation, we are still operating in a cautionary zone Performance is better, actually remarkably better, than one might have expected on the basis of historical experience So, we are doing reasonably well there and are generally looking at a positive, even enviable, position to be in As has been pointed out, there are worries and potential problems, and we need to stay alert But we can also continue to be patient "
2971,1996-12-17, I support your recommendation 
3025,1997-03-25," The Philadelphia District economy is operating at a high level  Intense competition, however, seems to be keeping the lid on wages and prices  Manufacturing is doing well; retail sales are generally good Commercial real estate is  shifting from a buyer's market to a seller's market Vacancy rates are going down; rents and  property values are going up The incentive to build is picking up, and developers are  shopping for land Competition for bank lending is stiff, with the predictable squeezing of  margins and slippage of underwriting standards The slippage in lending standards is always  done by the bank down the street The problem of one large credit card issuer in the District  clearly has had a sobering effect on other issuers, but that occurred too late to avoid varying  degrees of hangover for most of them I think the issuer that received the press attention  probably is more prone to problems and not as well managed as some of the others in our  District  Turning to wages and prices, some selected wage hikes are occurring On the  whole, however, the wage/price climate in the District remains subdued One manufacturing    3/25/97  CEO I recently spoke with, and I think she is representative of manufacturers generally, said  emphatically that increases in productivity will continue to absorb wage hikes  Turning to the nation, the uncomfortable uncertainty that most of us have felt  around the table over the last six to nine months is partly explained, I think, by how people  look at the economy Most people we talked with see the economy from their own point of  view They see business rolling in, stiff competition, and productivity going up They also  see some labor shortages, but those are the kinds of problems they like to live with Now,  that view contrasts with the macro framework that I think lays out the prospects for problems  down the road It strikes me that there is a greater divergence between the person-in-the-  street view and this macro framework than I have seen in a long time There is not much  appreciation, I think, for that macro framework view We have to weigh the risks, and my  sense is that the national economy has considerable self-feeding momentum Although  inflation is remarkably quiescent for now, I think the risks have shifted fairly substantially  toward the upside of too much demand pressing against supply down the road With the  strong demand, I think the current federal funds rate almost surely means that we are  pumping too much liquidity into the economy It is the old pegging problem that we know so  well from the past While patience has been wise, I think some insurance against overheating  makes sense now in order to keep the economic expansion on track "
3026,1997-03-25," I support a 25 basis point increase We ought to explain this  tightening action by indicating that we think we will increase the chances of prolonging the  expansion by moving now We central bankers ought to like job creation; we ought to like  growth; we ought to like prosperity, and I think we ought to explain our actions in the context  of favoring those things Indeed, if we have learned anything, it is that low inflation is  pro-growth rather than anti-growth With regard to the symmetry issue, I think the choice of  symmetry or asymmetry is based on a flexible theology It seems to play different roles at  different meetings, and I do not have strong feelings one way or the other But I think your  rationale is as good as any, Mr Chairman, so I would vote for symmetry "
3068,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Philadelphia District economy  generally continues to operate at high levels, although the rate of growth has moderated some  in recent weeks The more moderate growth is most notable in manufacturing and auto sales  Manufacturers generally expect a high level of activity for the balance of the year but  relatively small additional increases Auto dealers, too, report less than buoyant sales  Retailing more broadly is doing well, although there is so much competition that anecdotal  reports from individual retailers sometimes understate the broader picture Restaurant sales  in particular are doing well, which is a fairly good indicator of consumer attitudes  Construction activity is mixed The outlook for commercial building in suburban locations is  strong Buildings are now selling for more than reproduction costs, and there are the  beginnings of some speculative building On the other hand, some shakeout is likely in the  construction of retail outlets, such as supermarkets, which are overbuilt  There is more than ample liquidity available, and competition to make commercial  loans is fierce One executive in a highly leveraged company told me that some lenders are  willing to lend up to 30 percent more than a new acquisition is worth Some REIT activity  also looks shortsighted By contrast, however, there does appear to be more caution in the  consumer lending area, particularly in credit cards    5/20/97  Labor markets are tight in many areas of the District One sign of this is that  parents, although greatly relieved, are pleasantly surprised that someone is willing to hire  their offspring There is some upcreep in wages as labor markets tighten around the District  Many businesses, however, still say that they cannot raise prices and therefore must offset  higher wage costs somewhere else, usually through improved efficiencies  Turning to the nation, the uncertainties on the demand side of the economy are  greater now than when we last met There also are continuing uncertainties on the supply  side On the demand side, growth clearly is moderating more than was forecast at the last  meeting What we do not know is how long the slower pace will continue My hunch is that  there is still a fair amount of self-feeding momentum underlying the expansion When  people earn more and feel more secure in their jobs, they spend more and businesses invest  more  I think the risks for demand are still on the upside, but there is more uncertainty  than when we last met On the supply side, the uncertainties remain about as they have been,  although with a higher level of anxiety as the economy moves further into territory not  charted for nearly three decades Both labor force growth and, apparently, productivity gains  have increased capacity limits surprisingly far without generating broad-based price  increases The risk is that overheating will occur at some point, and we want to avoid that to  prolong growth At the same time, we do not want to act prematurely or unnecessarily On  balance, this strikes me as more of a time for heightened surveillance than for overt action "
3069,1997-05-20," This decision comes down to balancing the need for more  insurance versus wait-and-see I am more persuaded by the wait-and-see argument There  is, as I look at it, more upside risk on the demand side in the future, but there is also upside  potential on the supply side, which we have consistently underestimated If there is one  unifying theme that we pick up when we travel around our District, it is that there are  developments out there that really are enhancing productivity and working their way through  on the supply side I think a proactive monetary policy has to take both the demand side and  the supply side into account We want to see problems in a proactive sense, but we also need  to see benefits in a proactive sense I think it is a reasonable bet to have that wait-and-see  attitude, particularly since current monetary policy is not loose It is probably somewhat    5/20/97  restrictive, and I don't think we are that far behind the curve even if we are making a mistake  and should be tightening today I am quite comfortable with the ""B"" asymmetric proposal "
3113,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman The pace of economic activity in the  Philadelphia District is picking up somewhat in the third quarter after moderating in the second  Labor markets are tight, with some upward pressure on wages Businesses, however, are still    8/19/97  finding ways to offset higher wage costs Inflationary pressures therefore remain muted  Manufacturers, retailers, and contractors are all showing moderate increases in business activity  Loan volumes are up slightly Firms generally are doing very well in maintaining their cost  structure All in all, my impression is that the District economy is growing steadily without  noticeable excesses This steady growth environment is particularly helpful in alleviating some of  the long-standing social problems that one finds in a large northeastern city like Philadelphia  Turning to the national economy, there does appear to be some pickup in final sales  during the current quarter The amount of inventory accumulation is uncertain and quarter-to-  quarter growth rates are therefore uncertain as well More basically, the economy appears to be  growing moderately, with tight resource usage Conventional economic models point to upward  price pressures, as they have for some time They may be right or they may be wrong, but in the  meantime actual signs of an inflationary buildup are shadowy at best There still is a strong case  for us to wait and watch "
3114,1997-08-19," I was just going to say, Mr Chairman, that you have made wonderful  progress here this morning, and I do not think we ought to jeopardize it We ought to support it as  a group and consider it time well spent   If I could, I would   I will make an honorary motion   And the Chairman   I agree with your ""B"" asymmetric proposal "
3161,1997-09-30," The economy in the Philadelphia District currently is performing much  as it has in recent months It features steady growth at a moderate pace, tight labor markets, and  little or no upward pressure on prices In commercial real estate, vacancy rates are low and rents  are rising More capacity is in train, however, and rents are expected to be under less pressure as    9/30/97  more space is completed As yet, there is surprisingly little speculative building going on in the  Third District Although wage increases seem to be holding at around 4 percent, there are more  reports of additional perks, signing bonuses, and other incentives to attract and retain skilled  people With business activity generally favorable, attitudes are positive but tough competition  seems to be providing a restraining influence on the development of a boom mentality  Turning to the nation, we are in a reasonably comfortable position for now Actual  performance at the macro level continues to be surprisingly good, and the risks to that favorable  performance are largely unchanged from recent months Like some of the rest of us, I did  appreciate the confessions of a tortured staff Perhaps the time has come for all of us to torture  ourselves less Most people like to be right rather than wrong; most would rather have the outcome  turn out to be better than worse The problem here is that things have turned out to be better, but  most of us have been wrong [Laughter] Depending on one's mindset, each of us will respond  either by saying, ""The old model is still true; just give it time; it will reassert itself,"" or by saying,  ""There is a new model at work and the world is indeed different"" My guess is that the truth is  probably somewhere in the middle We just do not know where in the middle at this point But I  think the time has come for us to be less defensive, and the way we do that is to adopt the stance of  being open minded and alert and let the truth, whatever it is, fall out wherever it might In the  meantime, we make the best judgments we can If we are right, we are right; and if we are wrong,  we are wrong But I do not think we ought to torture ourselves any longer "
3162,1997-09-30," I agree with your recommendation, and I have an open mind about what  will occur in November and December "
3203,1997-11-12," In the interest of brevity, I will touch on only a few highlights The  economy in the Philadelphia District is operating at a high level with tight labor markets, but the  pace of demand has moderated some, notably in retailing and manufacturing There are several  other areas, however, that suggest that new attitudes are developing Business demand for new  office space is very strong, and landlords clearly are in the driver's seat Commercial loan  demand is also very strong, but the competition to make loans is intense As a result, bank  margins are thin and the terms are very liberal Lenders, if reminded, remember the lessons of  the late 1980s and early 1990s, but that influence on their current decisions is weakening REITs  have a lot of money Armed with a lot of cash, they are bidding up the prices of almost any  property that has some value They still seem, at least in the Third District, to be more interested  in buying than building, although I think that will change as prices exceed reproduction costs In  the credit card area, although there is justifiably a lot of concern, delinquencies have stabilized,  albeit at a higher level than a year ago Anecdotally, the credit card issuers have been trying to  do something about the quality of their new issues But I don't think what we're seeing suggests  that they are successful because the new issues seem to have about the same quality as the older  vintages  In our market, wages had been going up in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range I think the  typical increase is now settling in at a fairly solid 4 percent growth rate and labor markets are  tight Nonetheless, the familiar story is still there about the inability to raise prices, and I think  that is holding overwhelmingly I do not sense an increase in inflationary psychology  Turning to the nation briefly, the situation is that demand was supposed to moderate  but it has not, just as the inflation rate was supposed to accelerate but it has not When we throw    11/12/97 74  in the market turmoil that we have had, I think recent developments point at least to deferring a  decision today Nonetheless, given all the uncertainties as we look forward and weighing all the  pros and cons, it does seem to me that the risks of overheating have increased somewhat In  particular, one is beginning to see some attitudes that could very well become excessive on the  bullish side Thank you, Mr Chairman "
3204,1997-11-12," I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
3259,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Philadelphia District  is operating at a high level, with most sectors doing well Labor markets, as elsewhere, are very  tight, but inflation remains subdued despite some upward pressures on compensation We talk  about the tight labor markets, but business people are doing a lot more than talking about it  They are being rather creative in terms of attracting people who ordinarily would not be  available to work For example, along some of the main arteries in the Philadelphia region, we  see large signs advertising job opportunities at ABC company or XYZ company Local theaters  advertise jobs in their film clips Instead of just getting previews of the next film, the moviegoer  gets a film clip about working for specific companies Flyers about available jobs are being  distributed at senior citizens' meetings and in grocery stores I am told that serious consideration  has been given in some schools to sending flyers home with school children to invite their  parents or other caretakers to call a number or come to a particular place to discuss available    12/16/97 32  jobs The subways, buses, and taxis also are getting advertising from employers So, business is  responding to this labor scarcity and is exercising some flexibility in terms of enticing  unemployed people to accept jobs Clearly, there are limits to this process, but I think those  limits are being pushed back  In the consumer spending area, holiday retail sales seem to be doing reasonably well  overall However, one can get quite a mixed message depending on whom one talks to  Competition is fierce, and the patterns of retail sales are changing Sales through the TV  medium and catalogue sales are taking away some business from traditional retailers The large  malls with the more established stores seem to be doing well, whereas the big box retail stores  and strip malls tend to be having a tougher time We can get any story we want depending on  whom we talk to on any given day, but if we put it all together, I think we come away with a  sense that holiday sales are doing reasonably well  The commercial real estate market continues to tighten and office vacancy rates are  dropping Home builders and real estate agents report that demand for both new and existing  homes is quite healthy At this point, manufacturers report some moderation in demand and  output, but they do not point in particular to the Asian situation, although they may well do so  over the next several weeks  We in the Fed and other central banks focus on inflation and the goal of price stability  Being a good central banker, I always warn people of the risks of inflation and the virtues of  price stability When I finish that talk, the first question I get now concerns what I think about  deflation In my view, this deflation talk is not something one can just dismiss That's mainly  because it is coming from fairly sensible people, the same people who told us not to worry a    12/16/97 33  whole lot about inflation in 1996 and 1997 when we insisted that there was a big problem In  part, I believe these comments are reflecting the fierce competition that businesses face, and they  also reflect the fact that most businesses find deflation harmful I think they would rather have a  little inflation than a little deflation Nonetheless, while we do not have to buy into it and we  want to be sure to keep it in perspective, this is something that we ought not to dismiss out of  hand as coming from people who are ill-informed  On the international side I want to compliment President McDonough on his analysis  It was a very insightful analysis of what is happening and I appreciate very much having it  As far as the national economy goes, we are in an enviable position in terms of  underlying demand in the economy, in terms of job creation, and in terms of benign inflation  There clearly are risks and we have talked about those risks for months I think we need to be  flexible both in our assessment of where the risks lie and what monetary policy might or might  not have to do over the next 12 months or so "
3260,1997-12-16," I support your recommendation for ""B"" I think the case for staying  where we are is overwhelming today The issue of symmetry is a more marginal decision, and I  don't have strong feelings about it one way or the other In my view, the major case for  removing the asymmetry is that symmetry is probably a more accurate description of where  policy is Now and then, I think we ought to be accurate [Laughter] "
3309,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Philadelphia District  is growing at the same rapid pace as last year Job growth has expanded to all sectors including  manufacturing, which had been a drag on the regional economy Labor markets are very tight  Compensation costs are rising, but apparently so is productivity growth There is little evidence  of rising inflation  As others have said, the anecdotal comments from the business community revolve  mostly around people issues The most frequently heard comment is that qualified workers are  scarce and they are becoming more expensive There is more job-hopping as compensation is  bid up One labor leader told me that the building trades are having trouble attracting qualified  workers because wages in manufacturing have now surpassed those in construction  For the first time in several years, I also am hearing comments about a shift in the  psychology of the workplace In the wake of corporate downsizing, there was job insecurity and  people tended to work longer and harder Now there is an emerging view among workers that  they cannot keep up the pace any longer It would appear that job insecurity is beginning to turn  the other way, and workers are looking for things like more vacations and more predictability in  their work schedules If they're not getting that from their current employer, they can get a job  somewhere else with a significant increase in pay In conjunction with the tightness in the labor  market and the increasing costs associated with it, I continue to hear stories about the pervasive  use of technology throughout the economy to increase productivity It is one story after another,  and one gets the sense that the end is nowhere in sight, that we are in one of those periods where  this process is likely to go on for some time  Turning to the national economy, it seems that we are still being dealt the same hand  that we have been dealt for a number of months We have ongoing strength in demand and very    3/31/98  tight labor markets that by past standards should be causing inflation to accelerate, but that  acceleration is not happening We also have the card that points to some prospective slowing in  the pace of demand, and that slowing is not materializing either We all hear anecdotally about  significant productivity growth, but it is not being captured fully in the statistics I also think we  have the same hand being dealt to us as far as policy goes That is a wait-and-see policy versus  some kind of preemptive action We will be talking about that later "
3310,1998-03-31," I think we have an unsustainable situation Unless we are quite  fortunate and get some offset to inflationary demand pressures other than through policy action,  we indeed will have to face up to making a policy adjustment and probably more than once  On the issue of preparing the market, I think a policy speech by you at the appropriate  time is far superior to a two or three sentence press release There are a couple of reasons One,  I think that if you need to make such a policy statement, we have to be prepared to follow fairly  quickly with policy action We don't want to get ourselves into a ""cry wolf"" situation where we  talk and do not act So, I would prefer that you wait until it looks as though a policy action needs  to take place Your speech would prepare the markets at that time, and a policy action would  follow Ultimately, it is actions, not words, that count, and words will only matter if they are  followed by action Second, I would suggest that in addition to the usual macroeconomic  rationale for action, such a policy speech should stress that we like good times, that we like  people to have jobs, and that we are acting to sustain the good times The point was made earlier  that the lower echelons of the labor force are now beginning to participate in this prosperity, and  they would be the first to be unemployed if things went awry I think it is important that we also    3/31/98  make a point like that because it helps to give a balanced view of our policy It indicates that we  are not against growth and against lower echelon workers making progress and, indeed, that we  are moving to sustain such progress I would urge you to add that to the usual macro analysis "
3360,1998-05-19," On the proposed changes to the securities lending program, you  indicate in the memo that you plan to use a noon auction What are your thoughts about lending in  times of stress? Would you have to supplement that noon auction later in the day? Why noon?  Why not 130 or 100 pm? How will you deal with problems of demand after noon? "
3361,1998-05-19," The regional economy around Philadelphia continues to operate at a  fairly high level with mostly modest growth There are few signs of upward price pressures  Among the anecdotal tidbits that I have picked up around the District in recent weeks is that one in  four jobs is likely to go unfilled this summer in District shore areas There seems to be an increase  in the number of retail customers who cannot complete purchases because their credit cards are  ""maxed out"" There also are quite a few bankruptcies and delinquencies One Philadelphia firm,    5/19/98  for example, has sent 14 of its 250 employees to credit counseling school in recent months But  almost everywhere in the District, and this is the unifying theme, people are in an upbeat mood  At the national level, we find ourselves facing much the same economic situation that  we had in March Employment and output growth appear unsustainably strong, but there is little  evidence that inflationary pressures have begun to build We are wondering how soon or whether  growth in aggregate demand will slow or inflation build if the fed funds rate remains unchanged  Early data for the current quarter are inconclusive about any slowing in the expansion Higher  compensation costs and a slightly faster rise in the CPI in recent months are possible early warning  signs of accelerating inflation, but that evidence also is not conclusive The acceleration in M2 also  might be an early warning sign, but that too is questionable So, with data that remain unclear, we  basically are still in the business of balancing risks to determine what the appropriate course for  monetary policy ought to be The risks for the real sector are, in my judgment, still tilted toward  the upside as they were in March  The risks in the financial sector also are tilted in the direction of excess Some  examples are the narrowing of spreads, strong competition for lending that has led to an easing in  credit terms, a high level of consumer debt and personal bankruptcies, expansion of subprime  lending with questionable terms--for example, 125 percent loan-to-value ratios for home equity  lending--rising prices of homes and office buildings, rapid expansion of REIT activity, narrow risk  spreads between Treasuries and corporate bonds including junk bonds, and rapid growth of the junk  bond sector so far this year I would also mention the stock market, where P/E ratios seem out of  phase, and the strength of the merger movement, with merger offers that involve growing  premiums over current stock prices None of these signs is conclusive individually as an indicator  of major financial excess One can make that case, but I don't think it is that convincing a case    5/19/98  They do bear watching, however, because excesses in the financial sector can easily undermine the  pursuit of maximum sustainable growth and output  Where I come out is that our ready, alert position of recent weeks remains  appropriate, although we certainly have a number of things that we need to watch closely going  forward in the coming weeks "
3362,1998-05-19," I think this is one of those decisions where we have come to the end  of the line as far as whether hard analysis will give us the answer; it will not This is a period  where we must use our judgment Our judgment over the past year or more has been to be patient  It is tempting to overdo something that has worked in the past, but my judgment is that we ought to  keep things where they are for now In the spirit of humility that has been expressed, I'm not sure I  am right, and I don't think anybody else can be that sure either But my judgment coincides with  your judgment, Mr Chairman, to stay where we are "
3413,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, will try to be brief Not a lot has  changed in the Philadelphia District The region generally remains strong, although growth has  slowed This is showing up in manufacturing where the effects of Asia are apparent, particularly  with producers of building materials, chemicals, and machinery The same phenomenon of a high  level of sales but slowing growth is apparent in retailing Although the national news reports have  spotlighted the weakness in autos, sales of automotive products apart from GM products generally  have been strong in our area Construction is robust, both residential and commercial There  may be some slowing of construction activity in our District The reason is not so much because  of a lack of demand but I think because of some bottlenecks related to the shortage of machinery  and labor A number of people around the table have commented on the problems in agriculture,  and they certainly are severe, but I would like to add a footnote to that Apparently, ""fat is back""  and the dairy farmers in my District are pleased about that People want some taste back in their    8/18/98  food Milk fat prices are up and milk now joins red wine, martinis, and eggs in making a  comeback I have heard complaints from dairy farmers for years, and it is nice now and then to  hear something positive from them Labor markets remain tight in our District, although wage  increases are generally moderate and the phenomenon of not being able to raise prices is still  heard among businesses around the District  As far as the nation goes, I think the biggest change since we last met is that the  problems in Asia and their spillover effects appear to be more severe or at least make me feel as  though the global economy is in a more precarious situation US inflation remains subdued, and  in my estimation the threat of a breakout on the upside has lessened So, whereas the risks in  recent months were thought to be more pronounced on the side of greater inflation, they now seem  to me to be more balanced "
3414,1998-08-18," I support a ""no change"" policy, and I think the risks have shifted  sufficiently to justify a symmetric directive "
3462,1998-09-29," I agree with the simpler language I, too, think that Tom has  improved it, and I would go with that While I realize that it's difficult to be against providing  more information, I continue to have some problems with immediate release of the tilt I am for  more information as a general matter, but I believe the practical outcome of prompt release of  our decision on the tilt would be less use of it Monetary policy does not take place in a vacuum  It takes place in a wider social and political environment In that environment, it is almost  always easier to lower interest rates than it is to raise them If we are planning to raise interest    9/29/98  rates, we may as well get a real bang for the buck and actually do it If we say we might raise  them and then fail to do so, we are going to get the inevitable announcement effect and the  associated criticism for doing it There will be a further ""announcement"" effect later when  nothing happens I think we will go through that exercise a few times and conclude that it really  is not worth doing Not acting in the direction of a tilt may also erode our credibility The tilt  may be useful for our internal deliberations, but we would be using it less and adopting  symmetric directives more frequently So, I have real doubts that this kind of disclosure would  actually contribute to clarity And I therefore have misgivings about moving in the direction  where the majority opinion appears to be going "
3463,1998-09-29," The Philadelphia District economy, while still operating at high  levels, is showing some early warning signs of deterioration Business people have become  more uncertain and in some cases apprehensive This anxiety began in manufacturing and is  now spilling over to other businesses as well The outlook now is significantly more guarded  compared to several months ago However, measured deterioration and actual business  conditions today are still mostly concentrated in manufacturing Other sectors report more a  fraying around the edges Retailing and construction are still holding up Bankers report less  loan demand and still acute competition, and lending terms remain looser than one might expect  in this environment, especially among smaller and medium-size banks Inflation is a word that    9/29/98  is hardly used in the District Labor markets are still tight, although the squeeze on earnings and  less demand for exports are prompting a few layoffs and talk of more layoffs around the District  Turning to the nation, the risks clearly have shifted to the downside Global financial  stresses are closing in on the American economy and are likely to continue to do so for some  time With the Treasury yield curve now completely below the federal funds rate and the real  fed funds rate rising, there is a persuasive case for a decrease in the fed funds rate I believe,  however, that we have not fallen behind the curve and that we are still in a position to be  preemptive While it is important to move today, we also do not want to convey a sense of panic  or that things are getting away from us I think that what easing we do should be deliberate "
3464,1998-09-29," A 25 basis point reduction captures my feeling I think it is the right  measure of response at this point As far as the tilt is concerned, I'm almost indifferent about it  I believe that we are going to be so driven by events that the tilt is likely to have no substantive  influence on what we do If we had a different disclosure policy and there were an  announcement effect, I think it would be worth spending more time on this question, but I am  happy to go along with your recommendation "
3526,1998-11-17," I prefer Option 2 In my view, it captures what we have been talking  about around the table I would drop the sentence beginning with ""Any potential changes"" My  only reason for suggesting its deletion is that I think it is basically redundant, though it is  substantively harmless We need to have a Chairman who is fully effective A fully effective    11/17/98  Chairman needs to be able to change the federal funds rate between meetings If dropping or  adding this sentence in any way affects that, I am for whichever strengthens the Chairman's hand  to be fully effective "
3527,1998-11-17," Business conditions in the Philadelphia region have been steady  overall, but there is a continuing weakness in manufacturing Looking ahead, business contacts  expect some slight improvement in economic activity going into next year, but there is a cautious  tone to this forecast In the interest of moving the meeting along, I will skip the District details  Clearly, the national economy is currently showing a lot of resiliency, given the  turmoil in financial markets Perhaps the economy will escape major damage and continue to  move forward at a healthy clip The most likely outlook, however, is for a slowing of growth for  the reasons already given, particularly the international ones In short, the risks are on the  downside With inflationary pressures subdued, we have the flexibility to take out some  additional insurance against excessive weakness in demand  Financial markets have improved from their earlier unstable condition, but they are not  yet back to normal We need to continue to facilitate a return to normalcy Financial markets  currently are like a sick person who feels better after taking antibiotics for a few days but still  needs to stay on medication to avoid a relapse and to aid a return to good health In short, in    11/17/98  both the real sector and the financial markets, we have downside risks that, in my judgment, need  to be counteracted "
3528,1998-11-17," I support your recommendation In the interest of time, I associate  myself with the remarks of Governor Ferguson "
3590,1998-12-22," I believe Don Kohn deserves to be complimented, but I don't think  I'd go as far as others have! [Laughter] I think it is a learning step It is a good compromise I  hope that we all keep open minds and indeed do learn from it At some appropriate time we can  then weigh the evidence and decide what we want to do It may indeed turn out to be a good  step; it may not be a good step But I think a learning step is a step in the right direction "
3591,1998-12-22," The regional economy in the Philadelphia District is healthy,  although weakness in manufacturing persists Attitudes are positive and prospects for continued  expansion are good Retail sales appear to be matching expectations Consumers are shopping,  though, with an eye for bargains High-end brands that offer good values are moving while    12/22/98 31  high-end brands that simply offer prestige are sitting on the shelf Supermarkets have been  responding to value-concerned consumers as well by upgrading the quality of their store brands  while holding prices below those of nationally advertised brands As a result--and I think this is  an interesting statistic--the store-brand share of sales has risen recently to 25 percent from about  15 percent Auto dealers report the same value consciousness because they have to offer  discounts to move cars Pressures on profit margins are mentioned frequently by business  people Wage costs are up some, but raising prices is not competitively feasible  In commercial construction, there appears to be a reasonable balance of supply and  demand The rental market is strong and vacancy rates are low, but there are a few signs of  overbuilding The market is expected to stay on a solid footing, with vacancy rates stabilizing  around 10 percent and with no building boom All in all, the regional economy appears to be on  track for moderate growth during the coming months, with labor markets tight and inflation in  check  For the national economy, I think we have an unusually wide spectrum of plausible  outcomes I can envision an economy that expands well above the Greenbook forecast The  economy has shown a lot of resiliency There is an internal dynamic there that could provide the  wherewithal for a surprisingly strong growth rate next year I can also envision an economy that  comes in on the weak side There are vulnerabilities and we all know them; I don't need to tick  them off A combination of adverse factors could make for a very bearish performance The  Greenbook forecast is a reasonable guess among these wide-ranging alternatives Who knows, it  might actually come to pass, more or less That is a compliment! [Laughter]    12/22/98 32  The good news is that we are operating in a low inflation, high employment  environment that allows some maneuvering room for monetary policy should the unexpected  occur But in the current relative calm, we still need to stay awake and remain alert "
3592,1998-12-22," I support ""B"" symmetric without any agonizing! [Laughter]   May I ask one question, Mr Chairman? I was one who, just for  language purposes, wanted to drop the sentence ""Any potential changes in the federal funds  rate"" Some expressed a concern that one of the subtleties of that wording related to your  authority to act on the Committee's behalf between meetings One view was that dropping that  sentence somehow might be interpreted or perceived as compromising your authority between  meetings My question to you is Do you believe that the deletion of that sentence in any way  creates a perception of compromising your authority?   Thank you   I am for option 3 I would drop ""in coming months"" for the same  reasons and with the same degree of conviction that Governor Kelley expressed I am practically  indifferent about the last sentence On balance, I would probably keep it in "
3650,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic activity in the   Philadelphia District remains strong and shows few signs of slowing Labor markets   continue to be tight, but competition remains fierce and there appear to be few   inflationary pressures The outlook is also positive whether one talks to manufacturers,   retailers, auto dealers, homebuilders, or commercial real estate people That said,   however, one does not get the feeling that we are crossing over from strong growth to   boom conditions There is an absence of inflationary pressures in the pipeline   Businesses are still operating on the basis that prices will not rise There is, to be sure,   some upward pressure on wages, but productivity gains and cost-cutting are acting as   effective offsets And even in real estate, one does not get the sense of the kind of boom   conditions that prevailed ten years ago, even in areas that are prone to such conditions   I think much the same can be said about the national economy We see strong   growth, few signs of a buildup of inflationary pressures, and the absence of boom   conditions As for the risks, the upside risk to the domestic economy is still there, as it   has been; and the downside risk from abroad is also still there, as it has been The risk of   financial contagion, while still there, appears to have subsided--a little anyway     3/30/99 34   While a case can be made for tinkering with the federal funds rate to cancel, in   effect, some of the insurance we took out last fall, I am much more persuaded that we   should leave well enough alone for now and continue to see what unfolds in this truly   remarkable economy And it is remarkable in the sense that it is about everything one   could wish for  "
3651,1999-03-30," I support “B” symmetric I don’t think there has been enough   of a change since the last FOMC meeting to warrant a change in our basic directive As   far as what we stand for, I don’t think our primary objective is zero inflation In my   view, our primary objective is maximum sustainable growth, and low inflation is simply   a means to that end Therefore, I think we need to see something in the pipeline, even   very preliminarily, that suggests that the economy is beginning to experience a buildup in   inflationary pressures that puts sustainable economic growth in jeopardy Or we need to   see something, even if it is very preliminary, that suggests that we have the beginning of   boom conditions Neither strong growth alone nor a low unemployment rate alone is a   reason to tighten monetary policy So, I favor steady as she goes Our next move may   indeed be a move to tighten But that in and of itself doesn’t justify a change from “B”   symmetric at this point  "
3695,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy of the   Philadelphia District remains on an upward trend Manufacturing is strengthening   Retailers report growth in sales Construction has been increasing Business lending has   picked up Labor markets remain tight in most areas Apart from oil and tobacco prices,   inflation is benign and pricing power remains largely nonexistent according to most   business contacts The outlook for the regional economy is positive   Turning to the national economy, the strength in domestic demand continues   unabated and prospects mostly are for more of the same There may be a moderating   trend out there, but it is elusive Financial markets, fixed-income markets in particular,   look increasingly normal following their seizing up last summer and fall Developments   abroad, although mixed and still worrisome in some areas, look better or at least not as   bad as feared a few months ago   Taken together, these developments--robust domestic demand, more normal   financial markets, and less bearishness abroad--indicate to me that the balance of risks   has more of an upside tilt than at our last meeting  At the same time, inflation remains   quite benign despite recent headlines Core CPI, absent tobacco, is very tame The   broader measures of inflation are mostly decelerating Compensation and productivity   are still in a virtuous cycle   So, while risks on the demand side of the economy have shifted somewhat to   the upside since our last meeting, developments on the supply side remain largely   favorable To me that means a somewhat heightened state of alert for policy is called for   How that heightened state should be expressed is better discussed later in the meeting  "
3696,1999-05-18," Your recommendation of announcing a tilt captures my sense   of what we ought to do today I think it strikes the right balance between showing that   we are indeed awake at the switch and at the same time showing the appropriate restraint   Even more importantly, I believe it positions us either to act on the tilt in the future,   should that be necessary, or not to act But I do think it sends the right signal, and I fully   support what you are proposing  "
3743,1999-08-24," Mr Chairman, before we leave this subject, I think we owe Peter, the   New York Bank, and the staff here our gratitude and an enormous “thank you” for their   efforts on all of this Life is going to get messy; these likely will be extraordinary times   But this kind of extraordinary thinking and extraordinary planning really shows that the   Federal Reserve can operate not just in ordinary times but in extraordinary times My   confidence level in our ability to deal with all of these potential problems has gone up as a   result of this conversation, in large part due to you, Peter, and your associates  "
3744,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy in the   Philadelphia District continues to move up Manufacturing has advanced modestly Retail   sales and tourist activity have been strong Construction has increased Employment is on   an upward trend Conditions in the financial sector are so-so, with loan demand reported   flat Agriculture, because of the drought, is hurting, and some of the smaller banks that   service mostly farm communities almost surely will suffer as well later in the year and   going into next year Anecdotally, I am beginning to pick up a subtle shift in tone about   pricing power I have the sense that more business people feel a stronger need to raise   prices to protect financial performance, and they feel they may be able to make price   increases stick In part, this feeling reflects a view, whether accurate or not, that both   consumers and businesses are less inclined to shop for the lowest price or the best deal than   they have been I don’t want to make more out of this point than warranted; it’s just a subtle   change I don’t think it is a major shift nor is it a view held by a majority of business   people, but I just have not sensed it up until fairly recently   The national economy is clearly stretched The outlook both for growth and inflation,   however, remains unclear There is a reasonable case for a decelerating trend in demand   growth going forward, largely based on less of a kick from equity gains But we could be   fooled again On the inflation side, productivity gains may continue to hold down   inflationary pressures--and I suspect they will--but that may not happen either     8/24/99 55   On balance, the risk to the economy of raising the funds rate a notch is less than not   raising it A more important issue today is how we position ourselves going forward and   how we manage our rhetoric during the coming days and weeks, topics for later in the   meeting  "
3745,1999-08-24, I agree with your recommendation to raise the funds rate 25 basis   points and I strongly agree that we need a symmetric directive and that we ought to stay   with that  
3796,1999-10-05," I do, too   "
3797,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy for the Philadelphia   District continues to operate at high levels, with tight labor markets and benign inflation   Consumers are spending freely The market for homes is robust Recent increases in mortgage   rates have caused more homebuyers simply to shift to variable rate mortgages Commercial real   estate is also very active, with low vacancy rates for office buildings Some uptick in rents is   occurring, although given the amount of new building there is a consensus that the increases may   be short-lived Manufacturers report moderate growth, capacity appears adequate to handle the   increase in demand, and output prices are stable The labor market is especially tight for middle   and lower level workers and mixed for professional people For example, bank tellers are in short   supply but senior level banking people are available Accountants are in short supply but lawyers   are in ample supply [Laughter]    The stress in the health care industry is becoming widespread Hospitals   and medical schools are increasingly squeezed financially Physicians are more amenable to   unionization or dropping out of government insurance programs Patients are turning to politicians   more and more to seek relief from the “deny and delay” tactics of insurers The frustrations   associated with non-price rationing techniques are becoming more acute The Philadelphia area is   disproportionately dependent on the health care industry, and the fallout from health care stresses is   clearly negative for the regional economy     10/5/99 25   Turning to the national economy, incoming information points to a strong second half with   labor markets becoming even more stretched Yet inflation remains tame The longer this   favorable combination lasts, the more I consider faster productivity growth to be a more important   factor holding inflationary pressures down than the assortment of temporary factors Nonetheless,   there still is a large element of uncertainty about the outlook for productivity This kind of   uncertainty can be resolved only with time, tempered by policy actions motivated by an ongoing   assessment of where the balance of risks lies Against a background of continuing benign inflation,   two recent increases in the federal funds rate, and more edginess in financial markets, my   assessment is that the risks are sufficiently balanced to warrant a wait-and-see approach to policy   for now  "
3798,1999-10-05," I agree with the “B” option here Given the two moves we’ve taken and   balancing the supply side and the demand side uncertainties, I think “B” is right However, I   believe we could undo a lot of the good we’re going to do with a “B” decision by fooling around   with this asymmetry and symmetry issue at this meeting Our experience with announcing   asymmetrical directives has not worked very well It may work better in the future I’m hopeful   that Roger and his colleagues will come up with something that will make it work But a formal   asymmetric directive, when it is at best a confusing tool and at a time when we want to keep open   our options because of uncertainties about what’s going on in the economy, really is foolhardy I   feel very strongly that we ought not have a formal asymmetric directive because it will end up   doing more harm than good     10/5/99 60   I view the use of words as more promising, however, because words can help us lay out a   framework for our thinking about incoming information and policy We may very well want to   tighten in November, but we may not want to tighten So I don’t think we want to box ourselves in   by the language that we use, and an asymmetric directive runs a big risk of boxing us in Words, if   carefully chosen, can give the slant that we want without loading the dice And this is a time above   all when we want the markets to know that, yes, we may tighten, but we may not It is not a   foregone conclusion    Neither do I   SPEAKER(?) You don’t have to! [Laughter]    It’s hard to re-edit a statement 55 minutes before press time, but I think a   good way out of this is to drop the word “labor” in front of costs Labor costs are the biggest part   of costs, but I don’t think we need to single it out    That’s fine    Let’s quickly adjourn! [Laughter]    Why don’t we just toss these copies in the middle of the table and get fresh   ones?    Fix it up, Don!   "
3843,1999-11-16," Mr Chairman, if each of us sat down to write this statement, we   undoubtedly would come up with somewhat different language and somewhat different   emphases But, frankly, while we’d all do it a little differently, I think this is close enough that   we ought to accept it and move on to the next item on the agenda It’s not only the G-7 that has   trouble doing this If you’ve been around this Committee long enough, you know that we’ve   tried at times in our past to edit draft language as a Committee and I will tell you that the effort is   totally unproductive I believe our attitude should be that this largely has to be left to the   Chairman I do think we have to have something that is broadly acceptable, and in my view this   draft is in that broad area of acceptability and we ought to go with it    That’s the problem!    We shouldn’t have these drafts floating around I suppose we ought   to turn them back in    Thank you, Roger I think that you and your colleagues on this   Working Group have really done quite an extraordinary job to move us this far and you are to be   complimented My comments are intended within that overall framework   As for the two alternatives, I favor “I” The main reason is that the finger ought to be   a little further back from the trigger Risks sometimes materialize and sometimes they don’t   When we add the policy side to our assessment of the balance of risks, we’re really making a   two-step statement whereas a description of the balance of risks makes it a one-step statement   And it is easier to go from “I” to “II” if we want than to do the reverse So I come down for “I”   As for the proposed wording of paragraph 2 of the Authorization, as shown near the   top of page 4, I think the Chairman absolutely has to have the authority to move between   meetings in extraordinary circumstances I don’t think that’s debatable The world is not always   predictable and I think the Chairman simply has to have that authority It has been implicit in the   directive In fact, we got into this symmetry and asymmetry language partially for that reason-­  to try to fine-tune the extent of the authority that the Chairman has between meetings So if we   are going to make the adjustment and de-couple this from the directive itself, then I agree with   Cathy that we have to be clear about it and expressly state it I do have some concern about the   precise wording I think it ought to be the Committee authorizing the Chairman to direct the   Federal Reserve Bank of New York, etc, etc I don’t think we ought to be delegating authority   directly to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and putting the Chairman in a consultative   position But I agree with the basic premise that the Chairman has to have this authority; the   precise wording is another issue   I have just one more comment, which relates to the points of consensus, and I don’t   feel strongly about it Point two says that the FOMC’s vote at every meeting should encompass   both the intended federal funds rate and the symmetry or asymmetry And point three says the   operating paragraph no longer would contain any sentence referring to the Committee’s   consensus about symmetry or asymmetry As I read it, on the surface at least, that appears to be   an inconsistency But I don’t feel strongly about that issue    Virgil, if I had known it was your language, I would not have   questioned it [Laughter] But I’d still like to hear your explanation    I withdraw my suggestion on the words My main point is the   substantive issue that the Chairman needs such authority    Okay, that’s fine  "
3844,1999-11-16," The regional economy in the Philadelphia District continues to grow   Labor markets are tight, yet there are few signs of any upward trend in inflation despite rising   raw materials prices The outlook generally remains positive and there has been no basic change   in recent months One continues to hear stories about innovation, new ways of doing things that   improve productivity For example, the Internet is likely to have a major impact on the way   people buy all kinds of goods, from food to automobiles And while there are a number of   examples that I could cite, given the hour I’ll skip that But the bottom line is that existing   distribution networks are likely to become less expensive over time as a result of all of this   Turning to the national economy, demand remains strong Resources are stretched,   but productivity growth is also strong and inflation remains benign despite repeated predictions   to the contrary The traditional models have not held up and longer-term inflationary   expectations remain well anchored What does the future hold More of the same or a less   favorable mix?  Even if a less favorable mix emerges, it is likely to emerge slowly If more of   the same emerges, then we can continue to have the benefits of higher growth without higher   inflation Vigilance and patience have much to offer in this situation Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
3845,1999-11-16," I find going up 25 basis points and the symmetric directive   acceptable I think whether we move today or not is a close enough call that reasonable people   can differ, and the difference is so little that what one prefers and what one finds acceptable are   fairly close together I actually feel more strongly about the need for a symmetric directive We   have gone to extraordinary lengths to try to get through the year-end period and all this Y2K   business For us to have an asymmetric directive in the face of that would look as if the right   hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing I think we want to err on the side of calming   markets rather than exciting them, even if the risk of exciting them is very small So, I feel   strongly about the symmetric directive and I find the 25 basis points acceptable  "
3905,1999-12-21," Roger, I think you and your associates have done a first-rate job on   this and I support the majority recommendations To me the balance-of-risks approach is   the preferred course and, separately, I think the language laying out the Chairman’s   authority is much improved And if it’s on the table, Cathy Minehan’s editorial suggestions   also have merit, in my judgment  "
3906,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy in the   Philadelphia District continues to operate at high levels, with a general sense that the good   times will roll on Retail sales are robust throughout the District Some high-end car   dealers are having trouble getting deliveries, not because the manufacturers can’t produce   the cars but because there aren’t enough truckers and trucks to get the cars to the customer   Home sales are unusually brisk for December, in part, realtors say, because of the unusually   mild weather In commercial real estate, the demand for properties is strong, and I am   hearing reports here and there of some speculative building; it’s not a lot, but I haven’t   heard much about speculative building for a number of years Labor markets are very tight   We hear of some examples of large increases in compensation and special perks, but the   general pattern is still one of modest gains The report from bankers around the District is   that they believe that Y2K will be a non-event They have lots of cash in their vaults but   few customers requesting unusually large withdrawals   The national economy is clearly showing strong demand growth, with pressures   evident on the supply side even with outsized productivity gains, and still generally benign   inflation Some further increases in interest rates to temper demand growth are highly likely   as the new year unfolds Our primary objective during the coming weeks, however, is to get   into the new year with financial markets as settled as we can make them We have gone to a   lot of effort to do just that, and our decisions today should be consistent with those efforts  "
3907,1999-12-21, I prefer the symmetric directive  This is a meeting that in many   ways we didn’t need to have and I think the symmetric approach essentially reaffirms where   we are And it comes closest to having perceptions after the meeting stay exactly where   they were before the meeting  
3965,2000-03-21,  Thank you  [Applause]     So move   SPEAKER (?)  Second  
3966,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The regional economy in the   Philadelphia District continues to operate at high levels, with moderate growth and tight labor   markets but with few signs of accelerating inflation  There is a hint of possible slowing in the   housing area, but the rest of the regional economy, including retailing and manufacturing,   continues to exhibit strong demand  Although there are examples of outsized wage increases,   wage growth generally remains moderate  Only the cost of health care benefits is rising   noticeably faster  Productivity growth for the most part, however, is still holding down the cost   of production even with the higher benefit and energy costs              - 51 -     Turning to the nation, the story remains as it has been, very strong growth in demand   pressing on supply  There is little evidence to suggest a slowing in momentum  There is also   little evidence that core inflation is accelerating significantly  Nonetheless, in my judgment the   balance of risks is still clearly on the side of excess demand undermining the expansion  Some   further braking action from monetary policy is needed to help sustain growth, low inflation, and   job creation   "
3967,2000-03-21,"  I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for the reasons   you've outlined     I think it's an accurate statement of where the Committee is, Mr   Chairman   SPEAKER(?)  I agree with you  "
