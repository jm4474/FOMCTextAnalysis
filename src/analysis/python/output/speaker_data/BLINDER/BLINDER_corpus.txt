 I have one, Peter; it's sort of in two parts, but they are part of the same question Markets tend to latch on to things in faddish ways Something was almost implicit in what you said, and I want to see if you want to make it explicit--it's about the fad that dollar/yen dances to the US/Japan trade talks or events, that is, to monthly announcements of the trade figures or to the talks It was almost implicit in what you said that the market seems to be getting off that fad Did you mean to say that? And then the second part is related to the looming date, September 30th   Thank you   Mike, I have just a simple question about the news since the last Greenbook You mentioned that June and July payroll employment came in stronger than you expected Do you happen to recall what was built into the previous Greenbook for June and July?   July?   Including the 30,000 rise in the bias adjustment? If I'm not mistaken, the bias adjustment changed from Q2 to Q3   Say, more than 150,000 jobs or something?   Okay, thanks    8/16/94   Thanks   I'd like to pick two nits with the Greenbook One is a small nit, one is big as nits go, I guess [Laughter] Still, I think it is a nit in the sense that the basic outlook of the Greenbook, subject to a qualification I'll come to, seems about right The first, which really is a nit, has to do with inventories, especially retail inventories I think there is a hazard--although I'm somewhat reassured by some of the comments I heard around the table, especially from Cleveland--that the retail part of this inventory buildup is potentially dangerous Perhaps I overstated; this is a cause for concern not for panic I don't think it's going to snap back up in any huge way, but let me just read you two phrases that capture what I mean This one is from the Greenbook, page 4 and it says "there is no evidence of an inventory overhang at this time" This one is from the DRI report that came out about two days ago and it says "the sharp inventory accumulation of all goods in the second quarter creates an inventory overhang" It's not so much an illustration that one organization knows a lot more than the other, although I guess if I had to put all my chips on one table, I'd bet with Mike Prell over Roger Brinner It is meant to illustrate that reasonable people can look at these data and have different views If you decompose the inventory buildup over the last three months, March to June, 60 percent or so is at the retail level on the Board's adjusted current cost basis, which happens to be the way the handout reached me two days ago; I could have computed this another way as  -23-    8/16/94  well The number was $42 billion at an annual rate compared to an average in the three previous quarters of $14 billion, and the $42 billion is the biggest number in a long time When I see a number that big on quite weak sales growth--negative overall on retail sales over that period and 03 percent on average per month if you take out autos, which are a special case--and with the inventory/sales ratios creeping up not down, I'm a little less sanguine than the Greenbook about the amount of forward momentum in the very near term Now, as I said, it's not a very big deal I'm not talking about a qualitative change in outlook, only a quantitative change, but it is potentially in the negative direction  My much bigger nit to pick came in the second paragraph of the first page of the Greenbook where it says "labor and capital resources currently appear to be quite fully employed" I would have preferred to say "not quite fully employed, though close," I picked the words carefully, "not quite fully employed, surely close" We are unfortunately at one of those points in time where even though we know we don't know these things with precision and cannot fine-tune the economy, we have to make a decision on that because we are very close to capacity; there is very little doubt about that It matters, in this context, whether you are close on the down side or close on the up side, even though it is hard to tell the difference The view in the Greenbook--"quite fully employed"--colors a lot of what comes next It is reflected in particular in the NAIRU estimate, which in the Greenbook forecast is implicitly, on the new measure, 63 or 62 percent, something like that You could subtract 2 percent for the change in measurement, which is the Board staff's current estimate of this very elusive number and a number that keeps on shrinking You will remember the BLS thought it would be 6 percent back in January I think reasonable people couldn't rule out zero at this point, but 2 percent seems a reasonable estimate right now based on what we know If you take that 2 percent off, to convert to the old basis, which is not only the way I think but the way the econometric evidence speaks, that translates to an old basis NAIRU of 61 or 60 percent implicit in the Greenbook forecast To me, that is at the high end of the reasonable range I don't want to say it is an unreasonable estimate; it is a reasonable estimate but definitely at the high end My reading of the evidence is that a better estimate of the NAIRU on the old basis would be something closer to 56, 57, 58 percent I repeat again, these kinds of discrepancies only matter when you are really close to the NAIRU A year and a half ago, it didn't much matter which of those numbers you thought was more accurate I'd just like to say I don't think 63 percent unemployment should be the FOMC's aspiration level I have a strong feeling that we ought to be shooting for a lower unemployment rate than that We had a lower unemployment rate than that for the last three months, not incidentally As I said, this colors what is in the Greenbook because, commensurately with that, the average growth rate over the next five quarters, that is the last quarter of this year and all of 1995, is between 21 and 22 percent in the Greenbook forecast--which, again, I would have thought is slower than we would really like to produce It is not slow if you think we actually have had a small overshoot and we need to nudge the economy back down, because 21 or 22 percent is a nice small amount lower than, say, 2-1/2 percent which would nudge the economy down a little My feeling is that that is not quite the appropriate policy given where I think the NAIRU is  -24-    8/16/94  However, while in some sense this is a "fundamental" difference, I characterized it as a big nit  The Greenbook forecast is not at all unreasonable given the staff assumptions about monetary policy from here to January, that is, another 100 basis points on the funds rate built into the forecast I looked at what the econometric models, the Board's and others, say about what 100 basis points are good for, given the normal historic reaction of long rates to short rates Now, as I think Mike mentioned, with the first 125 basis points we had much more than the normal reaction of long rates to short rates I think all of us hope, and at least most of us believe, that we have a good chance in the next ratcheting up of short rates to get less than the normal reaction But just taking the normal historical reaction, 100 basis points of further tightening on fed funds would, after about a year, knock 7 percent off of GDP, and after two years about 1-1/3 percent So on growth rates, something in the range of 6 to 7 per year for the next two years would be taken out by that amount of tightening If you add that back in to 21, you're playing with a number that looks like 27 or 28 percent on current policy, and that seems quite reasonable So, I think the staff forecast is consistent with the policy that is built in, which I've already indicated I think produces growth that is too slow I was going to say too slow for my taste, but I should say too slow for the economy's best interests I think-- and I'm taking this more from the Greenbook of six weeks ago, where if I remember it was quite explicit while it was more implicit in this Greenbook--that this comes from a very literal, for my taste too literal, interpretation of not wanting to let inflation accelerate We don't want to let inflation accelerate That doesn't necessarily mean we have to stand against a 10 or 20 basis point increase in inflation, especially given the unwinding of a variety of factors including the speed effect that Mike mentioned If you look at the core CPI numbers in this Greenbook, it is 31 percent in 1993--this is fourth-to-fourth--31 percent in 1994, and 31 percent in 1995 It is a quite literal holding of the line exactly where we are, and the staff estimate is that it would take about 100 basis points more on the fed funds rate to do that I don't think we have to interpret this quite as literally as all that, and this is a reason that I think we should be aspiring to a bit higher growth than is in the Greenbook Thank you, Mr Chairman   I'm also supportive of the package that you outlined I just want to take two minutes to emphasize that it really is a package If we are going to make this kind of policy credible, it has to be with a symmetric directive It has to be with a statement that indicates as clearly as we can state within the limits of Fedspeak that our oars are out of the water That does not mean that we have thrown the oars overboard; we still have the oars, [Laughter] but we have pulled them out of the water I think that was implicit in what the Chairman said, and I think it is important So I wanted to emphasize it I think, as he did, that the choice comes down to zero or 50 basis points for the reasons that everybody has now indicated The crucial thing for us, one of the reasons I eliminated 25 basis points, is that that is likely to engender the belief that we are starting up a staircase--not just another shoe to drop, but maybe Imelda Marcos' closet [Laughter] By the same token if we move 50 basis points, it is crucial--that is why I come back to a statement-- not to engender a belief that we are starting up a shorter staircase  -33-    8/16/94  but one with risers of 50 basis points Like the Chairman, I think there is at least a fighting chance that 50 basis points would be enough So with such a strong statement, I not only support but support enthusiastically the suggestion of the Chairman Without it, I would not   I have just one, Peter You mentioned the potential responsiveness of dollar/yen to rhetoric as much as to what happens on September 30th; whose rhetoric? Let's take it as axiomatic that it won't be Lloyd Bentsen's   Not Congresspersons?   I have a couple   I have a couple of questions for Mike I should have asked these yesterday at the Board briefing but I forgot The first question is not meant to be a joke, but has to do with the employment report that's coming out at the beginning of next month and the baseball strike What are you expecting the baseball strike to do to that number? What do you project that number to be?   Working in the strike?   It's not the players that were--   I raise it because there was a lot of talk in the summer that the World Cup was adding to employment I said to myself baseball's got to be bigger than the World Cup--in America, anyway   Okay The second question has to do with Okun's Law and the 2-year projection From the end of 1994 to the end of 1996 you have in the Greenbook forecast roughly a 2 percent real GDP growth If potential is growing at 2-1/2 percent, that suggests a gap of a percentage point which suggests to me a rise in the unemployment rate conditioned on that forecast of about 1/2 percentage point You seem only to have about a 1/4 percentage point rise I was just wondering about that   From now   Okay, thank you   That's almost enough to square the circle right there   Thanks   Let the transcript be amended!   I have only a few points to make and since probably half the people around the table are as hungry as I am, I will make them quickly I wasn't planning to say anything about the trade negotiations; but since it was brought up, and lest silence be construed as assent, let me just say that I disagree 99-1/2 percent with what my colleague, Governor Lindsey, said in his assessment of what's likely--   I think 1/2 percent is on track, and I'll leave it at tha  On the forecast, largely for reasons having to do with inventories, which I brought up at the last FOMC meeting and certainly with the staff, I would look for the third quarter to be weaker than in the Greenbook By pure arithmetic, some of that difference is going to show up in a stronger fourth quarter So, this is not a major disagreement But, on balance, it leads me to a somewhat weaker second half of 1994 than the Greenbook forecast Conversely, I'd expect a bit stronger first half of 1995 than the Greenbook Note that the projected further tightenings of monetary policy built into the Greenbook forecast could not possibly be slowing down the economy in the first half of 1995 So, whatever is in the staff forecast for the first half of next year has to have been built in by the previous tightenings I don't think we have tightened enough to slow the economy down to 18 percent in the first half of next year Accordingly, I'd expect the first half of 1995 to be a bit stronger than in the Greenbook But over the next year there may not be much difference between the way I see things evolving and the way the Greenbook sees things evolving in total Now, for the eight quarters in 1995 and 1996, the average growth rate in the Greenbook is about 2  -31-    9/27/94  percent I don't find that to be a very satisfactory target If we have not yet overshot capacity, and I don't believe we have although one can't dismiss that hypothesis completely, the economy does not need to grow at 2 percent for two years in order to keep inflation from rising If we have already overshot, then indeed we do need something like that  Regarding inflationary pressures, I think we should realize, maybe more than we do, how concentrated the industrial pressures are in the United States right now There are lots of stories coming out of the manufacturing core of the economy about tight markets, very strong capacity utilization, strong order books, good sales, etc They are all true But they are very much concentrated in durables manufacturing, which in round numbers is 10 to 12 percent of value added in the US economy If you look at the demand side rather than the production side and look back at the last year, we have had buoyant growth over the year, which has scared a lot of people The four quarters ending in the second quarter of 1994 had a growth rate of 4 percent It's the only time that we have had a four-quarter period with growth as high as 4 percent in this entire business recovery In previous business recoveries, one four-quarter period of 4 percent would not have scared anybody and, indeed, would have left the FOMC thinking that things weren't looking that great  More important than the 4 percent, I want to call attention to the fact that that growth was highly concentrated I looked at these numbers last night I knew the qualitative story, but I was surprised at the quantitative dimension We all know where it was concentrated--in business fixed investment, consumer durables, and housing Those three sectors account for roughly 1/4 of GDP on the spending side I'm not talking about value added weights because a lot of that is imports, which is a point I'm coming to Those three sectors of the GDP over the last four quarters registered an 113 percent rate of growth This means by the laws of arithmetic that the rest of the economy, the other 75 percent, registered a 16 percent growth rate over that period Those three sectors, of course, leaving aside housing for now, are where the price pressures are--either current or incipient If you looked at the Greenbook forecast for the next two quarters and took housing out of the fast-growing sector, the result would be even more extreme We don't expect housing to be part of the fast-growing sector going forward; the staff doesn't; none of us do But, leaving housing in the fast-growing sector, those three sectors in the Greenbook forecast are projected in the second half of this year to grow at a 6 percent rate and the rest of the economy at a 18 percent rate If I moved housing over the sectoral line, that spread would be exaggerated because we are expecting a slowdown in housing  Regarding the point that I was making about inflationary pressures, many people in popular discussions point to international capacity as a safety valve on US inflation This is greatly exaggerated because roughly 90 percent of what we consume or use is produced at home The place where it has the most validity, however, is exactly where the pressures are right now--in business fixed investment, where over 40 percent is imported, and consumer durables where I don't remember the fraction that is imported Those are precisely the sectors where we are seeing pressure It is in this  -32-    9/27/94  very limited part of the economy where the international safety valve is most important  Finally, I want to align myself fully with the comments Jerry Jordan made earlier I have been worried for some time, and I am becoming increasingly worried, about the disjuncture between the Main Street view of inflation and the Wall Street view of inflation I just want to point out an implication None of us is sure this disjuncture is actually a fact; I suspect it is, as Jerry does, but it is hard to know for sure If it is a fact, the implication is that real interest rates look a lot higher on Main Street than they do on Wall Street, and we should be mindful of that If that hypothesis is correct, that's likely to mean that there is more punch in what we have already done than we realize Thank you   We each have one, Mr Chairman! [Laughter]   I'd also like to support your recommendation and just say a few things I do take seriously the fact that we, so to speak, gave our marker in August, and we should only be willing to take that marker back if the evidence was overwhelming that we couldn't wait I think the evidence is not close to overwhelming The first sentence of the second paragraph of the Greenbook said "the largest effects of the interest rate increases to date may yet lie ahead, but whether they will prove sufficient to prevent a buildup of inflationary pressures is unclear at this juncture" I think that is exactly right; I agree with that 100 percent That says to me that "B" asymmetric is the right policy We have to remember that most of this restraint is probably still in train and the price effects will come even later I want to be clear--the reason that I support the  -40-    9/27/94  asymmetry is not that I think there is a strong presumption that we are going to have to move between meetings We might; but as Bill just said, the probability that we're going to reduce interest rates before the next meeting is zero The probability that we are going to tighten is certainly not zero, and that for me makes it sensible to have an asymmetric directive   We don't have to exercise it   Mike, I want to ask you a question about the projection for the automobile market, which in the Greenbook is peaking this quarter at about 15-1/2 million light vehicles--cars and trucks--and then declining very modestly, almost trivially In the Greenbook, short-term interest rates are up 150 basis points more In addition, it is been a notable feature of this episode, I think, that auto loan rates have gone up only about half--or less--as much as market rates The first part of the question has to do with what this implies about the future of auto loan rates and for the responsiveness of purchases to auto loan rates Furthermore, as I look at the real disposable income forecast, it is also peaking this quarter Then, in the first three quarters of 1995, while the auto industry is barely showing a dent in sales, real disposable income growth rates are going to 22, 09, and 17 percent The question is how do you square that circle? What's going on with autos in this forecast?   That's the question; why is it in the middle!   Until about three minutes ago I thought that, even though I was speaking last, I would have some things to say that had not been said before But that is less true now than it was a few minutes ago Let me start at the point where Janet Yellen left off I thought it was a remarkable feature of the Greenbook projections that we could put in another 150 basis points of tightening at the short end and get almost nothing--10 basis points or something like that--at the long end Now, that is not impossible; nobody can rule that out But given the history of 1994, I think it takes a certain amount of guts to project that I commend the staff for having that much guts; it is more than I have I'm not as worried about the 35-year old bond traders that Bill is worried about as I am about the 25-year old bond traders who will be on it very quickly Furthermore, if in fact long rates don't move at all, we won't get a lot of  -31-    11/15/94  tightening out of this additional 150 basis points I don't doubt that GDP, sales, etc, are growing briskly and that the level of resource utilization, including labor utilization, is pretty near and maybe right at or even a little beyond capacity I also don't doubt that growth in the second half of 1994 now looks higher than we thought in August and certainly higher than we thought in July So I'm persuaded that there is a strong likelihood of a small overshoot-- we may indeed already have had a small overshoot--and that probably some more monetary tightening is indicated Nevertheless, as we whip ourselves up into a frenzy here, I think we should remember a few things The first is that the staff's 41 percent forecast for the current quarter is well above the consensus, as Mike mentioned Now it is true, as Mike also mentioned, that the early indications for this quarter are quite strong, but let's also remember that, as we sit here now, we know very little about October and nothing at all about November and December Also, there are, as Jerry Jordan and Janet Yellen mentioned, a few, small contra-indications--no indication that the economy is about to slump, absolutely not--but a few contra- indications  Much more important than the next quarter is the longer-term outlook, and that is what I really want to focus on I am thinking about, roughly speaking, the broad picture of the economy and monetary policy over a four-year period comprised of the last two years and the next two years As Janet mentioned a few minutes ago--and as Ed Boehne and Bob Forrestal mentioned earlier--there is a sharp tail-off in the Greenbook forecast between now and the second or third quarters of 1995 The real GDP growth numbers starting with the current quarter are 41, 25, 14, and 10 percent Given the lags, that does not have anything to do with any subsequent tightenings from here forward Therefore, it can come from only three places It could be factors having nothing to do with monetary policy, and that's possible But I think we have all agreed that there is considerable forward momentum in this economy and, if anything is slowing it down, it is monetary policy I think that's a very strong consensus around this table; and I share it The second candidate is, of course, the 175 basis point increase that we have already put into the system and the huge run-up in long-term rates that has come along with that Thirdly, something that has barely been mentioned up to now, though I guess Janet Yellen touched on it, is the wearing off of the monetary ease that the FOMC put into the system ending in September 1992 It was a very substantial dose of monetary ease That factor is virtually ignored in all public discussions and in most of the discussions inside the FOMC to date But everything we know about the effects of monetary policy says that monetary ease put into the system in strong doses in 1991 and 1992 should have its maximum effects on real GDP growth in 1993 and 1994--and now come the important words-- and then wither away You do not permanently raise the level of GDP by putting the economy on a monetary high We push it up a hill and then it comes down of its own accord I don't think there is much dispute about that  Now, there is a lot of dispute about the numbers I had the staff run its econometric model of the economy, the MPS model, to try to quantify that Nobody has to believe these numbers, but I don't know where else to get numbers other than trying to put this policy through an econometric model According to our staff model, the impact of all the changes in monetary policy from mid-1990 to date,  -32-    11/15/94  including the easings from mid-1990 to September 1992, the subsequent period when short-term interest rates were held constant, and then the tightening this year up to now should have done the following to GDP added about 7 percentage point to the 1992 growth rate; about 1-1/4 percentage points to the 1993 growth rate; almost 1-1/2 percentage points to the 1994 growth rate; about 3/4 percentage point to the 1995 growth rate coming down the hill; and 0--coincidentally it happens to be 0--to the 1996 growth rate What I want to focus your attention on is the estimate of the swing in the monetary impulse on the growth of demand from 1994 to 1996 of about 1-1/2 percentage points  The same model says that, if we follow the Greenbook's recommended increase in the next few months of another 150 basis points in the funds rate--and by the way, if long rates respond as they historically do and not by next to nothing--then we will chip a tiny bit off the 1995 growth rate--a very, very small amount--and about a percentage point off the 1996 growth rate If we add those two together, we are talking about a swing from monetary policy from both the end of the expansionary stimulus and the move to contraction of about 2-1/2 percentage points, from about plus 1-1/2 percent in 1994 to about minus 1 percent in 1996 That's a big number I think that with all the focus on the upside risks, which are certainly greater right now--I don't by any means see imminent risks that this economy is about to head downhill--we should remember that we are in this business for longer than a quarter and longer than a year And as we go out a couple of years into the future, there is a substantial downside risk At some point, all these higher interest rates are going to hurt autos more, I think, than is indicated in the staff forecast They are going to hurt housing; that might be right around the corner Who knows? I believe they are going to put a damper on business fixed investment, which is growing strongly throughout this Greenbook forecast  One last comment about stopping momentum There is forward momentum in this economy It is not going to be stopped by putting a rock in the road I don't dispute that at all I just want to close by putting some perspective on what a 325 basis point increase in fed funds within a year means--that's 175 to date and, if we do another 150 by February, that will make 325 basis points in a year Only once since 1984 has the Federal Reserve tightened by this much within a year That period, which has been discussed around this table a couple of times, was between March 1988 and February 1989 while the economy was in the midst of quite a large overshoot of capacity If you look at the previous 30 years, and leave out the very exciting episodes between 1979 and 1982 when 325 basis points in the funds rate was hardly worth talking about--there were many moves of 325 basis points in that period--there are only two other episodes in the previous 30 years from 1954 to 1984 One was in 1969 and the other was in 1972-73, both with inflation rising considerably As a result, the real federal funds rate rose considerably less than 325 basis points But here we are talking about the vast majority of the projected 325 basis points being on the real rate The moral of the story to me is that a 325 basis point swing, which is being contemplated here, is not trivial; it is very strong medicine It is enough to stop an economy with considerable momentum, although there is also an amount of momentum that even 325 basis points would be insufficient to stop It is therefore not to be prescribed lightly  -33-    11/15/94   I think all of us have experienced the following You go into a hotel room and the room is too cold You turn the thermostat up a notch You go in the shower When you come out, it is still a little too cold You turn the thermostat up another notch You then go to sleep, but wake up at 230 in the morning in a sweat in your bed The classic mistake of monetary policy--and I am not talking only about the United States and I am not even talking only about the postwar period--is overdoing it Overdoing it in either direction The classic reason for this error, though not the only reason, is impatience in waiting for the lagged  -41-    11/15/94  effects of what already has been done It is very, very frustrating to wait just as it is difficult to keep our fingers off that thermostat when we are still cold  Furthermore, one thing we know about the hazards of fine- tuning is that we really can't do fine-tuning That means that when we are close to target we should be very wary of oversteering I think that with 3 percent inflation and the economy right about at capacity we are in an awfully good position, and so we should be extremely wary about oversteering I fear that doing 75 today rather than 50 may send us down an oversteering path I want to be clear--it is not that I think a total of 75 more is going to clobber the economy into the ground But it provides the setting and the jumping off point for where we go from here  On strict macroeconomics grounds, a difference of 25 basis points today--between doing 50 and 75--is no big deal You can barely detect it The issue to me is the signal we send--the signal we send to the markets, the signal we send to people running businesses, who are thinking about their sales and therefore their inventories for the near-term future, and the signal we send to consumers about their expected near-term incomes And this, as you know Mr Chairman, is where I differ from your assessment  I think the signal we send out by doing 75 today, although I can see that we are going to do 75 today, is that the Federal Reserve is more scared about inflation than the people out there thought we were yesterday, and that the Federal Reserve signs on to the Wall Street indictment that we are behind the curve That will be correct because the FOMC does sign on to that view Thirdly, we will signal that there is much more to come I do not believe the market expectation after tomorrow will be only 75 more I don't believe that for a minute I believe Wayne Angell's 775 percent federal funds rate will be raised, not lowered, as a result of what we do today Finally, I think it sends a signal that I find very unfortunate that we can be led around by the markets I don't want to send any of those signals I'd rather follow the Kelley strategy A confident, patient--stately did you say, Mike?   Elegant, that is, moving with thought and planning in increments of, say, 50 as necessary and as a central bank that is not behind the curve, that is not panicked by an inflation which is likely to tick up 1/4 point or 1/2 point or something like that, but as a central bank that is willing to prescribe moderately strong doses at intervals if the need is there I think Don described it in his opening statement as taking a reasonably routine step and then waiting to see what happens  I am worried for a number of reasons, as Ed Boehne is, about the signal that 75 sends Don mentioned--I just want to underscore this--that the Greenspan Fed has never once moved the fed funds rate by 75 basis points in either direction Not once When this Fed has erred, it has been on the side of caution When I was on the outside as a citizen, I always thought that was good idea I would rather see my Federal Reserve err on the cautious side in either direction, and now that I am on the inside, I still think the same This Federal  -42-    11/15/94  Reserve, under our current Chairman's leadership, has only once changed the discount rate by an amount greater than 50 basis points This will be the first 75 The 75 now will make it--   No, the discount rate There was a 100 basis point change in the discount rate   A 75 basis point increase now will add up to 175 basis points within a 6-month period, if you go back and add the other 50s Since 1984, tightening has proceeded that quickly only once--in the period that I mentioned earlier between March 1988 and February 1989 There are several 6-month periods you can find within that period to get that pace of tightening  Fourthly, I think this will be like feeding red meat to the bond market lions They will chew it up and they will ask for more A Federal Reserve that did 25, 25, 25, 50, 50, 75 does not look to an outside observer like it is about to stop I think we will create what are already strong expectations that we are not about to stop We will create, rather than diminish, expectations of more near-term tightening to come--with the potential that has for markets, especially the stock market That's at the top of my worries about the surprise that will be created  My personal preference is strongly for 50, for reasons similar to those Ed Boehne mentioned The difference, of course, is that I have to vote I thought hard about whether I should dissent on this matter, and I did not decide until last night I finally decided that I won't, but I want to say why because it leads to a conclusion I won't dissent because, as I said, the macroeconomic difference of doing another 25 basis points today is really quite small Secondly, nobody really knows about market psychology I don't pretend that I know I said what I believe will happen--that this will be received adversely--but I certainly could be wrong Finally, I think it is better to show a united Federal Reserve against the criticism that we are surely going to get for this move But I just want to say right now that unless we receive some really surprising news between now and December 20th, I am not going to be prepared to go further on December 20th   I'd like to ask a question of Mike that keys off of where he finished with Jerry Jordan Yesterday in the briefing, Governor Yellen asked Mike a question about the difference in the forecasts attributable to the tightenings that are embedded in the Greenbook forecast but not yet acted upon by the FOMC She cited some numbers generated by the staff model Mike, you indicated that you didn't really accept those numbers I'd like to know--it is germane to the question that was just asked--what would be the forecast at a constant funds rate or the difference in the forecast between a constant funds rate path and the funds rate path embedded in the staff forecast?   Right    12/20/94   I wasn't pushing a constant-funds-rate policy; I was just asking what the effects of that policy were, particularly on the real growth rate and on the inflation rate On a fourth-to- fourth quarter basis, your forecast has real GDP growth decelerating from 41 percent in 1994, to 19 percent in 1995, and then to 18 percent in 1996 If you accepted what was in the the staff model and you backed out the effects of the coming tightening, that 19 percent and 18 percent would change to 21 percent and 25 percent Now, to my way of thinking about the marginal effect of new policy with respect to timing, wouldn't you expect the inflation effects to be zilch in 1995, pretty mild in 1996, and in fact mostly having an impact in 1997? I am talking about additional policy changes, not about the tightenings we have banked already   Sure I'm only talking about the derivative   I was not questioning any of that; you misinterpreted the question; it is only about the marginal effects of policy If we have passed through the NAIRU, which seems reasonably likely, exactly what you said ought to be happening But the marginal effect on inflation of policy tightening from today forward, to my way of thinking, ought not to be on this Greenbook page That is really the question Or do you agree with that?  -6-    12/20/94   Okay   The first 35 minutes   I take the longer view, an hour or so!   No!   I think the wall was extremely successful I'm not going to breach it I'm also going to be very brief since, coming almost at the end, almost everything that I might have said--and its opposite--has already been said! [Laughter]  Let me take a few minutes to defend the conventionality of the Greenbook forecast against some of the objections that were raised Although, as a small footnote, in thinking ahead about my Humphrey-Hawkins forecast in February, my inclination would have been to be a little higher on near-term growth--1995 growth--and maybe a little higher on inflation But these are small differences I want to defend the Greenbook both in the particulars, the kind of outlook that it is pushing--a rapid deceleration of growth and a small increase in inflation--and also on the basic methodology of being conventional I think there is a lot to be said for, and very little on the other side, the staff of the central bank to be extremely  -27-    12/20/94  conventional in its methodology and not buy on to hypotheses that have very little empirical support, although 10 years later that might look like a good idea Usually it doesn't, but it might Speaking as a citizen and as a central banker, I'm glad to see the staff sticking to the tried and at least not falsified methods! [Laughter]  I agree with the Greenbook outlook that we probably have pushed a bit past the NAIRU There is a probability distribution around this, of course, but the best guess is that the economy probably has pushed a little past the NAIRU, or noninflationary capacity I also agree that it is quite reasonable to expect a very considerable deceleration of growth in 1995 under current policy and then a tiny bit more in 1996 if there is no further tightening One of the reasons--Susan Phillips and several people have mentioned it-- is something that is too easy to forget the lagged effects of the stimulative monetary policy that only ended in February 1994, and only very slightly at that It is even easier to forget the stimulative effect of the bond market rally that peaked in price, troughed in yield, only in October 1993 Everything we know about lags in interest rates says that those two things--the previous Fed stance and the bond market rally attributable to whatever you want to attribute it to--should be powering the economy in 1994 I think the main reason behind the standard forecasts' underestimates of 1994 was an unwillingness to believe in interest rate effects It is the same kind of thing that is happening now; everyone is looking around and asking where it is, not believing, and then all of a sudden it is there This has happened many, many times in the past, and I have no doubt that it will happen in the future And it probably is happening right now This is a second reason to expect a considerable deceleration We first of all have the petering out of the previous expansionary effects of interest rates and, second, just the beginning of the early stages of the kicking in of the contractionary phase of monetary policy As I think Mike indicated in answer to some question, you should just now be beginning to see the effects of the Fed's tightening in 1994 It is very hard at this point to see it in the tea leaves, but history suggests that it is right around the corner So those are two fundamentals leading me to think we should have a sharp deceleration in 1995--the wearing off of the previous expansion and the kicking in of the tightening  Finally, there is the inventory swing I think the staff outlook--I was about to say it is exactly right, but nobody can get it exactly right Nobody knows the timing of this, but it is an awfully good bet that between the fourth quarter of 1994 and the fourth quarter of 1995, the inventory swing alone will take something between 1/2 and a full percentage point off the growth rate It would be quite surprising if that didn't happen So all that points to a considerable slowdown in the economy even if there is no more tightening of monetary policy, and somewhat more if there is That is as close to the fence as I'm going to come right now  Let me just take two minutes on inflation Many people are surprised, and several people have remarked around this table, about the modest rate of inflation given the rapid economic growth I want to say two things about that First, this is not quite as surprising as people seem to think If we have overshot capacity, as Mike said, we have overshot very, very recently and by very, very modest amounts And there are long lags It would be surprising indeed if we already  -28-    12/20/94  saw a sharp increase in inflation from that Simple evidence, which says the same thing in a different way, is that the conventional Phillips curves are fitting this episode extraordinarily well They have very small residuals So, if there is a new economy due to greater openness, a traumatized labor force, or whatever--all these things are possible--the evidence for that is really not in the data And so I think the staff is wise to stay clear of it That is, it would be imprudent for us as central bankers to presume we are in a new, substantially less inflationary world On the other hand, the recent news is good To the extent that the errors are coming in not quite zero, they are coming in favorably And while we would be imprudent to jump hastily to a conclusion that we are in a new world, we would be foolish to ignore the evidence as it comes in And the Greenbook doesn't ignore it They have written down the inflation forecast a bit in reaction to the recent data I think that is about the right way to deal with it  Finally, a last remark about inflation and in defense of the staff Standard econometric estimates would say that a 1 percent overshoot--1 percent as measured by the unemployment rate for an entire year--would add about 1/2 percent to the inflation rate Now, it is correct that nobody should take these numbers as equivalent to the gravitational constant in physics--never mind Einsteinian amendments to that We don't know these numbers nearly that well On the other hand, there is no particular reason to think that it is too low rather than too high It is the best guess, and even if you want to view that 05 percent effect as saying 05 plus or minus 2 percentage points, which I think would be very much an exaggeration of the errors, 05 is still as good a guess as you can make--except that, if anything, the incoming evidence seems to be pointing to a little less of an inflationary impact, not a little more, as I said a minute ago So, the evidence is not overwhelming But, if anything, it would shade you toward less of an inflationary acceleration, not more So, there, I have defended you!   Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree that this is a good time for waiting It was only 35 days ago that we raised the fed funds rate by what was essentially a record amount The August interest rate increase was only three months before that, and by all historical standards ought not to be showing in the data as yet That is to say, 125 of the 250 basis points of tightening that we have done up to now could not possibly be in the data at this point I think if we were to move now it would imply some sense of alarm on our part, some sense of urgency that things were going badly wrong And like you, I don't think things are going badly wrong Things are looking pretty good Even the next FOMC meeting comes just 11 weeks after the November 15 action, that is, less than a quarter What is magic about a quarter? It is, of course, the magic number for a macro economist who tends to look at the economy every quarter It is a shame there wasn't more spacing in there, but that is the way the FOMC calendar falls So, I think you are almost surely right that it is wise to wait until the next FOMC meeting unless something fairly startling happens In that regard, I would prefer a symmetric directive I don't feel strongly enough about this to make a big deal of it, but I have a predisposition to wait until the next FOMC meeting for a number of reasons I wasn't persuaded by Bill's argument that if these data that he mentioned come in strongly that we might not wish to wait what  -34-    12/20/94  basically amounts to only two more weeks If the Greenbook forecast without the additional tightening is, say, 21 percent real growth in 1995, which we were discussing before, it is not so obvious that we ought to take action to push it down lower than that As I said before, I suspect that the projection might be a little on the low side; that without more tightening growth in 1995 might be higher than that; and indeed that more tightening might be necessary I for one have an open mind about future increases in short rates  Finally, I won't repeat my thermostat speech of the last time, but I always keep in mind that the classic mistake of central banks in almost all times and almost all countries is to overstay either their tightening or their easing   I want to make a comment on Bob Parry's point and then pose a question On Bob's point and the answers to it, isn't it relevant that over the last three months, six months, nine months, twelve months--pick your timeframe; it almost doesn't matter--surveys of inflationary expectations in the United States have shown no deterioration and long bonds here are trading at lower interest rates,  -12-    3/28/95  not higher interest rates? Those two things would seem to me largely persuasive--although none of this is definitive with regard to the state of long-term inflationary expectations absent an index bond, for which all of us here at the Federal Reserve have been rooting for a long time But it is about the best information that we have, and it seems to me that it speaks with one voice on the extent to which the market expects the Federal Reserve to monetize deficits I think--I guess the opposite of "ahistorical" is "historical"--that is also an historical observation because the Federal Reserve has not been monetizing deficits Whether one has rational or adaptive expectations, I think it is sensible not to presume that the Federal Reserve is going to monetize deficits And I don't believe the markets believe that the Federal Reserve is going to monetize them Do either of you disagree with that, Ted or Peter?   Now the question I was going to pose Peter, I thought you said--correct me if I just misheard what you were reading --that the short end led interest rates down since the last FOMC meeting Did you say that?   I am reading the Greenbook table--   Okay Fine I have no question in that case   I did have a question, but I am again picking up on Bob Parry, especially on the answer to his question  SPEAKER(?) Picking on him or picking up on him?   No, picking up on him--definitely not picking on him Inspired by him Mike, referring to your answer to Bob, I was reading the quarterly Greenbook numbers on the capacity utilization rate They peak at 851 and they go down every single quarter through 1996 Q4, at that point reaching 829 I can't imagine, though I thought I heard you say "yes" in your answer to Bob, that if this page were another two inches wide and we saw the numbers for 1997 on it, that the utilization rate would abruptly turn back up Again, I am reading this just the way you stated it, Mike, with the economy gradually going back to its natural growth rate, which does not lead to ever accelerating inflation   You already have 58 percent unemployment and 829 capacity utilization by the end of 1996   Okay  -19-    3/28/95   That was my point   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman, I will be quite brief The scenario sketched in the Greenbook looks reasonable to me both in broad outline and in most particulars A definition of a reasonable forecast is that there should be risks on both sides, and they should be reasonably close to balanced I think this one is, but I would shade the risks slightly higher on the down side Let me tell you why I could list 12 upside and 15 downside risks, but I'll list only two on each side because I said I would be brief, and the other 13 are already covered [Laughter] On the up side, I would mention net export performance being better than thought, with or without further depreciation of the dollar, and even more so if there is further depreciation of the dollar--although on that issue I am a random walker, exactly as Govenor Yellen is The second one I would mention, and it has been mentioned several times, is that this could indeed be a false negative as we have had several times I can remember, prominently, developments last summer when the economy started to emit a little feel of a slowdown But the data that we have had in the last two months, I think, are quite different from the two months' worth of data that we had last summer It is more pervasive I think it is much less likely that this is a false negative than some of these other episodes that we have seen   You want to get all the signs? I think it is less likely that this is a false negative That was two negatives; I think I got three in the first go-around On the down side, it seems my role in this FOMC meeting is to keep echoing what Bob Parry said I agree very much with Bob's analysis As I look at the pieces of the Greenbook forecast, it is easier to tell stories component-by- component--consumer spending, business fixed investment, inventories, etc--coming in lower rather than higher Of these, I think I would put inventories on the top of the list But these are hunches, after all, and I have no major bone to pick with the Greenbook on any of those details  Much more important than that is the fact--and it really is a fact--that forecasts tend to understate swings whenever they occur It doesn't matter which direction; they do it Forecast revisions are serially correlated; that is a statistical fact There are several reasons for that I think it has to do with underestimation of multiplier/accelerator interactions I think it also has to do with people always saying, "yes there are lags, yes, there are lags," but not really internalizing it in their thinking--at least not in a reasonably numerical way And we all have this tendency to look out the window and see how things are and generalize from that So  -37-    3/28/95  changes are always underestimated To me, that is the major factor suggesting there is a downside risk  The other thing I would say, which is striking to me, is the conjunction--as Governor Yellen mentioned--between what I like to call the fundamentals and the tea leaves The fundamentals--models, etc-- tell us that the monetary tightening should be just about hitting the economy late in 1994 and into early 1995 That is exactly when we start seeing the slowdown--almost too good to be true! We have no right to think that these models are that good on timing Nonetheless, there are the fundamentals, and there are the tea leaves coming in right on schedule--which gives me a lot more confidence than I would have in either one in the absence of the other At the same time, I think there are very few signs of real deterioration in the economy When I say a downside risk, I do not mean a recession risk; it does not look that way at all The data really say to me that we have a chance of achieving this soft landing But I just want to remind everybody that the reason soft landings are rarely achieved has to do with what I was saying a moment ago about the downside risks People understate swings, forget about lags, and underestimate multiplier/accelerator models That is why we hardly ever achieve soft landings  In sum, I can hardly imagine circumstances--echoing now both Ed Boehne and Janet Yellen--that argue more strongly that this is a good time to wait and see if this negative really is a true negative, as I guess it is At this point it is only a guess Thank you   Mr Chairman, I think your strong recommendation for alternative B, the fact that it is a crystal clear  -48-    3/28/95  decision at this meeting, and the reasoning leading to that conclusion are all correct I am happy to endorse them On the asymmetry/symmetry issue, I am certain that I am not certain [Laughter] for the following reason Before I was a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, I thought I knew what the difference between a symmetric and an asymmetric directive was The longer I serve--and today certainly has added to this immensely--the less I know about what this distinction means So, I actually would like to request, before we vote on this, a specification of what we are voting on Let me elaborate on that slightly If Bill McDonough and several of the others are correct in the sense that inflation is likely to be higher in 1997 than in 1994--and I think he probably is correct in that--and if we are adamantly opposed to that, this Committee should not be voting an asymmetric directive We should be raising interest rates, probably by 100 basis points today I do not advocate that policy, but I think that is the implication That is not something that leads to an asymmetric directive At the end of this, I am going to pose the question What do we mean by an asymmetric directive?  On the signaling issue, I find that quite baffling As I think Bob Forrestal just said, on May 23 we either will raise interest rates or we will do nothing That will be major news Three days later, the kind of directive we adopted on March 28 will be announced and nobody will notice it So, I don't see that this has any signaling value as long as it is not leaked, and I certainly hope that it will not be leaked Therefore, I raise the question of what symmetry vs asymmetry means I thought a symmetric directive meant a fairly strong conviction at this meeting that we would not be changing interest rates one way or the other until the next meeting--leaving, of course, the usual flexibility that something quite unusual could happen and we could change our minds So it is not a lock-in, but it is a predisposition of the Committee to hold today's decision until the next meeting If I am right about that, and at this point I am not sure that I am, I would strongly favor a symmetric directive   If I can clarify that You are suggesting that there are three probabilities The middle probability is doing nothing If the up probability exceeds the down probability--   Okay, I have it Thank you  -49-    3/28/95   Okay, thank you   Peter, you talked about a coupon purchase operation in the last maintenance period and about the possibility of two such operations in the intermeeting period coming up This raises a question I have wondered about for a long time, which is how you decide what to buy There is a whole variety of securities out there I was just looking at the table in your report which shows that about 50 percent of our portfolio is now invested in Treasury bills, with various percentages in other maturities It is not obvious what the criteria are nor what the long-run goal is--if there is a goal for the maturity structure--nor how individual purchases and runoffs of securities contribute to or detract from that goal What do you have to say about that? Do you feel that you know what the criteria are?   I have a question that is related to a couple you have already fielded about looking out over a little longer time horizon But mine may be a bit more specific and pointed As I look at the last four quarters of this forecast, it gives off the aura of a steady state in all aspects except one Real GDP is growing at a rate of about 24 percent; nominal GDP is growing at a rate of about 48 percent; the profits share is constant; the savings share is constant; the unemployment rate is constant; the funds rate, real and nominal, is constant; and inflation is constant The one exception to that is capacity utilization, which keeps going down; and that raises a couple of questions Where is it going? What do you think is the natural rate of capacity utilization? What is it that breaks what I think of as not quite an ironclad but a reasonable 31 ratio between changes in unemployment and changes in capacity utilization? In the last four quarters of the forecast, the change in the unemployment rate is zero but the capacity utilization rate goes down by 11 percentage points   Pretty close, though   So, if I can interpret your answer If the demand for goods and services is growing at a fairly steady pace and the capacity in manufacturing to produce goods is growing faster, then you would get ever decreasing capacity utilization in manufacturing Maybe not forever but--   Is capacity utilization converging to 81 percent? That's what I'm driving at Where is it going?   I'll be mercifully brief as the last speaker Except for a few details, one of which I mentioned about capacity utilization and a few more which I will mention in a moment, I think the Greenbook forecast is pretty reasonable both on the real and the nominal fronts I would shade it a bit lower on real growth in the near term, more like DRI's forecast than the Greenbook forecast, reflecting my view that in the short term the downside risks exceed the upside risks I say that without a great deal of conviction; I don't want to exaggerate the asymmetry that I see I thought I felt the same way at the last meeting and, in reviewing the transcript for that meeting, I found that that is what I did say then Between that meeting and this meeting, the annual growth rates in the Greenbook for the second and third quarters of 1995 were both written down by an average of 1/2 percentage point and my prediction of what will happen between now and the next Greenbook is a further reduction of that order of magnitude It has occurred to me that I could probably make money by forecasting a bigger slowdown when the Greenbook is forecasting a slowdown, and forecasting a bigger acceleration when the Greenbook is forecasting an acceleration   That was the next sentence out of my mouth! [Laughter] If it is not true of the Greenbook, it is an exception to the rule There are a number of reasons for this tendency of forecasts to underestimate changes I mentioned this last time, and I am not going to go into any detail here, but a lot of those reasons could be summarized by saying that people underestimate multiplier- accelerator interactions Janet Yellen mentioned several such instances As I look across the components, I can find an explanation having to do with consumption, that is, with saving rates, with investment accelerators, with government spending, with fiscal policy --about which I will have one minute's worth to say in a moment--and with net exports as well It also has to do with the incredible  -28-    5/23/95  smoothness of the inventory cycle in the Greenbook, something that has not been remarked about Basically, the level of inventory investment in the Greenbook simply converges to what is essentially a steady state without ever overshooting That would be a first if it should happen So, I think the multiplier-accelerator interaction is likely to be underestimated in the forecast, not by a huge amount, but somewhat  As we discussed yesterday around the Board table, the treatment of the Mexico shock as a one-quarter event is extremely optimistic, as I see it I think that Mexico will be a drag on our exports for longer than is built into this forecast Finally, echoing what Governor Lindsey just said, though not quite as strongly and certainly not in as much detail, I now think that the likelihood is for a bigger fiscal contraction than is built into the Greenbook forecast I was extremely skeptical about this for a long time But with the passage of the budget resolutions in both houses of Congress and, as Larry said, with the hits having been taken and with the Republican leadership very, very committed--you can either put this as having dug themselves into a big hole or put themselves on a nice platform--I think the prospects for a bigger fiscal contraction are much more likely than they were a few months ago I want to note that we are not talking about something that is very far into the future This fiscal contraction starts late this year On the other hand, as has been remarked, what has already happened to the bond market, the stock market, and the exchange rate is going to be supporting the economy later in the year In my view, this does not add up to a crash landing by any means But I think it will not be quite as soft as in the Greenbook I would say it is likely to be a bumpy landing but not bumpy enough to break the landing gear [Laughter]   Just an elementary observation It does not make a lot of sense to take the same equation with the same intercept and the same coefficients and then change the right hand variable to see how it does If you had used a different inflation index over the eight years, you would have had a different rule   Right   For both problems   It never tells you which quarter, though! [Laughter]   I think the wisdom of your recommendation is evident, and I'll adopt Bob McTeer's words as my own   Dave, when you outlined the downside and upside risks, you didn't mention what I had guessed you would start with, which was the fiscal situation If you were doing the Greenbook forecast in a DRI framework, which gives the majority probability forecast, and, say, your alternatives, and you said here is my forecast with probability P1 and my forecast with probability P2, where P1 and P2 add up to about 3, what would you say about the fiscal situation?   What I am getting at is this You have one alternative forecast that has more fiscal contraction, and you have another that has less fiscal contraction   Thank you, Mr Chairman After all the praise that the staff forecast has received, I am tempted to start by saying that I think they have it all wrong But I don't actually, so I won't I don't have any major quarrels with the Greenbook I could differ with it a little bit here and there, but those differences are too small to bother anybody with Like many people, starting with Dave Stockton, I am troubled by the fact that it's a bit too good to be true We know it's not going to come in quite that well, but that is in no sense a criticism of the forecast; you make your best guess  A notable feature of the Greenbook forecast exercise, which various people have indirectly remarked upon but I'd like to make explicit, is that we have been seeing a successive writing down of the staff forecast as I have observed at past meetings That has now stopped I think the staff has stopped writing down its forecast, as I have, for good reasons Bob Parry mentioned several of them, and I won't repeat what he said about the composition of the GDP in the second quarter; that's much more important than the tea leaves that we get from week to week  However, as you could probably tell from the question that I posed to Dave, I have some fear that all of us are going to be revising our forecasts down again after the fiscal dust settles, whenever it settles We don't know what the dust is going to look like, and we don't know when it is going to settle But when I think about the various scenarios, I have a much harder time thinking about the economy coming out better at the end, or in the middle, of the process than I do about it coming out worse I just find it extremely difficult to conceptualize a scenario that takes us through this train wreck and has us coming out on the other side with stronger aggregate demand than we had when we went in There are two reasons for that One is the aggregate demand effect, which Larry Lindsey was emphasizing But we also ought not to forget about the potential  -27-    8/22/95  impact of this thing, whatever it is, on financial markets The foreign exchange markets, the domestic bond market, and the stock market could truly be rattled by this event Now, of course, none of us can predict what is going to happen I am just emphasizing this because I think it now ought to be at the front of our screens, not at the back Two or three FOMC meetings ago it was at the back of our screens, and now I think it really needs to be at the front  The last thing I'd like to call attention to is a subtle, barely noticeable, feature of the Greenbook forecast You have to look closely to see it But I think it's important for the long run-- not at all important for the short run--and also sensible In this forecast, there is a small GDP gap at the forecast horizon, which happens to be the fourth quarter of 1996 GDP is below potential by just a hair more than it is now, according to the staff's estimates It's not a very big gap, about 4 percent of GDP That's a small number, much less than forecasting errors for a six-quarter horizon But it's also about twice the estimate of the overshoot of capacity that we had at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995, which was minute Much more important for the long run--and the reason I bring it up--is that, if we look at the details of the forecast, that gap is slowly widening over time That is to say, GDP is growing just a tad below potential If we extrapolated that path into 1997 and 1998-- after all, year-end 1996 is a very short time horizon for monetary policy--we would be looking at a path with a slight upward tilt to the unemployment rate and a slight downward tilt to the inflation rate, neither of which is showing yet in the Greenbook forecast They go together, of course  I said I thought this was a sensible, though very subtle, feature of the forecast It's exactly what one would expect if the real interest rate is above the equilibrium real interest rate--which, I think, is what we believed at the last FOMC meeting and what I still believe If that is the case, the gap between potential and actual GDP, or between the natural rate and the unemployment rate, or between 3 percent and the inflation rate, will grow bigger as we go forward-- and at an accelerating rate since this thing feeds on itself  Finally, I think there is a reasonable probability that the gap between the equilibrium rate and the real short-term interest rate implied in the Greenbook path is bigger than in the Greenbook forecast for two reasons, both of which have been mentioned One is that the fiscal contraction is bigger than in the Greenbook path and that lowers the equilibrium rate The other is the possibility that the NAIRU is actually below the number that is being used in the Greenbook, as has been mentioned several times We don't know that that is the case Dave is absolutely right; I was quite happy with the way he characterized it But I think the odds that the NAIRU is higher than the staff number look extremely small compared to the odds that it is lower If that's the case, the divergence between the equilibrium real rate and the actual real rate will grow faster than an extrapolation of the Greenbook would presume Thank you   I thought the question was whether to move in advance Isn't that what you just said, Larry? You got the right answer but not to the question that you asked [Laughter]   Don, I want to ask you a question that came up when I scribbled my notes last night, notes which were much less extensive than yours I was thinking about the difference between the real Treasury bill rate, or any interest rate that really matters to somebody, and the real fed funds rate, which doesn't matter to anybody but us and a few banks that trade fed funds If I am not mistaken, when we looked at this a while back, it was somewhat puzzling that nominal fed funds rates were higher than Treasury bill rates on average over long periods of time Is that right?   Different risk?  SPEAKER(?) Sure   Yes, but that goes the other way   I am sorry Am I right that the average gap over a very long time is in the range of 75 basis points with fed funds higher?   What I was getting at is this On the question of the real rate relative to historic averages, I think you get a little stronger case that it's on the high side if you look at, say, Treasury bills   I think that's more correct than if you look at funds   So do I   This bill came out of the hopper vastly better than I and many other people expected Nonetheless, I find I can't support it as it is Let me explain why very briefly because in some sense I can say, "Please read Governor Yellen's remarks into the record a second time" She got to go first, so I'll be very short I, too, would prefer a much more symmetric treatment, or I guess I should say, in light of what Ed Boehne was just saying, explicit recognition of the stabilization role of monetary policy There is nothing whatever wrong about the phrase that says the "primary long- term goal" is price stability In fact, it is one hundred percent right That is what we do now It's exactly correct, and I am perfectly happy with that in the law You might even argue that it is the only long-term goal; I am not sure what else we can do in the long term But, in the short term, there are other goals I am worried about the applicability of the "taking account" phrase that Don mentioned, just as Tom Melzer was worried about it--but for the opposite reason It looks ambiguous to me the way it is dangling in the bill I would like to see the ambiguity removed, as would Tom, but in the opposite direction  The reporting accountability aspects, I agree, are a vast improvement over what we have in Humphrey-Hawkins I don't have any real problem with them except that I would like to point out one thing, which is what Don Kohn pointed out in jest just a while ago But for me it is not in jest We have a choice under this bill of reporting to the Banking committees that the answer is "one or two more recessions" or, say, of giving them a 5-year projection in which we have enough slack to put in, depending on the definition of price stability, say 4 point years of unemployment above the natural rate over the next 5 years Now, if we want to live with that or do that, that's okay I think that is a debatable proposition I am not necessarily negative about it, but we ought to realize that, in the court of educated public opinion, we will not be able to get away with an airy-fairy forecast that says that everything will be perfect and, in particular, that full utilization of resources will be maintained as inflation tracks down to zero We just won't So, we ought to go into that process with our eyes open  I think that could be done, and I think almost all the other mandates in the bill could be done However, the killer provision for  -44-    9/26/95  me is the line in there that abolishes the Employment Act of 1946 I am simply unalterably opposed to that; I could never, ever support any bill that has that as a clause   To clarify what I said, if you read the fine print, there is a section in the bill that calls for the repeal of outmoded or obsolete provisions, or something like that One of them is Section 2 of the Employment Act That's why I said what I said   I was going to raise a question about job security, but I'm not sure it's appropriate [Laughter]   If I'm not mistaken, the duration, or the amount of long-term unemployment, is high at current unemployment rates This has to mean by the laws of arithmetic that the amount of turnover and of short-duration unemployment are low I guess my first thought would have been that job insecurity comes from turnover; you worry about losing your job Isn't that right?   Yes, that's right I said that was my first thought Maybe it's wrong Maybe it's duration   It's disproportionately long   The separation rate and the rehire rate are relatively low, right?   Yes Certainly, the hypothesis for years was that the separation rate matters most Firing was the key thing in job security That may have been wrong   Right It was an economy move by the BLS to stop collecting those data Now, they are going to economize more, too!    9/26/95   The other question was for Ted Should we be reading recent events as an escalation of the anti-EMU campaign? This is a two-part question Should we expect that to continue to weigh against the dollar? There seems to be no inherent reason why that should be anti-dollar, but in practice it always seems to weigh on the dollar   Thank you, Mr Chairman There are two basic reasons for revising a forecast from one meeting to another One is that you receive news that makes you change your mind; the other is that you goofed the last time I don't think either one is true in this case I don't think the staff goofed the last time I see the news that has come in since the last FOMC meeting as being entirely consistent with the staff forecast, as I think Mike does The economy has been following the script laid out in the previous Greenbook-- toward the much hoped-for soft landing So, to me, the epsilon in the news has been roughly zero in the last five weeks; and, appropriately  -30-    9/26/95  the Greenbook forecast has changed very little--negligibly in fact Indeed, as I read over the minutes of the August 22 meeting last night, I had a strong sense of deja vu I thought I was reading the minutes of this meeting and it had not yet occurred! I suspect that when Norm drafts the minutes for this meeting, they are going to look a lot like those for the August meeting In fact, he won't have to do much work   Yes A number of us observed last time--fewer of us today maybe because we are getting used to the idea--that this scenario is too good to be true Almost everybody said that last time; very few people said it today To be sure, it is five weeks closer to coming true than it was five weeks ago; but it's still a little too good to be true [Laughter] I believe, as Sue Phillips just mentioned and others too, that the biggest risk remains the step into the unknown that Capitol Hill and the White House are about to take It could all work out fine, or it could work out to be a catastrophe There is no way to predict that But to me it presents a downside risk, not an upside risk It's hard for me to see it giving a big boost to the economy  Last time, I called attention to a feature in the Greenbook forecast that you could barely see You almost needed a microscope to see it That feature was that by the end of the forecast, which was then the fourth quarter of 1996, a small gap had opened up between actual and potential GDP, and that gap was growing slowly So, if it was extrapolated beyond 1996 one would see an uptrend in unemployment and a downtrend in inflation In the current Greenbook forecast, which has now gone out one more year, this gap is more visible; but it still is not very dramatic The real growth rates for the years 1995, 1996, and 1997 of the forecast period read 21, 22, and 20 percent-- all, as Bob Forrestal and others have noted, below the growth rate of potential Consequently, the annual average unemployment rates of those three years go 57, 59, and 61 percent That is where the Greenbook stops But that is not where the world will stop The core CPI inflation reads 31, 28, and 27 percent So we see a pattern of declining inflation in the data  The reason it is there now is the same reason it was there five weeks ago--which is that, if inflation is indeed capped at or below 3 percent as the Greenbook says and as I believe, the actual real federal funds rate is almost certainly above the equilibrium real federal funds rate Several people have observed this, and Governor Yellen in particular has emphasized it That means that by some reasonable definition--I guess my definition of a reasonable definition is that I can't come up with a better one--monetary policy is restrictive It is very hard to define the "zero" on monetary policy, but this is as good a way as I know And that monetary restraint--that is to say the gap between the actual real federal funds rate and the equilibrium real federal funds rate--probably will be greater the more fiscal restraint there is  This is a process that naturally snowballs I am sorry, but I am making tacit reference to termites here, though I wasn't going to use the term You start with a real funds rate that is a little too  -31-    -32-  high; that opens up the gap; that leads to lower inflation If you hold the nominal funds rate steady, the real funds rate gets higher because monetary policy is not standing still but actually is tightening as inflation declines; and that leads to a larger gap and so on You will recognize that this is exactly the argument that was used, correctly, on the up side against rising inflation in the 1960s and 1970s to explain why it was foolish to target the nominal interest rate It's just as foolish to target the nominal interest rate on the down side, and I don't think we are doing that  I had asked the staff, and Governor Yellen mentioned this, to use the MPS model to run the Greenbook forecast out further, holding the nominal fed funds rate at 5-3/4 percent, because you can just barely see what is going on by the fourth quarter of 1997 When the staff did this, they assumed that we would reach a balanced budget by the year 2002 I don't remember that I specified that I might have, but I don't recall doing so In any event, it has the consequence of calling for the dramatic reduction in the equilibrium funds rate that Janet Yellen mentioned earlier When you look at the paths that come out of that simulation, the unemployment rate rises from 62 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997, which is where the Greenbook turns off, to about 7 percent a year later and about 8 percent a year later than that And then it just keeps on going up because the economy is on an unstable path in this forecast By the year 2002, you don't even want to think about the unemployment rate The inflation rate falls from where it is now, around 3 percent, to about 1 percent by 1999 in this path Then it, too, keeps going; and by the year 2002, when the budget is balanced, the economy is experiencing a heavy deflation that makes the current Japanese standard look wildly inflationary  Now, that is not a forecast Nobody should take this particular model literally and nobody does I think not even the proprietors of the model take it literally I certainly don't and I don't worry that people around this table will Furthermore, we would not let it happen The economy is not going to go to minus 7 percent inflation and 10 percent unemployment The point of the exercise is to indicate whether the path we are on is a sustainable path or a nonsustainable path It suggests that the current real federal funds rate is probably unsustainably high And it shows us that the effects of this discrepancy start very small, so we don't really see them, but they build  I am now in what will appear in the transcript as the last paragraph--into policy, though just a little--in anticipation that this month's policy discussion may go like last month's policy discussion [Laughter] This observation does not imply that we have to cut interest rates today It certainly does not, and I would not in fact argue for that But it does strongly suggest that we need to ease policy sometime, especially if there is a large fiscal contraction--and regardless of public opinion in Wooster, Ohio as to the effects of fiscal contractions on aggregate demand More importantly, it suggests that we need to think about a long-term strategy for monetary policy What we do today will have essentially nothing to do with the next two quarters But what we do, not necessarily today but, say, in the coming six months, is likely to have a great deal to do with how the economy looks 1-1/2, 2, 2-1/2 years after that, and that's what we ought to be thinking about Thank you, Mr Chairman    9/26/95   I also support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, although as Governor Yellen does I find myself in considerable sympathy with Bob Forrestal's argument I think for the reasons Jerry Jordan, Ed Boehne, and others have stated, that this is a good time to wait We don't quite know what is going to happen I simply want to state as a matter of principle, one that most people believe but a few have argued against, that fiscal policy is a relevant consideration in setting monetary policy It doesn't mean that we have made our policy hostage to fiscal policy in any sense But it is true that we don't know what the fiscal policy is going to be   Peter, you mentioned that on Thursday and Friday, some of the Treasury securities maturing on November 15 started to sell at some discount How much was it? I was on an airplane at that time, and I didn't see the market quotations   That's why I was asking   I meant the yield to maturity, not the prices   I see   This is admittedly a very airy-fairy contingency if we don't think this default is going to happen But let me go back into the mindset that you were in a minute ago How many government securities issues are there, something like 300?   How many of those do we own a piece of? Almost all?   How many of them do we actually buy and sell?   No If I watched you for a whole quarter, how many issues might you have dealt in either doing repos or buying outright or anything?   Right Therefore, what kind of signal would you send if you told the market that these 55 issues are being shunned by the Federal Reserve, that we are not accepting them   Isn't that what you are suggesting?   But we wouldn't do open market operations? I thought that's what you said   What were you suggesting? I missed it   I thought we were talking about purchases in the market   I guess I am confused    11/15/95   They are short on staff up there; they can't give you two decimal places!   Mike, what you are saying about productivity prompted a question that I didn't think of before If you feed through the investment burst, so to speak, of the last three years into the capital stock and into a production function and it does nothing to total factory productivity, what should it do to labor productivity? How much of a fillip to labor productivity ought we to have gotten from this?   I would take your previous criticism as being valid We probably ought to view those in 1994 dollars or chain weighted Otherwise, we could get excited about something that is not there  -18-    11/15/95   These numbers aren't in my head But even though some of the chain-weighted numbers have been low, it is still the case that "K" has been growing significantly faster than "L" Labor productivity is still growing at 1 percent a year, right?   "L" has been rising for three years, but I don't have the number in my head Do you know how much it has increased?   Yes, net   I agree with that Suppose you did this calculation and it came out--I'll make up a number, because I don't know what it is--that it should add 4 percent on first principle to labor productivity That means total factor productivity decelerated because the evidence is as you said; I'm not disputing that at all   I am not going to say anything about my District economy because you do not want to hear about it! My one anecdote would be that the traffic was unusually light driving in this morning I will leave it at that  I was very comfortable with the September Greenbook forecast Like Al Broaddus, I was struck by the large size of the revision in the latest Greenbook It was a considerably larger revision than I made mentally based on the third-quarter GDP report Specifically,  -38-    11/15/95  the shock to the staff, and I guess to me, of about 1/2 percentage point on the level of GDP--that is 2 percentage points on the growth rate for a single quarter--led the staff as Al noted to raise the level of GDP in the middle of 1997 by about 2-1/2 times that much, by about 1-1/4 percentage point We discussed this yesterday at the Board meeting I personally would have been inclined, and still am, to be suspicious about the third-quarter GDP report--in two dimensions One is that there were certain flukish aspects, which is not atypical The other involves the deflator I keep staring at the translation of the nominal GDP into real GDP by using a 06 percent deflator Fortunately, we are behind closed doors here I never predict data revisions in public because it is a stupid thing to do But in the quiet of my own study, I expect that to be revised   In 1987 dollars, yes   Yes [Laughter] I know it is on the transcript, but fortunately no one will know I said that for five years I don't have to say it publicly   That is a very good point I would have been inclined to boost the forecast between September and now by less Now, I don't want to overstate that point Adding 7 percentage point to GDP in a two-year period is well below the ability of anybody to forecast, but one does have to make a point estimate somewhere So, I'm not saying that the staff's judgment is wild It just seemed a bit sporty to me [Laughter]   Yes, that's right They are prone to things like that That is what happens if you work at the Federal Reserve a long time! [Laughter] I had two things on my desk that I could easily pick up to compare The Blue Chip forecasters--now, that is a consensus, of course, so their forecast is going to move less-- changed their 1996 and 1997 cumulated growth rate by zero between a month ago and now Larry Meyer changed his forecast by 1 percentage point in each year; so he moved up 1997 by 2 point Those are samples that happened to be on my desk and that I looked at this morning before I walked in A notable feature of the new forecast, to which Al Broaddus and Jerry Jordan made reference, is that the implicit equilibrium real funds rate in the forecast now is 275 percent, which it was not the last time You can just see that by the behavior of the economy with a constant unemployment rate and a constant inflation rate That happens despite a budget deficit, which is now down to about 2 percent of GDP and falling and, more importantly I believe, is projected to fall It ought to be expected that government budget deficits move ex ante real interest rates  -39-    11/15/95  That seems rather high to me based on past experience when we have had deficits of that size in this economy Again, it's not wildly high, just a bit on the high side One reason, though not the only reason, for the staff's upgrading of the GDP forecast is that long rates are 30 basis points lower now, give or take a little, than they were at the time of the September FOMC meeting I pointed out the following to Mike Prell yesterday, and I will just point it out to everybody here today The reasons given in the market for the further notch down of long rates are the following four--I think this is the whole list increased expectations of Fed easing, lower reported actual inflation and implicitly expected inflation, more optimism about deficit reduction, and perceptions of a weakening expansion of economic activity The changes in the staff forecast between the last Greenbook and the current Greenbook, which no longer assumes any Fed easing, include a little more pessimism about inflation, less deficit reduction, and stronger GDP growth Now, I don't mean to imply that I think the staff is wrong The bond market is a lousy forecaster I believe our staff can probably educe evidence that they forecast GDP better than does the bond market; I am sure they can But I bring that up because I do worry about the internal consistency of the forecast If the strength in the forecast is largely predicated on lower real interest rates, but the reasons in the market for the lower real interest rates contradict those in the staff forecast, it will not come true More specifically, it suggests to me that if the staff forecast starts coming true, bond rates will rise substantially and I would suppose more than is built into the forecast  One final point At the last meeting many of us characterized the Greenbook as too good to be true I believe I was one, but I didn't go back and check the transcript That was the last Greenbook This one is better The risk to me in this Greenbook forecast looks disproportionately on the down side Some of you may remember that for a long time the biggest risk to me in the staff forecast has been the so-called train wreck Nine months ago it was well into the future; two months ago it was getting close; and now we are in it The government lockout is a vastly greater event than the Boeing strike by a factor of 40 or something like that In the first place, this is going to have, as Governor Lindsey and someone else said, a sort of standard Keynesian effect on aggregate demand There are fewer people working; they don't have as much money to spend It also has the potential to scare people and shatter confidence just at a time when the economy is teetering as to where it should be Further, it has the potential--knock on wood that it won't happen--to rattle financial markets, as we are all well aware I think that is a danger  The second downside risk to me is the weakening economic outlook in all the G-7 countries I don't want to exaggerate that risk I don't think this is a huge difference, and developments in Mexico may be a bigger deal for us potentially than the G-7 Finally, with about 1/8 the weight that Governor Lindsey put on it and 1/4 the weight that Governor Kelley put on it, I would list consumer debt problems as the third set of downside risks I have a hard time thinking of upside risks that are of comparable likelihood Thank you   It clearly doesn't fit the ups and downs in that period   It was developed for you, Mr Chairman, not for Paul Volcker! [Laughter]   I just want to make the point with regard to the last argument that you mentioned, Don, in your prepared remarks Since the gap is a forecast of inflation, you could read that as the expected change in inflation   I would not quite translate getting a zero on the second coefficient as an indication that the Committee did not care about inflation One can reinterpret this as indicating that the only thing the Committee cares about is the level and rate of change of inflation   It admits of that interpretation   That's right   That's correct   Mr Chairman, I find myself very much of a mind with Bob Forrestal If the third quarter had come in weak, say under 2 percent, I am sure I would be arguing strongly for a cut today based on four arguments (1) the weakness in the economy; (2) the very good inflation performance; (3) the high, by almost any standard, real federal funds rate--all of those are familiar reasons; and, (4) is something that you alluded to and Cathy Minehan just alluded to in a different way I am becoming increasingly uneasy about the Federal Reserve being cast in a role that we don't want as the rewarding or punishing father who looks at the President and Congress and says "You did well so I am cutting interest rates," or "You did poorly so I am raising interest rates" We really do not want to be in that position, which is another virtue of making a small rate cut disassociated from a budget agreement I think this is a factor that we should think about because we are very much in danger of being pigeonholed into that posture But, of course, the third quarter of 1995 did not come in weak; it came in quite strong I already said that I don't buy the staff's extrapolation of that upward revision into 1996 and 1997 Nonetheless, the third quarter is what it was and it brings us into 1996 at a higher base level of resource utilization, and that certainly seems to be reality or a reasonable guess about reality And as noted, the staff also claims that the equilibrium real funds rate is about 2-3/4 percent despite the heavy deficit reduction Again, I was skeptical about that I want to point out, though, that if the staff's forecast and estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate are correct, I definitely agree, as Don said, that we should not be cutting interest rates If I bought into that entirely, these arguments would evaporate It's possible that the staff is  -48-    11/15/95  right, but I don't think so And it still leaves intact two of the four reasons The reason I said I was very much of a mind with Bob is that the strength of the economy in the third quarter really destroys any argument that there is an urgency to this, that we can't wait five weeks I couldn't possibly argue for that proposition Thus, while I could support a small cut now if the Committee were going in that direction, I could also support waiting until the 19th of December, but I would very much favor an asymmetric directive toward ease   It's in the transcript that you made that remark! [Laughter]   Just a point of fact Does the regression have labor income on the right or total income on the right?   Yes   I am going to be blissfully brief As I sat down last night to write some notes for this meeting, I remembered something my basketball coach taught me when I was very young about shooting free throws He used to say the basket is the same, the ball is the same, why can't you be the same? Here we are in December, and I am thinking back to November The Greenbook is the same, the economy looks the same, and I feel the same way about the economy I want to elaborate on that just a little I want to make one point As has been noted by several people, the Greenbook, except for a few trivial details, is essentially the same Greenbook we had five weeks ago The economy, I would say, looks the same as it did then, only more so In broad outline, we were looking then at an economy that had shown a surprisingly strong third quarter; now the third quarter looks surprisingly stronger The economy was showing signals of weakening in the fourth quarter, which I think have continued to come in In addition, we had a big question mark about the budget, and now we have a huge question mark about the budget In consequence, I essentially feel the same way about the economy as I did five weeks ago, only more so  The preponderance of risks, as I said last time, looks to me to be on the down side I am not going to go into the details of why since you have already heard that around the table I think the biggest new risk in the last five weeks is the additional inventory pileup that seems to have occurred since then I am a bit more worried about that than I was five weeks ago Secondly, it certainly looks, as it did five weeks ago, that the economy can grow at trend with about 56 percent unemployment and about 3 percent inflation for a while, maybe a long while But private forecasts that have this scenario, and many do, are almost all predicated on an easing of Fed policy; the Greenbook forecast is not predicated on an easing of Fed policy I might add that the market rallies that are propelling or expected to propel the economy forward are also predicated on a Fed  -28-    12/19/95  easing We saw a little of that come out of the markets yesterday The part of the argument that said, "the budget will be fixed and therefore the Fed will ease" took a small hit yesterday in the market I think we got a little microcosm of what might happen if in fact we don't ease Thirdly, the real fed funds rate looks restrictive to me as it did a month or so ago My notes here say exactly what Jerry Jordan said It seems to me that the funds rate is more restrictive now than it was in February when we were actively stepping on the brake It is hard for me to understand why in December we would want to be stepping on the brake more firmly than we were in February I can't understand that at all, nor could I five weeks ago  The only thing that I have to say today that is not a repeat of what I said five weeks ago is a comment about wage pressures This has been mentioned by several people around the table We ought to recall that labor lately has been taking it on the chin quite badly, despite apparently tight labor markets Real wages are going nowhere, and profit margins are going everywhere One manifestation of this is that the gains from diminished health care costs are being pocketed by firms in the form of profits, not by labor in the form of wages, which is what a conventional theory of incidence would have led us to expect I raise this point for those who have a fear of wage pressures I raise it to suggest that we ought to expect some reversal of this in the natural order of things There ought to be a period of time when wages grow faster than prices just as there has been a period of time when prices grew faster than wages As this aberration straightens itself out, and the wage-price relationship goes back to what most of us think is consistent with the normal long- run theory of incidence, there does not necessarily have to be an acceleration of prices It would simply be the relative wage-price ratio snapping back toward what it was a few years ago That is all I have to say   The answer to that question obviously depends, among other things, on whether you think the shock is temporary or permanent That is extremely important Larry is looking at a temporary shock, and I believe Don is thinking about one that is permanent That is not the only variable but it is critical  I want to make a couple of points First, I think this is a very good discussion to have I only wish I knew we were going to have it, because I began thinking about this subject only when you started talking I have thought about it before, but not within the last month So, I hope this won't be the last of it for this Committee because I don't think I am the only one who didn't know that this subject would be on the agenda  I have a couple of substantive points Among the considerations in choosing between these two strategies are the following, though these are not the only considerations How important do you think losses of output are? That is very important And--Don, you touched on this obliquely--what are the relative social costs of the level of inflation, especially at low levels, and changes in the inflation rate? This is critical, I believe Then there are technical considerations, and if I had known about this topic last  -33-    12/19/95  night, I would have pulled out the work that the staff did on it and could be eloquent on the subject The choice does hinge sensitively on the marginal costs, around the target inflation rate, of small deviations in output and inflation Are these costs linear or quadratic; how is the loss function curved; and so on I won't try to get that right now, because if I try, I will probably get it wrong That is one set of comments  The second set of comments You characterized the opportunistic strategy, which like Bill McDonough I favor, as waiting for the unanticipated to happen In some sense that is right, except that we know it will happen It is not that we think we will go for the next thirty years without a recession We don't know when the recession will come, but we know it will come We also know that when it comes, even if we are being opportunistic the way you describe it here, we will not react fast enough to stop it in its tracks So, there will be a recession and there will be a period of slack That is what a lot of us mean when we say that we are "one recession away from price stability" It takes a very nimble central bank to move fast enough to avoid the slack that drags inflation down a point or two points when a recession occurs It will happen with a probability of one So, it is not unanticipated in some long-run sense; it is unanticipated only as to the timing That's crucial because, if it was literally unanticipated, you might never get to price stability by the opportunistic strategy  I also have a couple of quarrels with the way I think you portrayed the strategy Although in your discussion with Jerry Jordan it went the other way, I thought you said you were looking back at inflation performance rather than looking forward at inflationary expectations I would have thought you would have wanted to do the latter--to look forward at inflationary expectations, not backward at the actual performance Secondly, I think your matrix, as I think of it, is not quite right in terms of changes versus levels That is, "tighten" or "tight" and "easier" or "easy," so to speak, are two different things I would have thought the question was whether you wanted to be "tight" or "easy" I can imagine easing from a very tight position, and I can imagine tightening from an easy position Either could still leave policy on the same side of neutral I think the critical distinction here is which side of neutral are we on, and which do we wish to be on In that regard, we cannot avoid taking a stand, to use a well worn phrase, even though we know we don't know for certain what the equilibrium real interest rate is That is our choice Do we want to be on the north side or the south side of the equilibrium real rate? Once we put ourselves there, the rest basically will take care of itself if we are right, but with very long lags and uncertain timing If we are close to equilibrium, it is going to be uncertain as to whether we are on the right side because, as I said, we don't actually know the equilibrium real rate But the fact that we can't know this number with certainty doesn't avoid the need to estimate it It is the same sort of uncertainty that we face all the time We don't know what the economy is going to do in the next six months, but we have all these people here to estimate what it is going to do in that period  My last remark will tie that to the current situation I think that right now we are in a deliberate strategy posture, since I believe, as many but not all of those around the table believe, that  -34-    12/19/95  we are on the north side of the equilibrium real funds rate A version of the deliberate strategy is to hold the funds rate unchanged and let the economy do what it will, which is to create slack and bring the inflation rate down Whereas the opportunistic strategy, as Bill characterized it, would ease now and presumably try to bring the real fed funds rate to roughly what you think the equilibrium rate is   I would have labeled the top row as having a real equilibrium short rate of 275 percent and the bottom row as having a rate of less than 275 percent   I agree with that   The positive supply shock square in Don's chart   Thank you, Mr Chairman I am one of those opportunists who think that we have the real funds rate too high As you said, it's higher than it was at the peak of our tightening I don't see a reason to keep it there I hope you will allow me to agree with the reasons that you gave for lowering the rate without signing on to your brave new world scenario, which I am not quite ready to do I do agree 100 percent with all your reasons--the level of real interest rates, a weaker forecast than that in the Greenbook, and the minimal inflationary dangers I definitely want to underscore that we are quite fortunate to be sitting here on December 19-- ironically, we are quite fortunate, but the country is not--able to take this action and disassociate it entirely from the budget negotiation process, which I think is a very good thing for the Federal Reserve Do it now   Symmetric will be okay with me
