 Yes, I think that’s exactly right  The one GSE that had relied historically   on a lot more—    The one GSE that traditionally had done a lot of dynamic hedging had   already started, even in 2003, to shift over to more options hedging  But a couple of depository   institutions did not make such a big switch  For one particularly large firm, the results of poor   dynamic hedging showed up in their operating results, and by all reports they have since “gotten   religion,” shall we say And in part that’s because it has been inexpensive to hedge with options   in the last couple of years    Yes    There is some  Almost everyone dynamically hedges some portion of   their convexity Certainly, mortgage servicers still do some dynamic hedging, as do the GSEs   And hedge funds and fixed income funds that hold mortgages do some dynamic hedging  So   there is some, but it’s a substantially lower proportion than it was three years ago                                        August 9, 2005 8 of 110   They’re trying to model it  I don’t know if they have found any good   ones; you’re absolutely right about that These products have not been widely used; they’ve   tended to be used by a narrow segment until fairly recently  ARMs do have different   prepayment characteristics  I know from what I’ve read from the folks who sell the models that   they are working to improve their ARMs models to help with the hedging  But at this stage it’s   not as straightforward as buying an interest rate option on a long-term fixed-rate mortgage where                                              August 9, 2005 11 of 110  there’s sort of a natural hedge in a natural market  I don’t think there’s much likelihood in the   near term of a prepayment shock to the servicers, but in a year or two the possibility is probably   fairly significant    It is That’s exactly right  They do the best they can with the limited   history and information they have from the way the market has behaved in the past  But it has   not been a very big market because a lot of these weren’t securitized until fairly recently, so they   weren’t priced very well Therefore, unless you have a history in the business and have your   own internal model, it’s extremely difficult to figure out how prepayments are going to behave    From the little information that we have gathered, it’s a fairly wide array   of investors—from hedge funds to a very large number of international investors  I don’t know   if central banks are buying these, but—    Exactly That’s true     The numbers in Dino’s chart are breakevens, so there were no carry   adjustments  Therefore they’re not the same as the calculations in the Bluebook, which include a   lot of adjustments and are implied inflation numbers  These are purely the differences between   the nominals and the reals  One reason that we always include the five-year five-year-forward   breakeven rate is that it is the forward that is easiest to calculate—but where energy prices and   carry have the smallest effect  So if you want to get the clearest reading from pure market data,   it would be the five-year five-year-forward rate      This is Trish Mosser talking  Yes, we do have our own measure  It is   somewhat less noisy than the Barclays measure; but because it is based on market prices, it is   closer to the Barclays measure than to the Board’s measure, which of course is based on the   staff’s yield-curve model     January 9, 2008 7 of 60       May I add one factual comment to that?     During the height of the dislocations in December, the fed funds rate   overnight was regularly trading substantially higher early in the morning—this happened also in   August for a while—either early in the US trading session or before that  Our understanding from   market participants was that the reason for those higher rates in the morning was excess demand   from European-based institutions to borrow in the funds market, and when the US institutions   became more active later in the day, the funds rate would then go back down to the target   January 29–30, 2008 15 of 249       My understanding is that they have been approached  I don’t know what   decisions have been made other than the ones that may have been mentioned  In addition, they have   opened a swap line with the Danish Central Bank in euros, which was virtually identical to the   October 28–29, 2008 38 of 206    dollar arrangement that we have with the Danish Central Bank  So they definitely have been   approached for swap lines  On how many of them they’ll put into place, we don’t have any   particular information at this point     Certainly I would be happy to  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The   proposed changes were discussed in a memo that went out to the Committee last week as well as   in a memo that proposed a slight amendment to the domestic authorization that was circulated   yesterday  Let me start with the foreign-currency area, for which there are three distinct parts to   consider With respect to the authorization for foreign-currency operations, we propose keeping   the 2008 authorization mostly unchanged  We have one modest alteration  We propose adding   four additional currencies to the list of permissible foreign exchange purchases and sales—the   Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the Korean won, and the New Zealand dollar  This is being   done to reflect the foreign exchange swap agreements that were put in place in 2008 with the     January 27–28, 2009 8 of 267  central banks On the foreign-currency directive, we are currently recommending no changes    Regarding the procedural instructions with respect to foreign-currency operations, we are   proposing a slight modification to the introductory paragraph, adding the words “unless   otherwise directed by the Committee,” to recognize explicitly that the instructions can be   superseded by the Committee  I can pause now for a vote on the foreign side, or I can continue   on and talk about the rest    Sure I would be happy to  With respect to the authorization for   domestic open market operations, we are proposing several amendments  The specific changes   include, first, minor changes to consolidate language for repo and reverse repo operations into a   single paragraph; second, the addition of a new paragraph 2 that codifies the New York Fed’s   authority to transact in agency mortgage-backed securities for the SOMA portfolio using agents,   such as asset managers and a custodial bank  This paragraph also allows the custodial agent to   engage in repo transactions in order to manage the cash balances that are generated by agency   MBS holdings Third, we are adding language in the final paragraph, as suggested by a Reserve   Bank President, that makes explicit the authority of the SOMA manager, following instructions   from the Chairman, to take actions that “result in material changes in the composition and size of   the assets in the System Open Market Account”  This authority, however, would be subject to   the requirements, set out in the last sentence of the paragraph, that the Chairman consult with the   Committee, if feasible  It would also make clear that “any such adjustment shall be made in the   context of the Committee’s discussion and decision at its most recent meeting”  The intended   effect of the proposed revisions is to place the governance of intermeeting changes by the           January 27–28, 2009 9 of 267  Chairman in the size and the composition of the SOMA portfolio on the same footing as changes   in the degree of pressure on reserve positions and the fed funds rate   Last, in light of the Federal Reserve’s current program of purchases of agency debt and   agency MBS, the staff recommends that the guidelines for agency debt and agency MBS   purchases be temporarily suspended  The status of the guidelines will then be reviewed at next   year’s January FOMC meeting I should note that there is a precedent for this  For example,   paragraphs 3 through 6 of this document were temporarily suspended by the Committee in   August 1999 At the time, the SOMA manager was concerned about the Desk’s capacity to   respond to any Y2K year-end effects and sought the authority to accept agency debt and agency   MBS collateral    No    It is However, based on a previous vote, we have exempted the   fluctuations in the value of foreign portfolios due to changes in the exchange rates  We do   nothing at this point but passively invest both our yen and our euro portfolios  But given the size   of exchange rate movements that we have, it would be possible at some point for us   inadvertently to exceed a $25 billion limit  So we are assuming that we fixed an exchange rate at   a time when we were under $25 billion, and we determined that, if we happen to go over   inadvertently, it would not be a good idea then to go into the market and actively buy or sell   foreign exchange to undo that So other than that exemption, yes, we are abiding by that, and   that is in force right now   1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Spence and I will be referring to the  financial conditions and facilities handout in front of you  Stress in financial markets  has eased somewhat in recent weeks, but very unevenly  Markets directly supported  by the Federal Reserve or government actions have seen declines in spreads,  improved liquidity, and modest increases in trading and lending activity  But markets  beyond the reach of Fed and government programs remain very strained  Moreover,  the economic and financial downturn is very rapidly depleting banks’ capital  cushions   Let me start with markets in which the Fed has intervened  Interbank lending  spreads, shown in exhibit 1, have continued to narrow  The sharpest declines in  LIBOR–OIS spreads actually occurred before year-end, and at present, one-week and  one-month spreads are below their early September levels  The declines in spreads  occurred at the same time that private lending among banks increased modestly—  particularly at the one-week and one-month tenors  But almost no one is willing to  take the risk of lending on an unsecured basis to a bank for more than a month  As a  result, LIBOR spreads three months and beyond remain elevated  As Spence will  discuss in more detail, declining spreads and increased private-sector lending have  been reflected in reduced demand for term liquidity at our facilities  Similarly, in  commercial paper markets, activity is up, and spreads are down  Rates on all types of  A1-rated paper have declined—you can see this in the second exhibit—since the  announcements of the various Fed facilities for commercial paper and money market  funds After year-end, even A2/P2 commercial paper spreads, which are not eligible  for the CPFF, fell sharply   In exhibit 3, consumer mortgage rates, as well as mortgage and agency spreads  have declined notably since the announcement of the Fed purchase programs in  November  In addition, secondary mortgage market spreads to Treasuries fell again  during the first week of the purchase program in early January  Retail conforming  mortgage rates have increased somewhat from very low levels in early January,  moving up with long-term Treasury yields, but they remain well below the levels that  prevailed before the Fed’s purchase program was announced  Spence will be talking  in more detail about the MBS purchase program in a few minutes   The FDIC guarantee of financial debt has had an indirect effect on the corporate  bond market  Corporate bond spreads, pictured in exhibit 4, widened throughout the  fall, but since December these spreads—which do not include FDIC guaranteed  debt—have declined At the same time, the nonguaranteed portion of new issuance,  seen in exhibit 5, has actually increased; in just the first two weeks of January, it  accounted for more than half of new issuance  Apparently, guaranteed debt is not  attractive to traditional corporate bond investors, so they have shifted into obligations  of nonfinancial issuers This has effectively increased demand for a small pool of  corporate bond issuers, causing spreads to decline                 January 27–28, 2009 15 of 267  In contrast, markets without Fed or government backstop—such as consumer­ asset-backed securities, commercial-mortgage-backed securities, and leveraged  loans—have shown little or no improvement  Consumer ABS spreads (exhibit 6)  have narrowed a bit since the passing of year-end but remain very elevated despite  expectations for the beginning of the TALF program in late February or early March   Activity is at a standstill, and according to both the packagers and the buyers of  securitized products, it is likely to remain so until the TALF is up and running and  market participants have a sense that it will “work”   CMBS and leveraged-loan prices, shown in the next exhibit, seemed to stabilize  late last year but recently have fallen even further as the macroeconomic outlook has  continued to worsen more sharply than expected  The outlook for nonagency  mortgage securities continues to deteriorate  Recently the rating agencies projected  even larger losses, which will cause formerly AAA super senior tranches to be  downgraded to default-level ratings All of this is, of course, more bad news for  holders of these securities—including banks, insurers, and the GSEs—which are  likely to face larger write-downs on mark-to-market assets and significantly larger  impairment charges  Recent headlines about capital impairments at several of the  Federal Home Loan Banks reflect these ongoing write-downs    Despite the modest improvements in some markets, one should not underestimate  how remarkably fragile financial markets are right now  The process of deleveraging,  asset sales, and overall reduction in the risk profile of large financial institutions  continues unabated—although in a somewhat more orderly way than a couple of  months ago Lack of liquidity is one symptom of this fragility  Although liquidity  has improved since the beginning of the year, for most markets this improvement can  be characterized as moving from “nonexistent” to “very poor”  Even core benchmark  markets such as Treasuries and foreign exchange have exceptionally strained  liquidity  Volumes are at multiyear lows  Bid-asked spreads in euro–dollar foreign  exchange trading (exhibit 8) have more than doubled  In benchmark Treasury  markets, the amount traders will buy or sell at a given price—the trade quote size  shown in exhibit 9—is 01 of normal  Volatility has remained correspondingly high  across nearly all markets, even with the improved conditions in the last few weeks   High volatility and poor liquidity can be self-reinforcing  They raise the cost of  making and underwriting markets, which leads to less trading, higher spreads, less  credit formation, and in general a lot less risk-taking   The lack of liquidity across markets has led to some obvious unexploited profit  opportunities Exhibits 10 and 11 give a couple of examples  Exhibit 10 shows the  average error between the yield on 10-year Treasury securities and the predicted yield  for those securities based on the Board’s model  In normal market conditions, a host  of market participants—trading desks, institutional investors, and hedge funds—trade  constantly each day to exploit such large gaps and arbitrage them away  At present, a  combination of balance sheet constraints and high volatility has caused a pullback in  this activity, which, again, is self-reinforcing  Exhibit 11 has a second example of an  unexploited profit opportunity—namely, the spread between yields on corporate               January 27–28, 2009 16 of 267  credit default swaps (CDS) and corporate bonds  Even in normal market conditions,  the corporate CDS market is the more liquid (because it requires less balance sheet  and is a more standardized product), but the difference amounts to a few basis points   Currently the spread between CDS and corporate bonds is more than 200 basis points  for “liquid” investment-grade bonds and nearly 450 basis points for high yield    Large losses and associated balance sheet constraints of banks and dealers are  major reasons for the drying up of liquidity across markets  But also important is the  lack of arbitrageurs—most notably hedge funds  Hedge fund losses in the last few  months have been enormous  As exhibit 12 shows, 2008 was the worst year on  record for the hedge fund industry, with losses of 20 to 40 percent for the group   Almost every type of hedge fund had double-digit losses (except short equity, and  they were shut out of the market for some time)  Losses were concentrated in the  second half of the year, with about two-thirds of them in the last quarter  The poor  performance provoked record redemptions, estimated to be at least $150 billion and  as much as $400 billion  Of course, redemptions would have been much larger if  many—particularly large—hedge funds had not shut their gates  In response, hedge  funds have deleveraged very quickly, adding more downward pressure to asset prices  and further undermining liquidity  In short, the capacity of the financial system to  absorb and mitigate shocks is small—as small as it has been during this crisis    At present, there are two closely linked risks to the fragile equilibrium in markets   One, of course, is the continued rapid deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook,  both in the United States and globally The second is the truly precarious financial  condition of many of the largest financial institutions, particularly the global banks   Fourth-quarter bank earnings, which we are in the midst of receiving, were expected  to be very bad, and in fact have been even worse for the major US banks, as  exhibit 13 shows Earnings expectations for large European banks are even worse  than for US banks If they disappoint to the same degree, the Q4 losses just for the  banks in the table could easily be above $70 billion  Adding in the hedge fund losses  and the large expected losses at the GSEs and insurance companies, Q4 losses in the  hundreds of billions seem likely   The outlook for banks is hugely uncertain  Simply put, investors are worried  about the size of the “hole” in banks’ balance sheets—that is, the size of the  additional asset write-downs and reserving that will be necessary  If the hole is large,  as anticipated, or worse, enormous, how will banks be able to fill it?  As exhibit 14  shows, banks’ regulatory capital ratios look fairly robust, but for large banks, the ratio  of tangible common equity to tangible assets—a metric that investors and rating  agencies follow closely—looks much more precarious  Most important, losses come  first out of common equity  Replacing those losses at current share prices implies  potentially massive dilution for current shareholders  As a result, bank equity prices  remain under severe pressure—as can be seen in exhibits 15, 16, and 17  To scale  just how far bank equity prices have fallen, the market cap of all US banks  (including investment banks) is now about the same as the market cap of the soft  drink industry                           January 27–28, 2009 17 of 267  The downward pressure on US and European bank stocks is reinforced by  uncertainty about the form and size of government intervention, particularly for the  weakest players, which are viewed as closer to insolvency or government assistance   Even if some investors view banks as having significant long-term value, the  possibility of government dilution or even nationalization discourages capital  injections from the private sector  In contrast, government support of banks has  capped their credit spreads, which you can see in exhibits 18, 19, and 20  Although  credit tiering is evident in CDS spreads, the level of bank CDS for both US and  foreign banks has remained in the high end of the investment-grade range  Equity  holders may expect to be wiped out, but debt holders clearly view the probability of  losses as fairly low   Market expectations that large-scale fiscal action will need to be taken in support  of the economy and the financial system have had a significant effect on sovereign  credit default swap spreads The CDS spreads in exhibit 21 have risen because the  expected fiscal cost has soared and because of uncertainty about the ultimate size of  the bill—which will depend critically on global economic growth and on the  magnitude of government assistance to financial institutions  Not surprisingly, CDS  spreads for small countries with relatively large financial services sector—such as the  United Kingdom, Spain, and Ireland—have increased proportionally the most  In  recent weeks, movements in sovereign CDS spreads have mirrored movements in the  countries’ bank CDS spreads   Accompanying the increase in sovereign CDS spreads has been a pronounced  steepening of yield curves in the major economies  Exhibit 22 shows that in recent  weeks Treasury yields in the United States are up at all maturities, but the increases in  longer-term yields are particularly large—the 30-year is up about 40 basis points in  the last week and a half or so Part of this increase is likely due to short-run supply  increases In the next few weeks, $150 billion of new Treasury coupon securities will  be auctioned, and this week alone, we are auctioning $200 billion of Treasury bills,  notes, and bonds Given illiquid market conditions, we shouldn’t be surprised to see  a rise in yields that is somewhat exaggerated  Nonetheless, with large and sustained  fiscal deficits on the horizon, somewhat higher borrowing rates are not too surprising   Finally, a few words about monetary policy expectations  The results of the  Desk’s latest dealer survey are shown in exhibit 23  Neither the dealers nor the  futures markets expect any change in the target fed funds range in the near term   Dealer economists expect the current fed funds target range to be maintained well  into 2010, reflecting widespread views that the combination of a deep recession and  continued financial crisis will require easy monetary conditions for some time to  come  Spence will now discuss the balance sheet and the use of facilities    Thank you I am going to discuss long-term Treasury purchases  by the SOMA for a few minutes  Last week, we circulated a memo outlining four  options with respect to the long-term Treasury purchase program  To summarize   Option 1 is to retain purchases as an option but not to implement at this time; option 2  is to implement a pilot program; option 3 is to implement a large-scale purchase  program; and option 4 is to purchase illiquid long-term Treasuries not with the  explicit goal of bringing down longer-term yields but to improve Treasury market  functioning In addition, of course, there was an implicit option of announcing that a  long-term Treasury purchase program was completely off the table  The staff  recommended option 1—retain the program as an option that continues to be  evaluated but don’t implement at the current time     The staff demurred from implementing such a program at this time for five  reasons First, for the further expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that  would be needed, this program was viewed as likely to be less effective dollar for  dollar in easing financial conditions than programs more directly linked to credit  formation and to markets with more impaired liquidity  Second, it was unclear how  big such a program would need to be to push down yields significantly from their  current quite low levels A large program might not do much at these levels  In that  case, the program would be an especially inefficient use of balance sheet capacity   Third, such a program could potentially distort the relationship between Treasury and  private-sector yields, affecting Treasury yields while having little effect on private  rates This could potentially undermine the value of Treasuries as a hedging vehicle   Fourth, such a program might even have adverse effects  In particular, some  commentators would almost certainly argue that such purchases amounted simply to  “monetizing the federal deficit”  Although it is difficult to assess what effect such  arguments would have on financial markets, worries on this score could conceivably  lead to higher risk premiums, which could undermine the program’s effectiveness   Fifth, the program would increase the interest rate risk inherent in the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet because the long-term Treasuries would be funded by excess  reserves—an overnight obligation This means that, if short-term rates rose in the  future, the Fed’s net interest margin could be squeezed, potentially generating losses  for taxpayers   The staff does recommend, however, keeping the program alive as an option   After all, some of the decline in Treasury yields since early December may be due to                          January 27–28, 2009 24 of 267  expectations of such a program in the future  If the Committee endorses the staff’s  recommendation, to retain it as an option but not implement it at this time, will long­ term Treasury yields rise significantly—say more than 10 or 20 basis points?  That  does not seem likely First, most market participants, even those that believe the  FOMC will purchase long-term Treasuries eventually, do not anticipate that the  Federal Reserve will necessarily begin purchases right away  They generally believe  that, with Treasury yields as low as they are currently, there is no need to commence  such a purchase program immediately  Second, market participants are placing a  probability of only about 50 percent that such a program will be implemented at all   That’s based on our latest primary dealer survey  If the program is kept on the shelf  and remains a part of the tool kit and that is clearly communicated to the market via  the FOMC statement, we would anticipate that this would generate at most only a  modest backup in Treasury yields Finally, the note distributed last week also  contained some observations about some of the other options for moving ahead with  purchases at this point and discussed some of the execution issues raised by the  purchase program  I’ll now turn to Nathan, who will continue our presentation    Potentially fairly large—particularly if we are considering more than one   large institution In the scenario that Nathan laid out, which is the risk that we are considering,   we think it is somewhat less likely that we would use these lines for the sort of operations that   most of our foreign central bank counterparties are using to distribute dollars, which are   operations and tenders that are open to all We don’t see that kind of need across a broad group   of institutions and a broad group of banks around the United States  But there is certainly a   subset of institutions, many of them quite large with very sizable foreign exchange funding, that   fund themselves in Asia, Europe, and South America  Should those institutions end up being in   worse financial shape, many of them actually have quite substantial collateral with us at the   discount windows in the various Districts But they would not need funding in dollars  They            January 27–28, 2009 29 of 267  would want to come to us instead and, for example, take out a discount loan—they could do it   through other mechanisms—in a foreign currency rather than in dollars  The way that we would   then finance it—given the relatively modest size of our foreign exchange reserves and the fact   that the reserves are only in two currencies—would be to establish swap lines and fund them that   way    The way that we structure the foreign exchange swaps now is at a fixed   exchange rate for both the front and the back leg, so that we don’t have—     January 27–28, 2009 30 of 267   We would basically get back the dollars that we gave to them    That is the part that is still being worked out  I am sorry—I   misunderstood your question  We would bear, for example, through the discount window the   risk of lending in yen and euro  Obviously, the collateral would be in dollars, and the foreign   exchange risk would be—    My view is that the credit default swap market has taken a lot of abuse   for many things that would have happened even if it didn’t exist    There have been a few times, certainly, that the peculiarities of the   structure of the CDS market have led to more-volatile changes in spreads from one day to the   next But, quite honestly, it is a more liquid market  It probably gives you a truer price signal   for the vast majority of credits out there, particularly large corporations, both financial and   nonfinancial, than the corporate bond market does  When market liquidity goes away and it is   harder to discern fundamental movements in asset prices, the less liquid market—and that is   definitely corporate bonds—gives you the worst signal, and the CDS market probably gives you   a better signal Given the size of the CDS market, the rapidity with which it grew, the size to   which it grew, and the fact that it is a little the dog that didn’t bark and that there were certainly   problems with the Lehman bankruptcy and a lot of technical issues, my view is that, frankly, it   has been one of the markets that has continued to function—not wonderfully, but it still   functions—and some liquidity is still there  Others may have a slightly different view, but that   has been our experience    I think they are probably less distorted—certainly in the case of   corporates    I don’t think we are nearly far enough along in this process, nor have we   spoken in sufficient detail to either our bank supervisory or our discount window colleagues to   make that judgment, frankly  At this point, the fact that I know is that quite a significant amount   of collateral is posted within the Federal Reserve System at the discount window that is not   currently being borrowed against  That is, honestly, probably as much as we can say at this   stage But, clearly, that would be a set of conversations we would have to have    For what it is worth, I think that the signal to markets of closing even the   dormant facilities, given my obvious view about how fragile things are, could actually have a   pretty serious, significant, adverse effect, even though they are not being used  They are viewed   very much—particularly the two facilities you mentioned and particularly the MMIFF—as a   backstop We don’t need it now It is not priced attractively, frankly, given the spreads in   markets  But should we go through another period, heaven forbid, like September and October,   it would be used, according to market participants        January 27–28, 2009 49 of 267   May I add one parenthetical point to that?  The swaps—unlike the   TALF, for example—are priced at a penalty to market rates, and to the extent that market spreads   do come down, as we have seen in the past two months, swap lines do self-liquidate  They have   declined very noticeably—they were nearly $600 billion at one point  As the spreads come in,   effectively the private sector comes in and undercuts the central bank, which was by design    1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial market developments   during the intermeeting period have been driven largely by three factors  continued   sharp deterioration in global economic conditions, uncertainty and pessimism about   the health of financial firms, particularly commercial banks, and reactions to a wide   range of unconventional policy measures by many central banks and governments    Despite last week’s rally, as exhibit 1 shows, global equity prices are sharply   lower The S&P 500 has fallen 16 percent since the beginning of the year  Of course   this is much better than a week ago; as of last Monday, the S&P 500 was down                       March 17–18, 2009 4 of 266  25 percent for the year Foreign stock markets, which had fallen 15 percent to  25 percent from the beginning of the year to a week ago Monday, are now down  “only” 5 percent to 17 percent for the year This, of course, reflects the deep, nearly  global recession which has occurred in response to the financial crisis  The sharp  contraction in credit is now a global phenomenon, resulting in credit losses,  write-downs, and financial deleveraging occurring nearly everywhere   Financial firms also had a bit of a respite last week, in part based on predictions of  better first quarter earnings, but overall they remain very distressed  The continued  uncertainty regarding both the health of financial firms as well as the nature of  government assistance programs has weighed on their capital structures  As can be  seen in exhibit 2, both common and preferred equity indexes for financial firms are  down sharply during the intermeeting period  In fact, preferred equity of financials  has fallen more than 20 percent since late January, while common equity prices are  down less than 10 percent, reflecting increased risk of suspended dividends or  conversion of preferred equity to common  This trend is even more pronounced for  those firms that have already received government capital and, thus, for which the  possibility of losses further up the capital structure is perceived to be largest   Perhaps more jarring is the very large widening of financial firms’ CDS spreads  in recent weeks, which can be seen in exhibits 3 through 5  Bank CDS spreads are  now significantly wider than they were during the height of the financial turmoil last  fall, following the Lehman bankruptcy This is truly extraordinary in light of the  government programs that have been announced or expanded in recent weeks  the  FDIC guarantee program, the announcement of the Administration’s stabilization  plan, and several public statements that systemically important firms will not be  allowed to fail during the current crisis   The widening of CDS spreads reflects several factors  First, in the US, there is  deep concern that the current bank stress assessment will result in actual or de facto  nationalization of some institutions; this raises the possibility that debt holders as well  as equity holders will take a hit Second, financial firms with more opaque balance  sheets—commercial banks, insurance companies, and some finance companies, such  as GE Capital—have experienced larger increases in CDS spreads  The lack of  clarity about the size of “toxic” assets and how legacy accrual assets will be marked  has led to questions about their viability  In fact it’s notable that the CDS spreads of  the two former investment banks, which largely mark their balance sheets to market,  have not widened in recent weeks, although they remain at very high levels  Third,  market liquidity continues to deteriorate in nearly every market where the Fed has not  intervened, including CDS  Thus, the price impact of even small CDS trades and  small positions can move spreads sharply; for example, a relatively small number of  investors continuing to take short positions in financial CDS may be responsible for  the bulk of the price action in recent weeks  Finally, and perhaps most importantly,  investors are very concerned about whether the “strings” attached to government  assistance for financial institutions or markets will be changed in the future  In  particular, the risk that the “rules of the game” for debt investors will be changed—                       March 17–18, 2009 5 of 266  after investments have been made—has risen sharply in recent weeks  To quote a  member of our Treasury Market Practices Group, “the rules coming from Washington  change every other day; no one is willing to invest in anything”  It’s worth noting  that this risk extends beyond investments in banks and is a reason that some investors  are not planning to use the TALF, no matter how attractive the economics of the  program may be   In response to continued deterioration in both economic and financial conditions,  central banks around the world have eased monetary policy conditions to an  unprecedented degree in recent weeks  Of the G-20 central banks, eighteen have  eased monetary policy since the beginning of the year  In addition, exhibit 6 shows  that most of the major central banks have lowered interest rates to near zero and  embarked on programs to expand their balance sheets through additional liquidity  programs as well as credit-easing and quantitative-easing programs  Credit-easing  programs have generally focused on purchases of commercial paper and corporate  bonds outside of the US In the US, the investment-grade corporate bond market is  the rare credit market that is operating fairly normally, but this is not the case in many  countries   The local market responses to these new programs—some of which I will discuss  in a moment—have generally been positive, but their relative impact globally is  harder to discern In particular, movements in major dollar FX rates (exhibit 7) do  not appear to be closely related to changes in policy stance, the degree of central bank  balance sheet expansion, or relative economic prospects  For example, one might  expect the euro, or at least the Canadian dollar, to have appreciated relative to the  US dollar since the beginning of the year, given the euro area’s higher policy rates  and the Canadian economy’s relative stability  But, in fact, the dollar has appreciated  against nearly every major currency since the beginning of the year  Certainly, the  dollar’s position as a reserve currency and its continued status as a safe haven have  contributed to its appreciation   Last week’s intervention by the Swiss National Bank to weaken the Swiss franc  relative to the euro (exhibit 8) is one reflection of concern over the deflationary  impact of an appreciating currency  The SNB’s intervention last Thursday pushed the  Swiss franc down nearly 3½ percent relative to the euro in a matter of minutes   While the SNB does not plan to engage in ongoing competitive devaluations,  preventing a sharp appreciation of the currency, particularly vis-à-vis the euro, is a  key component in its quantitative-easing plan to prevent deflation   However, the United Kingdom probably wins the prize for the most aggressive  quantitative-easing plan, at least in terms of its timetable  Two weeks ago, the Bank  of England announced an asset-purchase program focused on commercial paper,  corporate bonds, and government securities  Given the limited size of UK credit  markets, the BOE announced that the majority of the purchases will be of government  bonds, and specifically over the next three months they will purchase as much as  £75 billion of gilts in the 5- to 25-year maturity range                                    March 17–18, 2009 6 of 266  The planned BOE gilt purchases amount to 5 percent of UK GDP, nearly  12 percent of total gilts, and 18 percent of nominal gilts held by the public  To put  this in some perspective, a similar-sized program in the United States, by these  metrics, would entail purchases of US Treasuries ranging from $585 billion up to  nearly $750 billion over a three-month period     Since the announcement, gilt yields have fallen 19, 53, and 79 basis points in the  5-, 10-, and 20-year maturities, respectively, but 2-year yields have risen 38 basis  points—they are not buying 2-year gilts  As shown in exhibit 9, most of this was an  announcement effect  Interestingly, the spread between the policy rate and the  10-year yield in the UK (exhibit 10) did not decline  In other words, long-term  yields have fallen in parallel with the policy rate  Finally, private credit yields did  decline with the policy action, particularly corporate bonds, which the Bank of  England will also purchase However, as noted in exhibit 11, other yields, notably  swaps, fell significantly less than government yields, leading to an increase in swap  spreads   Turning now to our own asset-purchase programs, we have continued to purchase  both agency MBS and debt at a steady pace  Agency debt purchases now amount to  nearly $47 billion and MBS outright purchases total $219 billion, as well as an  additional $69 billion in dollar rolls, which I will discuss in a moment  Exhibit 12  shows that the spreads of both agency debt and MBS to Treasury yields have been  fairly stable since the last FOMC meeting  Notably, however, the conforming  mortgage rate to households has continued to decline to about 5⅛ percent   There are several reasons for this, including the introduction of our dollar roll  program in early March  In the first week of March, there was a nearly 100 basis  point drop in the forward financing rate for MBS relative to the MBS cash repo rate  (exhibit 13)  You may recall that the dollar roll market is like a “repo” market for  forward delivery of agency MBS To give an example, the March–April dollar roll  transaction, which is what we’re purchasing now, is a transaction that simultaneously  purchases MBS for delivery in March and sells identical MBS to be delivered in  April By participating in the dollar roll market, we have lowered the cost of  managing mortgage inventory and moved forward financing spreads back to levels  that prevailed before last fall’s turmoil   In addition, as the refinancing wave from January abates, mortgage lenders’  ability to process new mortgages has increased, and they have tended to lower rates to  borrowers Finally, retail spreads, while high, have come down because of the  improved liquidity and predictability of conditions in the secondary mortgage market   Since our purchase program began in January, other investors and arbitrageurs have  “followed” us into the MBS market  Not only are bid-asked spreads lower, but, as  shown in exhibit 14, the daily price volatility of new MBS has declined steadily,  reducing uncertainty about prices at which new mortgages can be sold                            March 17–18, 2009 7 of 266  While our MBS purchase program has helped to lower MBS spreads from the  exceptional levels seen last fall, they remain very high by historical standards, as  shown in exhibit 15 In contrast to the Treasury yield curve, which is shown in  exhibit 16, mortgage spreads do not appear to have a predictable relationship to the  business cycle  The Treasury curve, while steep, seems consistent with past episodes  of economic weakness   In anticipation of Dave’s and Joe’s discussion of large-scale asset purchases,  exhibit 17 scales our asset purchases so far relative to upcoming new issuance  To  date, the MBS program purchases are very close in size to the overall new issuance in  the MBS market  However, market expectations are for a large refinancing wave  during 2009 (the result of low rates and mortgage relief programs)  The median  estimate is for $18 trillion in new issuance, but estimates vary widely—from under  $1 trillion to $3 trillion For comparison, a median estimate of long-term Treasury  issuance is also shown At our current pace of purchasing, we will not keep up with  expected new MBS issuance   Finally, I want to say a few words about policy expectations and the impact of our  programs  Exhibit 18 shows the results of the Desk’s latest survey of dealer  economists along with market-implied expectations for the future policy rate  Most  dealers continue to expect policy rates to stay close to zero until at least the second  quarter of 2010 and to remain below 1 percent into 2011  Market-implied  expectations continue to be skewed upward, but we believe this probably reflects the  high risk premiums in future Eurodollar rates rather than an accurate reading of  policy expectations   Markets directly supported by Fed programs continued to function reasonably  well However, as seen in exhibit 19, both secured and unsecured money market  rates have increased modestly in recent weeks  The increase in LIBOR rates largely  reflects increased credit risk of banks and is consistent with the rise in bank CDS  spreads The rise in Treasury repo rates, in contrast, reflects the large Treasury  issuance and associated ample supply of Treasury collateral for lending   Spreads on consumer-asset-backed securities have narrowed somewhat since the  last FOMC meeting in anticipation of the first TALF subscription, which opened  today Our expectations for the first TALF subscription are modest, with a few  billion dollars of lending against ABS, most likely backed by auto and credit card  lending Bill will be saying more about the TALF in a few minutes   Spence will discuss various aspects of the balance sheet in more detail  However,  I would like to point out in exhibit 20 the continued decline in the size of our balance  sheet, as the liquidity programs shrink at a faster rate than our purchase programs  increase On a related operational note  Demand for borrowing Treasury securities  from our term securities lending facility has continued to decline, with operations for  both Schedule 1 and 2 collateral consistently undersubscribed  TSLF operations are  very staff-intensive, so we are proposing to reduce the frequency of Schedule 2                    March 17–18, 2009 8 of 266  auctions from the biweekly schedule that was implemented during the market turmoil  last fall back to the original weekly schedule  We plan to maintain the overall size of  the TSLF program for the present but will continue to assess whether changes may be  appropriate in the future  I’ll now turn it over to Bill Nelson who will discuss the  TALF    It does not, according to the authorization—but I’ll bow to Debbie for   greater wisdom on that    Yes, correct    It’s a different kind of flexibility  In the mortgage-backed securities   program, although we do buy across the curve in all coupons, we are focused very much on the   TBA, or the forward delivery market, which trades weeks and months in advance of delivery  If   that’s the market that you’re trading and buying in, you have a huge amount of flexibility from   day to day to respond to prices in that market and just to buy more forward contracts or fewer or   do a dollar roll and offset some of those if you have to  But then on delivery day you get, as we   did last week, $160 billion of securities  So in that sense of flexibility—can you respond daily to   market events, for example, tighter spreads, narrower spreads?—it’s very easy to do  That’s a   very deep, liquid market; it’s a very homogeneous market, even though what you get delivered is   fairly heterogeneous In the Treasury market, it’s a different kind of flexibility  We can buy in   various parts of the Treasury curve  In the mortgage market, it’s very hard to move around the   mortgage yield curve easily, but it’s easy to do that in the Treasury curve  So I’m not quite sure   what you mean by flexibility If you mean sheer quantity, they’re probably about the same    Next day    Several times a month, but yes  It depends on the type of security, but   yes, basically once a month    Well, it’s once a month per type of security  So there are actually   several days a month    But it’s very periodic and very, very predictable when they’re going to   settle    I also would defer to the supervisors on this  But we have had   conversations with the supervisory teams of a couple of these institutions (not just the one) since   we decided that it was worth investigating, and nearly all of them are deleveraging abroad as   they are deleveraging here and attempting to reduce their liquidity risk  I think that eliminating   that risk in a really short period of time is probably unrealistic, considering the size and scope of   operations, including very traditional banking operations—which, we all know, are subject to   runs—that several of these institutions have in many countries  And many of those countries do   not have, for example, the deposit insurance schemes that the United States does, which means   the institutions are more vulnerable there  I think the possibility of completely shutting down   and eliminating the risk in a short period of time is probably unrealistic, although movement in   that direction is a good idea    My impression is that they are moving in that direction  I wouldn’t   superimpose my views over the supervisors’ about whether they’re doing everything they can    Yes, I had a comment about how long this goes on  It seems—both from   our MBS purchase program and from the UK’s announcement—that a huge amount of the   interest rate effect happens on announcement, not on execution  It doesn’t grow over time as the   purchases get bigger and bigger and bigger Boom—the rates fall  Discerning spread changes   from the purchase levels is very tricky business, and so is the macro effect—I wouldn’t venture   there But that announcement effect happens because of the assumption that the central banks   are going to keep buying for a while, not that they’re just going to do it for a month or two and   then stop the program and go away  I am fairly certain that in the US we’ll see that reaction in   mortgage spreads—if the determination was made to stop in July, the forward rates in July would   pop right up and we’d be back to approximately where we were in January  There’s a question   already arising about what the Bank of England is going to do after three months    Yes    Not to be too technical here, but because this swap would be cash   collateral, in that sense there’s not a loan actually  The institution would have to produce cash   dollars and get cash yen, or whatever, on the other side  If they’re in the middle of a distress   situation, where do they get that cash?  Well, they’re probably going to be getting it from the   discount window, honestly, or perhaps from the PDCF or somewhere else in order to execute this   transaction So if there’s lending going on to an institution like this, it would be lending in   dollars We don’t want to impose where the cash dollars come from, as a practical matter  We   don’t know quite where their collateral might be  It might be in the PDCF  It might be in their   bank And it seemed, therefore, that to separate the liquidity swap part out from the lending part   might actually have a few virtues    There’s a completely different set of limitations, namely, how much the   payment and settlement system can handle, depending on how compressed we make these   purchases We have not done this yet for Treasuries, but for mortgage-backed securities, we   think that if we tried to buy $1½ to $2 trillion more this year, we would come close to breaking   it    It’s possible there’s a workaround for those sorts of things  But if there   is, we’d have to start it tomorrow    I think where the LIBOR rates are well inside, for example, one week   and one month, those are the operations that are most undersubscribed and least used  There’s           March 17–18, 2009 53 of 266  more in three-month, where the market rates are still more elevated—again, this is reflecting   credit risk and balance sheet constraints at institutions and how long they’re willing to lend to   each other   I think the ultimate question is  If things continue to improve, will the swaps ultimately   wind all the way down to zero?  I think there’s probably a risk that there would still be a few   institutions that would like to continue to borrow, and we’ll just have to take away the punch   bowl when the time comes  But, like Nathan, I’m encouraged that, as rates come down, and in   particular, as we basically get underbid by the market, the facility usage drops off pretty quickly    So as long as that trend continues, I think we’re fine  Whether, in the end, we have to take it   away is a possibility—we’ve had those discussions with the other central banks    It’s more liquid than anything else  [Laughter] But that’s a pretty sad   statement at this stage  There are, in fact, huge price gaps between the different pieces of the   Treasury curve One of the things we do by going in is actually to improve liquidity, particularly   at the long end, and hopefully help to bring down yields that way as well It is interesting—and   this is a point I made in my presentation—that our presence in the mortgage-backed securities   market, particularly the large presence in the TBA market, which is the forward liquid part of the                  March 17–18, 2009 97 of 266  market, has improved liquidity tremendously, according to the asset managers we’ve been using    I think our buying Treasuries would hopefully have some effect there, too    Yes    It partly depends on where we would buy  I don’t want to get too   technical here, but I think we’d probably start not with the rates you see every day—the on-the­  runs—we’d probably start with the off-the-runs where we can improve liquidity  Normally as   the off-the-runs come down, part of that would be the spread to the on-the-runs that would come   down as well—hopefully it’s low   We would move across the curve I think the strategy—which we’re in the process of   working out, because we weren’t so sure that we were going to be doing this—would be to start   there, but to go to recently issued securities, where there’s a little bit of liquidity but not a lot  In   terms of the size of the effect, honestly, I don’t think we have any better estimates than the ones   that Joe gave you We’re guessing there would be a very large announcement effect, of the order   of magnitude that Joe said  Once we got going—let’s say it’s $500 billion, and people figure out   how much per week approximately we were going to do—we’d move back and forth across the              March 17–18, 2009 98 of 266  curve We would announce in advance approximately over a course of weeks what tenors of the   curve we would be buying—not exact days and exact amounts, because we don’t want to get   front-run that badly, but we’d want to give folks a sense of where we were going  If we thought   there were particular distortions in one part of the curve, we would focus more there  So we’re   doing something somewhat analogous to the way we are managing the MBS program  We don’t   have an explicit target, but when both retail rates get high and mortgage spreads get high, the   investment managers know to buy more, and we would take the same approach    Absolutely    Absolutely It would still be steep, but not as steep as it is now    Yes, and it’s typical    Bid-asked spreads, trade depth, how much size of a trade you could put   through, how easy it is to hedge    Correct We want other people to follow us in  Our volume alone is not   going to do it That’s clear If others don’t follow us in, it won’t work  What’s interesting about   the MBS market is that volumes were low, bid-askeds were very wide, and daily price volatility   bounced all over the place So if you actually wanted to sell any mortgages, it was very hard to   figure out where they were going to price What has happened since we have come in is that   others have come in after us, because our managers add a little stability—if the price gets too   high, they buy a little more that day; they buy less if it’s a little low  So they temper their   purchases on a day-to-day basis  I don’t know if we’d do it literally day to day for Treasuries,   but we would do it over time    And the number was—this is our best guess—an additional $2 trillion of   mortgage-backed securities, that might strain it    That’s a very hard question to answer  I am concerned that a very small   quantity would be seen as ineffective, and part of this is about the announcement effect, not to   mention the liquidity effect  Could it be less than $500 billion? Yes  We calculated about how   much we would have to buy every week, and we’d go in two or three times a week with several   billion dollars every time  So these would be sizable transactions from our perspective  It could   be scaled back a bit, but I wouldn’t want to put it at $100 billion or $200 billion, not over a nine-  month period I’m afraid it wouldn’t be effective    Because the deadline is tomorrow, not surprisingly, we have no one who   has signed on the dotted line We have, however, three very serious issues—two of them auto-  related, one of them credit card-related—that appear at this stage pretty likely to go through    There do seem to be at least enough customer-to-dealer contracts signed, or in the process of   being signed My ballpark guesstimate, based on the numbers I’ve seen, is $5 billion—could be   $8 billion—total Quite frankly, before the machinations of the last week and a half, I don’t   think we truly anticipated more than $5 to $10 billion in the first subscription  There’s been no   price discovery in this market for several months  And just on those grounds alone, many issuers   and investors might be somewhat reluctant to be first in the TALF    Well, we’ve launched it in the sense that the subscription is open and   that lending has happened    The $500 billion would largely extend the buying through the end of the   year If the Committee has a preference that those be front-loaded, that would be possible for us   to do from an operational standpoint  As a matter of fact, if the Committee would be interested        March 17–18, 2009 174 of 266  in giving us direction on that, we’d be happy to take it  Honestly, the additional $500 billion   would not be a huge surprise to the market  I think the expectation of most is that $500 billion at   the same pace through the end of the year is a likely outcome of today’s meeting    If we accelerate, particularly on the mortgage side, and front-load those,   I would view it as very unlikely Spence probably has a better feel on the liquidity programs  A   little shrinkage there might occur, but, particularly if we add Treasuries and we are more   aggressive on the mortgage side, I would view it as very unlikely that the base would shrink    Yes, that’s right  In thinking about the base, because the settlements are   so lumpy we probably have to switch a week forward and note that even though the base might   shrink one week, it will jump up a lot the next when all of the MBS settle    Yes    I think I can say with some confidence that, if we buy a lot of mortgages,   by the middle of May it’s very unlikely that the monetary base will be shrinking, and it will grow   fairly aggressively, because the big settlements in mortgage-backed securities tend to happen in   the middle of the month    Yes I think there might be better tools for doing that, though  Honestly,   if that were the guidance given, we would probably go back to doing repos    We’d immediately get the question  What’s the breakdown between   Treasuries and MBS?  And what are you going to do about agencies?  But the agency debt   market is the simple part to answer, because that’s a much smaller market  I think we’d end up   having to give a hint, or they would take away from our first two operations what your   preferences were, whether that was correct or not    I would say in fact, to President Rosengren’s point, one might actually   want it to be front-loaded    That’s all right I had something very similar to Brian’s  I actually stole   the last sentence from alternative A    About either the pace of purchases or the size of the balance sheet?    Yes We could say, “The Committee anticipates that the combination of   outright purchases and various liquidity facilities outstanding will cause the size of the Federal   Reserve’s balance sheet to expand in the coming months”  We’re a little hesitant to pick the next   intermeeting period because of the lumpiness of mortgages, honestly  But if that would suffice,   we think that would work best from our perspective     1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial conditions have improved   modestly in the last month and a half, reacting to aggressive policy actions in many   countries, some improvement in the near-term outlook for the largest financial firms,   and tentative signs that the free fall in global economic activity may be leveling off a   bit Equities are up, credit spreads are narrower, the dollar is weaker (that’s probably   a good sign in this environment), volatility is down, and liquidity in many markets   has improved  Despite these modest improvements, financial markets and   institutions, by any normal measure, are very stressed  In short, the calm in markets   is very uneasy, and continued improvement will depend critically on upcoming policy   initiatives—particularly the outcome of the capital assessment program (CAP)—and   of course, on the evolution of the macroeconomy    The May 4 release of the CAP results is a major risk event for financial markets,   probably the largest since the passage of the TARP legislation last fall  Importantly,   the risk surrounds not so much the disclosure of which large banks are likely to need   additional capital in a stressed environment or even how much capital they might   need Those can be estimated  The important new information in the CAP release is   the plan for how those capital holes will be filled, including what next steps banks   will need to take, how and when government capital may be used, and what   conditions will be imposed upon the banks  Lack of clarity about standards and   future actions is likely to lead to even greater uncertainty about the future viability of   large banks, and it increases significantly the risk of bank runs—in either wholesale   or retail markets    As exhibit 1 shows, credit default swap spreads have narrowed in recent weeks, as   macro news has been less dire and equity markets have rallied  High-yield spreads   have fallen more than 500 basis points since early March, and notably cash bond   spreads of both investment-grade and high-yield corporates have fallen even more   than CDS spreads, signaling some improvement in corporate bond market liquidity    Credit spreads of financial firms have also narrowed—by more than 100 basis points    1 The materials used by Ms Mosser are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)              April 28–29, 2009 4 of 201  since early March—but much of the narrowing has occurred outside the US banking  sector Concern about the nature of government intervention in the banking industry  has prevented a significant narrowing in spreads, despite stronger equity prices  A  comparison of exhibits 2 and 3 makes this clear  Despite rising stock prices and  declining volatility, most US bank CDS spreads have widened in the last month and  a half In contrast, European banks, whose equity price performance is similar to that  of US banks, have had a narrowing of CDS spreads   Setting the CAP and the political environment aside for the moment, exhibit 4  shows that banks’ first-quarter performance surprised to the upside, with most large  global banks beating the Q1 earnings expectations, in some cases by wide margins   That said, however, the quality and the sustainability of these earnings have been  questioned, and the uncertainty about banks’ ability to absorb future losses—  particularly related to consumers, leveraged loans, and commercial real estate—  remains high  As you can see in the last column, regulatory capital ratios for most  large US banks exceed requirements, but their ratios of common equity to capital (in  the third column) remain quite low  Tangible common equity relative to assets has  become the de facto measure of bank health for most market participants, for a couple  of reasons First, losses have to be covered by revenue and common equity, and  given market uncertainty about the future size of bank losses, more common equity is  viewed as a sign of health regardless of other types of capital  Second, the public  policy focus on potential needs for additional common equity (directly or through  convertible preferred equity) has increased the market’s focus on that measure  It is  particularly interesting to note that European banks, in the bottom half of the table,  have significantly lower tangible common equity ratios (and regulatory ratios) than  US firms  Moreover, most analysts believe that European banks are not as far along  in writing down their assets as their US counterparts, and they have proportionally  more recession-related losses ahead of them  Nonetheless, European bank equity  performance has been about the same as that for US banks; and as I noted earlier,  European bank credit spreads have narrowed, whereas those of US banks have  widened   Another measure of the near-term uncertainty regarding US banks can be seen in  the term structure of bank CDS spreads in exhibit 5  Normally CDS term structures  slope up slightly However, currently banks’ CDS spreads are inverted, suggesting  that if banks can survive the next two years, then the probability that senior debt  holders will face losses is significantly diminished   Despite the hand-wringing over the near-term future of the banks, liquidity  conditions in many markets have improved  In particular, some of the unexploited  profit opportunities that we have noted in the past are now actually being exploited   For example, in exhibit 6, the spread between three-month funding in the foreign  exchange swap market relative to LIBOR has narrowed to pre-crisis levels  This  reflects better liquidity and trading conditions as well as a willingness of banks and  others to take some additional risk onto their balance sheets  Similarly, exhibit 7  shows a decline in the average absolute difference between actual and modeled                      April 28–29, 2009 5 of 201  Treasury yields, reflecting an increased willingness by market participants—banks,  dealers, hedge funds, and so forth—to commit balance sheets and to arbitrage away  the price differences in the Treasury market   At the bottom of the page, exhibit 8 shows jumbo and conforming 30-year  mortgage rates Not only have both mortgage rates come down, but the spread  between them (in orange) has actually narrowed since the last FOMC meeting  You  might well be surprised at this  After all, the secondary market for securitizing jumbo  mortgages remains closed, and the Fed purchase program is focused solely on  conforming mortgages  So one might expect that, whatever effect the Fed’s program  has had in lowering conforming rates, this progress could well be to the detriment of  the jumbo market  But that is not what has happened  Jumbo rates appear to have  fallen about 50 basis points in response to the decline in Treasury yields after the  March FOMC meeting and notably have remained at those levels since then   I have already highlighted one market response to our Treasury purchase  program; let me turn there next  As you can see in exhibit 9, the FOMC’s program to  purchase $300 billion in long-term Treasuries by September had an immediate  announcement impact on long-term Treasury yields  But since then, long yields have  drifted higher and are now just 10 to 15 basis points below the pre-March FOMC  levels Of course, it’s hard to know the counterfactual here  Given the large quantity  of new Treasury issuance and less dismal macro news, Treasury yields might be well  above their mid-March levels in the absence of Fed purchases  We are more  encouraged by the effect of the purchase program on volatility and liquidity   Exhibit 10 shows that implied volatility in both Treasury and swaps markets fell  sharply on the announcement and have remained low  Actual volatility has fallen as  well Market participants tell us that, although our purchases may not prevent long­ term Treasury yields from rising, they expect that such increases will be more orderly  because of our regular presence in the market  Market participants are already  discussing (and pricing) what may happen when the Treasury purchase program ends   At present, most expect that the Treasury purchase program will be expanded and  extended beyond September However, the risk that the program may expire in  September is reflected in options prices  Implied volatility over the next six months  has fallen, but volatility over the subsequent six months has been rising in recent  weeks The Desk is focusing its purchases in the 2-to-10-year segment of the  Treasury curve, consistent with the FOMC’s directive to help improve conditions in  private credit markets  As you can see from exhibit 11, we are making smaller  purchases outside this target range—to the disappointment of some market  participants—but will continue to concentrate most of the $300 billion in purchases  between two and ten years Somewhat to our surprise, we are purchasing a sizable  amount of on-the-run Treasuries  Because of the very large amount of new Treasury  supply and the continued pressure on dealers to keep their balance sheets small, on­ the-runs are being offered to us in large sizes and at quite competitive prices relative  to the market  One last note about the Treasury market  This Friday a new market  standard of charging for failures to deliver in the Treasury market will go into effect   While we wholeheartedly believe that this will improve Treasury market liquidity              April 28–29, 2009 6 of 201  when interest rates are low by reducing the incentives to deliberately fail, there may  be some anomalous Treasury movements in upcoming weeks as market participants  adjust to the new standard   Turning to the mortgage-backed-securities purchase program, exhibit 12 shows  the daily pattern of our agency MBS purchases, including the step-up in average size  after the March FOMC meeting  Our purchases have been a little smoother in recent  weeks largely because volatility is lower  Early on we bought more on days when  MBS prices were low and less on days when prices were high  As volatility has  declined, there are fewer of those days  In addition, because volatility is lower,  originators are selling more forward and at a steady pace, which is reflected in our  purchases We are purchasing TBAs (the forward MBS) at about $135 billion per  month, although we anticipate that delivery will be lumpy and that June deliveries of  MBS, in particular, may be very large  Exhibit 13 shows a limited announcement  effect on agency MBS and mortgage rates after the March FOMC  Since then,  however, primary rates have drifted lower, and secondary MBS yields have been  stable, despite the rise in Treasury yields  Given the size of our MBS purchase  program, we are not surprised at our ability to influence secondary-market MBS  yields, but we have a more limited ability to influence primary mortgage rates  The  good news is that the primary–secondary mortgage spread has not widened with the  recent large refinancing wave (unlike earlier this year), but overall the spread remains  quite wide by historical standards The spread is affected by a number of other  factors, including fees charged by the GSEs; the costs of hedging mortgage  inventories, servicing spreads, and valuations; and the pricing power and capacity  constraints of the originators Unfortunately, our purchases can help to influence only  some of these factors—specifically, hedging and pipeline costs—and the  Administration’s housing program can help to lower GSE costs and servicer costs,  but the other factors (in particular, pricing power and capacity constraints) may, in the  future, work to push spreads higher Exhibit 14 makes clear why our ability to  influence MBS yields is larger than our ability to move Treasury yields  Our MBS  purchase program—both to date and as planned through the end of 2009—represents  a sizable portion of expected new MBS supply this year  In contrast, our announced  Treasury purchases amount to less than a third of expected issuance over the life of  the program   Although the TALF subscription in April was even smaller than we had  anticipated, we are somewhat encouraged by the price response and the fact that non- TALF securitizations have come to market as well  Exhibit 15 shows that secondary- market spreads on triple-A-rated ABS continued to narrow after both TALF  subscriptions Moreover, the yields on new securitizations have been at least  100 basis points tighter (and in some cases, as much as 700 basis points tighter) than  the spreads in exhibit 15 Much of this drop in yield is due to better liquidity  conditions and the fact that TALF subscriptions have provided the market with some  price transparency for the first time in months  As shown in exhibit 16, better  liquidity and pricing have encouraged non-TALF securitizations as well—particularly  in auto loans and credit cards, where activity had effectively ground to a halt last fall                     April 28–29, 2009 7 of 201  As in our purchase programs, one measure of success for the TALF is whether other  market participants follow us in  If the TALF, even in small sizes, can provide some  price discovery and a bit of liquidity to the ABS market, it could be a catalyst for  improving credit conditions  In short, the economics of the TALF work  But the  program continues to be dogged by the slow take-up by borrowers, particularly by  political baggage, including repeated contradictory statements by various public  officials regarding the TARP-related “rules of the road” for borrowers on issues such  as executive compensation  The outlook for the upcoming May 5 subscription is for  six to eight consumer securitizations for an estimated $7 billion to $9 billion  On the  supply side, as many as 14 TALF-eligible deals could come to the May subscription  and 12 additional deals in June; but given the uncertainties on the demand side of the  market, we are hesitant to predict a sizable subscription at this point   The liquidity facilities—the TAF, the swaps, the commercial paper and money  fund facilities, the TSLF, the PDCF, and the PCF—continue to shrink as conditions in  money markets have improved  LIBOR, foreign-exchange swap, and financial CP  spreads are all narrower since the March FOMC meeting  Some of this is due to  reduced demand for funding as financial firms delever and term out their debt,  particularly through the FDIC guarantee program  However, market participants do  report some increase in the availability of term funding  Although most of the  programs are slowly winding down, the CPFF—shown in exhibit 17—is lumpy  This  week about $150 billion in CPFF paper is maturing  Since yesterday, $85 billion of  this paper has matured, but less than half of that—about $40 billion—has been  reissued to the facility If this trend continues for the week, CPFF outstandings could  fall below $175 billion   Exhibit 18 summarizes the overall trends in the balance sheet, most notably the  step-up in purchase programs and the continued shrinking of liquidity programs  The  balance sheet grew more than 8 percent in March and 5½ percent in April (at monthly  rates) This has been accompanied by similarly impressive growth rates in the  monetary base The lumpiness of several of the programs—CPFF and MBS  purchases, in particular—makes it unlikely that we will achieve steady growth of the  balance sheet from week to week or even month to month; however, the balance sheet  and the monetary base will almost certainly continue to expand at a rapid pace in the  near term  Our outright purchases are now on the order of $200 billion per month—a  much faster pace than we anticipate (or almost anyone does) for the rolloff of the  liquidity programs even if market conditions continue to improve  So we expect  robust balance sheet growth—on the order of 6 percent per month—in the near-term   Seth and Chris will be discussing long-term balance sheet trends in a few minutes   As a prelude to that, our latest primary dealer survey suggests that few expect  changes to our purchase programs at this meeting but many place higher odds on  program expansion as the year proceeds  Dealer economists expect that by mid-2010  the Fed will have purchased more than $13 trillion in MBS, $500 billion in  Treasuries, and over $200 billion in agency debt  In other words, nearly everyone  expects significant expansion of the Treasury purchase program, and some expect                                                                     April 28–29, 2009 8 of 201  expansions of the agency and MBS programs  Longer term, the expected path for the  fed funds rate, shown in exhibit 19, actually moved up somewhat  On average,  dealers now expect the fed funds rate to rise to about 1 percent by the end of 2011   The continued rapid expansion of the balance sheet as well as the shift in   composition away from near-term liquidity facilities and to long-term lending and  purchases naturally raises a number of questions regarding how the Desk is going to  conduct monetary policy in the future when the FOMC would like to target a higher  policy rate Although the Committee may feel that that particular policy decision is  well down the road, the staff has already begun work on how the Desk could achieve  a significantly higher policy rate with a balance sheet that is very large and composed  mainly of long-duration securities and loans  We are preparing an extended briefing  and discussion of this issue for the June meeting  To preview some of the tools and  instruments that we are considering  First, if we are granted legislative authority to  issue central bank bills, how could that authority best be used?  Second, how might  our current legal authority to pay interest on excess reserves be used to allow better  control of the policy rate—for example, through the use of a redeposit facility?  There  are a number of legal and operational complexities to work through on this topic   Third, to what extent can we sterilize excess reserves by lending out our portfolio of  securities via the repo markets and the MBS dollar roll market?  Given the very large  size of our holdings, it is unlikely that we could feasibly lend out the entire portfolio,  but even lending out a portion of our Treasuries, agencies, and MBS might be helpful  in targeting a higher policy rate  Fourth, how feasible will it be for the Desk to sell  securities in order to shrink the portfolio, including the potential impact on interest  rates, financial market liquidity, and the Fed’s income?  We doubt that there is a  single magic bullet in this list, but we will continue to work through the legal,  operational, and accounting—not to mention policy—issues and will report back to  you at the June meeting   Finally, I would like to request a vote to renew our long-standing bilateral swap  lines of $2 billion with the Bank of Canada and $3 billion with the Banco de México   The Committee received a memo from Nathan and me recommending the annual  renewal of the lines now, although we are well aware that our recent experience with  liquidity swaps warrants a wholesale rethinking of these facilities  We will do that,  and we plan to come back to the Committee in the not-too-distant future with a more  thoughtful discussion of the role of swap facilities across central banks  In the  meantime, we recommend the renewal of these smaller lines  I also request a vote  ratifying domestic operations since the last meeting  Seth will now continue the  presentation    Probably, but at a cost Right now, even though we are buying a   significant proportion of the new issuance, there are others who are buying new issuance as   well—fixed-income money managers and a few banks and so forth  In addition to that, there is a   fair amount of trading activity in what I will call “off-the-run TBAs”—the higher-coupon   TBAs—as well as in the forward market, both for hedging purposes and for speculation   purposes If we followed that strategy, we would effectively wipe everybody else out of the   market  There wouldn’t be any secondary trading  We would be the only purchaser, and we   could probably continue to drive down at least the secondary spreads    In the short run, they probably take some capital gains, in point of fact    The big question is when they would come back and how quickly  The experience of central   banks completely taking over markets to the point that the market is effectively shut except for   what the central bank is buying is not so pretty from a liquidity standpoint  For example, in   Japan it took a year and a half to get their money market to work again in any kind of normal   way, and that was a money market, not a relatively complex product like MBS   I think the big question is, if we completely dominate the trading in this market, we can   probably set whatever price we want, but if there are no other buyers that will complicate things   for the originators in the following sense  Originators will have to be very certain about how   much we’re going to buy, the price, and the point at which we’re going to exit  As long as   they’re very certain about the price and we buy absolutely everything, they’ll have no problem   originating at low rates But the minute there’s any hint that we’re not going to buy every last   dollar, there’s uncertainty about what they can sell to someone else  At that point it’s going to be   much harder for them to hedge their pipeline, and the spread between the secondary rate and the   primary rate may be wider  So I think there’s a concern that perhaps the spread could widen out   despite our best efforts to drag the secondary rate down  The short story is that there is a bit of a   tradeoff between how low we can push the secondary-market rate and how much we want to   preserve some liquidity in the market so that we have an exit strategy    About 85 percent of the TBAs that we buy are between 4 and 5 percent   coupons, which is nearly all of the new issuance  So, yes, we’re very focused on the new   issuance              April 28–29, 2009 16 of 201   We are buying some seasoned  I don’t know if I have a maturity   breakdown in this chart pack, but there is one, I believe, in the balance sheet briefing that we sent   around About 10 percent is off the run With the two refinancing waves, that part of the market   is actually shrinking Our purchases of high-coupon MBS may not be so big as a share of   outstandings, but our market share keeps rising every day because those are exactly the loans that   are being prepaid into 4s, 4½s, and 5s So by the end of this refi process, a huge proportion of   the market is going to be concentrated between 4 and 5½ percent—perhaps not 80 percent but   we would guess 60 to 70 percent of the market—at which point our numbers will not look so out   of line We’re just a little ahead of the curve    If we had started out purchasing absolutely everything, the answer is that   it would have had the undesirable effects We could have gotten the rate down  I don’t know if I   could quantify buying absolutely everything It’s probably not, shall we say, a nice, linear   relationship between how much we buy and how far we could have gotten the rate down  I’m   guessing that, if we really wanted to get the rate down another 100 basis points, which is what   you’re talking about here—50 to 100 basis points on the retail mortgage rate—we would have           April 28–29, 2009 17 of 201  had to buy all the new issuance and quite a substantial amount of the outstanding 5s as well  So   we would have had to buy at least 40 to 50 percent more than we did    The narrower we make the secondary spread to Treasuries, the more   everybody else is going to exit the market because nobody else has our funding advantage, shall   we say, or our ability to just magically create the dollars to purchase these assets  If the Treasury   yields did not come down—and if we focused more on mortgages, presumably they would not—   then the spreads would get so compressed that they would not be attractive to anyone else    Yes    One parenthetical comment  On CMBS, our understanding, in talking to   the investors and the syndicators, is that the new-issue CMBS are obviously a substantially   smaller pool of possible loans and securitizations than the legacy  Opening it up to legacy   actually makes the larger number seem, at least relative to take-up so far, more possible  If for   some reason we would stop with just the current-sized TALF, I think I at least would be   surprised if we got to $400 billion  But if it is opened up to legacy assets, then the possibility of   getting the larger numbers is more likely    You’re welcome  [Applause]    One change in behavior, though, from the very first implementation of   interest rates on excess reserves back in the fall, whether it was a learning curve, getting our   systems up to date, or whatever—Chris can correct me if I’m wrong on this—the major   downward pressure on the funds rate now is due to the trading by the GSEs, which don’t get the   25 basis points They’re not eligible for it In fact, the trading between banks is actually quite   small right now    They can simply buy it and hold it, but that doesn’t show up in the   reported funds rate The reported federal funds rate that you see every day is on the broker   trading volume, and the vast majority of the people who bother to trade are the GSEs    To the extent that it’s paying down higher-cost debt—    Aside from paying down short-term debt, it’s reducing their liquidity   risk and taking pressure off money markets  To the extent that it is replacing more-expensive   bank debt and loans with corporate debt that less expensive and long-term and so less expensive   in the duration sense—then that’s additional cash for the corporation  So it’s a pretty classic   recession shift in composition in the corporate bond market, when cap-ex is usually declining  I   don’t know that what they’re doing now is particularly atypical given how slow economic   activity is  If and when the economy turns the corner, the composition of the corporate bond   market will tend to be a follower, not a leader  So cap-ex will determine the way out, rather than   the ability to get funds determining cap-ex, at least at this point in the business cycle    I would agree with that Two comments  The first is that there really is   no cliff-like expectation in the market right now  The good news is that we have a lot of   credibility that we’re not going to stop abruptly one day    Right, and in fact, if you look at the latest primary dealer survey, to a   firm practically, there is an expectation, regardless of the level effect, that the wind-down will be   smooth  The timing of that varies from respondent to respondent, but the expectation is that we   will not all of a sudden stop buying on December 30 or 31 of this year, particularly in Treasuries   on September 30     April 28–29, 2009 110 of 201  My second comment has to do more with the actual implementation  Is “steady as she   goes” the right approach versus some another approach to purchasing, given that we are   uncertain about the endpoint and how slowly we might wind these down?  My comments here   are really dependent upon the program we’re talking about  The MBS program—purchasing   MBS, the issuance of MBS—is very lumpy  We could very well be well ahead of a steady-as­  she-goes plan in purchasing MBS, given the current directive we have, in the next two or three   months because there is a huge refinancing wave coming through and, if we don’t purchase,   mortgage rates will rise or rise more than we want them to   If that is the way the market dynamics turn out, that is the Desk’s intent in terms of   instructing our investment managers  So we’re well prepared to be very flexible there and   perhaps come back to the Committee with a warning at some point to say that we are well ahead   of a steady pace, but our expectation is that purchases will taper off  Or we could come back and   say, if we want to keep this program going, then what is the Committee’s view about increasing   the size?  As Brian noted, we don’t know which of those scenarios we may face, but those are   the scenarios   The agency debt purchase program similarly, honestly, is very dependent upon the   financing needs of the GSEs It is possible that the program might actually pull back early, if   their portfolios shrink and there is less debt out there and less need to support the market in order   to support the agency market  Then again, if the GSEs’ portfolios grow and our mandate is still   to purchase, we may be lumpier in how we purchase those securities  Treasuries are different   because of the steady issuance Because we know that the Treasury Department is going to be   issuing just a huge amount of debt at a steady pace and we also know, particularly for Treasuries,   that the announcement effect may be as important as anything else in terms of lowering the level     April 28–29, 2009 111 of 201  of interest rates, we are more inclined toward “steady as she goes” in purchasing there  So the   problem that you’re worried about and the cliff effect may perhaps be more relevant from an   operational standpoint to the Treasury purchase program than to the other two programs    Yes The market expectation is absolutely—    In the Treasury program, yes    I showed the average Our dealer survey had an average of the program   that the sizes total to approximately $500 billion, but their estimates there are quite skewed  A   number of individuals expect that the program will be $750 billion, along the lines of what it is   in alternative A In fact, I would also say that, in the dealer survey, we asked economists for   their opinions If we asked the Treasury traders for their opinions, I think we would probably get   an average or a median expectation that the Treasury program would be even larger than   $500 billion But it is the one program that all market participants say will be both extended,   partly because its terminal date is earlier than the mortgage and agency one, and expanded by a   sizable amount    It would still be only about half    Yes, even the larger number would be about half    Yes, that’s correct  In terms of cliff effects, because of the lumpiness, if   the market conditions are appropriate, it will be easier, for example, to slow down quickly the   purchases of MBS and, to a degree, the purchases of agency debt  The Treasury piece will be the   part for which, because of the smooth issuance and the expectations, from an operational   standpoint, we would guess that a smoother slowdown would be a more advisable   implementation strategy    Absolutely Our recommendation would be that, if the Committee has   been clear about their intentions that it’s not needed, we would put on a timetable—we’re now   publishing a schedule two weeks in advance; we don’t put in the quantities, but we put in the   section of the curve—and we would make clear that we’re going to diminish our purchases over   time    Given this size, it would be a greater pace as well  It would be like the   mortgage program  We’re purchasing Treasuries at $50 billion per month  The $500 billion that   was in the dealer survey would be a steady pace, so to go to $750 billion would be increasing the   pace    It would depend on what the Committee asked us to do  If the directive   is to extend it through December, then we would spread it out over whatever time frame the   Committee gives us    Yes, it does           April 28–29, 2009 123 of 201   There would probably be some market benefits at the front end of the   curve There’s no question that the one-to-two-year section of the curve reacted less than the   section further out  That’s probably because a lot more issuance is there, and so the quantity   we’re buying relative to supply is a little smaller  And if we did it pretty explicitly, particularly   between one and two years, we’re guessing that it would steepen the yield curve; but we hope   that, if it was announced, that additional purchases across the curve would have an   announcement effect of bringing the whole curve down  So for that portion of the curve we   think that it would be useful in bringing yields down    They are expecting both an extension and an expansion    That depends upon the size The size they’re expecting now is smaller   than what has been proposed in alternative A    Yes, and we are going to study purchasing ARMs, which we had not   purchased    Yes I don’t want to leave the impression that we’re not buying any   seasoned MBS  We are  In fact, the purchases that we’re making in the dollar roll market are   actually exclusively the higher coupons because that’s where the liquidity in the market was   most affected So from a balance sheet, month-to-month perspective, we actually are purchasing   them  We’re simply then rolling those purchases for the following month and lending them out,   if you like, through the financing market  But we could definitely investigate increasing the   share of higher coupon MBS as well    I don’t think the communication challenge is any different than it is with   discussing the swap lines or the 13(3) programs  They all have deadlines Markets participants   understand that it is path dependent  Their view is that, if the economy gets significantly worse,   the probability that the Board of Governors will extend the 13(3) programs and that the FOMC   will extend the swap lines and the purchase programs is much higher  The better that things get,   the less likely that is    From a tactical standpoint—and I’m using the word “tactical” literally—   I think we have plenty of direction from the Committee  We obviously need, particularly given   how unusual and new these programs are, to communicate back to you to let you know what our   tactics are, and we’ve tried to be clear with you In fact, particularly in the case of the Treasury   program, we’ve tried to be very clear with the market what our tactics are because transparency   seems to make it more effective rather than less  Now, if I can re-interpret your question just a   bit, should either financial or macroeconomic conditions change dramatically, would we like to   have more strategic instruction from the Committee?  Yes, on a more frequent basis  But barring   that, I don’t see that we need a lot more direction on the day-to-day tactics, which I think we   tried to lay out for you in broad terms     You are stuck with me for one more round  Thank you very   much, Mr Chairman  In spite of the recent hiccup—a pretty big hiccup actually—in   mortgage markets, financial market conditions have continued to improve for the   most part in recent weeks  Most credit spreads continue to narrow, the availability of   funding for financial firms has improved while the cost of that funding continues to                      June 3, 2009 4 of 20  fall, and the banks’ capital-raising efforts since the release of the stress test results  have exceeded expectations  Gains in both equity and commodity prices reflect a  growing belief that global economic growth has stabilized, if not exactly turned the  corner In short, the perceived tail risk of a sustained free-fall in the economy,  combined with another financial meltdown, has receded fairly significantly  The  improvement in risky asset markets has been accompanied by significant increases in  government bond yields and steeper yield curves around the globe  This, of course,  includes Treasuries and has some implications for our purchase programs  Similarly,  the notable improvement in funding conditions is reflected in reduced use of Fed  liquidity facilities—and that’s a good thing—but it affects our balance sheet   I will talk about our programs and our balance sheet in a few moments, but let me  start first with what is mostly good news  Since the April FOMC meeting, global  equity markets are up 10 to 30 percent, led by particularly strong increases in  emerging markets and stock prices of all types of financial firms  The improvement  in the global growth outlook and the portfolio reallocation toward riskier assets is  reflected in the narrowing of credit spreads nearly everywhere—with the largest  declines in spreads occurring in the riskiest asset classes and the riskiest countries   Not surprisingly, the dollar has weakened notably, but in an orderly way  It’s fallen  about 8 percent on a trade-weighted basis since the April FOMC meeting  Generally  speaking, the dollar depreciation has been largest against currencies where equity  performance has been the strongest and the credit-spread tightening has been the  largest  The one exception to this, which is a bit of a puzzle, is the euro, where the  dollar is nearly 9 percent weaker since late April   Turning to the United States, corporate credit spreads have tightened nearly  125 basis points for investment-grade companies and 350 basis points for high-yield  companies since late April  In fact, corporate bond rates themselves have actually  fallen despite the backup in Treasury yields  The largest banks continue to raise  capital and issue non-FDIC guaranteed debt at a fairly fast pace, and the ease with  which this capital has been raised is notable  Several of the issues have been  significantly oversubscribed, and the relatively muted effect of what in many cases is  very significant dilution reflects both better economic news and increased confidence  in the long-term viability of the large banks   Similarly, the spreads on most securitized products continue to narrow   Yesterday’s TALF subscription supported $15½ billion of asset-backed securities,  $11½ billion of which was financed in the TALF  That’s 13 issues, and they covered  nearly all the eligible asset classes  Indicatives, which are quoted spreads on existing  consumer ABS, have continued to tighten, and the spreads on actual transactions have  narrowed more than anticipated Compared with the May TALF, the June  subscription spreads are anywhere from 15 to 30 basis points narrower  For a little  longer term comparison, a Ford auto loan securitization yesterday priced 130 basis  points lower than a very similar issue in the inaugural March subscription of the  TALF Thinking ahead to exit—and this may be too soon—but there were several  non-TALF credit card securitizations in the last week or two that were sold at spreads             June 3, 2009 5 of 20  at or below 100 basis points In other words, they were sold at prices that make their  financing uneconomical in the TALF  The notable exception to this trend is the  commercial-mortgage-backed securities market, where spreads widened very sharply  last week in response to a proposed change in ratings methodology by Standard &  Poor’s S&P’s changes, if implemented, could result in downgrades of nearly half of  the most senior CMBS tranches eligible for legacy TALF  (It would also place  S&P’s ratings judgments very far from its peers)  Prior to the S&P announcement,  the CMBS spreads had narrowed steadily in response to the expansion of the TALF to  new and then to legacy CMBS; but since the announcement, they have widened more  than 100 basis points   All the factors I noted at the last briefing have continued to push Treasury yields  higher Less macro tail risk, an unwinding of last winter’s “flight to quality”  investments, upward revisions to both current and future Treasury supply, and the  US Treasury’s intentional shift of issuance out the yield curve have all contributed  to an increase of nearly 65 basis points in the spread between two-year and ten-year  Treasuries in recent weeks  It’s worth noting that the 2-year yield hasn’t budged—all  of the steepening is due to an increase in the 10-year yield  The yield curve is  exceptionally steep, even by the standards of past recessions  Typically, the spread  between the two-year and the ten-year yield steepens steadily throughout recessions  and continues to steepen into the recovery  The current spread is 270 basis points—  that is above the post-recession peaks in the last few recessions and certainly much  higher than previous levels late in recessionary periods in the past  In addition to the  factors I’ve noted, a minority of market participants have interpreted this steepness as  evidence of significantly increased inflation risk, but that doesn’t seem to us at the  Desk to be the consensus view in markets  Reduced risk of deflation and improved  liquidity in the TIPS market are the most commonly cited explanations for the rise in  long-dated breakeven rates I’ll repeat myself one more time by noting that the  Treasury purchase program is not large enough to offset the factors that are increasing  long-term yields  We continue to purchase securities at a steady pace, with purchases  concentrated in the 2-year to 10-year maturity range  You won’t be surprised that our  operations continue to be met with very strong offers to sell securities to us   Turning finally to mortgage markets, until the middle of last week, the effect of  both the MBS and the agency purchase programs had been to narrow spreads to  more-normal levels in these markets and, in the case of MBS, to encourage the  refinancing wave that began in March However, there is a clear limit to how low the  Desk could and should push MBS and agency yields relative to rising Treasury rates   We don’t wish to push spreads so low that we “become the market”  This would not  only be detrimental to market functioning but would also likely impair our ability to  exit successfully when the time comes  In the MBS market, we reached that limit last  Tuesday, when the MBS–Treasury spread was 130 basis points, about 10 basis points  below where it had been at the time of the April FOMC meeting  On Wednesday of  last week, MBS yields jumped over 40 basis points, and the 10-year Treasury yield  rose 20 basis points, with most of those increases occurring in just a couple of hours  during the afternoon The proximate cause of the jump in yields was convexity                    June 3, 2009 6 of 20  hedging by mortgage servicers and originators as the primary mortgage rate rose  above 5 percent—the level widely viewed as the “trigger” for households to  refinance, or not refinance But more fundamentally, the backup in MBS yields and  mortgage rates was, frankly, inevitable given the steady rise in Treasury yields   As is typical in the MBS market, once mortgage rates rose far enough that  refinancing became unattractive, mortgage extension risk caused a positive feedback  loop to ensue With slower expected refinancings, the duration of existing mortgages  and their associated servicing rights increased, which prompted selling of long- duration assets (MBS, swaps, and Treasuries), which in turn pushed long-term rates  even higher, which caused more duration extension, more selling, and even higher  long-term rates  You get the picture By the end of Wednesday, it was clear that the  spring refinancing wave that we had been experiencing was over  The mortgage  convexity vortex—that’s one of my favorite descriptive terms of this—has waxed and  waned over the past week There were large increases in rates on Wednesday and on  Monday and modest declines in rates on other days  Regardless of the daily pattern,  there is no doubt that mortgage rates have moved to a higher level, and there is likely  to be additional volatility in fixed-income markets in the near term   So what does this mean for the MBS purchase program?  Except for a single day  last week, we have not significantly increased our pace of purchases, nor are we  planning to To do so, we believe, would only narrow MBS–Treasury spreads to the  point that other investors would leave the market  Moreover, the supply of low- coupon MBS is likely to slow significantly in coming weeks, and so over time we  will shift the composition of our purchases toward higher-coupon, more-seasoned  mortgages If the rise in long-term rates persists—which it may if there continue to  be macro improvements, large Treasury supply, and convexity hedging—then the  new supply of MBS is likely to fall to very low levels, at which point we will  consider additional tactical changes to the MBS program  We are already considering  several ways to adjust both the MBS and the agency-debt purchase programs in such  circumstances, and we will be reporting back to you with our findings and  recommendations at the next meeting   Finally, as Brian and I noted in the memo last week, the balance sheet has not  grown as quickly as we had forecasted just a few weeks ago  Essentially, the  improvement in private funding markets—evidenced by a 40 basis point decline in  the three-month LIBOR rate—has accelerated the shrinkage in our liquidity facilities   As of the end of May, the liquidity facilities were $255 billion smaller than we  expected a few weeks ago—mainly because of very large declines in participation in  the TAF, swap-financed foreign dollar operations, and the CPFF  Figures from this  week’s operations suggest that the use of our liquidity facilities will continue to  shrink, although perhaps not quite as rapidly as in the last few weeks  As a result, our  near-term projections for the balance sheet and the monetary base have been revised  down We now expect the balance sheet to grow about 3 percent per month over the  summer We will provide more details on balance sheet projections in a couple of  weeks In the meantime, I’m happy to take any questions              June 3, 2009 7 of 20   This is actually over the whole last month, so it isn’t just the last couple   of weeks It is really since the end of April  The April tax receipts were substantially below   even the Treasury’s estimates, so that has added to supply; and they are revising up the deficit   projections a bit I should have been more precise and said that the Street continues to increase   their projections of Treasury supply  We know that Treasury’s announcements on this are more   discreet than that, but the analysts on the Street continue to increase their forecasts  The   Treasury is absolutely pursuing pushing its issuance out the yield curve  It had shortened up   quite substantially the weighted average maturity of the debt, and over the course of this year, it   is going to be increasing the maturity of the Treasury debt pretty substantially   Back to your first question about foreign yields, the increase in 10-year yields in the   United States is slightly larger than the increases, say, in Germany and Spain  It is about 10 or   15 basis points larger than, say, in France and the United Kingdom  Japan is much smaller, only   about 15 basis points But the ranges go from about 15 basis points to about 50 or 60  The   United States is toward the top, but there is no question that yields have gone up everywhere               June 3, 2009 8 of 20   There is a wide variety of estimates  I would like to get the Treasury   staff here at the Desk to report back to you with the details  But everyone’s median number   keeps getting revised up I think the range is still between $1 trillion and something over   $1½ trillion But the fact is that all of the increments to everyone’s forecast are positive   numbers  No one is revising things down But we can get back to you with more details    We are almost exactly on schedule, so we are at about $100 billion or   maybe a little over $100 billion  Did I do that right?  Yes    We think the TALF has had an important role to play in the consumer   ABS markets in allowing for price discovery  When a market goes dormant for months on end,   it is very difficult for investors and issuers to know what the right price is, particularly when the   secondary markets are so illiquid that the prices being quoted there are just so exceptionally              June 3, 2009 9 of 20  outside historical experience The advantage of the TALF providing some financing has been   that there is price discovery  Every time there is new issuance, that new issuance comes in just a   little below the previous issuance, and the bid-asked spreads narrow just a bit  So we think that   has actually been its main benefit, frankly, because the sheer size is not huge  It has been more   like a kick-start mechanism for the rest of the market    Yes As a matter of fact, that is one of the topics that we are planning to   talk about at the end of the month at the in-person meeting  We are going to discuss some of the   near-term strategy issues with the purchase programs, including some of the changes that we   could make  And ARMs are one of the areas that we, along with the New York and Board staff,   are studying  We will have probably a note for you and, if not a note, certainly a presentation on   that topic    That is true    One other notable difference is that with TALF 20 we have been fairly   clear in the information we have released to the public that we are going to do much more credit   analysis ourselves and we are going to hire a collateral evaluation agent to give us an   independent, security-by-security evaluation of the quality of the collateral  One of the reasons   for that was, frankly, concern among the team working on the TALF that we might run into a   situation like this, where there were potentially significant disagreements across the rating   agencies, and we really do want to have more control of our destiny, as Bill calls it  So no   decisions at all have been made, and this is one of the things that the team is working on very   actively     The recent rise in long-term yields has highlighted a number of   challenges to the large-scale asset purchase programs—challenges related both to   policy intent and to implementation  In light of the recent changes in market and   macroeconomic conditions, my briefing discusses a few potential changes (large and   small) to the purchase programs that the Committee may consider going forward                          June 23–24, 2009 15 of 261  In order to help frame your thinking, and ours, about the purchase programs, the  staff prepared a note discussing whether the effects of purchases come about  primarily through changes to stocks or flows of assets  Basic theoretical models point  mainly to stocks affecting interest rates  But practical market considerations, finance  microstructure models, and our experience with purchase programs to date suggest  that both the stock and the pace of asset purchases can effect yields  The purchase  programs all produced significant announcement effects, suggesting that the expected  decline in the stock of assets lowered yields  For Treasuries, the stock effect appears  to be more important than the flow effect, perhaps because the Treasury market is  highly liquid with good price transparency and predictable supply, so informational  asymmetries and inventory frictions that are associated with flow effects are smaller   Also, the Treasury program is by far the smallest relative to the size of the overall  market, so flows of purchases are likely to have a smaller ongoing impact on yields     In contrast, both the MBS and the agency debt purchase programs are large  relative to the size of their respective markets, and, in both cases, the size and pace of  new supply is quite uncertain, leaving more scope for the Fed’s purchases to have a  significant ongoing effect on prices  As a result, it is not surprising that the Fed’s  purchases caused not only up-front announcement effects, but also ongoing  reductions in MBS and agency spreads as markets adjusted to the pace of purchases    As Brian noted in his presentation, in recent weeks when it became clear to  market participants that the pace of MBS purchases would not be adjusted as yields  edged higher, MBS (and mortgage) rates rose sharply  Of course, the convexity of  mortgages and MBS was the main reason that the backup in mortgage yields was so  large and so quick, but some of the increase in yields reflected adjustments to market  expectations of the program, based on the Desk’s flow of purchases   Regardless of what changes, if any, the Committee decides to make to the  purchase programs, our analysis, and particularly our recent experience, highlight the  ongoing need for clear public communication about the policy intent and goals of the  purchase programs as well as about their implementation  Moreover, given that both  the stock and flow of Fed purchases appear to influence yields and spreads, we  believe there are number of program changes that the Committee may wish to  consider Broadly speaking, these changes fall into two categories  (1) changes  specifically related to size and flexibility of the programs—in other words, related to  stock and flow effects of the programs, and (2) other implementation changes to  enhance the effectiveness of the programs   Let me start with the options related to the size and flexibility of the programs  If  the Committee believes that the recent run-up in long-term yields represents an  unwelcome tightening of credit conditions inconsistent with the appropriate stance of  policy, then an expansion of the LSAP program may be attractive  Given its small  size, the Treasury purchase program is a logical candidate for such an expansion  A  large expansion—for example, of up to $750 billion through year-end—would be a  surprise to the market, and, in the staff’s view, it would significantly lower long-term                       June 23–24, 2009 16 of 261  yields Of course, such an expansion could also increase concerns about debt  monetization and perhaps inflation   Alternatively, a more modest expansion/extension—to $450 billion through  year-end—might be attractive because it would raise fewer concerns about debt  monetization This change could be communicated as a continuation of the current  program and an alignment of the end dates of all three purchase programs, with an  additional note that all may be adjusted in the future depending on the economic  outlook and financial conditions  This may be particularly attractive if you believe it  is premature to plan and communicate the end of the Treasury purchase program   The Treasury program endgame will certainly move to the forefront of market and  policy discussions if the Treasury program is kept unchanged   Expansion of the MBS purchase program is another option that has the advantage  of being (half) a step removed from debt monetization  However, given reduced  expectations for new MBS issuance and the already large size of the program, the  staff has some concerns that a larger MBS program would run the risk of SOMA  purchases distorting market functioning  For reasons that we have highlighted in the  past, we do not recommend expanding the agency debt program, given its large size  and its impact to date     While the staff does not recommend explicitly reallocating funds across the  various purchase programs (eg, reducing the MBS program and reallocating to  Treasury purchases), the Committee might want to consider implementation strategies  that increase the flexibility of the programs     Regardless of what the Committee decides about the size of the purchase  programs, it could consider a portfolio approach in which the timing, size, and  particularly the composition of purchases are adjusted in response to market  conditions, done in a manner that makes the most efficient use of the Fed’s balance  sheet For example, in a scenario of rising yields and narrowing spreads on MBS and  agencies, the Desk could shift toward purchasing Treasuries; in a scenario of falling  yields and widening spreads, the Desk could shift purchases away from Treasuries  and toward MBS and agencies; and in a scenario of declining yields and narrowing  spreads, the Desk could simply purchase less of everything  This approach could  have the added advantage of containing the future size of the balance sheet to the  extent that it targets purchases where they are perceived to have the greatest policy  impact  It could also help to reduce volatility and minimize market distortions of the  purchase programs    However, this approach also entails a significant complication in that such  changes to Desk operations would presumably require the Committee to articulate to  the Desk and to the market what its reaction function is  Formulating this reaction  function would be difficult, partly because the appropriate levels of spreads and  yields would depend on both macroeconomic and financial conditions  Setting (and  communicating about) a policy stance that is dependent on macro and financial                              June 23–24, 2009 17 of 261  conditions is what the Committee does in normal times, of course  But these are  neither normal policy circumstances nor normal operating procedures To pull this off  in present circumstances may be quite complex   Alternatively the Committee could move in the direction of giving the Desk more  flexibility within asset classes by purchasing larger quantities when spreads and  yields are rising and fewer assets when they are falling  This approach—if  appropriately formulated, communicated, and executed—has the advantage that it  could reduce volatility and consequently, perhaps, lessen the need for actually making  large adjustments to operations  However, a flexible pace of purchases is likely to be  credible only if the size of the purchase program is relatively large  As a result, the  staff would not recommend such a strategy for the Treasury purchase program at its  current size   One final note on this topic Selling put options is one way that the Desk could  implement such a flexible, responsive approach to the purchase programs  A strategy  of buying more when the yields rise in effect provides investors with an option to sell  to the Fed at a particular price  Selling the option explicitly would not only allow us  to capture the value of that commitment, but it also would provide a hedging vehicle  to the market, which, in turn, might reduce hedging costs and thus risk premiums   But an options strategy involves the same communication challenges that I have  already noted If the Committee is interested in exploring this further, the staff would  need a few weeks to address several legal and implementation issues    Whatever the Committee’s views are on the merits of changing the size or  flexibility of the purchase programs, a couple of additional implementation issues  deserve your attention   First and most importantly, the Committee could consider how it would like to  handle the phaseout of purchase programs, the so-called cliff effects  If one believes  that the purchase programs affect yields only through the stock of assets, then cliff  effects on yields are unlikely However, if the flow of purchases affects yields at  all—the staff believes we have seen some evidence of this—then it may be prudent to  consider a slow phaseout of purchase programs in the weeks either preceding or just  beyond the programs’ end dates  In particular, if no changes are made to the Treasury  purchase program, the staff believes there is a risk of a cliff effect in yields in  September, so we request the Committee’s views on the advisability of phasing out  purchases slowly In addition, the Committee might wish to discuss how it would  like to communicate its intention regarding phaseout to the public   Second, the staff recommends that agency MBS purchases be expanded to include  securitizations of hybrid ARMs  To date, the MBS purchase program has been  concentrated in purchases of 15- and 30-year securities  Adding hybrids would likely  narrow what are currently very wide spreads in that sector and so ease credit  conditions for borrowers who are not benefiting from the current program Hybrids  would also reduce the duration of our MBS purchases and thus limit the System’s                                                            4 The materials used by Messrs Clouse and Hilton are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)                  June 23–24, 2009 18 of 261  exposure to income and capital risk  However, because this program is likely to be   quite small, that effect would not be large  Purchases of hybrids are covered by the   current directive and thus would not require further explicit authorization by the   Committee  Although ARMs are slightly more complicated to purchase than   fixed-rate MBS, a hybrid purchase program can be implemented in a matter of days   Our recommendation is to add purchases of ARMs with fixed-rate lockups of at least   three years in order to avoid the risk that market participants would incorrectly infer   signals about the near-term path of short-term rates    A final implementation strategy that the Committee may want to consider is to  increase the duration of Treasury purchases  If the Committee would like a bigger  bang for the buck on yields, shifting Treasury purchases to maturities seven years and  longer will remove more duration from the private sector and, according to portfolio  theories, likely lower yields On the other hand, such a shift runs the risk of distorting  the yield curve, and, of course, it would increase the duration and interest rate risk of  the SOMA portfolio   I’ll close by summarizing what we see as the key decision points and staff  recommendations  First, if the Committee is interested in expanding asset purchases,  Treasuries appear to be best choice; of course, this topic is more a subject for  tomorrow’s discussion than for today’s  Second, a portfolio approach to asset  purchases has notable advantages, including the potential for a larger impact, but it  requires more articulation of objectives and responsiveness, which may be complex to  achieve in the current circumstances  Third, the staff recommends tapering down  purchases near the exit And finally, buy hybrid ARMs   Thank you, and I’m happy to take questions    For the hybrid ARMs, we are looking for input  It’s currently   authorized, but we’d like the Committee’s views  For the portfolio approach, if it goes across   asset classes, it’s going to require very substantial communication by the Committee, I believe,   so that’s really much more in the realm of the policy discussion, because it would be effectively   making sizes flexible and fungible  Regarding more flexibility within asset classes, again, under   the current authorization, we have that authority, but we’d be interested in the Committee’s   input    Yes, that’s correct  For corporate bonds, clearly, both yields and spreads   have come way down, not just because of our actions presumably, but particularly because of the   recovery in equity markets  I guess we can take credit for some of that  On the mortgage side,   however, the spreads are or became effectively as low as we reasonably believe that we could   push them with both the agency debt and the agency MBS program  That means that additional   purchases are going to have very large side effects; as we have discussed in the past, that makes   us very concerned about exit and about market functioning and keeping the market healthy  So   at this stage our ability to lower private credit rates in the mortgage sphere is extremely limited   unless our impact in the Treasury market directly is bigger    One follow-up remark to that  On a daily basis in implementing the   MBS purchase program, particularly during the refinancing wave, we were sensitive to supply           June 23–24, 2009 34 of 261  and spreads, and we would buy somewhat more on certain days and a little less on other days    But, to be honest, that shows up as a very tiny bump in the overall pace of purchases  As long as   spreads were continuing to narrow overall, we did not make very large changes from week to   week and month to month in quantities  Even though there was some daily movement, the   changes we made were small ones   In the Treasury program, quite honestly, given its relatively small size, we didn’t feel that   we had the flexibility nor that flexibility was necessarily a wise approach, since, frankly, it would   not be credible, given chart 7—the size of it is just too small to have an appreciable effect on the   level of yields When we were being flexible in agency MBS, it tended to be in response to   spreads more than to the level of yields    They may have Treasury securities that they could sell  They also have   the ability to short them  They can also do similar portfolio adjustments in the swaps market,   which, through follow-on effects, through other trading mechanisms, will affect Treasury yields    So they can pay fixed on swaps    Well, the convexity hedging phenomenon, particularly in the current   episode, was actually more concentrated in servicers and not so much in MBS investors   themselves, although I’m sure there were a few of those that were selling convexity  Servicing   portfolios have even more convexity than mortgages, so, dollar for dollar, it doesn’t take a big   change in their duration to cause someone who is hedging to sell either a lot of swaps or a lot of   Treasuries One reason for the speed is that there are many servicers, they have really, really   similar portfolios, and they all go in on the same day or two and conduct the same sorts of trades   in the same direction    Two things We used history    But we used the long history of spreads to Treasuries to make a   judgment about how narrow they were  We also considered whether there was anyone else who   was buying for investment purposes, in other words, anyone else who was willing to come in and   actually purchase them to hold besides us  If we were the only long-term purchaser, we took that   as a signal that we had lowered spreads to the point that they were not attractive to other   investors  That was the place that we were before the convexity hedging episode, and it’s one of   the reasons that we were already beginning to slow down           June 23–24, 2009 44 of 261   I believe that flexibility could be a very successful strategy, but it would   need substantially more clarity about the Committee’s views and literally its reaction function,   for lack of a better term, which may be very difficult to do, given how far out we are in   uncharted territory    It’s our understanding that it’s fairly mechanical  Now, a couple of   times the Bank of England has bought so much that they were afraid that they were reducing   liquidity in the market, and they have slowed down again from a market functioning standpoint    Yes But they absolutely are much more focused on a reserves or a   money target than the SOMA purchases have been    Absolutely              June 23–24, 2009 57 of 261   I have two responses—at least two  The first is that certainly “buy and   hold” has been the staff’s maintained hypothesis when we do Seth’s pictures of the size of the   balance sheet And if we’re going to be reducing excess reserves in the future, while we could   do it through selling, probably our first step—and I think this would be the staff’s bias—would   be to use the reverse repo market in order to manage to a higher federal funds rate  So that’s my   first response—as a baseline, probably yes        June 23–24, 2009 61 of 261  However, there are a couple of caveats to that  It does very much depend on how the   Committee wants to react to whatever the macro and financial conditions are at the time we are   exiting One can imagine a scenario, the really high-inflation scenario that Seth played out,   where the Committee might very much want to tighten financial conditions in the broad   economy very quickly  Selling a really large quantity of assets very quickly would probably   achieve that for you, no matter how we manage the short-term interest rate   So I think it’s very dependent on the Committee’s views at the time that exit comes   around It’s possible to do, but the question is  Will that be what the Committee wants to do,   both with the size of the balance sheet and in terms of influencing financial conditions?    We have been purchasing these securities on the upside very quickly,   with the intent of influencing private credit rates  On the exit side, at the point we would decide   to sell, we have been going with the assumption that we would exit much more slowly in the   optimal case  We would sell very slowly and in small quantities—this is not built into Seth’s   baseline, but we could do this—in the way that we have been purchasing Treasury securities for   decades, which is to buy regularly, in tiny amounts, being as market-neutral as humanly possible    That can be achieved, but that’s a slow unwinding  It’s faster than what’s built into Seth’s   pictures, but it’s quite small  A big year would be $50 billion or $70 billion on the purchase side,   on the upside, in the old days So we would assume that size on the downside  So it’s not a   rapid way to bring down the balance sheet        June 23–24, 2009 62 of 261   Fed bills, or doing reverse repos for that matter, wouldn’t shrink the   balance sheet, they would simply shrink reserves; that is, they would affect the liability side of   our balance sheet, but not the asset side—the assets would still be just as big    One comment On the primary dealer survey that we do before every   meeting, we did ask this question about probabilities of increasing versus decreasing  We didn’t   really ask the “up to” part, we just asked whether the sizes might be decreased  In all three   categories, there was some weight put on decreasing the size of the programs  If I’m recalling   the numbers correctly, it was smallest for the Treasury program, but that’s partly because it’s   scheduled to end in September, and it’s closer to being done  But there is some weight being put   on decreases in size, meaning not getting all the way    Okay I’ll take a stab at that one  I don’t know that it is so much that we   didn’t have a sense of what the Committee wanted, although there were times when perhaps we   didn’t have perfect clarity, but rather it’s that I don’t think the public and the markets always   understood For example, there was discussion in the market that the Treasury purchase program   was going to be immediately expanded in the middle of May—in an intermeeting period—and   extended and enlarged substantially as Treasury rates continued to rise  In fact, this was a   shockingly widely held opinion, despite the Chairman’s public statements that were close to   being to the contrary So, on the communication issue, everyone understands that these are very   unusual programs, but it would be good to clarify what your expectations are in terms of the   direction of what the programs are likely or not likely to do  For the Treasury purchase program,   in particular, there’s a bit less clarity  For the MBS program and the agency program, the   markets have now figured out that, up to a point, narrowing spreads was the goal  As for going   further than that, the Desk is likely to step back and say, “We’re not going to become the 100   percent only investor” But they learned that by watching what we were doing as opposed to   getting a communication from the Committee  If your preference is “steady as she goes” through   the end of the programs, subject to the caveat that if conditions improve the Committee may use        June 23–24, 2009 65 of 261  the “up to” option, then that would help as sort of a basic starting point  Beyond that, it depends   on what the Committee’s true views are about the ultimate goals of the programs and whether   they should be enlarged or kept the same size    If the Committee is comfortable with the option that I spoke about in my   presentation for flexibility within asset classes and agrees with our assessment that, subject to   this sort of communication, it would be useful, then that would be the right kind of clarifying   statement    Assuming the “up to” sizes stay where they are, I think I agree   completely with Brian, particularly regarding the Treasury program, where we simply don’t   think anything other than “slow and steady” is probably the appropriate implementation strategy   given its current size and its current expiration date  We are already, frankly, moving in the   direction of more flexibility, as Brian described, on the agency debt program, and we’ll continue   to move that way, assuming that the spreads don’t widen and we don’t get dislocations in the   opposite direction  If flexibility is going to be useful, it would be in the MBS program, and,   obviously, we’d be happy to write down a couple of alternatives for the next meeting  It might   help clarify the language    I would agree with that It is a small risk  Because of this renewal, the   swap partners are aware of at least that portion of the press release, although not of the rest of the   liquidity facilities, obviously We informed them that some language along the lines of what the   Chairman read would likely be in the press release  Their reaction in a number of cases was   “Oh, well, we’re not going to put anything like that in our press release,” and a couple of them   were outright concerned about it  So there was a dispersion—some thought it was fine, and   others not I would agree with Brian—I think there is a risk  I don’t know that it’s large, but   there is a small risk that it would be viewed as a bit of tightening     The last sentence that was added to the press release, which says the   Board and the Committee would also consider expanding if things get worse, helps to mitigate   that risk quite a bit     Most central banks have accounts with us  Very few central banks hold   all of their reserves—for very few central banks, we are the custodian for all of their reserves    They almost all have additional custody relationships in addition to CBIAS    I don’t believe that, certainly during the crisis, that was actually what   happened in practice What I think is particularly true of European institutions is that they were   borrowing in the United States and then moving the cash to their homes  The US subsidiary   was sending it basically to the parent, and they were not lending it on to other institutions in   Europe They were using it in their own parent institutions             November 3–4, 2009 24 of 201   One final comment—I also think about the realities of collateral  The   fact is that large global financial institutions have collateral at almost all the large central banks    Moving that collateral on short notice, particularly in the midst of a crisis, from one central bank   to another in order to make sure that you have collateral and you can borrow in the right currency   is very time-consuming  It does not happen quickly  There is work afoot to make that   movement of collateral around the world smoother, but it isn’t there yet  And the swap   arrangements, like the comparison of moving collateral around, basically put the counterparty   risk, as Brian noted, frankly, where it belongs, and also allowed the collateral to be used at the   central bank that is actually bearing the counterparty risk and not moved around and needing to   be reevaluated by another central bank     May I make one more comment to President Lacker?  Although not   mentioned specifically in the memo, it is probably worth remembering that the first time that   liquidity swaps were used was on September 12 and September 13, 2001  So there are other                                November 3–4, 2009 33 of 201  circumstances for having these kinds of facilities in place, and in the case of the reverse lines   particularly, should there be some sort of catastrophic event in another large financial center where   our ability to basically do broad distribution of foreign currency, not just to specific institutions,   might be useful  We didn’t really discuss that here, but we know that it has been done at least once   the other way      I was going to make the same point, namely, that the contracts are such   that, absent the ECB or one of the central banks defaulting to us, we will get all of our dollars   back  The contracts are not dependent on future exchange rate levels
