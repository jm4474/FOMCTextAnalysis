8179,2005-08-09," Yes, I think that’s exactly right  The one GSE that had relied historically   on a lot more—    The one GSE that traditionally had done a lot of dynamic hedging had   already started, even in 2003, to shift over to more options hedging  But a couple of depository   institutions did not make such a big switch  For one particularly large firm, the results of poor   dynamic hedging showed up in their operating results, and by all reports they have since “gotten   religion,” shall we say And in part that’s because it has been inexpensive to hedge with options   in the last couple of years    Yes    There is some  Almost everyone dynamically hedges some portion of   their convexity Certainly, mortgage servicers still do some dynamic hedging, as do the GSEs   And hedge funds and fixed income funds that hold mortgages do some dynamic hedging  So   there is some, but it’s a substantially lower proportion than it was three years ago                                        August 9, 2005 8 of 110   They’re trying to model it  I don’t know if they have found any good   ones; you’re absolutely right about that These products have not been widely used; they’ve   tended to be used by a narrow segment until fairly recently  ARMs do have different   prepayment characteristics  I know from what I’ve read from the folks who sell the models that   they are working to improve their ARMs models to help with the hedging  But at this stage it’s   not as straightforward as buying an interest rate option on a long-term fixed-rate mortgage where                                              August 9, 2005 11 of 110  there’s sort of a natural hedge in a natural market  I don’t think there’s much likelihood in the   near term of a prepayment shock to the servicers, but in a year or two the possibility is probably   fairly significant    It is That’s exactly right  They do the best they can with the limited   history and information they have from the way the market has behaved in the past  But it has   not been a very big market because a lot of these weren’t securitized until fairly recently, so they   weren’t priced very well Therefore, unless you have a history in the business and have your   own internal model, it’s extremely difficult to figure out how prepayments are going to behave    From the little information that we have gathered, it’s a fairly wide array   of investors—from hedge funds to a very large number of international investors  I don’t know   if central banks are buying these, but—    Exactly That’s true  "
