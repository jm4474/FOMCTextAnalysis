9179,2011-12-13,"4  I will be referring to the material in the chart package labeled  “FOMC Briefing on Communications Initiatives”  My briefing has two parts  First, I  will discuss the subcommittee’s recommendation that the Committee begin to collect  and publish participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy in the quarterly  Survey of Economic Projections (SEP)  Then I will discuss the draft statement on  longer-run monetary policy goals and monetary policy strategy that the subcommittee  circulated last Friday   On the SEP, in the November briefing on the trial-run results, the staff presented  exhibits that focused on the central tendency and range of the projections for the  target federal funds rate—essentially the same approach that the SEP uses in  presenting the economic projections     The central tendency is calculated by omitting the three highest and three lowest  forecasts  This statistic generally comes close to covering the middle two-thirds of  the values when the distribution of projections is reasonably symmetric  In contrast,  when the distribution is highly skewed with substantial clustering at one end of the  range, the central tendency can cover a markedly higher proportion of responses   This consideration is relevant under present circumstances, because the distribution of  the funds rate projections is highly concentrated at the zero lower bound  For  example, in 2012, three-quarters of the projections are 13 basis points, but the central  tendency ranges from 13 to 67 basis points   In light of such considerations, the subcommittee explored alternative approaches,  and settled on a design that provides further details about the distribution of funds rate  projections  The SEP mockup that was circulated to the Committee on December 2  includes two new charts that are shown in exhibit 1 on the first page of your handout   These charts convey the key features of the policy projections and are intended to  complement the information provided in the Committee’s forward policy guidance   The upper panel of this exhibit depicts participants’ assessments of the  appropriate calendar year for the first increase in the funds rate  The bottom panel is  a plot of the individual projections, showing the average level of the target funds rate  in the fourth quarter of each year of the projection period and over the longer run  In                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Krane are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)     December 13, 2011 120 of 198              effect, the upper panel provides information about the appropriate timing of policy  liftoff, while the lower panel gives a sense of participants’ expectations regarding the  appropriate pace of subsequent firming   Your next exhibit shows the new text in the mockup  The introductory portion  gives a brief overview of the policy projections, while the section titled “Appropriate  Monetary Policy” provides a more detailed narrative  These paragraphs describe  salient aspects of the assumed liftoff date and the distribution of the funds rate  projections  They also summarize the key factors that informed participants’ policy  judgments and contributed to the diversity of their views   With regard to participants’ views about the appropriate path of the balance sheet,  the subcommittee concluded that a qualitative narrative would be more practical than  quantitative projections about its size, average duration, and relative composition  In  retrospect, however, one shortcoming of the trial-run survey was the omission of a  specific question about the balance sheet, and hence relatively few participants noted  it in their submissions  Thus, going forward, it could be helpful for the SEP to ask  participants whether their views for the balance sheet differ materially from the  Tealbook baseline   Looking ahead, we have identified a number of other potential enhancements to  explore in the SEP  For example, the distributions of the economic projections could  be depicted using an approach similar to the lower panel of exhibit 1  Information  about the linkages between the policy projections and the economic forecasts could  be provided, perhaps using bivariate scatterplots like the ones presented at the last  FOMC meeting  We would be happy to follow up on these possibilities as well as  any other suggestions that you might have for enhancing the SEP, either for external  publication or for internal use by the Committee  In considering the subcommittee’s  recommendation to publish policy projections, you may want to refer to the  approaches taken by other central banks around the world  As seen in your next  exhibit, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Swiss National Bank condition their  baseline forecasts on a constant interest rate path  The Bank of England and the Bank  of Japan condition theirs on financial market expectations of policy rates  The ECB,  which is the only major central bank with a policy board of comparable size to the  Federal Reserve’s, also publishes a forecast conditioned on market expectations of the  policy rate; however, this forecast is that of the staff and not the policy board  One  notable disadvantage of all of these approaches is that the central banks’ economic  projections do not necessarily correspond to their outlook under appropriate policy     Three central banks do publish projections for their appropriate policy rates  the  Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Norges Bank, and the Riksbank  In New Zealand,  these forecasts convey the views of the governor  The Norges Bank and the Riksbank  publish forecasts that represent the consensus of their policy boards, each of which  has about a half-dozen members  These two central banks also publish confidence  bands to emphasize the uncertainty surrounding the baseline forecast  In addition, the  Norges Bank presents trajectories under some alternative scenarios  A figure taken   December 13, 2011 121 of 198              from the Norges Bank’s most recent monetary policy report is shown in the bottom  panel of exhibit 3   One concern about publishing policy rate projections is that some members of the  public may not fully understand the conditionality of the projections and may be  surprised by subsequent revisions  However, this does not appear to have been a  significant problem for the RBNZ, Norges Bank, or Riksbank  For example, in mid- 2009, the actual values for the policy rates in both Norway and Sweden were well  below the 5th percentile of the forecasts they had made the previous October   However, these differences were generally perceived as appropriate responses to the  global financial crisis, and were not viewed as reneging on earlier commitments     I will now turn to the draft language of the consensus statement on the FOMC’s  longer-run goals and its strategy for fostering those goals  The latest draft of the  statement, distributed last Friday, is shown in your next exhibit  The first paragraph  reaffirms the FOMC’s commitment to its statutory mandate from the Congress to  promote maximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest  rates  It also describes the benefits of explaining policy actions to the public as  clearly as possible   The statement then spells out the consensus goals and strategies  Paragraph 2  notes that economic disturbances cause fluctuations in the goal variables, but that  monetary policy can only influence economic activity and inflation with a lag   Accordingly, the Committee’s monetary policy decisions will reflect how the  medium-term economic outlook and the balance of risks to this outlook compare with  the Committee’s longer-run goals for maximum employment and price stability   Next, the statement addresses the price stability mandate  Paragraph 3 says that,  over the longer run, inflation is primarily determined by monetary policy, and thus  the Committee has the latitude to specify a long-run goal for inflation  It specifies  this goal as being 2 percent, as measured by the annual rate of change in the price  index for overall personal consumption expenditures  It also notes that  communicating this inflation goal helps to anchor inflation expectations; this is  necessary to foster price stability and moderate long-term interest rates, and also  enhances the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of  significant economic disturbances   Paragraph 4 recognizes that it is not appropriate for the Committee to specify a  fixed goal for employment because its maximal level is largely determined by  nonmonetary factors, and that these may change over time and be difficult to  measure  However, it notes that the quarterly SEP provides participants’ estimates of  the longer-run normal rate of unemployment based on currently available  information, and it reports the central tendency for these projections from the most  recent SEP  The last sentence also observes that these longer-run projections are  substantially higher than they were several years ago, demonstrating that participants’  judgments about the long-run normal rate of unemployment respond to changes in  their assessments of the economic environment   December 13, 2011 122 of 198              The statement closes with paragraph 5 describing the strategic principle that  policy will follow a balanced approach in mitigating deviations of inflation from its  longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of  its maximal level  It says the Committee will do so by taking into account both the  size of these deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which they  are expected to be closed  Your final exhibit reproduces the questions the  subcommittee circulated last week to help guide today’s discussion
