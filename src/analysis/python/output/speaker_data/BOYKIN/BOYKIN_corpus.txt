 Mr Chairman, our forecast also is pretty much in agreement with the staff forecast We have strengthened our outlook for the national economy for the rest of this year and going  -14-    8/18/87  into next year We think we do have a rate of expansion that is sustainable Subjectively, it is a little hard for me really to believe all that, given what has been going on in our particular part of the country While we are seeing a little improvement, we certainly are lagging the rest of the country Both anecdotally and statistically, we can kind of show that we are working through the trough; but the recovery, to the extent that there is one, is so fragile that it would not take very much to have us continue the downturn that we've been in for the last couple of years Reference has been made to energy We have seen a little improvement there, certainly, in terms of perceptions There has been a little improvement in construction, but it's not in building; it's in roads, public construction, that sort of thing Manufacturing looks pretty good In agriculture, we are continuing to see cropland values decline and we are not through yet; of course, we came into this a year or two after the Midwest, in particular And, of course, everybody reads about the conditions of the financial institutions One concern that we are hearing, primarily from people in mid-sized and small businesses, is that they're very concerned that they're not going to get credit And without credit, they're not going to be able to grow and expand and create jobs This is something that we're hearing more and more The banks are not willing or able to lend, and a cutoff of credit has occurred; and they don't see very much end to it   That's a lot of it, Jerry The bankers say that there just is not any loan demand The small and mid-sized businessmen say we have the demand but banks won't take the risk So, I think it's probably somewhere in between--the banks are not seeing the kind of demand in the loans that they are willing to make   Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative B I would favor basically no change from current policy, and I say that because I guess I am not totally convinced that the economy is going to be quite as strong as perhaps some others believe I question that inflation is a problem at this point Granted, when you determine or realize it is a problem, you are pretty far down the road, so that a certain amount of anticipation is desirable But, given the fact that the interval between this meeting and the September meeting is pretty short compared to some of the intervals, and that the need for a policy shift is less than convincing--to me, at least--I would stick with alternative B, the $500 million borrowing assumption Rather than being symmetrical, though, I would have a sentence in there that would allow a little tightening by the Desk, if that should become necessary   Mr Chairman, I guess it's somebody's turn to say something not quite as positive as we have been hearing I guess it falls to my lot, being from the Eleventh District I would characterize our economy in the Eleventh District as still somewhat sluggish and a little fragile, although there have been tentative signs of improvement Businesses around the District that serve a national or international market all seem to be saying that they are seeing some improvement These would be primarily in electronics, livestock, chemicals, and defense There is a little more optimism there The businesses that serve their own local area or region,  -22-    9/22/87  though, say that their business remains flat; they really have not seen any signs of improvement Obviously, there is a correlation in attitudes and sentiment related to oil prices, since oil is so important in our region With the improvement there, and with the increase in the oil rig count and additional activity going on, there is more optimism There is a little more activity in related businesses; all but construction-related manufacturing are growing Agriculture is stabilizing, and cotton and livestock farming are doing fairly well Our retail sales remain fairly flat We continue to worry somewhat about the condition of our financial institutions Pick up a newspaper and you'll still find reports of foreclosures and bankruptcies continuing Last week in Austin, which was really the bright spot for the last several years in Texas, there was the posting of a foreclosure of a fairly major hotel-office complex that was pretty new There were foreclosure postings in Houston, also, of two or three fairly well known good projects This doesn't mean the foreclosures will actually occur; the postings could be part of a renegotiation Nevertheless, it is upsetting We saw a report last week that Dallas had lost 40,000 jobs over the last year That seems awfully high to me, but those are the kinds of reports we are hearing Though we hope that we are on a comeback trail--and, if oil prices hold, I think we will be--I don't think we have seen the bottom of our commercial real estate problem I think we probably are going to be worrying about that for at least two years, possibly three, before we can work through that  On the national picture, and possibly I'm somewhat influenced by our own Eleventh District, we would come out--looking out through the rest of this year to 1988--a little below where the Greenbook is this time Although we moved our own forecast up slightly, we didn't come as far as the Board staff has in the Greenbook On the long-term rate, I don't know that I have any particularly useful insight into that except that the evident concern about inflation does not seem to be quite as deep among the people I've talked to; certainly, in our District, there is not really [unintelligible] to the problem   That's my policy prescription four square   Mr Chairman, uncertainty certainly prevails down my way In looking at what might be appropriate for forecasting, we really would not have much basis for argument [with the staff forecast], but in our own forecast we have come down a full point; that is very judgmental, obviously As far as the effect on our District economy, our initial reaction is that probably whatever the effect, it is likely to be a little less in the Eleventh District than in the rest of the country, simply because we are so much farther behind the rest of the country We have seen signs of sluggish growth in the District We think the situation continues to be extremely fragile The real estate problems keep coming up and are a pervasive cloud in the psychology The earnings reports that we have just gone through with our financial institutions, and the added provision for loan losses--most of it triggered by real estate--just put another damper on that The cautious optimism that I tried to express for a couple of meetings seems to have abated somewhat I'm not sure we can even be cautiously optimistic right now   Mr Chairman, I'm right along with everyone else I favor the 6-3/4 percent funds rate, which I guess I would have described as "A-" or "B+" going in [to this discussion], but your description of "B" puts me there, so I don't have any problem with that On the borrowing number I was thinking $300 million, but I guess that becomes whatever it becomes, given the funds rate that we're looking for On the language, I favor Variant I; I think saying as well as we can what is going on is important Of course, that won't be released for about six weeks and that's a while down the road If any misinterpretation seems to be going on in the markets as to what we are doing, maybe another statement such as the one released earlier would be called for I thought that was very, very appropriate I like things even on both sides as a rule, so symmetric language always appeals to me   Mr Chairman, I'm not a proponent for changing anything we're doing I'm satisfied with where we are and, therefore, I really have nothing to contribute to this discussion I assume that nothing's going to change; and if that's so, I'll be satisfied  SPEAKER(?) Except the discount rate   Mr Chairman, on the national economy, we would line up pretty well with the Greenbook forecast We've felt for the last several months that on the national level we [unintelligible] fairly good performance Looking at the District level, and I guess more particularly at Texas, about the only bright spot that we can find is in manufacturing, where we are seeing improvement We're having employment in the manufacturing area as great as, if not greater than, other parts of the country; and of course, the services industries related to that are doing well Having said that, I've said about all of the good that I can The overall unemployment rate in Texas, for example, is well over 8 percent, which is considerably above the national rate Agriculture did have a good year; it is hoped that it will have another one I think drought conditions might be developing and are causing us to wonder slightly about that  Obviously, one of the major things going on down our way is the bank and financial conditions, which I understand we will get into  -44-    3/29/88  later in some detail But it's a very, very heavy overhang in terms of attitudes and willingness to take on new ventures There's certainly concern over the ability to obtain financing from financial institutions in the local area The real estate situation obviously has contributed very significantly to these problems and there is no short-term solution to that It's going to be more long-term, as opposed to immediate, as far as what's going to be happening in Texas I think it's going to be a very close race between the ability of our local financial institutions and businesses to improve their balance sheets and get a little sounder footing and the onset of a downturn in the national economy at some point If we do encounter such a downturn before we are able to position ourselves a little better, we are going to have even bigger problems than we already have   I agree with the position that has been stated by you, Mr Chairman, and others I'm a "B-", "C+", however you characterize it, with the $100 million increase in borrowing I guess I would be inclined to move sooner rather than later on the $100 million If I had the real courage of my convictions, as Lee Hoskins does, I would really like to line up with him I guess I just don't have that much courage, given the situation I have down there in the Southwest But, I think he makes a very, very good point that policy, and what it is that we can do, has to be viewed in the longer run And I think when we temporize and rationalize some of the short-run problems we think would result from taking actions, that's not really communicated and tends to compound the problems over the longer range   Well, Mr Chairman, I'll start with the Eleventh District and get the less-than-good news out of the way early I would say that the perception of what's happening in the Texas economy, and the Eleventh District generally, is improving somewhat I think we are beginning to see some evidence showing through in the statistics We did have growth in our District in the last half of last year that had kind of plateaued or stalled out during the first half of this year But now we do think that we are seeing some renewed or resumed growth in the District and this is reflected in the employment numbers and that is primarily centered in Texas  Those categories where we are not seeing much improvement, of course, remain in the construction side of it, finance, and insurance We do have our real estate remaining weak We've had fairly good rains in our District, although somewhat spotty, but the feeling is that the rains have ameliorated the drought effects The information that we are getting from our bankers around the District is that they don't see a major threat to timely repayment of agricultural loans in the District  We are somewhat nervous, I guess, about oil prices If we do get a decline there, that obviously will be a negative However, there has been so much adjustment to lower oil prices that it would not have the same effect as earlier declines had Given the fact that our economy seems to be so much more closely linked to the national  -13-    8/16/88  economy, and given the fairly good forecast for the national economy, we feel that that will continue to be a pull for us and will be positive  Attitudinally, as far as the financial situation is concerned, I think there is a great deal of relief with the approach to the resolution of the First Republic situation, and that has received very good press, has been very well received Now the remaining speculation is whether the last big one will have to have some kind of relief   Mr Chairman, I also would go with "B", a $600 million borrowing assumption, and the asymmetric language because I do think the next move will have to be up As for the placement of the aggregates, I'm rather ambivalent on that at the present time Having tightened the position, which would lean towards moving to a little more restriction, I must confess I have a little discomfort I share many of the concerns that Governor LaWare pointed out Given the situation that we have in the Southwest, and having I guess the bulk of the thrift problem centered down there as well as other things, I'm a little uncomfortable as rates move up--as credit becomes a little more restrictive--about what the full implications are going to be I think it's going to make it fairly difficult for us However, since there can only be one monetary policy and it has to be a national policy, I fully support the direction of what we are doing   Mr Chairman, I'll lead off As far as the Eleventh District economy is concerned, we're looking at what's happening or might happen in energy--which over the past year or so is showing a little bit of improvement and turning into more of a neutral factor for us As far as the outlook for the economy generally, the overall mood of the people that we've talked to very recently has been  -10-    9/20/88  a little more positive, although it's difficult for them--or for us-- to point to specifics that show that something's happening  If we do get a sustained price for oil in the $14 range, that would probably indicate that we have no growth at all in our District economy, whereas we currently have a forecast of sluggish growth of something around 1 percent or less for next year We are getting reports of substantial capital investments that are planned or that are under way in petrochemicals, particularly in Houston--the upper Gulf Coast area And they are, of course, benefiting from the lower price of oil  We were fortunate over the last several days to have missed some of the rather devastating effects of Hurricane Gilbert Although there were tornadoes and there was some damage, it wasn't anything close to what had been anticipated The real estate area continues, of course, to be the biggest drag that we have And I do have a real- -as opposed to an anecdotal--comment on that About five years ago, we had our bank property appraised in connection with a study that we were doing The appraiser came up with a value in excess of $30 million, which a couple of our directors--particularly our then- Chairman who was in the real estate business--felt was low We've just had our property reappraised in connection with another study we're doing The same professional independent appraiser group did it this time They're telling us that our property now is worth between $6-1/2 and $8-1/2 million You know, that's something else   Well, there are special factors The key--and this is not the place to make this statement--but I'll make it anyway What they're saying is our building is totally used up in terms of its usefulness   But I thought that was very, very significant Granted, we have special circumstances; nevertheless I have a better appreciation of what the commercial banks have been having to deal with as they get new appraisals and reappraisals And I don't believe anybody knows what real estate is worth any more   That's all I have   I would just express agreement   In the Eleventh District, Mr Chairman, things are pretty much as they were in September We are continuing to see some modest growth Manufacturing is leading the improvement that we have The unemployment rates in our three states have been moving downward but only Texas is making any progress compared to the national rate in closing the gap In Texas we've got unemployment of 68 percent; in New Mexico it's 8-1/2 percent; in Louisiana it's 10 percent The lower oil prices are a real source of concern and could undermine the modest recovery that we've been experiencing I think further declines would probably cause us to look for zero growth in    11/1/88  1989 compared with the 1-1/2 percent or so rate of growth that we've been forecasting over the last several months Other sources of concern for us include a noticeable slowdown of orders in the electronics industry And there continue to be a few pockets on the foreign side and [some] that tend to be drought-related Of course, we continue to worry about and try to deal with the financial situa- tion in our District, both on the thrift side and the banking side   I would agree with your policy prescription, Mr Chairman   Well, Mr Chairman, I really don't have any questions or any real disagreement with the staff forecast  Looking at the District, our recent performance and the near- term prospects for our economy continue to improve Over the last year and a half the gains in the Dallas District have been concentrated primarily in manufacturing services More recently, we've seen some gain from the energy sector The contraction in construction seems to be nearing the bottom Agriculture remains a bit of a concern, primarily because of the uncertainty of the drought situation As I've reiterated over the last six months, most of my contacts outside the banking and real estate industries have been sounding increasingly optimistic I had a group of investment merchant bankers in for a breakfast meeting last week and most of them agreed that the Texas economy and even that of Louisiana, which has been one of the weakest states, are beginning to demonstrate increasing strength In fact, a few who represent very large companies with considerable capital from both national and international sources are beginning to look upon the region as a ripe opportunity because of the reduced competition coming from the banking sector On the whole the regional economy is improving but growing slower than the nation Banking, real estate, and now agriculture are the exceptions to this pattern Within the District no one is noting price or wage pressures but there have been a few signs over the last two or three months of some shortages of engineers, first in Houston and now in Dallas Overall, I think we're feeling a little more optimistic down our way than we have for quite some time   I would favor alternative B as you suggested And I would strongly favor asymmetric language I would do that because I think projections are extremely important right now I'm not sure that we will know by the time of the next meeting whether we are in the pause or whether we're heading a little differently And when this policy record becomes public, following the next meeting, I think it could lead to some confusion in terms of our commitment to having inflation in the forefront of our thinking I think it could send the wrong signal   Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District our economy continues to grow Even in Louisiana, where for the first time in quite some time the unemployment rate has slipped down to    5/16/89  single digits, it's looking a little better Growth is getting increasingly closer to the national rate; part of that, of course, is some of the slowing of the US rate We are seeing more and more signs that we are looking more like other Federal Reserve Districts; we're not quite the outlier that we were Labor shortages of specific types are cropping up Engineers, for example, are in very short supply We're even seeing help wanted signs appearing throughout Dallas Unemployment rates in many Texas cities are now in the low 5 percent area Nonetheless, the greatest strain still is centered along the Gulf Coast area--Houston in particular--and in the lower Rio Grande Valley We still have problems in some of the other areas of the District Banking and real estate are still dragging us down a little in Dallas, Austin, Shreveport and similar areas Manufacturing continues to grow above the national rate And in the services sector employment was matching the national growth In sum, Mr Chairman, we feel a little more optimistic about our area Having been burned as badly as we were, we don't want to overstate that We are coming from a fairly low figure but people really are feeling better   We're familiar with that term   Mr Chairman, I would agree with "B" and the $600 million My preference really would be to remain asymmetric or "as-symmetric," as Mr Syron says The [weak] money growth is troublesome; but the forecast is for some rebound and if that holds true, that's fine But it seems to me that more or less what I'm hearing is the commitment for a conference call before the next meeting, which gives the opportunity to make any slight adjustment if that's wrong But I would still lean toward "B," asymmetric   Mr Chairman, our District economy continues to underperform the nation We are now estimating that we're doing about two-thirds as well; we had been doing about half as well This improvement, though, is primarily because of the slowdown in the growth at the national level; on a [regional] level we're doing about the same Geographically, the mix of growth seems to be a little different Texas now appears to be growing more slowly than either Louisiana or New Mexico Within Texas, Houston of course continues to be the bright spot Having been down there recently, listening to the anecdotal information coming out of Houston, the mood is totally different One large developer in home building said it was quite refreshing to worry about drainage ditches as opposed to other types of drainage In the District, manufacturing activity has remained our strongest sector; employment has been growing in that area while it has been declining nationally Textiles, apparel, plastics, rubber, and wood products have been doing particularly well Most durable goods products have been sluggish; electronic components have been particularly soft and transportation equipment is a bit of a concern from our standpoint Our GM plant in Arlington, Texas is going to be down for a while We wonder about the GM truck assembly plant over in Shreveport Bell Helicopter remains somewhat in doubt And of course with the B-2 bomber, General Dynamics as well as LTV have some concerns Construction remains the softest sector and is showing signs of bottoming out Agriculture has been hurt by moisture conditions; we either had too much or too little moisture I'd say all-in-all, our sluggish growth continues from a very low base And outside of Houston and a few border towns on the Rio Grande Valley there is little or no sense of optimism Of course, on the financial scene, we have had all of our major bank holding companies with their problems addressed in various fashions Something good always comes out of something bad; we've had an opportunity to widen our acquaintanceships considerably We've spent a lot of time meeting folks out of the Cleveland District and out of New York and out of Richmond and out of San Francisco   On the national economy, basically we wouldn't have a great deal of difference on the forecast If we would differ it is that for some reason we have a hard time being quite as    8/22/89  optimistic on the national picture Our guess would be that if we're going to err, it's probably that we are not going to get quite as strong a performance as projected Of course, the inflation side is still worrisome; indeed [we don't see a] significant improvement for the next year and a half on the inflation front   "B" and I would stay symmetric Although my opinion is that if there's any change it would be toward ease, I'm not so convinced of that that I would want to put it in the directive at this point   Mr Chairman, on the national picture our view would be pretty well along the lines of the Greenbook We would not find anything about which we would have serious disagreement As several others have pointed out, the forecast of inflation running through 1991 remains quite troublesome--certainly to me  Looking at our District, it's very difficult to come up with adjectives to characterize what is going on If I were an optimist I'd say we were having modest growth If I were a pessimist I'd say it has turned very sluggish Not knowing which I am, I'll try to describe a few of the elements Where we had had some strength in manufacturing, those gains are slowing The slowdown in electronics seems to be in line with expectations In petrochemicals, inventories have been building and prices have been soft, with a result that several plant expansions either have been delayed or canceled Retail sales have shown modest improvement with the exception of auto sales, which had been stronger and now are showing declines in many areas Two of our weakest sectors, energy and construction, have begun to show small gains; but residential construction continues weak as does agriculture--both cattle and crops The statistical data continue to show what I would say is modest growth We have had rather extensive discussions over the last couple of weeks with various businessmen and others in our District The attitude has changed, even in Houston Growth seems to have leveled off there as it has [in Southern Texas]; and they were two particularly strong areas The way that they are characterizing the situation is that they think our economy either has stalled or is shortly headed for a stall   That could be a factor!  SPEAKER(?) He's back   Well, a considerable difference--   I favor alternative B My preference also would be for symmetric language   Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District there is not very much new to report I think it's fair to say that the expansion--what little we have had--has slowed Private nonfarm and farm [income] was basically unchanged between July and September The  -11-    11/14/89  Texas index of leading indicators has fallen for four consecutive months The declines have been moderate, suggesting continued weak growth rather than a recession The declines have been led by durable goods manufacturing; nondurable goods manufacturing is holding up a little better Services have been strong, with growth in business services especially strong The construction sector does appear to have bottomed out finally I guess the best words we are hearing are around the Houston and Gulf Coast area, although those words are not quite as good as we were hearing several months ago   Mr Chairman, I would agree with alternative B; I have a fairly strong preference for symmetric language Also, I agree with those who have already expressed the view that the inflation forecast that we have in the Greenbook doesn't show very much progress there Granted, we have risks on the down side of the economy; but on the other hand, I'm not sure that we've had the opportunity to see all of the effects flowing through of what we have done in terms of ease over the last few months I guess I'm hoping that that will keep us from slipping into recession But I think we would make a bad mistake if we really didn't keep inflation fairly high in importance   I don't think we have a luncheon   Well, Mr Chairman, the economy in the Dallas District continues to mend Slowly but surely economic conditions are showing mixed signs of improvement Finally, we even see Louisiana being able to reflect slightly better conditions However, with regard to the improvements that we're seeing, while they're pretty much across the board, the extent of the gains is highly variable Energy and construction continue to show modest improvement The rig count in Texas has shown some significant gains A lot of this is attributable to the horizontal drilling that's going on The manufacturing picture has been somewhat mixed On the construction side, while we have seen gains, they are possibly a little tenuous as construction values have fallen lately On the other hand, this appears to be a correction related to potential overexpansion in petro-chemical capacity down along the Gulf Coast The weakest sector of our economy is agriculture; that continues to be hurt by drought and other weather-related conditions On the so-called credit crunch issue, we also hear some anecdotal evidence; but it's not all that different from what we have heard for quite some time with respect to our small businesses And given where we've been in our District, we've been hearing this for quite some time On a little broader issue, if the rationing really is going on and it seems to be primarily related to real estate concerns, I would question whether a slight change in interest rates one way or the other really would address that particular problem  On the national picture, I feel pretty good about the staff's current forecast It seems a little more in line at least with what we've been thinking and we would not take issue with it I would associate myself with those who are expressing concern about the long- term prospects for inflation I think that maybe something ought to be done about that   Mr Chairman, I would lean somewhere between "B" and "C" but I'm certainly willing to accept the arguments of what the possible effects might be on foreign exchange rates That being the case, though, I would feel pretty strongly about going asymmetric on the directive Roger pretty well made that speech It does seem to me that it positions us, if later events call for an actual upward movement in the fed funds rate If that became necessary, we could move; or if that were delayed and had to come even after the next meeting it seems to me that that would tend to minimize a bit the surprise element that seems to be a matter of concern If later information indicates that the economy and other factors are not what  -42-    3/27/90  I at least anticipate--if policy doesn't actually change over the intermeeting period--the markets would be able to read that; and following the next meeting, if nothing happens, they could tell that pretty quickly So, I don't see any significant risk in going asymmetric, but I think there are a lot of good arguments for going that way   Mr Chairman, it's not too often that anecdotal and statistical information seem to be pointing in the same direction, but in our case for the first time in over two years they are beginning to match In contrast to previous reports that I've been giving, where District performance had been marked with some strong and some very weak sectors, there is now improvement and it's more broadly based District manufacturing continues to outperform the nation We had increases in manufacturing employment in the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of 1990 while it was declining nationally In wholesale and retail trade, District employment increased at about a 4-1/2 percent rate in the first quarter Employment in the services sector is still growing at a healthy rate, with particularly strong gains in the areas of finance, insurance, and real estate In the energy sector, all field activities continue to improve; as for the long-term outlook, there is considerable optimism for continued improvement District construction activity has been strong recently, though it's likely to slow some from its current pace of nearly 10 percent Recent rains have improved the outlook for agriculture except, of course, in those areas where we've had some very, very severe flooding, which I'm sure you've seen on the news  Our bottom line is that we do appear to be coming out of what we call our great recession in the District, and the improvement and growth seem to be widespread Also, I think it's becoming quite evident that our economy is much more diversified Having said that, I'm inclined to conclude that we may be getting away from the historical boom-bust type of activity that we've had There may be some disappointment for those who are waiting for the next boom, having gone through the bust But I'm inclined to think that for the longer term it's going to be a much more healthy situation economically  With respect to the national picture, we're in substantial agreement with the forecast that you have, Mike   Mr Chairman, I am obviously more uncertain today than I have been in the past couple of meetings I could support alternative "B" I would have a fairly strong preference for asymmetric language Your prescription of a narrative in the policy record reflecting inflation concerns and that sort of thing is okay, but if we're talking about credibility and sending some signals, that brings in a lot of nuances and subtleties it seems to me I think an asymmetric directive would give credibility to the verbiage that would be in the policy record and for that reason I think we would have some opportunity to strengthen at least the credibility [of our inflation effort]   Mr Chairman, as seems to be the case for the nation as a whole, economic conditions in our region are showing signs of slowing There are special factors here and there that keep the overall growth numbers positive After fairly strong employment gains in the first quarter of the year, our three-state District would have experienced employment losses in the second quarter had it not been for a strong growth in government jobs Our manufacturing employment had been growing slightly while conditions nationally deteriorated In the last few months, however, manufacturing employment has declined in each of our three states Weakness has been concentrated in transportation equipment--mainly defense-related--apparel, and electrical equipment While employment gains were experienced in chemicals and petroleum refining, we expect some slowing in these industries with the higher price of energy-related input Employment in the services sector has been extremely weak outside of government employment The government employment gains were for all government entities and were not just related to federal census workers  -18-    8/21/90  In private services, the main areas of strength were in transportation and public utilities, both of which will be adversely impacted by higher energy prices The one area where higher energy prices should help the District economy is in drilling activity, but any positive response that does occur will be with a long lag time First, inflation-adjusted oil prices are only about half the peak level reached in 1981, and the rig count is highly correlated with real oil prices Second, almost half the drilling activity in the Dallas District is for natural gas which has a long way to go before gas prices catch up with oil prices Third, drillers have to be convinced that higher energy prices will persist for several years And lastly, even if everything on the price side fell in place--and as Bob Forrestal found out--we simply do not have the capacity to increase drilling activity since about half of that capacity exited the industry over the last four years I did see on local TV that they reinstituted a rough-neck school out in west Texas to teach people how to drill oil wells So, somebody has a little optimism In the short run, the negative effects of higher energy prices in the District will predominate over the positive effects I might add, however, that the weak picture for retail sales that has existed lately should be helped somewhat by the sharp boost in royalty and partnership income which is proportional to oil prices  Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, we did do another round of Beigebook contacts As a result, the anecdotal evidence has shifted from [an outlook for] slow but steady growth to one of great uncertainty Even the focus of agriculture down our way has shifted from too little or too much moisture into marketing uncertainties in the new environment With respect to the national picture, I really don't have views that would be considered different from the Greenbook forecast   Mr Chairman, I'm fully supportive of your position   Mr Chairman, the economy in the Dallas District seems to reflect many of the national trends, but overall we may be doing just slightly better than the nation now The picture is quite mixed, however, and virtually all segments of the region's economy are growing more slowly than earlier in the year The higher energy  -25-    10/2/90  prices help fewer people and hurt more people in our District than was the case years ago So, the net impact is less certain Residential construction activity has shown a modest pickup from the extremely depressed levels of the last several years, but nonresidential construction is flatter now, with the exception of the Houston area Retail sales have shown some very slim gains in recent months The refining petro-chemical business has held up relatively well lately Other areas of manufacturing have been somewhat weak We did meet with our advisory council on small business and agriculture a few weeks ago Our agricultural conditions seem to have improved, certainly in recent weeks Outside of the issue of credit availability, which incidentally is not a new issue with us, the economy may be doing considerably better than it had been over the past several years of meeting with that group  Looking at the national economy, I have no real disagreement with the staff's Greenbook forecast Intuitively, I wonder if the third quarter will be quite as strong as they're indicating, but I would not have a great quarrel with it We don't see any evidence that we're heading into a cumulative downturn As a matter of fact, as I look at Mike's forecast and think about that outcome, it would not be a bad result, if it could actually be accomplished It seems to me that the assumption is that a steady monetary policy would accomplish that result So, in spite of all the uncertainties and concerns, I would tend to pay a bit more attention to the inflation picture rather than [to the possibility of] the economy slipping over too far   Well, Mr Chairman, as much as I would like to support what you're recommending, I have some difficulty doing it I guess to me the Greenbook forecast looks a little more realistic than it does to others I'm afraid we might lose sight of the inflation situation I'm more concerned that the timing would be premature by  -54-    10/2/90  several weeks if we did make a move It seems to me that the last 1/4 point move was tied to the credit situation And I have to confess I don't fully understand--we'll discuss it at lunch--but if you do the reserve requirement change, it's to address that That seems to me at least a nod in that direction So, if that is a nod, I would want to wait a while longer and let the economic data come through before doing what is being contemplated So, I would not favor it   Well, Mr Chairman, I really don't take much exception to the staff forecast through the first quarter of next year I do wonder a little, as others have, about the bounceback of growth in the second quarter and thereafter on the inflation side I hope it turns out to be the way that it's forecast I guess I have slightly less optimism in that regard  As far as developments in the Dallas District, it does seem that conditions down our way, at least on average, are reflecting the same set of weaknesses that are affecting the rest of the country Higher oil prices are supposed to improve matters in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico but so far we're not seeing any of the benefit For example, neither drilling activity nor employment in the oil and gas industries has increased significantly Manufacturing employment is down; construction is down slightly; employment growth is stalling in the private producing sectors; agricultural incomes are lower than expected because of increased fuel costs Government is the only robust sector, and to me that's a bit of a negative Uncertainty is a major factor that seems to be depressing economic activity in the District The volatility in the oil markets leaves oil and gas producers uncertain about the future price of oil and, therefore, cautious about expansion In addition, there seems to be heightened uncertainty about the health of the national economy, interest rates, the tax load, and the possibility of war in the Middle East All of these factors seem to be leading consumers to postpone purchases, particularly purchases of real estate and durable goods  Within the District, growth patterns are very uneven New Mexico, which had been showing the strongest growth of our three states, has shown actual declines in employment and other economic measures through 1990 Louisiana had been laggard in the recovery in the Southwest but has been showing steady growth and improvement Texas, particularly in the last few months, seems to be slowing almost to a standstill We had a joint meeting last week of all four of our boards of directors and the comments made at that meeting certainly confirmed what our statistics are saying There was very little optimism expressed at that meeting In short, the near-term outlook is on the pessimistic side; but looking further out, we can expect to see some improvement only if higher oil prices are sustained   I concur, Mr Chairman I do feel a little of the sentiment that Tom Melzer expressed   Well, Mr Chairman, about the best that we can say about the Dallas District is that it's pretty flat This is what our statistical evidence is saying and it has been confirmed by our board of directors at our meeting last Thursday and by other anecdotal information that we've been getting lately It is increasingly difficult to find a segment of our District economy that is doing well Most of our contacts are mentioning either mild declines or slight gains Manufacturing activity has been weak, particularly in electronics and defense-related industries Construction activity has picked up slightly, but most of that pickup represents a completion of major petro-chemical projects begun about two years ago Our retailers are telling us that the Christmas season has been slow, with merchandise not moving except at post-Christmas-type discounts Overall, the outlook for the District economy is for little or no growth over the next few months    12/18/90  With respect to the national picture, I certainly would not take issue with Mike's forecast, particularly since he added somewhere along the line that the risks are certainly on the down side   I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I would also hope that there is a discount rate cut The only comment I would make is that I hope you would exercise considerable discretion in going any further in the intermeeting period unless something very unusual happens
