535,1977-10-17,SMOOT,"  I’ve learned two things in sitting here for the first time  One is that my  perspective is different here than it is back there; and secondly that there is some advantages of  going earlier in the process  We considered the arguments relating to the credibility of the  Federal Reserve,  and we think that there’s some merit in that argument  We agree, I think,  somewhat with Mr Roos that credibility will come when we vigorously pursue the aggregates  targets that we set     We considered the issue of base drift, and frankly, in looking at the kinds of adjustments  that might be required, and also taking into consideration the uncertainty in the economy, we  don’t think that this is the time to attempt to make up too much  Putting all that together, and  taking into consideration the arguments that have been made here, I think we came down on a  position of favoring alternative B  We think that’s a middle course, one which we can be  satisfied with  We certainly go along with the narrowing of the M2 and the M3 ranges, and we  would go along with a 1 point reduction on the top    Yes, I would like to lend support to alternative B in regard to the  aggregates; I share the view, first expressed by President Guffey, that the range on the fed funds  rate should be 6-1/4 to 7, and I’d like to move [the midpoint to] 6-5/8  "
1032,1979-04-17,SMOOT," Nevertheless, I have to agree with Bones in that  we can find no major area of disagreement with anything the staff has  said at this point; we have minor points of difference, but nothing  dramatic If one can abstract from this horrible inflation problem,  things don't appear to be out of kilter [The economic expansion is]  slowing down-I think the way we would like--and, therefore, in  general terms our view would be to stay roughly where we are   I don't know whether it's a fact of whom I'm  sitting between today but I find myself in amazing agreement with them  on certain points We would prefer alternative B  quibble about a 118 point increase in the federal funds rate although  we don't think it's required As far as [raising] the discount rate,  that's another possibility we had considered That might merit some  consideration if the funds rate rises at all But fundamentally,  alternative B is fine   We would not   Yes   CHAIRMRN MILLER I think there is a sentiment, then, to come  back with a specific proposal, Steve and A l a n   Thank you very much   Unless there is further business we will confirm our meeting  on May 22 when the fever will have broken, everything will be cool and  you will vote unanimously for sound monetary policy!   END OF MEETING    	790417meeting 	790417staffstatements    "
1107,1979-06-27,SMOOT," Yes, Mr Chairman We have no bold thrust to put forth at this point  We are impressed by the continued softness in the domestic economy but we’re not ready to  suggest an easing in policy at this point On the other hand, we’re not inclined to suggest that we  tighten policy at this time either Thank you  "
1154,1979-07-17,SMOOT," That's correct, Mr Chairman We would agree that it was a predictable response to the speech We would be reluctant at this point, due to the condition of the economy, to take a monetary policy action But we don't in any way discount the potential buildup of additional difficulties and suggest that we watch the situation closely "
1374,1980-02-04,SMOOT," Thank you, Mr Chairman I had very little time to prepare for this Dave is not well and sends his best, however, to all of you The last time I was down here I did have time to prepare a great deal and I was very confused Now I haven't had much time to prepare very well and I am still very confused! Nevertheless, we would be somewhat less pessimistic than the Board staff's projections To address your questions On the real GNP, we see it negative for the year, but maybe in the range of 1 to 1-1/2 percent negative On the CPI, we'd say up 10 to 11 percent for the year, but if I read my own charts correctly we'd be closer to 10 percent in the fourth quarter And on unemployment, consistent with our somewhat more optimistic view on the economy, we would be in the range of 7 to 7-1/2 percent On the tax cut, we have considered a tax cut in the second half of the year in the range of $25 to $30 billion I would agree with Governor Coldwell that it ought to be carefully constructed to stimulate capital formation and to look at the social security tax Other than that, I don't find our differences with the Board staff to be that great There are a lot of marginal things that just add up to a somewhat more--  Yes, we would anticipate one I would also subscribe to Mark's comments that differences of 1/2 or 1 percentage point at this time really appear to be somewhat meaningless  Governor Partee argued for alternative I, based on the higher anticipated nominal GNP Looking at my own staff's projections, our nominal GNP figures would be somewhat higher than the Board's But they also encompass a money supply growth rate in the 4-1/2 to 5 percent range Depending on which one of those I pick, I am indifferent between alternative II and alternative III, which I think is where you were, Chairman Volcker If I had to choose, I would choose alternative II based on the observation, which is made quite clearly in the Bluebook, that all of these alternatives suggest a lower rate of growth in money than occurred last year And if we pay any attention to the long-term trend in money growth, then we are coming down from a higher trend level I must say that I have faith, as you do, that the staff's ranges are consistent; at least the numbers for M-1B, M2, etc, appear to be consistent, and I wouldn't quibble with those So, based on that, we would be agreeable to alternative II "
1525,1980-06-05,SMOOT, Philadelphia agrees 
1663,1980-10-21,SMOOT," Thank you I'll be brief Anecdotally, though I heard your story about the shopping centers, Willis, my barber assured me yesterday that people are getting fewer haircuts in reaction to inflation I said it was just because I'm getting bald!  I think as a group we have been somewhat surprised by the strength in the economy and that has been reflected in the unexpected strength in the aggregates The Bluebook provides policy alternatives that are somewhat accommodative to those surprise events by proposing two alternatives, both being less restrictive than the path chosen by this Committee last month I think that's correct; [if not], then I retract that My impression looking at ""A"" is that we picked [a growth rate of] something less than the top of the M-1B range last month I raise the point to question whether we are trying to lead or follow here And I would certainly urge that we attempt to lead, although I bear in mind the problems with monetary policy attempting to do it all by itself With regard to the forecast, the Greenbook is more pessimistic than we would be on the economy and somewhat more pessimistic than other forecasts we have seen This would cause me to be somewhat concerned about our present view of the future and our reaction to it Further, if we are entering some kind of recovery, I suspect that we have tended in the past to underestimate the growth of the economy in the early stages of recovery; and I throw that out as a reason for being somewhat concerned Given that, I would urge at a minimum alternative A, accepting the risk of higher interest rates On the issue of credibility, I think it's important that we do all we can to meet the M-1B target in the sense of staying within the range I think changing the ranges because of technical factors, which was suggested today as an alternative, would be a mistake We tend to accept what is given to us in the form of a lower M-1A but we're not happy with or [don't] tend to accept M-1B when it drifts out of its range So I would urge alternative A at a minimum "
1774,1980-12-18,SMOOT," Thank you, Mr Chairman It's probably appropriate as the only First Vice President here that I go last except for you Are there others left?  Excuse me  I would be in agreement with those who expressed the view that the 1981 targets have to be lower than the 1980 targets And I would endorse strategy I There is a consensus, as I read it and see it in the [documentation], that we have a soft first half coming And as President Ford outlined, that's going to make it possible to achieve those lower targets for that period and give us some time to think about the second half I have heard some [comments] that we should be reluctant to let interest rates decline as rapidly as we did in 1980 However, I haven't heard anyone suggest yet that that may have been all right but perhaps we should have moved more promptly when the aggregates started to come in very strongly, rather than tolerate as much of the strength as we did and that, therefore, we may have higher interest rates today than we otherwise would have had So I would put that on the table for consideration  You mentioned, Mr Chairman, that you are hearing people say ""If this is what dealing with inflation means, I'd rather have inflation"" I suspect that means ""If this is what dealing with inflation is via monetary policy only, then I'd rather have inflation"" I think that simply indicates the extreme reluctance within the economy generally to make the kinds of adjustments that are really necessary to deal with the inflationary problem that we have There are less painful ways, I'm sure, to handle this And there are more equitable ways In that regard, everything I have read about strategy conflict--and I think we have some here between monetary policy and fiscal policy and between labor union policies and other policies--is that we have to speak as strongly as we can on the resoluteness of the Federal Reserve in this endeavor When we are involved in these strategies of conflict, people have to believe that we mean to carry out our stated strategies or certainly we will lose  Finally, two minor points One is that I would agree with those who have suggested that we look at some aggregate other than M-1A or M-1B, or M2, on the order of perhaps an M1-C I don't endorse [any alternative] wholeheartedly at this point, but it is certainly worth further staff consideration My second point is that on ATS and NOW accounts, there is some evidence in New Jersey that about 20 percent or maybe a little more of the money that went into NOWs came out of ATS accounts We are doing some further work to try to highlight more of what that was all about But, of course, to the extent that those kinds of transfers took place, that would have no effect on M-1B Thank you "
1883,1981-04-28,SMOOT, Philadelphia can agree with that also 
2007,1981-08-18,SMOOT," Steve, a question In the directive language, can you define a little more precisely for me what ""around the upper limit"" of the M2 range means? Is 11-1/2 percent M2 growth, for example, consistent--  Well, let me raise a second question if I could From the standpoint of looking at the federal funds rate, what do you think the likelihood is under these alternatives of seeing the lower ends of these interest rate ranges--15, 16 percent?
