 Thank you, Mr Chairman Our views of economic conditions closely parallel the staff's forecast in the Greenbook As some others have suggested, there are a couple of areas where we differ a bit One is in the growth of income, and the other is in consumption On balance, it appears to us that the economy is picking up strength Employment, output, and exports are expanding, as we see it, and we have noticed a jump in prices Comments by our directors and others support this view Even the hardest hit sectors --commercial construction, agriculture, and metals--are said, particularly by our directors, to be enjoying a period of stability and possible turnaround So it's not surprising, I guess, that we would suggest that our forecast shows more strength, on balance, than is indicated in the Greenbook   We see a further acceleration in prices this year and next, and believe that the risk is on the upside Therefore, I believe it's reasonable, at this point, to increase the pressure on bank reserves by moving toward the "C" path I'm not particularly picking the C alternative, but favor a $600 million borrowing objective   I like the comments made by Ed Boehne We are experiencing a bullish feeling with respect to business in our District I'm really not sure how much significance, if any, should be placed on this observation but, at a recent meeting of our directors we did notice for the first time, perhaps, some concern about risk on longer-term loans, and some adjustments in their basic lending policies, at the margin  With respect to our outlook, it's quite similar to the staff's Greenbook forecast, but we still continue to see the consumer in a stronger spending pattern than indicated by the staff We also see housing as less of a drag on the economy We don't believe exports are going to be quite as strong as projected in the Greenbook Despite the sectoral differences in the projections, we come out at about the same place, with real GNP growing at about the same pace as the forecast in the Greenbook We would see that, however, being accompanied by some pretty strong wage and price pressures  With respect to your question, I don't know how much I can add on that, but recent changes in the rates do appear to us to be related to the rate of interest [needed] to attract foreign savings We believe that some of the earlier increases that we saw might have been tied more closely to inflation   Our preference would be to line up fairly closely with Si Keehn's suggestion on the decision We would go with $600 million, but would lean on the side of further tightening  -38-    9/22/87   Well, I'm pleased to be here with you again Several of you commented that you'd rather see Lee at this chair than me and I agree with that; I certainly would Nevertheless, in our District we are cautiously optimistic about prospects for further gains in output as inventory cutbacks near an end Our District contacts tell us that they're reasonably satisfied that retail stocks are at about the desired levels Manufacturers, especially of motor vehicles, steel, and major appliances, have for the most part cleared their inventories We also see scattered signs of a comeback in capital goods out there Several industry sources believe that their business is either near a trough or in the early stages of recovery This is especially the case with producers of industrial equipment, industrial controls, heavy duty trucks, small electric motors, electrical equipment, and ball bearings But I would hasten to add that the recovery in our District is not yet broad-based or very strong Our directors do not yet see much of a recovery but their attitudes may be based more on year-to-year comparisons or on their memories of pre-recession operating rates, when they expected to be at 85 percent or more [of capacity] Still, we feel that the latest purchasing agents reports confirm that manufacturing has been in an expanding phase in recent months; and that should continue, albeit less rapidly than many would want That concludes my remarks   We still have some concern over the continued weak behavior of M2, so ideally what we'd like is a directive between "A" and "B" with an early reduction of 25 basis points in the funds rate as reports perhaps unfold in the next week or two   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District's economy reflects the sluggishness that we see in the data at the national level Employment growth has stalled Weakness in auto sales has led to some cutbacks in production schedules And this weakness in demand for autos has led to a more sluggish recovery in the tire industry as well On the other hand, the steel industry--and Si reported on this--is one of the brighter spots in our District Steel producers report that this will be the best quarter of the year, supported especially by a pickup in auto and steel warehouse business Producers of flat-rolled steel are operating at 85 to 90 percent of capacity But prices are weak, profits are down, and the mood certainly is not buoyant We also were pleasantly surprised recently with the outlook for inflation that was developed by a panel of economists from firms around the Fourth District Their projection, which had been running at about 3-1/2 to 4 percent, has been revised downward to 3 percent  In brief, we see the growth of the economy stalling in recent months but we have no reason to believe that the recovery will not be sustained And we are hopeful about the outlook for inflation That concludes my report   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our support for the recent reduction in the fed funds rate was based on the need to encourage a stronger growth rate of M2, not because of a perceived threat to the economy in the District or the nation We're concerned over the persistent weakness in M2 since last spring and its longer- term trend over the past four years A stronger growth rate in M2, within its target range, would likely add to the credibility of that target and would provide the base for a realignment of intermediate- and long-term rates Normally, we would be inclined to wait a bit longer to judge the impact of this recent reduction in the funds rate to the 5 percent level Work in Cleveland suggests that if we want a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter 1992 growth rate of 3 percent in M2, we need a funds rate lower than 5 percent Projections of M2 growth have fallen short for some time now, and we would prefer to push on the funds rate until we get M2 safely to a level we are comfortable with We're getting close now to next year and, although we haven't come to a finalization on our view yet, our guess is that we will want something around 3 percent We would not mind going into next year a little heavy on M2 growth, but we don't believe the 1/2 point reduction in alternative A is needed at this point; our preference is for the position half-way in between We believe another 25 basis point reduction of the funds rate with symmetric language is appropriate at this time And we believe we should push ahead as rapidly as we can to get the M2 growth we want   Thank you, Mr Chairman We concur with the Board staff's view that growth of the economy has stalled, although we are not quite as bearish about retail sales in the fourth quarter as is indicated in the staff's estimates Perhaps, like Gary Stern in Minneapolis, we view the outlook from the vantage point of a District that has outperformed the nation since last spring, although there are signals of softening in our area, too Ohio unemployment rose slightly in November for the third consecutive month and the unemployment rate held steady at about 56 percent, which is low relative to the nation Retail sales and manufacturing production also have been stronger than the national averages, at least through September And construction contracts for both non-residential and residential homes have continued to grow faster than for the nation through October Our concern, as Si Keehn also has indicated, is that scheduled cutbacks in auto production extending into the first quarter of '92 may be working through the auto supply industries in our District Steel operations are under downward pressure Our steel contacts note that delivery lead times have been shrinking in recent weeks; customers are no longer on a quota; and order books for flat rolled steel now have openings for late January delivery Capital goods production is still mixed but apparently on a slowly rising trend I would conclude by mentioning that, despite a pervasive mood of pessimism, even among business executives we see no widespread cutbacks of capital spending plans Indeed, some producers plan increases in 1992 and they have not changed their plans, while a few  -16-    12/17/91  others are scaling down spending increases in view of the lower-than- expected sales and profits in recent months   Yes, Mr Chairman We come out just a bit different from your recommendation, perhaps a little closer to Tom Melzer We acknowledge the potential for a no-growth economy this quarter and next But we don't believe further action by the Fed can do a whole lot to counter the near-term weakness in output Neither do we believe that the Fed can or should do much to offset the structural imbalances in the economy that have been talked about around the table here today real estate, the decline in defense expenditures, debt overloads, and so forth Apparently, M2 growth has revived recently and might now be on an acceptable path that is close to the midpoint of the target range We've cautioned against a policy oriented around a reaction to real-time economic data History has shown, it seems to us, that such a policy process can mislead  -33-    12/17/91  policymakers into thinking they can fine-tune these economic activities Moreover, it seems to us that such a policy process also leads policymakers to lose sight of the key long-term objective of maintaining price stability So, our policy prescription, while not a whole lot different from your recommendation, is that the FOMC hold a steady course at least for now until we see the cumulative results of our several actions to cut interest rates over the past year
