5228,1994-12-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Third District economy continues to expand but at a more moderate pace than in the nation as a whole Employment levels in several areas of the District still have not reached their pre-recession levels Manufacturing activity continues to be one of the strong points; its levels continue to be high, although not as high as in earlier months Retailers are telling us that they are experiencing good holiday sales, especially sales of durable goods  Housing activity around the District remains mixed, with only a few areas in the District showing signs of strength There are some signs of increases in nonresidential building activity, although this is not translating into substantial gains in construction employment  -21-    12/20/94  at this point Bank lending around the region is up but also not as strongly as in the nation as a whole That is particularly true of business lending Price pressures continue to be evident in the manufacturing sector, but they do not appear to be widespread around the region Also, although we do not have evidence of strong pressures on wages in the region, we do hear of more cases of signing bonuses being given to workers in some sectors of the District economy Thank you, Mr Chairman "
6940,2002-11-06," Thank you The report distributed to the Committee on October 8  follows up on the January 2001 SOMA study to explore several issues  These include  the structure of auctions of term discount window advances and their coordination  with Desk operations; the perspective of bank supervisors on the risks posed by an  auction credit facility (ACF); the methods proposed to control credit risk to the  Reserve Banks; and the effect of ACF advances on Federal Home Loan Bank  advances In addition, at the request of the Crisis Management Steering Committee,  the report considers whether an ACF could be used in a contingency as a substitute  for the Desk’s open market operations    The structure of ACF auctions could be quite simple or more elaborate, and there  is in fact a fair amount of detail in the report about that  A simple structure would be  preferable when first introducing an ACF The report concludes that auctions of term  advances could be easily coordinated with Desk operations and could be effective in  supporting the secular growth of currency on the Fed’s balance sheet and handling  seasonal swings in the demand for currency and reserves                         November 6, 2002 99 of 122  In consulting the supervisors about the issue of risk, those supervisors on the  working group expressed concern that, if banks were permitted to borrow very large  amounts from the ACF without any constraints, that could pose liquidity risks to  banks that might create a “too big to get downgraded” issue  That is, examiners  might become reluctant to downgrade a large bank’s CAMELS rating if that risked  making the bank ineligible to roll over its ACF funding  Supervisors also noted that  the Fed would shift from being an occasional lender of last resort to having an  ongoing lending relationship with banks under an ACF  This might pose a potential  conflict between using an ACF in the implementation of monetary policy and rating  banks independently of monetary policy objectives  Supervisors stressed that such  concerns could be substantially reduced, though perhaps not entirely eliminated, by  keeping an ACF relatively small and by establishing the same set of risk controls that  would be applied to reduce the Fed’s exposure to credit risk  Bank risk-taking, risk to  the FDIC, and credit risk to the Fed could be limited by establishing a variety of  controls that are described in the report  Those controls include restricting eligibility  to financially strong depository institutions and imposing limits on how much each  institution could borrow     Even with these risk control measures, however, the report notes that extending  ACF advances to a number of depository institutions would increase the likelihood  that the Fed would at some point have to deal with an institution whose condition  deteriorates so rapidly that FDICIA guidelines apply  Therefore, the report suggests  that the Fed would want to consider developing special procedures for dealing with  such an event   A contingency auction credit facility or what we call a CACF would share many  features of an ACF, but differences in the purposes of the two facilities and in the  circumstances surrounding their use would require some different features as well   Those, too, are discussed in detail in the report   Compared with backup facilities that duplicate the Desk’s open market  operations, a CACF—like other discount window facilities—would broaden the range  of counterparties in an emergency as compared with simply the number of primary  dealers In addition, a CACF would not be limited to dealing only in narrow classes  of collateral, which could also be important in an emergency     The report considers two emergency scenarios  In the first, in which financing  markets are functioning but the Desk and its contingency facilities are not, a CACF  could be an effective backup to the Desk in providing a predetermined aggregate  supply of reserves to the banking system  A CACF could be similarly effective in the  later stages of a more widespread crisis if many participants in financial markets were  able to return to normal operations but recovery of the Desk’s operations were  delayed In the second scenario, in which financing markets are severely  dysfunctional at the same time the Desk’s ability to operate is impaired, a CACF  would more likely be used to elastically supply funds to depository institutions at a  fixed interest rate In such a scenario, the emergency primary credit facility would                     November 6, 2002 100 of 122  likely be as effective as or easier to use than a CACF  The main appeal of the CACF  over other types of discount window lending in that type of scenario would come  from its ability to visibly provide Fed credit earlier in the day, which might have a  more positive effect on bank and market behavior during an emergency     The report identifies several open issues that would have to be resolved if these  facilities were to be implemented, and I will not go through all of those  In  concluding, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the people who helped prepare this  report The group included Jim Clouse, Bill Nelson, Michael Martinson, and David  Wright of the Board; Spence Hilton, who drafted a large part of the report, Sandy  Krieger, and Bill Walsh of the New York Fed; Lois Berthaume from Atlanta; Chris  Moore from Cleveland; Bob Hankins from Dallas; and Steve Meyer, who also drafted  a large section of the report, from Philadelphia  My thanks to all of them for their  work That concludes my remarks    Governor, if I might comment? We didn’t know at the time that the System   was going to proceed with the Lombard facility  But within the ACF or discount window   alternatives portion of the study, there was a comment that the ACF could work with either an   adjustment credit or with a Lombard style facility    Certainly that would be helpful            November 6, 2002 105 of 122 "
