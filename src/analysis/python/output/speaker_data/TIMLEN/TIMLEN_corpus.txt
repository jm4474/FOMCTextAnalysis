  Mr Chairman, we cannot hear you in New York     Good morning, Mr Chairman  On balance, I personally favor some overt  indication by the System of its continuing concern with the question of inflation  I am personally  in favor of the reduction you have proposed in the upper range of the target for M1, from 7 to  6-1/2 percent, which focuses primarily on the long-range nature of these targets  Basically it’s  clear we are going through a pause in our economic situation, but I think we should be willing to  look beyond that in setting our long-range targets  I’d also say, in defense of the technical  argument put forward by the staff paper, the explanation of what has been happening to M1  gives further ground for the reduction moves     I think it would be a very confusing signal to lower the upper range for  M1 while raising the upper range for M2 and M3  I don’t think that would convey the System’s  intent, and its present posture on inflation in long range  I think the general public would be  totally confused by the technical explanation for raising M2 and M3, and it would obscure the  real purpose, that is, lowering the upper range of M1  So I would not favor a change in M2 and  M3     But don't those weights change? Those are the weights today, but the--   Mr Chairman, I'm generally in agreement with your comments in the areas of concern that you referred to Having been trained in the traditions of Benjamin Strong, Allan Sproul, and Paul Volcker, I may have some shadings of view   I don't think I will comment in depth on all the areas you touched on, but certainly [foremost] in my mind are the level of inflation, the strong growth in the aggregates, and the tentative position of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets Sure, we have to be concerned about the prospect of a recession and high [un]employment, but now is a time when psychology is a very important factor I think the perception of the Federal Reserve's resolve may be at issue and I believe it's timely to give an indication of the direction in which we may be going It's my judgment that there should be a continuing gradual process of tightening and we should adjust to developments over time as they [occur] Those are my comments, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, I was prepared to vote for one of your first two alternatives moving the funds rate up to the area of 11 percent with a funds range of 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent, M1 at 4 to 8 percent, and M2 at 7 to 11 percent I think the important thing is the movement of the federal funds rate And if the general thinking of the Committee is in terms of an objective of 11 percent, I'd be prepared to vote for [any of several] variations in the M1 and M2 ranges--whether it's 3-1/2 to 7-1/2, 4 to 8, or 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M1, for example My leaning would be 4 to 8 on M1 or something shaded down from that, but I think the key in the eyes of the market is where we put the funds rate    But does the 33 and 34 percent include the extra  time off, extra vacations?    Mr Chairman, you expressed some interest in the  discount rate actions at the Reserve Banks Two weeks ago the  directors of the [unintelligible] New York Bank voted a 114 percent  increase in the discount rate When the officers came in that  morning, they were very troubled as to what our recommendation should  be on the rate There was some feeling to do nothing, some feeling to  do a 114 point, and some feeling to do a 112 point I think on  balance the strongest sentiment was to take a small, but not  insignificant step and therefore to recommend a 1/4 point Well,  later in the morning we heard that the projections on the monetary  aggregates were reduced somewhat, so the officers decided on balance  to propose that we wait a couple of weeks Having made the  recommendation to the directors that we do nothing [on the discount  rate], the directors expressed some sentiment that it would be well to  coordinate the action of the Bank with [developments] in the open  market that were identified with the new Chairman, so that on their  own initiative our directors moved and voted a 114 percentage point  increase in the discount rate [Our board] will be meeting on  Thursday of this week and I would suspect with further market  developments and administered rates, there might be some sentiment for  something more than the action taken two weeks ago As an aside, I  might say that there’s a good deal of talk in the markets in New York  about the possibility of an impending credit crunch As we look at     9/18/79 -26-   the situation in the individual major banks, however, we can't find a  commercial bank that may be faced with a credit crunch   In terms of the general situation, my views are very close to  Governor Coldwell's I don't think the situation is particularly  dissimilar from the one we faced last month Inflation is still for  me a matter of major concern The monetary aggregates still are on  the high side, and the dollar--which I don't think Phil mentioned--  continues to be under recurring pressures in the foreign exchange  markets I must admit that we cannot overlook signs of weakness in  the economy Unemployment is edging up and there is the question of  inventory accumulation [It's unclear] whether there has been a  correction in the automobile industry but that is a possibility I  think it's important that we not have the problem of a General Motors  strike We do have a problem that the settlement was expensive I  think it's important that the Federal Reserve not indicate that it is  weakening in any respect in its resolve to fight inflation or restrain  growth in the aggregates, so I would favor some further tightening at  this time    If I had my preference, I'd have the same ranges  suggested by the two governors [a funds range] of 11-1/4 to 12  percent with an M1 range of 3 to 7 perent--I think the 8 percent looks  very high--and an M2 range of 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent I don't feel  that this is strongly different from the numbers you put down And I  agree with Phil that if the numbers are coming in pretty high, I would     9/18/79 -38-   [want to1 feel that we could go to 11-3/4 percent and not be blocked  by the 11-1/2 percent     We had a businessmen’s meeting in our Bank about  a week ago and we had three or four industrialists as part of the  group Of the three or four, all were predicting a rather good year  in 1980 with the exception of one that is a supplier to the automotive  industry It’s generally the same kind of [story] we’ve been hearing  for a long time The industrialists were all vigorously defending  their accomplishments in the area of productivity They were saying  that their own companies were doing very well in that regard and they  thought the national statistics really related to the services field  and government regulations One of the people there was a mutual  savings banker who was not very happy about the prospect for deposits  in New York for the next quarter    Mr Chairman, it is clear to me that  expectations of Some strong action by this group this weekend are at a  high level I'm not sure that the Committee should always respond to  expectations, but in the circumstances today the proposal of combining  something new and different with strong traditional steps has real  appeal to me For some time we've been hearing complaints that the  United States is not dealing with the fundamentals And in my mind,  the rapid growth in the aggregates that we've been seeing is thought  of as one of those important fundamentals I'd say it is very  important that the announcement connect this new technique with an  effort to control the rapid growth in the money supply The total  package must not be perceived, as some have been in the past, as a  flash in the pan I'm not sure how well this will be understood As  a result, I would endorse those people who have strongly recommended  that we have an in-depth explanation of this technique and its  relationship to coping with the aggregates growth I also agree with  the remarks that Roger just made on the importance of a strong  consensus coming out of this meeting    We have another event associated with the next  meeting--the annual meeting of the retirement committee That meeting  is about the Federal Reserve’s retirement system and it brings all the  Presidents here Then they would have to come back again the next  week for the FOMC meeting    We’d just need to know in order to change our  schedules    You are staying with the suggestion of an 11-1/2  to 14-1/2 percent funds rate range, right?     District 2 is [covered by] Tom Timlen, who  agrees with the Chairman’s recommendation I must say that I was  surprised at the limited borrowing by clearing house banks here in New  York City last Friday, but I suspect it will rise In saying that I  agree with the Chairman‘s recommendation, I would also add that it  seems to me quite likely that the Desk will have trouble trying to get  the funds rate down to 15-1/2 percent, [given the degree] of  nervousness and caution among the people who are running the  commercial bank money desks S o  while I concur on the Chairman’s  recommendation, I wouldn‘t be surprised to see [fed funds trading at]  rates beyond the [formal] range That’s all I have, Mr Chairman     Frank, what's the usury ceiling in  Massachusetts?    You see, we do    But you start with the estimate of required  reserves for M1 and M2    Does either give you a better assurance as to  what Ml will do in December?    But that would be no later than January     Mr Chairman, I must say that as a former discount officer I find my views very sympathetic to those of Governor Wallich I'm reminded of the fall of either 1966 or 1969, when there was a good deal of discussion as to why the funds rate was so low In my mind the explanation that fall was that under some program of easy access to the discount window related to business loan restraint,  was borrowing $1 billion for about three or four straight weeks And the funds rate slipped, much to the consternation of the people at the Desk But [the reason] was rather simple There was an additional supply there against a rather constant demand   Yes, I did Spence Marsh and I went through that; I think it was in 1966 Yes, we have had some problems   Yes, they did I think Governor Mitchell had some kind of program involving access to the window if a bank promised to be a good fellow in terms of not being aggressive and making business loans I think the rate may have stayed high this past week because banks for some reason or other--maybe the reason Henry cited-- have not borrowed So there was a supply/demand factor here; the supply of reserves in totality was less, so the demand in the funds market was proportionally great and the rate stayed where it was It's a question of the chicken and the egg every once in a while I'm not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg in this precise period of two or three weeks   Mr Chairman, I must say I am pleased that this is only a preliminary discussion of our long-range targets be they for 1980 or 1980 and 1981 I am not sure whether I am distracted or overwhelmed by major external political forces as well as external financial forces I have no idea how or when they may be wound down; maybe we will have a better idea for the final discussion in February   Why not? At any rate, I think these external developments all pose threats on the side of impeding our inflation fighting efforts, and they pose a risk to the strength of the dollar if there's a renewed reason for a flight from [other] currencies Finally, I would agree with some of the people to my immediate right that a recession is upon us I look at the auto situation and housing and the cost of energy as we go into the winter and the impact on consumers For me inflation continues to be the overriding concern Inflationary expectations are as rampant as ever The dollar continues to be vulnerable in the foreign exchange markets to any appearance of an easing in our policy, and [market participants] do focus on interest rates So my prescription as of this preliminary discussion is not to compose another dramatic package like October 6 or November 1, but to restate our resolve on inflation and commit the Federal Reserve to a reduced rate of growth in money and credit I  -40-    1/8-9/80  would avoid any appearance of an easing when we go to the new definitions And we should make such a commitment not only for 1980 but also for 1981 I'd say if we need any countercyclical policy we should look to the Treasury and the fiscal side I haven't really studied the numbers much yet I would be inclined to go for something very close to alternative 2 on page 8 of the Bluebook   My preference, Mr Chairman, is for alternative C I think it's consistent with efforts to reduce the growth in the aggregates over the year 1980 and also consistent with the [view] that the basic economy may be slowing in the first quarter I think it would have an important impact on inflationary expectations and help our credibility It will also [add] strongly to the message conveyed in terms of the relevant interest rates in the foreign exchange markets, where I must say the emphasis is on interest rate levels as opposed to the movements against reserve targets I don't have a strong feeling on what the federal funds range should be, whether it should be 11-1/2 to 16 percent or 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent I'd just as soon stay with the existing range of 11-1/2 to 15-1/2    Depending on the alternative--the memo had three alternatives--some of our people said four to six months for programming   Mr Chairman, I have heard at least six economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York opine on the matter of reverting to contemporaneous reserves Not one of them thinks there is any major advantage in such a change, so I will be disposed to follow that professional judgment in my Bank I must say that John Balles has given most of my points in terms of the bank relations [effects of] such a change and I would like to stress the importance of that It is lead time, not only at the Reserve Banks but at the commercial banks as well I would say, too, that I don't think that First VPs are in a position to start changing their priorities in the computer support area We have a number of very key projects going forward in that area to bring up our new FRCS 80 communications network We are entering the area of resource sharing And to change our priorities to accommodate something that is not held out as having a major advantage is to me very poor planning I would also say that we have had so many changes in the area of reserves--and those changes involve a cost to our member banks--that this would just add to the difficulties of shaping things in an orderly way   The one number I can read accurately from this whole list of numbers is our projection of unemployment in the fourth quarter of 1980, which is 73 percent In New York we're probably giving more weight to defense spending than the Board staff is giving, not only in terms of defense spending by the Federal government but capital expenditures by the private sector in anticipation of government orders In terms of real GNP, then, our picture for the year, quarter by quarter, differs slightly in the timing and the depth of the possible recession Our four quarters run a positive 1 percent for the first quarter, a positive 05 percent in the second quarter, then two negative numbers in the third and fourth quarters of minus 1 and minus 2 percent On a full year average basis that comes out to [minus] 06 percent Our deflator quarter by quarter ranges between 85 and 89 percent, so for the year we have 85 to 9 percent inflation [as measured] by the deflator Our CPI is somewhere around 10-1/2 to 11 percent One thing that I would throw out that you have not asked for is that our people in New York think the saving rate will continue to be quite low for the entire year of 1980; to wit, they have it averaging out at 29 percent   Yes, there's a big difference between the Board staff forecast and ours on the saving rate On the federal fiscal situation, for fiscal 1980 we are looking at a deficit close to $45 billion; I'd say $40 to $45 billion And for fiscal 1981, depending upon a tax cut, we have $40 billion on the low side without a tax cut and $60 billion on the high side with a tax cut I don't really have a good judgment on whether there will be a tax cut on not   Do I think there should be one? For a change, I would agree with Mark Willes But some of the numbers are hard for me to estimate in terms of the full impact of defense spending, whether out of the government or the private sector In terms of the  -29-    2/4-5/80  consumer, I just don't know how to read currently the effect of the mild winter I would have been rather concerned about the cost of heating but I know our Buffalo branch is running considerably below budget in terms of heating that building What the experience is in private homes, I just don't know So the consumer may have a little uptick there   I wouldn't put it in quite the same language as Mark, but I am uncertain   Mr Chairman, I consider myself neither simple- minded nor complicated-minded, but just poorly educated for this forum Having said that, I would have some preference on the technical side for the wider 3-point range shown In terms of the aggregates to focus on, my preferences would be M-1A and M2 We have commented around the table about growth in bank credit and I do think the Desk should be asked to keep an eye on that number, which has looked so high the past year My position is no different than it was last month I look forward to having the yearly goals show a gradual reduction in the aggregates I am most impressed by the comments Peter Sternlight made yesterday about inflationary expectations in the market I think there will be a great focus on these goals as you announce them later this month; people will be looking for an indication of the posture of the Federal Reserve at this particular point in time I might say, too, that as they look at our long-term goals, they will [do so with] the immediate impression of economic developments at the start of the year January, I believe, will look strong It may have an impact on the entire first quarter; people may not discount it, as Fred Schultz has suggested, as being all due to good weather So, my preference is alternative III as stated in the Bluebook And I would pick up the thought that Nancy Teeters noted earlier That we will have opportunities to change the ranges at midyear in the event that some of the gloomy prospects do actually come to fruition But I don't share the gloomy prospects personally   Is there any understanding as to where in the range the Desk would be shooting for?   Could you try Steve's range, because its width is 2-1/2 points as opposed to 3?   Five; we've lost one!   How would the chair vote?   Is that for simple or complicated minds?   I thought so, too  SPEAKER(?) Try again   While I prefer what Phil Coldwell said, I would vote for "B"    Paul, do you want a motion on that 17-1/2 percent?   Paul, I have just a couple of comments We had a session with about a  dozen businessmen a week and a half ago and they were very, very optimistic about the business  outlook for this year They expressed a great deal of concern, though, about the high levels of interest    3/7/80  rates and about those high rates being built into the price structure And they made particular  reference to prices being charged by the utilities I must say that smaller banks are talking to us about  their inability to make a profit on new loans that they are putting on So I would suspect that there is a  credit bite coming along now at, say, the medium and smaller size banks in terms of their earnings I  can't help but add that in New York the earnings situation at savings banks is also a source of much  concern Three or four of them actually posted losses in 1979, as you know There is also a good deal  of concern regarding losses on consumer credit cards, but that's news to no one  Getting back to the group of businessmen, there was a great deal of encouragement on their  part for the Federal Reserve to get into credit controls But the credit controls they were proposing  were not on their own ability as businessmen to borrow but on the ability of consumers to borrow I  have to say that it seems to me that these rates are all going to have to bite pretty soon They have to  be slowing some people down I'm most hopeful that the Administration package next week may be  seen as a good one so that the Federal Reserve doesn't have to continue carrying all the [burden] on its  side and we can be seen as firm but not prone to overkill on the interest [rate] side I'd say the move  now to give Peter Sternlight a little room on the up side is fine, whether it's 17-1/2 or 18 percent I  think the 17-1/2 is fine As for the range, though, I would say that with either 17-1/2 or 18 percent I  would [want] some assurance that we're not going to flip-flop too far down the other way I can even  see the floor being adjusted at this point, perhaps moving it up to 12-1/2 or 13 as a signal of our  continuing resolve--our resolve that rates are not going to go down very far That's particularly  important I think for the Europeans, who in the foreign exchange markets are giving us a good deal of  credibility as our rates are hanging in there And our rates are hanging in there, as you know, despite  massive intervention by [officials] in Tokyo and Germany So basically, I'm all for the 17-1/2    3/7/80  percent 1 could see being a little stronger or hawkish in that regard by going to 18 percent or even  raising the floor   I agree with that   The top being 18 percent?    I move that the nominations be closed   So moved   Scott, you mentioned the possibility that some parties may be suffering major losses by reason of the decline in the price of gold Would that include any major commercial banks?   [What about] European banks?  -2-    3/18/80   With their $10,000 tractors   But [the difference] is very substantial, Peter, in April Dave, New York's [estimate] is about twice what the--   Mr Chairman, I haven't talked to [any business contacts] since Friday, except to that group of bankers who were here yesterday But I must say that through Thursday of last week, businessmen, and by that I mean mostly industrialists, were still telling us in New York that they have great confidence in 1980 being a pretty good year--maybe not a record year but a pretty good year It's true that the money market banks and the medium size and large regional banks have all been approached for, and have granted, loan commitments And I know a few of them are very uncomfortable about meeting those commitments In upstate New York some of the country banks have been expressing a great deal of concern about the effect of the current level of interest rates on local small businessmen I think local small businessmen are not unlike the farmers in the Midwest There are stories that automobile dealers are just closing their businesses because they can't finance their inventories; rather than go bankrupt, they retire We have the impression that inventories are generally modest, although for some small retailers they are pretty minimal I have the impression that in New York City retail sales are pretty good, but that may not be the case outside of the city We've had some indications that in the first two months of the year there have been price increases, particularly by the large grocery chains Some people explain that as the reason for all the coupons we're getting in our Sunday newspapers In effect, it's giving back the anticipatory price increase  We also have in our area the same grave concerns that Frank has in Massachusetts and New England generally Our thrifts are in very bad shape Three of the ten largest mutual savings banks in New York were in the red for 1979, and probably more will be in the red for 1980 It is disintermediation on the one side and terrible earnings on the other side My own feeling is that if the consumer hadn't been running out of gas before last Friday, he certainly has had his accelerator taken away from him as of Friday On the other hand, though, we're hearing that some companies are accelerating the timing of their annual wage increases For example, if an annual review was to be in July or August, they're bringing it forward So the consumer may have a little extra money in his pocket The Board staff's projections of the outlook for the next 15 months seem pretty reasonable In all the circumstances, my thought is that we should hang in there, which is probably what "B" does That would be my idea of hanging in there   They will be borrowing at the higher rate when the funds rate is at 18 percent   Do you want to define "little"?   A little less than "B"  -43-    3/18/80   Mr Chairman, in light of Mr Pardee's comment that the only thing that is keeping the dollar strong in foreign exchange markets is the level of interest rates in this country, I have some difficulties in not moving up the floor [on the funds rate range], as a few people have suggested, to 14 percent A 14 to 20 percent range at least is a 6 percentage point spread as compared with the 4-point range we started with That 14 to 20 percent would be my preference   As opposed to 11-1/2, I'll vote for 13   [Unintelligible] because it's not high enough   Having in mind the special credit restraint program that the Federal Reserve announced last Friday, there may be some advantage in including a sentence in the directive that would make reference to the rate of growth of bank credit falling within a range of 6 to 9 percent To have that as part of the directive would be supportive of your commentary over the last 3 or 4 days   Maybe the number is not the precise number that we want   It's not very prominent in terms of what people can see   Make it qualitative and not quantitative?    We can't hear at all in New York   I can hear you, Paul, but that's all    We do in the foreign [currency authorization] and I thought we had it on the domestic side, too   It had reversed itself in about a month to a month and a half   But there was also, if I remember, a calm before the storm Penn Central went bankrupt on a Sunday and nothing really happened until a week later And then all of the commercial paper issuers had to come in with their credit lines We put a big bulge [of reserves out through] the discount window and that [crisis] was over by early August, as I remember   I must say with regard to this recession that things seem to be going a little better for the Second District than for our friends in the Midwest On the one extreme we have Buffalo, where the steel industry, the auto industry, and the auto suppliers are all having a very, very poor time of it, with very high unemployment If you go over to Rochester, though, they tell you that it is a city with no trough in their peak Kodak just issued a record bonus at year-end and it helped some car dealers In New York City, I would say we're all concerned about the thrift situation, but business construction is quite strong in New York, particularly downtown We seem to have some of that [in the pipeline] through '84 In the City, the service industries are doing well with some minor upset in employment, although I must say the IBFs in New York have not [unintelligible] 20,000 jobs It's interesting to talk to bankers particularly about what is going on today; they really don't seem to be worried about what they know, for example, about Braniff, Pan Am, International Harvester, and Chrysler The reaction to the Braniff [announcement] last week was kind of a "ho hum" I must say, though, that the bankers are now talking--in the terminology of the last two weeks--about "survivor loans," which is the only thing that's keeping [some firms] going because of reduced cash flows Just as recently as last week, the bankers said they were worried about trouble spots that might jump out without warning And I think we're in [that situation] today  On a personal note, in Manhattan, and particularly midtown, one can't help but notice the number of small businesses that are either throwing in their keys and closing or going into bankruptcy I know within three blocks of my apartment, I've lost my favorite Chinese restaurant and my favorite Italian restaurant   Mr Chairman, I think the Federal Reserve has demonstrated over time--what to many of us seems a very long time--its commitment to its objectives Today the credibility of the Federal Reserve in terms of that commitment is not at issue We all recognize that the country has had some success in its war against inflation But I think this Committee must also recognize that we are encountering a very weak economy Against that background, the Committee should avoid any dramatic action of easing I fear that any such dramatic action would be misinterpreted and would stir up inflationary expectations I do think those inflationary expectations are a real risk in the financial districts, particularly as they contemplate the outlook for the federal deficit I must state that my thinking is quite close to Ed Boehne's, which will probably make him rethink his position! I do, however, like alternative B I might shade it slightly in the direction of alternative A and that shading in my mind would be in terms of, say, shooting for borrowings around the $700 million level rather than the $800 million level indicated   Shading a little toward "B+" but not much  -32-    5/18/82    Paul, in New York we only have information from 2 or 3 banks and it's all switching basically within the M2 category, with very little from the Ml That is just from 2 or 3 specific banks that have told us what their situation is
