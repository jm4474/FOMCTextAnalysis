3626,1988-08-16," That hasn't been a factor during this most recent period, in part because so many people in the market are trying to put together estimates about how reserves are going to behave--very much the same way we are Data on reserves are released with a lag, but it's a relatively brief lag, so people are able to speculate as to what factors are influencing reserve behavior That brief lag may cause people to wonder momentarily in a transition period about the impact on the funds rate But I think over just a relatively short length of time they've been able to perceive that For example, in the recent period, people have been watching the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and have seen a rise in other assets and have concluded from that rise that while there are many components in it, the foreign exchange component has probably been a fairly large one; and therefore, our needs to add reserves going forward would be smaller than they had thought heretofore So it seems as though it has worked out in this past period Any sort of disturbance on the funds market has been fairly brief  I think it was only temporary  One other part of that--whenever there is central bank intervention, the financial markets have been quite    8/16/88  sensitive to listen to that Each morning one hears what the rumors are as to whether central banks are in or not in, so that when they take a look at what they think might be affecting reserves, that would be one thing they tuck in the back of their minds to some degree  Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  Initially this morning, when the trade numbers first came out, the long bond was down about a point It seemed that for a brief juncture it would be holding, and I don't know whether it changed further since  Well, I think, during part of the period there was an effort to let the market know that if expectations had carried the rate beyond what the Committee had voted, that seemed to be a way of letting them know that The reason, of course, was that these expectations could become embedded; and we were trying to signal that they were really moving faster than the Committee had instructed The longer those things persist, the more people begin to feel that--if these expectations really get imbedded in the structure of rates--when the Committee meets again, we may have taken the decisions from it So we felt it necessary to give a signal when rates seemed to be ratcheting higher That was particularly true when funds seemed to be getting sticky at the 7/8ths level  Right Well, we got the borrowings "
3854,1989-07-05, Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]    7/5-6/89 
4096,1990-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, in the six weeks since you met last, it has been the case that market forces have shown through by the time the maintenance period has come to an end So, we ended up with federal funds either being quite comfortable on the settlement day or quite tight on the settlement day Some of that has been reflected in banks' behavior, based on their expectations of what the funds rate was going to be In the first couple of periods they were quite convinced it was going to be a soft settlement day, and so it was As we got into the June 13th period they were so sure it was going to be comfortable that they waited until the very end even though there was a real need for reserves Some market [participants] chance this; they put off [action] until there is no more room    7/2-3/90 "
4413,1991-07-02," Presumably having a nice time! Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  They are looking at an array of options I believe their thinking at this point is not to try to change the whole    7/2-3/91  structure, because it's a process that has worked very well, but to make some adjustments around the margin It's possible that if they do decide to make a change, they would probably want to make that change known before we get into the August refunding and conceivably even before the next round of two- and five-year note sales  Yes, some people feel that the move up to 8-5/8 percent or toward that level--it didn't really stay there--was reflecting an awful lot all at once And, therefore, the yield has come back to the 8-1/2 percent trading range and it is sort of being held in that range because the views on both sides in terms of the [likely] extent of this recovery seem to be somewhat offsetting There is a concern that even if the rate of inflation does come down, as analysts say they think it will, there are going to be sufficient pressures elsewhere in the long run that may keep that particular part of the yield curve from moving down much more In that connection they keep looking at the yield environment in Germany and other countries and feel that it just may be a factor inhibiting any possible downward move in long rates even if inflation comes in better, as they think it will  Well, there have been a lot of reports about demands for credit abroad I think right now, as far as people can see, the major source of credit demand is in the US government and perhaps the state and local entities What the corporate issuers are doing isn't being seen as an important part of the demand for credit but as restructuring their own balance sheets "
4553,1991-12-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman Since the cut in the discount rate on the 6th of November, we've had some rate declines in the domestic market They have ranged from about 25 to 30 basis points or so in the short end of the market where they have been supported by expectations from daily releases over the interval suggesting that there will be some further monetary accommodation coming along The periodic unrest in the stock market shored up the short end, and from time to time some of the news coming out of the Soviet Union also has been a factor in that direction The rate declines have been more grudging in the long end of the market where rates in the longest maturities [unintelligible] since November 6 In the long end of the market, some actual selling has been taking place throughout this period without the kind of demand that we had in the short and intermediate areas And there is also a sense that the long end of the market is somewhat hostage to the various rumors that have come out from time to time about different fiscal stimulus packages that might be coming along So, the gains are more pronounced at the short end of the market    12/2/91  In terms of reserve management activities, the federal funds rate over the period has tended to hold fairly close to 4-3/4 percent; it has been a shade firmer than that over recent days Reserve management operations have been supplemented throughout the period by outright purchases as we look toward the seasonal need to put in reserves that is typical at this time of the year So, our outright activity has been of some magnitude over this period, and we used a big chunk of the leeway that Mr Sternlight had requested from you at the last meeting In terms of the stock market, which has been a focus of attention, I should take the opportunity to bring you up to date on that This morning at the outset people were calling for a decline of something in the one percent range following on the heels of what had happened in some of the overseas markets this morning And as the stock markets have managed to hold above the 2850 level today, it seems to have backed up from that As we were coming in to this conference call, stocks were actually higher on the day at a shade above the 2900 level Thank you  We heard such reports over this period I think people are trying to come up with a variety of [explanations] as to what is underlying this market I have heard that in the past year a number of [times] in the long end of the Treasury market These were securities that had been borrowed by the Japanese prior to the end of the last fiscal year and there are a variety of scenarios out there as to just why they have been lightening up their holdings The magnitudes that you mentioned are estimates that have been around the market waiting for such a volume of Treasury zeros [unintelligible] that might come in for sale in that market from the Japanese There are some reports, of course, that the Japanese are taking profits in this market and in fact [there is] a view about their placing money or keeping money home Some of it has to do with periodic rumors of a [unintelligible] and no one has been able to come up with any change that will fit this bill I think they're pretty hard to come up with specifically But there's also a sense that the problem has to do with the IRS taking a closer look at Japanese practices in the wake of the stock market scandals and that people are cleaning up their books basically for that reason "
4711,1992-06-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  Even though they didn't want to have to do that!  It's one of the foibles of having a federal funds rate objective that gets narrower and narrower That did happen on a couple of occasions and we didn't want to have to drain the reserves if we could avoid it So, the fact that the perception out there was that at certain rate levels and at certain times we didn't have a tolerance [for actions] that would cause people to bid the rate up is part of what one has to call the ""market dynamics""  Well, we have a little more flexibility on one side of the rate depending on the state of market expectations There isn't anyone out there who expects that the Committee is going to be firming policy, so there's more tolerance for a funds rate that deviates to the high side of the expected level than there would be for a funds rate that deviates to the low side So, actually, we have throughout this period felt somewhat more comfortable with having our operations be a little loose on the up side--that is, letting funds trade at higher levels without necessarily going in and offsetting it Whereas on the low side we wouldn't feel as comfortable because if there were any direction to policy in this period, that's the way the market thinking has been  MRJORDAN That asymmetry, though, is due to market perceptions that we are conditioned by real magnitudes; they think we're responding to things we can't control anyway But the follow-up question is this Over this last week the market tried to [interpret] that failure to cut the funds rate, in a reserve supplying sense, as a relative tightening of policy From the Desk perspective, would you view it as tighter?  The market has built in a good amount of the 25 basis points    6/30-7/1/92  In fed funds terms, the market--  No, I don't think so  But the market does  We may have to drain  You're right that there has been a better tone underlying the long end of the market And the barrier, which seemed to be 8 percent for the longest period of time, now seems to be 7-3/4 percent The long rate doesn't seem to be able to get through that barrier; it has been at about the 780 percent level, which is where it was at the time of the last meeting also So, there hasn't been too much net change over the full intermeeting period, even with the decline--    6/30-7/1/92  Yes, and then it came back down  It's hard to say The fact that the recovery doesn't look robust certainly has been a factor in any improvement in the long end of the market But in discussing what the long end will do [in response to] Fed policy, it usually turns on whether or not the long rate is going to back up, not so much whether there's a chance for sustained improvement Most people in the market don't [consider it likely] that there is room for a sustained improvement in the long end for quite a while There's at least a sense that people have to wait to see whether or not this improvement in prices is sustained, and there's a lot of skepticism about that Some people don't think the progress has been all that it should have been And then we have these deficits The market also frequently makes reference to the global demands for capital Finally, our own statements may not be adequate, and there are all these political uncertainties So, people don't seem to have a lot of high hopes for the long end of the market doing a lot better It's really a question of [rates] moving back up if the Fed were to ease  Right  Right, and I do think the fact that the recovery doesn't look like it's rolling ahead has been a help for the long end "
4775,1992-10-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman; thank you, Bill [Statement--see Appendix]  This morning?  The early read we got was that a technical adjustment had been taking place in the market yesterday afternoon as the stock market recovered from its lows And with the world stock market this morning also tending to recover from the lows seen yesterday, there is just what one would call normal, technical position adjustments taking place There didn't seem to be anything more fundamental than that at work  We were somewhat surprised The quarter had finished on a firm note We really thought that we had put in [enough] reserves and made an allowance for even higher-than-normal excess reserves for the quarter-end, but we had a very large miss Therefore, the next morning, which was the beginning of this maintenance period, the funds market started out on the firm side; and sometimes that carries over But I have to say we were surprised by the carryover firmness because it was the first day of the maintenance period and the banks had the whole remainder [of the period to adjust] and it was also prior to the time when there were widespread expectations that the Fed would be cutting the rate So, we're having a very difficult time trying to understand why people would pay these higher rates so early on The rates aren't consistent with the reserve numbers either Reserves don't show [a need for us] to put in that volume of reserves So, we've been surprised by it The market hasn't been as surprised because they think the need is bigger than we are saying This is one of those periods where right after the quarter-end the Treasury balances plummet because they have to pay out these social security [checks] And the market, even though it knows that, thinks the need is bigger So, the market hasn't been as surprised about the firmness of the funds rate as we have been The firmness that we're hearing about is coming more or less from regional sources, and we just don't have a satisfactory explanation for it  The fact that the funds rate hasn't behaved quite the way it should has been largely ignored by the market thus far It is seen as something that's technically driven at this point  I guess I could answer that in two ways They look at those kinds of aggregates broadly in terms of their impact on policy, but I think they see that impact as being somewhat removed They look more closely at their estimates of reserve requirements as an operating factor that we have to contend with And I think that's as close as their focus would go on that  Well, the market looks at what it thinks the Federal Reserve acts on; they feel reasonably confident that that is the thing to do They don't see the monetary aggregates as being the driving force to policy right now They find it very difficult to read what the aggregates are saying, and everything they read says the Committee does too So, they don't tend to look at them that closely  They don't ignore the money numbers by any stretch of the imagination; they do look at them Some people are commenting a lot about the rapid growth of M1 being a harbinger of trouble, but others aren't Some say one can't look at that because the Fed is looking at the broader aggregates Nobody understands fully or positively what is going on here If they thought we were going to be acting on it or if they thought we should be because the growth rates are out of historical experience, then they would respond to it  Right  Right  I don't know what that means! [Laughter] "
4837,1992-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  It's worth noting that Jerry Powell told everyone yesterday that as an outgoing Treasury official for debt management he would advise the transition team not to make that change "
4922,1993-03-23," Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, I think it's what the future reductions in the deficit portend going forward rather than the reductions themselves But, as you know, the general likelihood of an economy that performs reasonably well with low prices is probably more the key point than, say, overseas rate cuts would be in the markets going forward  Yes  I guess it [depends on] the point from which they're all starting Some of the people in the market are looking at the near-term weakness as being somewhat mitigated by the drop in interest rates that has occurred already So, if expectations before all this [centered on] worry that the economy's recovery was going to produce growth rates in the 4 percent plus range early on, which reflected some of the estimates toward the end of last year, those estimates are being scaled down to something that's--  I do get some sense that there is or has been-- and maybe it's taking a long time--some underlying shift in expectations about future price performance than had been the case before I think that has been ratcheting down  Yes  One thing that has been interesting on a day-to- day basis in the market is that there has been [less] day-to-day volatility by a fair amount And sometimes people are at a loss to    3/23/93  explain the movements in prices on any given day to the next Many of the dealers in the market are not expecting to see this kind of movement take place and are constantly expecting to see it give back its ground That's why I mentioned the climate being a little skittish Not everyone was a believer in the full degree of the rally  Oddly enough, at this juncture I think the information that the market expects on the real side is favorable inflation on prices People generally have tended to feel that while the reports for January and February were sobering, they were really not indicative of the trend in prices They believe that there is slack, particularly on the labor side, that is going to keep inflation reasonably well contained, even if it's not on a downward trend, and that the employment report perhaps overstated things They think the recovery is here and will continue, but the sense of where it's vulnerable is in [the process of] going through the Congressional passage of the budget [There are concerns] that some compromises are going to be made to get the package through and that some of these compromises are going to mean the death knell for the intent of the package, if you will, and that we're going to end up with perhaps half a loaf  That's how we got the 302 percent fed funds rate! "
4970,1993-07-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix] "
4999,1993-08-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I hope you can hear me down at that end also [Statement--see Appendix]  A predisposition  -32-    8/17/93 "
5128,1993-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the interest of time I'm going to dispense with some incredibly interesting statistics on the Treasury's fund-raising operations in the market over the intermeeting period and the reception of the refunding and composition of the debt unless someone has questions about it [Secretary's note Statement in its entirety is shown in the Appendix]  I'd just conclude, Mr Chairman, with a request for a temporary increase in the intermeeting leeway from $8 billion to $11 billion As I noted earlier, upcoming reserve needs at this juncture are expected to be sufficiently large and persistent as to warrant a cushion beyond the normal limit "
5158,1993-12-21, [Statement--see Appendix] 
5189,1994-02-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  For the entire period that begins today--which is the first day of the maintenance period--both the New York and Board staffs estimate a need to add something under $1 billion for the full period The distribution of those reserves in the first couple days of the period is such that today is sort of straddling ""flat"" if you will Tomorrow is flat to a modest deficiency, although I have to say there's some difference of opinion about the estimates of the Treasury balance, and that difference of opinion is $3 billion between us and the Treasury If we are right, there will be a modest deficiency tomorrow; and if the Treasury is right, there will be a more considerable surplus  In the market it will depend on where the federal funds rate is I guess people will assume that if the funds rate were firm we would signal something through inaction--by not providing reserves However, I think most of them feel that our preference would be to signal something through an assertive action and therefore a funds rate anywhere in the range of 3 or 3-1/8 percent would evoke a draining action on our part I think that is how people would see something like that conveyed We are coming off a period where there has been some uncertainty in the reserve numbers About a week or two ago, the market might even have viewed this maintenance period that we are going into today as a drain period But given all the variabilities, they might see this as what I would call a modest add So, for us to drain reserves within the right federal funds context would get the message across, presuming funds are trading at the appropriate level for us to do that  I think that's correct as far as the technical condition of the money market in terms of getting the right constellation of rates Yes, I think that's correct  Well, it certainly would remove any ambiguity about the move [Laughter] People don't have to guess about the size of the move and that kind of thing; I guess if there's a pro, that's the positive outcome In terms of setting a precedent, I think it very much depends on the wording that's used  I think that it can't be harmful  No, it tells everybody what's happening and it leaves no room for ambiguity, and if it's phrased the way you are suggesting, it's not setting a stage for people to have expectations of an announcement every time there is a policy change going forward  Yes  It's very risky sometimes to try to time things down to the wire and hope that people pick up the press releases  Initially, the market moved up by almost a point at the long end--at the 30-year mark--as the headline news on the nonfarm number came across the wire There has been some backing away from that The market is still up; it was up about 3/8 to 1/2 when we came in here It may be that market participants are trying to read through some of the underlying data in terms of hours and so forth So, it's lost some of its initial gain, but it is still up  When the market was anticipating the move, I think most of the expectations were for 25 basis points Some of that got built into the rate structure yesterday; I think by the time the day was over about 80 percent reflected that a 1/4 point move might occur today This morning's numbers on the January employment situation may have moved some of that pricing back out of the market So, certainly a move of 50 basis points would have to be reflected in the market Since 25 basis points is not fully in there now, the next 25 basis points would clearly result in some rate back up; rates would have to adjust much more than they have "
5208,1994-02-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman Since the February 4th meeting, we've had an increase in interest rates pretty much across the board and that increase has surpassed the 25 basis point move that took place in the federal funds rate Initially, the increase was centered in the shorter end of the market I guess that is what one would have expected, given the short-end adjustment to a federal funds rate move, but then the longer end began to catch up First, the market felt that it had to try to digest some of the new supply that was coming out of the Treasury's quarterly refunding, which took place the following week The markets then began to adjust The adjustment in the 10- and 30-year areas became somewhat more pronounced as market participants began to react to current interest rate prospects and future inflation prospects in a way that led them to wonder how far and how fast the Fed would have to move going forward I guess some of that came about as people started getting more information about the fourth quarter This is old news, but thoughts about the fourth- quarter GDP were being revised up By tomorrow, there will be a new estimate for that and most of the thinking in the market is for a growth rate pretty close to 7 percent Even in the first part of the year there was some thinking that perhaps there was an undercurrent of strength in the economy, a little more than the market may have anticipated earlier on That lengthened this debate about just exactly what was happening or how to characterize something that's a neutral stance by the Fed as opposed to an accommodating stance  Against that background, people began to anticipate some further moves down the road There was then a tendency for people to try to make some sales on any market strength So, when there was some good news coming out--what formerly would have been taken as good news for the market on some of the different price indexes--everybody seemed to be poised to go the same way People generally were looking to lighten up their inventories and to come in on the curve, and the consequence of that was that there never really was any strength The reaction that seemed to be taking place in other bond markets also was    2/28/94  something that people were paying pretty close attention to as some of the overseas bond markets began to erode I think that led to an element of securities overhang that made people cautious and provided no incentive to step in on the buy side, given the fact that higher rates were seen as likely down the road By the middle to the end of last week, the market reached yield levels that in the case of the 30-year bond just flirted with the 6-3/4 percent level, though it never pierced that level; on the 2-year notes, that level seemed to be 4-3/4 percent At 4-3/4 percent, I guess there has been a feeling that an awful lot of near-term bad news has been priced into the market and that seems to have acted as a stabilizing influence Friday and today the markets have been tending to stabilize and to do somewhat better, with many people out there expressing the view that there has been an overreaction in the market And, at least on a near-term basis, the market acts oversold; therefore, that's potentially enough to give the market a steadier footing going forward There are a lot of data coming out this week, and each day there will be something on the plate that the market will be looking at pretty closely, culminating with the employment report at the end of the week  A lot depends on how quickly people begin to discount a fair amount of adverse news And in fact they have not reacted to some positive news At this point, as Bill mentioned, they're oversold, so that expectations are bound with that and on timing of something like the March meeting And I think it would just depend on whether the new information that comes out is stronger than has been discounted or not "
5228,1994-03-22, [Statement--see Appendix]  It's over 
5261,1994-04-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman Since your meeting of March 22, yields in the 2- to 10-year area of the Treasury market are up some 50 to 60 basis points and yields in the long-bond area are up 45 basis points, bringing the yield level on the 30-year issue to 730 percent The major catalyst in the market continues to be the view    4/18/94  that the economy has put in a strong first-quarter performance even in the face of the damping effects from adverse weather and the California earthquake Market estimates are now in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range for first-quarter GPD growth The second quarter is expected to come in around 4 percent as well Thus, the biggest jump in yields during the period came surrounding the Easter weekend when the March nonfarm payroll numbers showed a large rise of 456,000 Yields were up 30 or 40 basis points in a day and a half surrounding the announcement of a rise in employment that was much stronger than had been built into the market And I would have to say that Easter Monday, the 4th of April, trading markets in the Treasury area came pretty close to being disorderly There was an emotional selling climate that day that pushed yields up 30 or 40 basis points before subsiding over the period since then The mortgage markets saw broad- based selling as did municipal markets and those markets exerted a drag on the Treasury market as the institutional customers were brought into all three markets, with selling begetting more selling The limited price action of late has come because professional market participants are becoming more uncomfortable about shorting the market further at these yield levels At the same time, customers are not buying in the market with any particular enthusiasm because they feel we're still in a rising rate environment and the Fed will be moving rates upward again The short end of the market moved up by less, with the short end of the yield curve pretty flat to up 10 basis points, while rates out in the longer end are up about 3/8 of a point Bills have benefited from a combination of quarter-end window-dressing buying and safe-haven purchases and some paydowns from the Treasury in various of its maturities There will be some additional paydowns in that market later this week In recent days, the market has tended to trade in a fairly narrow rate range, as I mentioned before, giving back some of the increases that we had just after the Easter holiday Thank you, Mr Chairman  Using the 2-year note as the benchmark for that, there is a 25 basis point increase that people have been building in; I think that is priced into the 2-year note as we speak When we look at the forward curve in the federal funds market, we see the market pricing in some additional increases going forward in time  There was an outlook in the market at the end of 1993 that the funds rate would be at 4 percent at the end of 1994 But the most recent market outlook has been that we'll be at 4 percent sooner than year-end And so people really haven't paid much attention to those comments; that hasn't had an influence on the market I think people have been expecting to see a 4 percent level closer to midyear than year-end in the domestic markets  -2-    4/18/94  Well, we tend to look at the federal funds futures contracts, but the volumes are small and in that sense I don't think they give the same kind of liquidity picture as the Euro-dollar futures contracts The reason that we look at them, though, is because we don't have to make the quality adjustments that one has to do for the Euro-dollar futures In looking at those fed funds futures contracts, although they're too small to reach firm conclusions about them, I would have said they were pointing to something in the 5 percent range by year-end Of course, a lot of that is still a degree of market speculation as to what the second half of the year is going to look like for the economy and whether the Fed is going to have to go from ""neutral"" to restrictive That would be embedded, I think, in those December levels "
5281,1994-05-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]  Well, I think that what really is at stake is that while we have announced the changes that we have made, the market still sees itself as always looking for when we're going to make a change in the future On occasions when they think we will or we should, they move the funds rate up immediately in the morning well before any kind of an announcement by the Committee would be likely And the rate sits there until we demonstrate something to the contrary And so on a couple of occasions where the market thought the data were such that perhaps there was going to be an action in coming days, they moved the funds rate up to reflect that possibility Part of the theory that seems to be at work there is that if people really believe that the Fed will move, for some it means buying cheap funds relative to what they will be later Moving the funds rate also is a way of testing the Fed to see what its stance is And so even though we recently have announced our policy actions, what we respond to is the market moving ahead of our announcement of Fed policy actions I think that's always going to happen  Yes, there are some people who still think that's a possibility; it hasn't been ruled out because we have mentioned that these announcements have not necessarily been for all time I think the market tends to set up for itself a series of time points It looks for announcements on the discount rate now within a certain period of time in the morning, policy announcements any time after that, but always the possibility of something being signaled ahead of the announcement Even if that is not forthcoming, there are circumstances when they move the funds rate ahead of the Fed For example, on the day of the employment data release on Friday, May 6, most people didn't think that the Fed would take action that day, but they still moved the funds rate up on the theory that perhaps the Federal Reserve would do something on the following Monday And thus the constellation of where the funds rate would be over the balance of the period suggested that it was worth pushing the rate up  -5-    5/17/94  Well, I guess it's really their anticipatory moves that we're talking about; it's not the actual Fed moves; it's the market anticipating the Fed moves before they occur  Perhaps with the passage of time, as people become accustomed to our new disclosure practices, those anticipatory moves will not require our protest actions But we're always going to have anticipatory moves; I think that's a given How the market would view our absence from protesting I think would require more experience with our new disclosure practices I don't think there's enough experience with them now for the market to be confident that, had we stayed out when they pushed the funds rate a point higher, we were not paving the way for the Committee We're not in the position to pave the way for the Committee  Right  Or that we were trying to get the market ready for it--to pave the way for a decision I think that there just has not been enough experience with the announcements for people to feel comfortable in terms of what the timing of those announcements is and so forth  Yes  Well, relative to our expectations on the April tax collection themselves, we fell short by $12 billion And if we take April and May combined there was a big catchup in early May  They only fell short by about $9 billion We had forecast an increase in the April tax take of something in the neighborhood of 25 percent over the level a year ago and it appears to be coming in between 5 and 10 percent above Everyone seems to have had those same kinds of overestimates, so people are still trying to find out if there will be some offsets in June or whether in fact all these adjustments were made last year and people really did get ahead of the change in their tax liabilities "
5305,1994-07-05," How the bond market is going to respond will depend on the circumstances that caused such an abrupt change and what that does to the expectations and how long it persists  I feel I am starting on an uneventful note here, and I am I was going to comment that reserve management was relatively uneventful over the intermeeting period [Laughter] And I was going to go on to say that that occurred notwithstanding the huge flows in reserve markets [Statement--see Appendix]  Of the System's portfolio?  Let me start out by saying that when we make additions to the portfolio on a permanent basis, we usually do so when we see a protracted need to supply reserves If we really don't see that, if it looks as if there are going to be short-term swings, we will address most of that reserve need with repurchase agreements and the like I don't know what page of the report you have in front of you, but during the intermeeting--  The New York Desk report?  Okay On an outright basis, the portfolio went up by $4-1/4 billion during the period That increase reflected $3-3/4 billion of bill purchases in the market and securities purchased directly from foreign accounts that were essentially all bills The data you see in the middle of that table partly reflect the exchange that took place at the end of last week when the refunding settled, so it's a wash; it doesn't count as an increase It's just an exchange of notes and bonds that matured in May, not new purchases Most of the increase in the portfolio over the intermeeting period came in Treasury bills, virtually all of it For the year to date our holdings are up $16 billion and that has been, in some sense, almost evenly distributed between coupons and bills We have been looking to keep the average maturity of the portfolio pretty close to the level where it was last year We are not aiming to shorten it or to lengthen it very much There was a view in earlier years that the portfolio should be somewhat shorter, but we reached a conclusion about a year or so ago that the amount of liquidity in the portfolio is probably appropriate for current circumstances Basically, we try to keep it pretty much at about the 38-month average reached last year The reason for doing the acquisitions in the bill market during this particular six-week intermeeting period was that we already had made some additions on the coupon side earlier  Yes, I think there is something to be said for letting the market know that the meeting has concluded In terms of  -65-    7/5-6/94  what announcements the market is looking for out of this Committee when there is no action, I have to say they haven't got a clue They know that decisions on how to handle these announcements have not been made and they know the Committee hasn't addressed the issue, so most of them think that the Committee wants to maintain as much flexibility as it can until it has made a decision on that For now, I think some of them are hoping there will be at least an announcement that the meeting is over, so they can go about their business If we said that we have nothing to announce, that would be helpful  It's to buy time until the Committee has had a longer discussion on this That is what they are thinking "
5323,1994-07-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman Yields today are quite close to the levels that were prevailing at the close of your July meeting two weeks ago, but they've been both higher and lower in the interim since The June jobs reports gave the market a jolt just after the meeting, as the nonfarm payroll rise of 359,000, even after allowing for seasonal distortions, and the upward revisions for the prior two months led to a view in the market that some near-term System tightening was at hand Yields rose across the yield curve by up to 20 basis points at that point, putting the 2-year note at 6-1/4 percent and the 30-year bond at 7-1/2 percent Subsequent news since that time has caused a retreating in yield levels by about 20 to 30 basis points, as the markets deferred the timetable of a likely tightening move mostly to the August FOMC meeting at this point in time The price data that came out following the jobs reports were within the range or better than expected; retail sales were a bit lower, and the inventory rise looked to be a possible harbinger of what lies ahead The general view in the market seems to be for some slowing in the second half of the year, but there is skepticism about whether it's going to be enough to ease pressures on capacity, and so the risks of higher inflation and further Fed moves ahead are viewed as being there Such moves are just thought to have been deferred in time and perhaps reduced in magnitude At this point, the markets seem to be pricing in a federal funds rate of 5 percent at year-end That would be roughly in the middle of the current range of market expectations of around 4-3/4 to 5-1/2 percent Since a move by the Fed does not seem to be imminent, the market is generally comfortable with putting funds to work in various short-term trading strategies, and that has carried yields down a bit too low, and thus the market was ripe for some profit-taking, which has been occurring today The market started to go down before the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony today and it moved down further following his prepared remarks, as his observations in the question and answer portion of his testimony were not out of line with the market's own thinking about the future It seems that the Chairman would have had to sound quite optimistic for the market to keep the rally going At this juncture, the market sees his commentary as calling for mild caution, in line with participants' views about the future I'd be happy to answer any questions "

5368,1994-09-27," We spent a lot of time talking to people in the repo markets as we proceeded, and we learned some hard lessons in that market here I think there has been some concern that as these repo markets are developing in Europe market participants have not quite learned from our mistakes So we have been trying, both at the central bank level and with US dealers who have a presence in these markets overseas, to let them know how important it is to maintain margin and all of the other good practices As they are evolving, they are taking a look at some of the early history here and learning from it  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I answer to either [Laughter] [Statement--See Appendix]  The part of the statement that was released in August that has captured a lot of attention--and some people have likened it to the sort of attention that Talmudic scholars give--is the ""for a time"" phraseology The rest of the announcement followed the format of earlier announcements It has not had an impact on our operations; it has not affected us in any way that differs from the earlier announcements That is to say, people see that the Committee has been announcing its policy moves and that has tended perhaps to give us a little more flexibility in our day-to-day operations I'd say more than a little flexibility until we come right up to a Committee meeting What we have noticed is that each time we come up to a Committee meeting, there is still this question about whether we are paving the way for a policy change That has not dissipated The ""for a time"" concept immediately after the August meeting was taken by most people in the market to mean until November 15 That was the ""nuance"" that they put on the statement But as you can see from the data that have come out since the August meeting and the market's reaction to it, I don't think they feel that the Committee is hard- bound by it It has been a factor in that people perhaps have responded more slowly to the data on the theory that, having said this, the Committee would like a longer period of time to review information as it comes in So, the response to the numbers, say the PPI number, was muted because (a) it was the first number like this and (b) since it was the first, the Committee presumably would want more evidence But I don't think the market thinks that the Committee would overlook the data if it were overwhelmingly conclusive    9/27/94  I don't want to use a technical argument here because I don't think technical arguments carry weight for long periods of time, but I will say that an awful lot of money has been kept in the short end of the market because people are very cautious; most people feel that rates are going higher still, and the short end has been a beneficiary of that The 2-year rate in particular has been the subject of some debate in the market A lot of people look at the spread of the 2-year note over the funds rate as being too narrow to be sustained, but that abstracts from the fact that there has been a fair amount of interest in staying short That perhaps is what has kept that segment of the curve relatively low Bill rates were so low that the segment that you point to between one and two years may have been depressed beyond what fundamentals would call for People are questioning the spread of the 2-year rate over the federal funds rate at this stage of the cycle, given the prospect of further Fed moves And I think some people feel it's hovering around the low end because of defensive moves  We see, as I mentioned, that people have ratcheted up somewhat further their views about prospective tightening We see that in the futures contracts for December and in market commentaries We see it through early next year Not everyone, as I mentioned, is completely sure about where prices are going to be There is still a fairly wide discrepancy in that  At the time I first wrote this earlier, I would have described it as a narrow majority, but over the past week or so I would say it probably has become a more comfortable majority I think that's the way things have shifted over the past week People really got caught up in the numbers released last week They were a big surprise  Do you mean me?  -18-    9/27/94 "
5394,1994-11-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]  -3-    11/15/94  That's right  For the month of November?  I don't know the precise average, but it is on the high side, because after its rise at the end of the quarter the rate never really went back down The last statement week ended on a firm note and it was a holiday on Friday With expectations of a rate move at this meeting today, the funds rate has been persistently above that average  Yes  For November "
5419,1994-12-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]  It has been a disappointing year for a lot of people in the financial markets We have had some sense since Thanksgiving that many people are just hanging on in the hope of getting through December 31 If they have done well or have managed to do all right, they want to finish the year in that position If they haven't done well, they don't want to add to their losses As a result, there has been a general tendency for people to try to take cover This gives us a hint as to why we have had abrupt moves when securities have come into the market in clumps, because people don't feel they necessarily have the wherewithal to take them on If they do buy them, they have to re-route them right away or hedge them with something equivalent  I think that in the Orange County case there probably are several influences at work It was helpful that people eventually were able to get a handle on just what the county has In    12/20/94  the first day or so, people couldn't get any information from Orange County on almost anything, and I think that is what caused the biggest market backup Since that time, the markets have come back in many cases to where they were prior to the break of the news or maybe just 5 or 10 basis points past that, even with some of the securities being liquidated So I think the initial move occurred because of the lack of knowledge of exactly what was going on and what was going to happen By the same token, markets are in an atmosphere where there is an FOMC meeting and people view interest rates as being on an upward trend If you could have picked a time for Orange County to sell, maybe this would not have been the time you would have picked "
