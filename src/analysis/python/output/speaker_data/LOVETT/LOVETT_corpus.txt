 That hasn't been a factor during this most recent period, in part because so many people in the market are trying to put together estimates about how reserves are going to behave--very much the same way we are Data on reserves are released with a lag, but it's a relatively brief lag, so people are able to speculate as to what factors are influencing reserve behavior That brief lag may cause people to wonder momentarily in a transition period about the impact on the funds rate But I think over just a relatively short length of time they've been able to perceive that For example, in the recent period, people have been watching the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and have seen a rise in other assets and have concluded from that rise that while there are many components in it, the foreign exchange component has probably been a fairly large one; and therefore, our needs to add reserves going forward would be smaller than they had thought heretofore So it seems as though it has worked out in this past period Any sort of disturbance on the funds market has been fairly brief   I think it was only temporary   One other part of that--whenever there is central bank intervention, the financial markets have been quite    8/16/88  sensitive to listen to that Each morning one hears what the rumors are as to whether central banks are in or not in, so that when they take a look at what they think might be affecting reserves, that would be one thing they tuck in the back of their minds to some degree   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Initially this morning, when the trade numbers first came out, the long bond was down about a point It seemed that for a brief juncture it would be holding, and I don't know whether it changed further since   Well, I think, during part of the period there was an effort to let the market know that if expectations had carried the rate beyond what the Committee had voted, that seemed to be a way of letting them know that The reason, of course, was that these expectations could become embedded; and we were trying to signal that they were really moving faster than the Committee had instructed The longer those things persist, the more people begin to feel that--if these expectations really get imbedded in the structure of rates--when the Committee meets again, we may have taken the decisions from it So we felt it necessary to give a signal when rates seemed to be ratcheting higher That was particularly true when funds seemed to be getting sticky at the 7/8ths level   Right Well, we got the borrowings   Thank you, Mr Chairman; thank you, Bill [Statement--see Appendix]   This morning?   The early read we got was that a technical adjustment had been taking place in the market yesterday afternoon as the stock market recovered from its lows And with the world stock market this morning also tending to recover from the lows seen yesterday, there is just what one would call normal, technical position adjustments taking place There didn't seem to be anything more fundamental than that at work   We were somewhat surprised The quarter had finished on a firm note We really thought that we had put in [enough] reserves and made an allowance for even higher-than-normal excess reserves for the quarter-end, but we had a very large miss Therefore, the next morning, which was the beginning of this maintenance period, the funds market started out on the firm side; and sometimes that carries over But I have to say we were surprised by the carryover firmness because it was the first day of the maintenance period and the banks had the whole remainder [of the period to adjust] and it was also prior to the time when there were widespread expectations that the Fed would be cutting the rate So, we're having a very difficult time trying to understand why people would pay these higher rates so early on The rates aren't consistent with the reserve numbers either Reserves don't show [a need for us] to put in that volume of reserves So, we've been surprised by it The market hasn't been as surprised because they think the need is bigger than we are saying This is one of those periods where right after the quarter-end the Treasury balances plummet because they have to pay out these social security [checks] And the market, even though it knows that, thinks the need is bigger So, the market hasn't been as surprised about the firmness of the funds rate as we have been The firmness that we're hearing about is coming more or less from regional sources, and we just don't have a satisfactory explanation for it   The fact that the funds rate hasn't behaved quite the way it should has been largely ignored by the market thus far It is seen as something that's technically driven at this point   I guess I could answer that in two ways They look at those kinds of aggregates broadly in terms of their impact on policy, but I think they see that impact as being somewhat removed They look more closely at their estimates of reserve requirements as an operating factor that we have to contend with And I think that's as close as their focus would go on that   Well, the market looks at what it thinks the Federal Reserve acts on; they feel reasonably confident that that is the thing to do They don't see the monetary aggregates as being the driving force to policy right now They find it very difficult to read what the aggregates are saying, and everything they read says the Committee does too So, they don't tend to look at them that closely   They don't ignore the money numbers by any stretch of the imagination; they do look at them Some people are commenting a lot about the rapid growth of M1 being a harbinger of trouble, but others aren't Some say one can't look at that because the Fed is looking at the broader aggregates Nobody understands fully or positively what is going on here If they thought we were going to be acting on it or if they thought we should be because the growth rates are out of historical experience, then they would respond to it   Right   Right   I don't know what that means! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   It's worth noting that Jerry Powell told everyone yesterday that as an outgoing Treasury official for debt management he would advise the transition team not to make that change   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think it's what the future reductions in the deficit portend going forward rather than the reductions themselves But, as you know, the general likelihood of an economy that performs reasonably well with low prices is probably more the key point than, say, overseas rate cuts would be in the markets going forward   Yes   I guess it [depends on] the point from which they're all starting Some of the people in the market are looking at the near-term weakness as being somewhat mitigated by the drop in interest rates that has occurred already So, if expectations before all this [centered on] worry that the economy's recovery was going to produce growth rates in the 4 percent plus range early on, which reflected some of the estimates toward the end of last year, those estimates are being scaled down to something that's--   I do get some sense that there is or has been-- and maybe it's taking a long time--some underlying shift in expectations about future price performance than had been the case before I think that has been ratcheting down   Yes   One thing that has been interesting on a day-to- day basis in the market is that there has been [less] day-to-day volatility by a fair amount And sometimes people are at a loss to    3/23/93  explain the movements in prices on any given day to the next Many of the dealers in the market are not expecting to see this kind of movement take place and are constantly expecting to see it give back its ground That's why I mentioned the climate being a little skittish Not everyone was a believer in the full degree of the rally   Oddly enough, at this juncture I think the information that the market expects on the real side is favorable inflation on prices People generally have tended to feel that while the reports for January and February were sobering, they were really not indicative of the trend in prices They believe that there is slack, particularly on the labor side, that is going to keep inflation reasonably well contained, even if it's not on a downward trend, and that the employment report perhaps overstated things They think the recovery is here and will continue, but the sense of where it's vulnerable is in [the process of] going through the Congressional passage of the budget [There are concerns] that some compromises are going to be made to get the package through and that some of these compromises are going to mean the death knell for the intent of the package, if you will, and that we're going to end up with perhaps half a loaf   That's how we got the 302 percent fed funds rate!   Thank you, Mr Chairman I hope you can hear me down at that end also [Statement--see Appendix]   A predisposition  -32-    8/17/93   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the interest of time I'm going to dispense with some incredibly interesting statistics on the Treasury's fund-raising operations in the market over the intermeeting period and the reception of the refunding and composition of the debt unless someone has questions about it [Secretary's note Statement in its entirety is shown in the Appendix]  I'd just conclude, Mr Chairman, with a request for a temporary increase in the intermeeting leeway from $8 billion to $11 billion As I noted earlier, upcoming reserve needs at this juncture are expected to be sufficiently large and persistent as to warrant a cushion beyond the normal limit   [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]   It's over   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I think that what really is at stake is that while we have announced the changes that we have made, the market still sees itself as always looking for when we're going to make a change in the future On occasions when they think we will or we should, they move the funds rate up immediately in the morning well before any kind of an announcement by the Committee would be likely And the rate sits there until we demonstrate something to the contrary And so on a couple of occasions where the market thought the data were such that perhaps there was going to be an action in coming days, they moved the funds rate up to reflect that possibility Part of the theory that seems to be at work there is that if people really believe that the Fed will move, for some it means buying cheap funds relative to what they will be later Moving the funds rate also is a way of testing the Fed to see what its stance is And so even though we recently have announced our policy actions, what we respond to is the market moving ahead of our announcement of Fed policy actions I think that's always going to happen   Yes, there are some people who still think that's a possibility; it hasn't been ruled out because we have mentioned that these announcements have not necessarily been for all time I think the market tends to set up for itself a series of time points It looks for announcements on the discount rate now within a certain period of time in the morning, policy announcements any time after that, but always the possibility of something being signaled ahead of the announcement Even if that is not forthcoming, there are circumstances when they move the funds rate ahead of the Fed For example, on the day of the employment data release on Friday, May 6, most people didn't think that the Fed would take action that day, but they still moved the funds rate up on the theory that perhaps the Federal Reserve would do something on the following Monday And thus the constellation of where the funds rate would be over the balance of the period suggested that it was worth pushing the rate up  -5-    5/17/94   Well, I guess it's really their anticipatory moves that we're talking about; it's not the actual Fed moves; it's the market anticipating the Fed moves before they occur   Perhaps with the passage of time, as people become accustomed to our new disclosure practices, those anticipatory moves will not require our protest actions But we're always going to have anticipatory moves; I think that's a given How the market would view our absence from protesting I think would require more experience with our new disclosure practices I don't think there's enough experience with them now for the market to be confident that, had we stayed out when they pushed the funds rate a point higher, we were not paving the way for the Committee We're not in the position to pave the way for the Committee   Right   Or that we were trying to get the market ready for it--to pave the way for a decision I think that there just has not been enough experience with the announcements for people to feel comfortable in terms of what the timing of those announcements is and so forth   Yes   Well, relative to our expectations on the April tax collection themselves, we fell short by $12 billion And if we take April and May combined there was a big catchup in early May   They only fell short by about $9 billion We had forecast an increase in the April tax take of something in the neighborhood of 25 percent over the level a year ago and it appears to be coming in between 5 and 10 percent above Everyone seems to have had those same kinds of overestimates, so people are still trying to find out if there will be some offsets in June or whether in fact all these adjustments were made last year and people really did get ahead of the change in their tax liabilities   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   We spent a lot of time talking to people in the repo markets as we proceeded, and we learned some hard lessons in that market here I think there has been some concern that as these repo markets are developing in Europe market participants have not quite learned from our mistakes So we have been trying, both at the central bank level and with US dealers who have a presence in these markets overseas, to let them know how important it is to maintain margin and all of the other good practices As they are evolving, they are taking a look at some of the early history here and learning from it   Thank you, Mr Chairman   I answer to either [Laughter] [Statement--See Appendix]   The part of the statement that was released in August that has captured a lot of attention--and some people have likened it to the sort of attention that Talmudic scholars give--is the "for a time" phraseology The rest of the announcement followed the format of earlier announcements It has not had an impact on our operations; it has not affected us in any way that differs from the earlier announcements That is to say, people see that the Committee has been announcing its policy moves and that has tended perhaps to give us a little more flexibility in our day-to-day operations I'd say more than a little flexibility until we come right up to a Committee meeting What we have noticed is that each time we come up to a Committee meeting, there is still this question about whether we are paving the way for a policy change That has not dissipated The "for a time" concept immediately after the August meeting was taken by most people in the market to mean until November 15 That was the "nuance" that they put on the statement But as you can see from the data that have come out since the August meeting and the market's reaction to it, I don't think they feel that the Committee is hard- bound by it It has been a factor in that people perhaps have responded more slowly to the data on the theory that, having said this, the Committee would like a longer period of time to review information as it comes in So, the response to the numbers, say the PPI number, was muted because (a) it was the first number like this and (b) since it was the first, the Committee presumably would want more evidence But I don't think the market thinks that the Committee would overlook the data if it were overwhelmingly conclusive    9/27/94   I don't want to use a technical argument here because I don't think technical arguments carry weight for long periods of time, but I will say that an awful lot of money has been kept in the short end of the market because people are very cautious; most people feel that rates are going higher still, and the short end has been a beneficiary of that The 2-year rate in particular has been the subject of some debate in the market A lot of people look at the spread of the 2-year note over the funds rate as being too narrow to be sustained, but that abstracts from the fact that there has been a fair amount of interest in staying short That perhaps is what has kept that segment of the curve relatively low Bill rates were so low that the segment that you point to between one and two years may have been depressed beyond what fundamentals would call for People are questioning the spread of the 2-year rate over the federal funds rate at this stage of the cycle, given the prospect of further Fed moves And I think some people feel it's hovering around the low end because of defensive moves   We see, as I mentioned, that people have ratcheted up somewhat further their views about prospective tightening We see that in the futures contracts for December and in market commentaries We see it through early next year Not everyone, as I mentioned, is completely sure about where prices are going to be There is still a fairly wide discrepancy in that   At the time I first wrote this earlier, I would have described it as a narrow majority, but over the past week or so I would say it probably has become a more comfortable majority I think that's the way things have shifted over the past week People really got caught up in the numbers released last week They were a big surprise   Do you mean me?  -18-    9/27/94   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]  -3-    11/15/94   That's right   For the month of November?   I don't know the precise average, but it is on the high side, because after its rise at the end of the quarter the rate never really went back down The last statement week ended on a firm note and it was a holiday on Friday With expectations of a rate move at this meeting today, the funds rate has been persistently above that average   Yes   For November   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--See Appendix]   It has been a disappointing year for a lot of people in the financial markets We have had some sense since Thanksgiving that many people are just hanging on in the hope of getting through December 31 If they have done well or have managed to do all right, they want to finish the year in that position If they haven't done well, they don't want to add to their losses As a result, there has been a general tendency for people to try to take cover This gives us a hint as to why we have had abrupt moves when securities have come into the market in clumps, because people don't feel they necessarily have the wherewithal to take them on If they do buy them, they have to re-route them right away or hedge them with something equivalent   I think that in the Orange County case there probably are several influences at work It was helpful that people eventually were able to get a handle on just what the county has In    12/20/94  the first day or so, people couldn't get any information from Orange County on almost anything, and I think that is what caused the biggest market backup Since that time, the markets have come back in many cases to where they were prior to the break of the news or maybe just 5 or 10 basis points past that, even with some of the securities being liquidated So I think the initial move occurred because of the lack of knowledge of exactly what was going on and what was going to happen By the same token, markets are in an atmosphere where there is an FOMC meeting and people view interest rates as being on an upward trend If you could have picked a time for Orange County to sell, maybe this would not have been the time you would have picked
