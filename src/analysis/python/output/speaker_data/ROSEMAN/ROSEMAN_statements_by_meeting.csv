9051,2011-08-01,"  Thanks  We had put procedures in place to address how  government payments would be handled if the debt ceiling wasn’t increased in a  timely way  Those procedures have evolved fairly substantially in the past week or  two, and they weren’t finalized until Friday evening or fully documented until  yesterday afternoon   August 1, 2011 10 of 53              Let me walk through what the current assumptions would have been  The  procedures are based on three principles  The first one is that principal and interest  on Treasury securities would continue to be made on time  The second one is that  other payments may be delayed  The third principle is that any payments that were  made would be settled as usual   So how do you implement those three principles?  With respect to the first, the  principal on Treasury securities that are maturing would be funded by having auctions  that would roll over those maturing securities into new issues, so the new issues  would be able to fund the redemption of the maturing securities  With respect to  interest payments, the way the Treasury planned to ensure that it would be able to pay  interest payments timely by holding back other government payments and  accumulating sufficient cash balances in its Fed account to pay upcoming coupon  payments  The implication of this approach would be that the Treasury would be  delaying non-P&I payments even on days when it may have ample balances in its Fed  account to have been able to make those payments if it had so chosen  Instead, the  Treasury would be conserving that cash to be able to ensure that it would be able to  pay future-dated interest payments  Then, to ensure that payments made would settle  as usual, the Treasury would not submit any ACH files to the Reserve Banks for  processing unless it was certain that it would have sufficient balances on the  settlement date to settle those transactions  Similarly, for checks, the Treasury would  not mail checks out to the intended recipients until it was sure that it would have  sufficient balances in its account to fund the presentment of those checks once they  came back to the Fed  And for Fedwire funds transfers, the Treasury would not make  funds transfers unless it had sufficient balances in its Fed account to do so   So this, compared with the procedures Treasury had mapped out just several  weeks ago, provides a much higher level of assurance for the banking industry that  the payments they do get would be settled using normal procedures  It also provides  assurance to the recipients of those payments that they would have good funds as they  typically would  But it would result in delays in payments, and in particular,  payments that do not relate to principal and interest  The other thing I should mention  is, because the Treasury was ensuring that P&I payments would be made on schedule,  it avoided a lot of very potentially disruptive effects if it missed a coupon payment or  missed a scheduled redemption of maturing securities   These, at least, are current procedures that have been codified into a special  operating circular that was developed jointly by the Reserve Banks, the staff here at  the Board, and at the Treasury, and has been approved by the Treasury as reflecting  what it would like the Reserve Banks to do as its fiscal agents if it ever came to that   We were positioned, in the event a deal wasn’t struck, to issue this circular to the  industry so it would understand what the rules of the game would be  And there were  a lot of other associated customer communications that were developed, and stand  ready just in case, though we no longer think we would need to use them   So with that, let me open it up to see if there are any comments or questions   August 1, 2011 11 of 53                Well, actually, the current approach requires very little change on the   part of the Reserve Banks in how they would process payments because the contingency plans   were based on the assumption is that by the time the payments hit the Fed, they would be   processed as usual   One of the reasons, I think, that a lot of the changes were made in the recent weeks is that   it was only recently that senior policymakers, here at the Board and at the Treasury and   elsewhere, paid very serious attention to what the procedures would be, and questioned, perhaps,   whether that was the appropriate approach  Planning had been under way for months, but it was   only recently that there were questions raised about whether there were better approaches that   would provide a higher degree of certainty to the recipients of the payments  And I think we   ended up in a better place than where we started out     This is something that I know the New York Fed has been paying a lot   of attention to  You’re asking, if the Treasury changed its mind again and it would not be   prioritizing P&I, how would that work?     Actually, that would be something that the Federal Reserve would be   able to implement  The challenge is whether other market participants would be able to deal   with it in their systems  So it wasn’t an issue as much of whether Reserve Bank systems would   be capable of handling delayed coupon payments or delayed redemption of matured securities,   but whether the other participants, the counterparties, would have similar capabilities  And   based on very limited discussions, there would be very big operational challenges and probably a   lot of disruption associated with the limitations in their systems  This is because when market   participants developed their programs, they never contemplated the possibility of not having   timely payments, and therefore, their systems weren’t designed along those lines     Well, I think the challenge would be more on the Treasury side  What   the Treasury would have needed to do is to give us certain types of payments and not give us   other types of payments, and I know that it had concerns about its operational capability of   carrying that out  But frankly, the Treasury had concerns about some of the approaches we’ve   ultimately adopted that in the past week or so that it has now decided it would be able to do after   all  So I suspect that it would, with sufficient lead time—at least in weeks, not days—be able to   accommodate that  But it’s something that until you have developed the procedures and tested   the procedures, your comfort level is pretty low  "
