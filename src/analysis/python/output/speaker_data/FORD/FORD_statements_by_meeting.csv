1495,1980-08-12," With regard to the comment of what to peg it to Should we go to a floating discount rate, my feeling--[given my prior experience at a commercial] bank--would be in line with what Lyle said We should consider an alternative that no one here has mentioned [yet], and that is tying it to something like the bank issue rate on CDs From the point of view of the money desk manager of a major bank--and those are the people we are dealing with--whether or not the bank goes to the discount window obviously depends on its alternative sources of funds And in terms of maturity matchings, since borrowings through the discount window are not normally overnight but rather are done on a more than overnight basis, I would suggest that the staff in its analysis of this question look at the possibility of applying it to the reserve adjusted CD rate for major banks on large quantities of money That would make the movements in the discount rate less volatile since a longer maturity [is involved]  -13-    8/12/80  and would tie it to the alternative source of funds that money desk managers tend to consider Also, we might consider having the discount rate normally set close to that reserve adjusted cost-- perhaps a little below it to give us some leverage--because then [money managers] would want to come in if we set our rate just a little below, but the reluctance factor would sort of balance that out It would give us some leverage over them  Well, as one of the novices here, I must say I am very relieved by the narrow range and the bias of the two alternatives before us in that I see no danger that the markets--  I may choose at some future date to suggest a third But I like the way the alternatives have been structured here because whichever way we go with this decision there seems to me no danger that we'll be reading in the newspaper--even without a leak but after due time when we release the [record]--that we biased ourselves toward getting off the path that we set last October We will probably not be accused of loosening monetary policy based on limited information of a recovery, and so on So either way we go, I think this decision can be viewed in the marketplace as a reasonable one With regard to the arguments on whether we should make this minor adjustment toward tightness, [as in] ""B,"" I am persuaded by [several] things First of all, I've seen virtually no evidence of price softening, which is what the name of the game is supposed to be as I understand it [Our goal is] to promote a view in the world which says that we're determined to wring inflation out of the economy And  -37-    8/12/80  the facts as I have heard them and see them are that we're not seeing that price relief yet The second argument that persuades me is the one that Mr Wallich made, assuming he is correct about the course of the aggregates and that we will have to crank down the numbers later For smoothing reasons, I find it rather persuasive to think ahead and to try to avoid the need to bring the aggregates down later at a time that may inopportune Also, with the limited evidence we have that the aggregates may be expanding in the next few days, I would lean, along with the rest of the splitters, toward ""B"" "
1533,1980-09-16," Did you offer them interest rate controls!  You asked about where we stand on tax policy, and that's one of the things my staff has been looking at We're very concerned about the explosive growth on the spending side that we've seen in the last year or so It now appears that on a year-over-year basis federal spending both for defense and nondefense purposes is well up into the double digit range, well beyond earlier forecasts I'm curious to know, Jim In your projection and in your model of the federal deficit on an NIA basis, I take it that $67 to $68 billion shown is without the tax cut  You're saying that without the tax cut there would be a $40 billion deficit next year?  Well, I remember the President saying just a few weeks ago that there was going to be a zero deficit next year So I [proceed] based on the trend in their forecast rather than the absolute level Looking at off-budget spending trends that are coming on stream and adding them on to a realistic estimate of the deficit, I would come to the conclusion that we definitely have to resist a countercyclical tax cut at this time It would lay the groundwork, as a couple of the previous commentators have noted, for a very tough situation for us early next year in that we would be looking at a lot of pressure in the financial markets with a possible crowding out scenario We'll be caught in the trap of either having to create and be given [the blame] for a credit crunch or for letting the aggregates get away from us in the first, second, and third quarters of next year And when we have already committed ourselves in public to reducing the rate of growth of the money supply I don't see how we can hope to do that if we have to do it in the context of a huge deficit developing early next year So, I think we have to fight this  -17-    9/16/80  countercyclical tax cut But if we wanted to add something to what we say, I'd say it should be directed toward the need for a longer-term change in the tax structure that would emphasize taxing consumption more and investment and saving less, together with some indexed reduction over a longer period of time of the inflation premium in the tax structure on incomes of all kinds I'd be inclined to continue to fight the tax cut as a countercyclical [measure] and start to fight for tax reform as a longer-term measure  May I ask On this anticipated fluctuation in the funds rate for alternative B, let's say that in the model it would average 12 percent Do you also estimate what the peak pressures are likely to be? In other words, are you anticipating that at times it is likely to hit the 14 percent ceiling [of our current range] and that we'll have to react accordingly?  My feeling is in line with what John Balles said I'm worried that the forecast may once again underestimate the pressures on monetary expansion And given the fact that we are rapidly approaching the first anniversary of our new policy and are going to be scrutinized very carefully on the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter performance, I would think we definitely have to get focused on taking a conservative course of action, which would be moving to something like alternative B, possibly even widening the band of allowable interest rates rather than narrowing it  Let's pray for New York [to be right]! "
1556,1980-10-21," On the business outlook we don't have much to add My staff is exuberant about the fact that they have done better for the last two or three quarters forecasting the aggregate economic variables, and they are saying that the quarter we are in now may be a little stronger than the Board staff's forecast In the Southeast we  -37-    10/21/80  are finding a very mixed economic picture and some of the same concerns that others around the table have expressed about what we might do to housing and whether or not new car sales will really go up and all that But the new things that I would like to add to the discussion that has occurred around the table so far involve not just how our policy would be viewed by the public but how the public and the financial community will perceive the government's overall policy actions And what is happening on the fiscal front concerns me as much as what we are doing Irrespective of the outcome of the election, if I read it right, we are going to continue to see above range spending in the federal government; every revision of the level of the federal deficit has been sharply up in recent months We are now looking at estimates for the deficit during this fiscal year of perhaps $50 to $80 billion, after closing out last year somewhere in the $60 to $70 billion range, without considering off-budget spending So on the fiscal side, if we ask what we will be looking at six months from now, regardless of the outcome of the election, it appears to me that both sides are coming out with tax cuts [So] that applies to the outlook of the Board [staff] for the fiscal deficit irrespective of the outcome of the forthcoming election That has to be considered  Everyone has mentioned that the outlook for shocks is particularly scary right now, with a major war going on in the Middle East So we are vulnerable there to inflationary pressures hitting us again And that brings us down to what we should do against this background of vulnerability to shocks and the fiscal outlook My feeling is that we have to be very concerned not to go through these wild gyrations of monetary aggregate growth I wouldn't want to advocate that we sharply contract [such growth] in an effort to get it way down in the middle of the range because that will just encourage another round of [unintelligible] that we will settle up with monetary policy Rather I do think we have to temper our approach at this time to try to hit--your commitment Paul, you were the one who said it last October--these targets We can't ignore the fact that regardless of what we say and how we interpret the different variables to the public, they are going to make their own reading on it What they are going to say is that either we did it or we didn't In that connection, I feel somewhat like Mr Mayo Whether or not we are happy about these things, the fact is that we are going to be measured by them So we may as well try to play to win, whether or not we like the rules of the game The only element that I would add [relates to] the letter you sent to us concerning how the public would interpret hearing that we are reconsidering our operating procedures If you throw that into the pot, I think you are very right to be worried about how it would be interpreted, especially if we miss the aggregates So with all of that taken together, I come out on the ""A"" side, with a lot of concern that we are not going to win either way we go on this But ""A"" seems to be the one that gives us a chance at least to maintain some element of our credibility on the October 6, 1979 plan you announced  There are two other dimensions to what you're discussing on borrowed reserves One is that on Friday, if the rates don't break this week, I suspect you're going to get a number of Reserve Banks recommending an increase in the discount rate, which would obviously affect the borrowings The other thing is that we put out a revision in Regulation A  We have a revision of Reg A which, if I've read it right--and depending on how the different discount officers interpret it--calls for a tighter policy in regulating borrowing by the big banks, the issue that Steve just talked about So we have to [factor]  -53-    10/21/80  into our thinking at least whether we're going to raise the discount rate  So you don't think the Board is likely to move [the discount rate] on Friday? "
1583,1980-11-18," Paul, if we do that, which I strongly [favor]--I support the notion that we should look at the pros and cons of all of the issues that have been raised--we ought to consider one other basic question, which we are assuming can't be raised And that is just not generating the numbers so often I heard you say that we couldn't operate for a month or even two weeks without going through this exercise But [I wonder about that] when I look at the commitment of resources that we are making to this--the overtime, the blood, sweat, and tears of the staff One can discount that very heavily in terms of a need for information But there are other countries in the world, it seems to me, that operate their monetary policy without going through this tremendous expenditure of resources and all the problems of revising and re-revising and interpreting and re- interpreting the data  I'm disheartened, as everyone is, about the alternatives in front of us On the inflation front, Paul, everything we have discussed and everything we see is disheartening except the possible outside chance of house prices weakening due to a disaster in the housing market That's clearly shaping up in front of us I feel strongly that it's too late to try to salvage the year-to-year growth rates in the monetary aggregates because it would require a very sharp adjustment that would be extremely difficult to achieve So I would come out, for essentially the same reasons Mr Balles mentioned, in favor of alternative B with the proviso that the aggregate growth targets be viewed as a maximum I would not be inclined to narrow the range on the fed funds rate With regard to what Governor Partee said--he threw in something about how we communicate this to the other regulators--I do think we are headed into a period of very difficult times for the thrift institutions In talking to Jerry Corrigan and other people in different parts of the country, we are now starting to see some really sharp deterioration in the balance sheets of thrifts all around the country I am afraid that in the next few months we are going to see [the need for] some fast mergers in that area that are going to be rather difficult, and I don't know what this Committee can do about that That's just another inevitable side effect of this period we are entering Should we get a crisis in the Middle East, based on the OPEC meetings and consultations around this time, I think we would have to consider reconvening this Committee to restudy our entire program in light of the experience back in '74 when we went through [an oil crisis] the last time Overall I come out in favor of ""B"" as it stands  Tony Solomon addressed that What's wrong with Solomon's approach?  Yes, but if we put a 17 percent cap on the fed funds rate, that almost guarantees--I mean it could be happening before we get out of this room  It's not whacky; it's semi-whacky "
1606,1980-11-26," Paul, this is Bill Ford I just have one question I would like to [ask] Are you thinking about the tolerance [unintelligible] level of the discount rate might have other [unintelligible]?  The [unintelligible] also happens fairly quickly on the discount [unintelligible]  Paul, this is Bill Ford In Atlanta five of the largest banks in our District are right on the edge of being subject to the frequency rules So we anticipate that it's likely to be [unintelligible] We have not been putting undue pressure of any kind before-- "
1644,1980-12-12, Atlanta is with you 
1662,1980-12-18," To pick up on the criteria questions, I did feel that Steve's talk highlighted the problems and the complexity of explaining this multiple set of targets and, therefore, I strongly share Frank's criterion number one, which is that we should narrow the number of targets we aim for, preferably to one target With regard to the volatility of the transfers of funds between the different categories, we also have been making some serious efforts to try to determine in our District how much shifting of funds there will be And on the subject of the number of institutions offering NOWs, we have done some stratified samples of thrifts to see how many institutions are offering them, compared to the New England experience We found in one survey that out of a stratified sample of 60 S&Ls, at a minimum 56 are going to offer the account immediately from day one, out of the box at the turn of the year  NOWs, or share drafts  Yes, I'm talking about savings and loans We didn't do the credit unions, although in talking to Jerry last night I  -41-    12/18-19/80  was very interested in what he had to say because we are both coming up with similar feelings in our Districts That is, given what we see from surveys of the thrifts and the amount of pre-emptive advertising of NOWs, share drafts, and so on, I'm afraid we are going to be overwhelmed and that the New England experience is likely to be less relevant than some of us had thought earlier We expect to see an accelerated learning curve on the part of the consumer, which therefore highlights everything you have been saying all year long, Paul, about the problem of M-1A versus M-1B It says to me that we have to come up with some sort of measure that averages them So I tend to lean, again on the choice among evils theory, toward some measure that averages the two, [perhaps on a] total reserve basis, which Chuck said might be [a blend of the two], recognizing that it, too, has many inadequacies So, I'd go for the one target approach I don't think you or anybody else on the face of the earth can possibly explain all those adjustments, which I agree are relevant, that the staff came up with We just can't explain all of those adjustments for four different targets We have to pick one thing and try to explain it and simplify it with regard to how hard to come down on policy  I think by the time we meet in February we may find ourselves again worrying about missing all the targets on the down side If my guess is right about where the markets are going, as John Balles and others said, we're leaning on so much stringency now that even though the immediate figures still show the economy surging, except on housing and autos, we are going to pay for this stringency and we're going to pay before the next meeting of this Committee I think it's more likely that we will see something similar to what we had early last year--though I wouldn't say it will be an exact replay--than that we will have to worry about the aggregates running away So for the immediate future, my feeling is that we can have a reasonable set of growth targets like one of the [alternatives suggested], but I'd hone in on one [variable] rather than all of them  And we are likely to find that our problem is that the economy will cool off I don't think there is much we can do about it between now and early next year Whatever is going to happen is already built into the policy we've been making Then the question will arise next February, if we do get some relief due to a cooling of the economy, what we should make of it in terms of setting the year- over-year target I end up, bottom line, being a little optimistic in that if the stringency we've put on bites within the next 90 to 120 days, bringing many of the numbers down so that we are starting to worry about the numbers being too weak rather than too strong, we may then have an opportunity to set targets for the whole year to catch up a little on this base drift That would make us more credible, [particularly if] backed up, hopefully, by a Reagan strategy that deals with the other things we have to worry about, like the deficit and so forth, which you have been giving speeches about So I come out wanting to pursue a very moderate growth policy for the next 90 to 120 days, but narrowing down to one target I have a slight preference, amidst all the anxiety about which one to use, for a total reserve target That's about where I would leave it at this point  Excuse me, Paul May I ask one clarification question? Did you say that you would or would not allow the base drift? It sounded to me as if you said on M-1A and M-1B you would allow base drift and on M2 you wouldn't  Compared to the fed funds ranges in the three alternatives the staff developed, this is narrower than any of them Why narrow it? I'd be inclined to give more leeway rather than less  Yes, but we're setting this presumably for three months, right?  Oh, just the one month  Yes, but still we're talking about a target that goes for at least a quarter or so  I'd hate to think that within the next quarter we'd be upset to see the fed funds rate come down to something close to what any of these--  The lower part of the range I mean  So make it a little wider as these alternatives suggest and--  And we'll be calling each other up during the Christmas holidays To me, Mr Chairman, your proposal to soften the  -81-    12/18-19/80  language so as to signal the money market watcher that we're not watching every day for every little glitch of fed funds rate--the averaging idea or however you want to express it--is a good one Between that and Governor Partee's idea of making the range 15 to 20 percent it may provide enough [flexibility] so that we won't have to be on the phone with each other all over the country  You would explain it in any event in your testimony, right?  Why argue about it?  Mr Chairman, on the point you just made about how it would be read if we made it 16 percent, am I not right that our current range, [which went into effect after we consulted] on the telephone, has a bottom of 13 percent?  So if we raise the bottom by 300 basis points, we're going to be read as tightening now  But that is a big jump, going from a bottom of 13 percent to 16 percent, when we're really anticipating moving the other way "
1689,1981-02-02," I also want a clarification of what you did with regard to your discount rate sensitivity studies A priori one would expect to see the amount of borrowing out of line with your plan the greater the differential between the effective rate at the window and the effective comparable rate in the market But the amount of borrowing is obviously conditioned by the administration of the window Did you find as we hit periods of time when the spread widened between the effective rate at the window and market rates-- say, for CDs adjusted for reserves--more problems with the borrowing at the window or not?  Which discount rate, with or without the differential?  Yes In other words, you did it against the nominal discount rate rather than the one that affects the larger banks  In other words, we don't know for sure that we would have had less problems with the borrowing track if, for  -15-    2/2-3/81  instance, we had [operated] the window with a penalty rate lover] the funds rate or something like that?  We observed that the amount of borrowing we predict is--  I guess, Paul, I have the bias of someone who has been involved in it on the other side That is, as I understand my micro-economics, it says that the inducement to a profit-making bank to come to the window is higher the greater the spread All I'm asking is--  -16-    2/2-3/81  The bottom line of what I'm trying to get at is this On the basis of your research, if we did two things that have already been discussed--one is to get to contemporaneous reserve  -17-    2/2-3/81  accounting and second is to make the window more directly related to market rates--rather than the lags that we now have, would the procedure otherwise be improved overall or not? Do we gain nothing by doing that?  Paul, I'm not sure You've made this point a number of times about the mechanical connection between the way the [window] works and the rest of the procedure, but given the complexities of the dynamics that Chuck was hinting at, I'm not sure it's that simple It could blow up in our face; I'm not saying I swear I know that it wouldn't--  Well, whether or not you do, that's why I'm interested in what Mr Balles was suggesting That more and more people are saying that this is not so automatically volatile; that there is some kind of damping mechanism that may come into play to save us Granted, it's a policy risk to test it, given the uncertainty of the theoretical dynamics of it On the side of arguing for trying it, a couple of things have popped up that really bother me about the way we operate the discount window One is the subsidy It has been mentioned that it's perceived that we are giving away money to the banks Another thing about it is the difference between the way we operate our window and the [way the Home Loan Banks lend to the] thrifts We're all aware that Congressman St Germain is conducting a hearing the thrust of which, as I read it, is to say ""Hey, let's allow the thrifts to come in and borrow and forget about this [problem of] exhausting their other [sources of funds]"" In that connection, we've been looking at how they operate at the NCUA and how  -39-    2/2-3/81  the Home Loan Banks operate their windows I'm sure you know that they operate their windows basically by offering their members a variety of loan options based on maturity, more or less keyed to the yield curve that they have to deal with when they go out to raise money to fund the loans I'm not saying that that's ideal for us, but the fact is that as we interact, if we allow the difference between what it costs to borrow at the Fed window to be vastly different than, say, at the Home Loan Bank window, sooner or later we're going to have to face the political realities and the heat that Congressman St Germain is generating  Well, the obvious thrust is to move toward their system of going more toward--  No, it has to be accompanied by modifications of this technique that we use here; you're right  Isn't it the truth--as opposed to the perception in the market that the subsidy goes to big banks--that the subsidy goes to the little banks? It seems to me [true] by definition, with the surcharge  But the fact is that the size of the subsidy the bank gets depends on whether or not they pay the surcharge; and the smaller the surcharge, the more the subsidy  The other element is that while this discussion is leading us toward credit rationing of some sort at the window, we're reacting to a public perception which is technically not the truth-- which is that the subsidy goes to the big banks There is a subsidy for all the banks but the biggest; the subsidy is for the ones under $500 million, item 1 The second thing is the way we administer the window If I understand it, in doing the rationing now, which we may  -45-    2/2-3/81  want to change as you say, in some sense liability managed institutions should not get in Maybe I'm making this too strong--  But you are sort of saying we should not have to be aware of what they are doing to qualify And we all have heard the horror story about the guy who comes in and admits that he's managing his liabilities, seeking to maximize his subsidy, and he's the one we throw out It's that kind of thing that I see as being--  One thing I think I see--but I don't have any research to prove it--is that the multibank holding companies seem to send in their subsidiaries, many of which qualify for the biggest subsidy of all, on a rotating basis As a banker, from a profit maximizing standpoint, that's the ideal thing to do if you're worried about your shareholders' interests That's another aspect to [discount window] administration these different games that people are definitely playing with us at the window That frustrates me so much about the present system that it leads me to question whether we don't have to modify this procedure significantly in order to get away from these games The alternative is some form of rationing at the window that at least is more honest than the present one  They can move anything they want They can make the loans or the deposits show up wherever they want  Yes, but try to track that in reality when you're talking about banks that have 30 or 40 subsidiaries and geniuses to  -46-    2/2-3/81  manage their balance sheets, which we don't We couldn't keep up with that, could we?  It's a Catch-22  Doesn't that get right into the same thing that Paul was talking about the logic of the system? Because, in effect, that's partially moving to trying to peg the rate to the market to the extent that those borrowings are a significant portion of the whole  -47-    2/2-3/81  amount of borrowing Once again it is attempting to go to a market determined rate at the discount window and then we're back into the box that Paul was talking about; we're trapped if we buy the current system of control  I'll take 90--  You do have the contemporaneous accounting on your list now?  From one meeting to the next? May I ask for a clarification? Are you saying that whenever we have a meeting, we state the monetary aggregate targets and then always have a proviso to the Desk that the Manager will tell Paul any time we're going to move 300 basis points plus or minus from where the funds rate was when we left the meeting? And that would call for consultation on the subject of whether we would want to let the rates go?    2/2-3/81  Since we meet on average every 5 to 6 weeks--I'm just trying to remember the history of the market [rate movements]-- that would have triggered a discussion on couple of occasions, right?  Well, if I may comment on Governor Partee's statement that the range ought to be widened It seems to me that if we're going to issue a report on changes in monetary policy for the next year compared to last year, and if one of the things we're going to say is that we are going to move faster against movements off the path on reserves, there has to be a logical symmetry in that we have to say something that is consistent with that on the other side Either widen the band or make a stronger statement that we will adjust right away  Well, you're right to be concerned about the problem it creates for the banks--especially for a large branch bank system--because I was involved [as a banker] in researching this when it was discussed as a possibility by the Fed some time ago We have to give them warning if we are going to do this  I know that But having said that, if we give them warning, there's no question that the banks can gear up to provide [the data] As to the theoretical arguments on things like the discount window and so on, there is disagreement among the theoreticians as to how much goes toward getting us out of the box that you and I were discussing earlier But there's no question about the direction To some extent it does get us out of the box Some people say a lot; some people say a little Therefore, given my concern about the absurdities of the discount window operations with thrifts thrown in and everything else that is happening in that area, I feel it's only logically consistent I am a strong advocate of moving, with proper notice to the banks, toward contemporaneous  -60-    2/2-3/81  reserve accounting but not overselling it, though, because I think you're right that if we oversell it, it could hurt us  Yes And a complication might arise if we're now allowing some of them to report quarterly Could that complicate it?  Okay  SPEAKER(?) Sure  Yes We need time just like the commercial banks  But the Fed did this in the late '60s, right?  Yes, but now it should be a lot easier to go back to it technically because more of the banks are moving toward being on line with their branches in terms of their EDP operations So it should be a lot less painful if we reinstate it now than it would have been with the same--  As I recall the theoretical discussion--some of the staff members may be able to enlighten me on this--one of the factors that keeps us from getting a big payoff for going to CRA is the difference in reserve requirements among different size banks Isn't it right that that is another source? And with the new law, that tends to smooth those differences Maybe that, too, would help reduce the noise that comes with moving to CRA  Isn't that right in terms of the theoretical arguments? Yes, but why doesn't CRA give an immediate linkage?  We assume this is with time for everybody to get their acts together?  Well, what's the alternative policy?  There is that perverse dynamics Are you asking whether, as the interest rate cycle evolves, bankers change the balance requirements? Is that the question? Sure they do  Oh, heavens That varies so much from bank to bank  -81-    2/2-3/81  For a long time, the Fed did a survey of lending [practices] and it supposedly covered that When you read the results of those surveys and talk to corporate lending officers and listen to the policies dictated to them by their senior managements, there's a vast [unintelligible] You learn nothing from the survey What you have to do, actually, is an audit of collected balances--not just what the bank says the corporate customer has to have but what it actually is getting out of the corporate customer I think it would show, as Paul suggested, that when things get tight the bankers try to come down on them harder But as for how much they do, I've never seen any good evidence for all the banks I know how it works in two or three banks that I'm familiar with, but not all of them  I don't really understand the notion that uncertainty is desirable I always thought when we were discussing volatility in long-term rates before that we said uncertainty compounds volatility; it is an economic cost It has to be either that uncertainty is bad or it's good I think it's bad  -84-    2/2-3/81  Well, maybe for a time we don't have to compile the data for the public  -85-    2/2-3/81  That's what you're asking? Is that what they're asking us? Do we want the Act changed?  I'll make a very brief comment We're more optimistic than your staff because we are more optimistic about the results of your preaching By the end of the year we're not outliers on any of these measures that have been tabulated here But we are on the lower end [of the range of forecasts] for both unemployment and inflation because we think there is a chance with the new Administration coming in that we will avert a recession during the first half of the year, contrary to the staff forecast That assumes that the Fed does its job on the monetary aggregates and further that eventually there is a change in spending and tax policy on stream that will have some favorable effects on the economy in real terms And we think that by the end of the year the economy won't be booming but will be going along reasonably well, below the long-term growth path but in a positive vein generating growth of about 3 percent on average in the last two quarters with a reasonable unemployment rate and a lower level of inflation than we have right now That [assumes] that we do what we say we're going to do on the aggregates and that people take seriously the need to reduce spending to keep the deficit under control And we are assuming that they will  -96-    2/2-3/81  They don't know  Even those banks that try to monitor it only have partial information about where the money going in [came from] I would say you are very right to be concerned about our vulnerability for surprises on the M-1B range adjusted, whichever one we choose We have done in depth what you are suggesting with some S&Ls and some banks We asked them what they expect The very limited feedback I get is essentially that the S&Ls are just delighted by how all their projections are being overrun; they are not sure how much of it is coming out of [banks] On their own internal accounts they can track some of the switches from one account to another, but on the net inflow of funds to NOWs they don't know exactly  This assumes what--that $13 or $16 billion out of $40 billion for the whole year is already behind us?  Looking at the numbers, my feeling is that the assumption that in one month we already have half of the full year's shift is where we are most vulnerable  I would come out as follows, which is basically where Fred Schultz came out First of all, I'd speak in terms of the unadjusted targets without all the [unintelligible] and I'd declare that we are going to make a further reduction in the targeted growth rates for both M-1A and M-1B as under alternative I I frankly am not fully convinced that the rest of the adjustments in [alternative I] that the staff suggested tentatively would have to be made are really valid On the face of it, they make it appear that we're not undertaking a reduction And given all the questions about it, I think Nancy's point [is valid] that we would be running the risk of running the economy into the wall I would make the opposite assumption looking at page 7, because I don't understand how the staff comes up with a reduction in the inflation rate and an increase in every interest rate, including the mortgage rate, as we go through the four quarters of the year Going from the present high level of real interest rates, that means that real rates get even higher That's why I think we have to take account of Nancy's concern, but not on the basis of the table on page 7 I'd be more inclined to think we might have better luck than that If we actually do reduce the inflation rate, by the fourth quarter I think the rates on page 7 would be lower than in the first quarter rather than higher based on the notion that interest rates reflect inflation So, to make me feel a little less worried about crashing the economy into the wall, I'd go with what Governor Schultz said about M2 and M3 and use 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent  Finally, with regard to the explanation, you obviously have to go with however you feel most comfortable rationalizing it I would consider one other alternative for explaining just how crucial this estimating procedure is and that would be a very simple form of sensitivity analysis I would run it something like this I'd say that in the first month of the year we had something like a $15 to $20 billion shift into NOWs Our best guess--and I would call it that--is  -126-    2/2-3/81  that this [total] will double over the rest of the year We could be off by a factor of over 100 percent in the growth of NOW accounts very easily In other words, instead of going to $40 billion, they could go to $60 billion or even to $80 billion That would mean that you, the public, and you, the Congress, will be seeing horrible M-1B numbers that could scare the heck out of you but not reflect a real change in what we're trying to do I'd put it that way and then take the best idea that I think has come up around the table--the idea that Presidents Mayo and Corrigan mentioned--that if something horrible like that were to happen, people would recognize that it would bring a big drop in M-1A and a big pop in M-1B and that we'd still on average be tightening If I had to explain it tomorrow, that's the way I'd do it But you have to do what you're comfortable with because you're the one who's going to be under the gun  I'd go with ""B"" and keeping the fed funds rate in a range of 14 to 20 percent  I think the volatility issue will be less of a problem for us if we don't have credit controls again The last time [the funds rate] went from 16 to 6 percent from top to bottom and then from 6 to 21 percent So, from peak to trough to peak, we had a 25-- "
1739,1981-03-31," Sure They want to keep the money in the bank but in the form of an account that has the lower reserve requirements That's why some of them, I'm told, are continuing the ATS approach, which one would have thought would have been outmoded  -26-    3/31/81  So, from the [market] I think what you are hearing here is--  I wanted to ask one question, in the same vein as John's about how some of the technical work was done, on this issue that has been raised by some of the money market gurus about the seasonal adjustment As I understand it, for the first quarter of the year it would not have made a lot of difference in the adjustments you made for December through March, but looking ahead to the next quarter of the year, there might be some problems with the big seasonal adjustment I would like to hear, Steve, how you factored that into your projections and whether we are facing the possibility of any big surprises just due to the fact that we haven't yet been able to develop an appropriate seasonal adjustment  How would you rationalize doing that?  It's on page 8  They're adjusted The unadjusted is on page 8  Do you know what they did? What's causing the confusion, I think, is that the staff switched what they put in parentheses and what they don't--  Well, after listening to all the discussion, I frankly am confused by the indicators we're getting on the real economy I've never been a great believer in trying to fine-tune the economy from one month or one quarter to the next, anyway I come out between ""B"" and ""C,"" where a number of other people have, with John Balles' reservation, however, that we ought to allow the lower end of the funds rate range to be at least somewhat lower than what the rate is today as we're sitting here I'd be inclined to go for a ""B-"" solution with a little more stringency in the control of the aggregates growth and a little more attention to M2 Although Nancy's argument about the unreliability of M2 also concerns me, I feel more nervous about the problems with M-1B than I do about the problems with M2 And looking at the growth rates that the staff has for M2 in these various [alternatives], I'd lean toward trying to come down on M2 a little harder than ""B"" with an in-between policy prescription somewhat like a number of others have expressed, except with the fed funds range having a lower low end that will allow some flexibility in the next few days so that if the futures market for the T-bills, for example, is right, we don't have to be on the phone with each other next week  Paul, the way I hear the sense of the Committee is this Whatever we want to argue about on M-1B, either 5-1/2 or 6 percent, even if we're hitting M-1B at 5-1/2 or 6 percent, the farther off M2 goes, the more we want to adjust I think that is what you're trying to say  You may get a chance  Are we leaving out M-1A altogether?  Yes "
1784,1981-05-06," Paul, this is Bill Ford in Atlanta I, too, want to say, if I'm reading you right, that I think this is a move toward trying to put across that we are deemphasizing adjustments in the interest rate or fine-tuning it That did create some confusion initially, but the message is getting through to so-called Fed watchers not to overinterpret every little tick or movement of the fed funds rate You might consider tacking on a sentence at the end, in light of the comments we just had on confusion about which days we mean, to underline further the fact that we are continuing to stress keeping the aggregates under control and deemphasizing the importance of these particular trigger points  That would be great That would make it clearer that we're moving in that direction and not paying a whole lot of attention to the particular point level of the fed funds rate    5/6/81 "
1804,1981-05-18," In the South we have a mixed picture that reflects some of the things you've heard from other areas The tourist business is great As for the steel industry in our area, surprisingly, after years of disaster around Alabama, US Steel is planning to put up a new plant of all things and employment is rising in that industry In our high-tech belt that is developing around Atlanta and Florida, the high-technology industries are doing great The defense-related industries are doing great In housing and    5/18/81  construction, surprisingly, while activity is not great, on a month- over-month basis it is up and on a year-over-year basis it is up Mortgage loan closings are up; we don't understand why, but apparently they are The agricultural sector would be all right were it not for the fact that everybody else in the country has gotten rain except us apparently, and there is still some concern about the lingering effects of the drought we've had  The big area of worry is in the financial sector where, on the banking side, our banks are doing not just well, they're doing fantastically well Big banks in Atlanta and Florida are up 25, 30, 35 percent year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, anyway you want to measure it But there are areas of stress I've been going out, as Ed has, trying to get closer to the individual industries and some of the particular players to hear how it sounds to them The thrift executives are counting [reserves]; they are all down I've now talked to about 8 or 10 of them individually because I made the mistake of making a public speech about their problems a month before everybody else did, so I've been going around trying to heal the wounds and listen to them What I hear is that they're all measuring their survival literally in terms of how many months of reserves they have left at the current rate They all have it counted out that way and they are in a near panic state, as [the Board] will hear when it meets with its Advisory Committee later today or whenever  Consumer finances are starting to worry me in that we see more and more isolated signs of stress on the consumer balance sheet tipping upward One of the biggest industries in our area is Equifax credit reportings, for example, and they say business is great There is more concern than ever about the credit condition of the consumer The collection companies are doing great, which is bad news in terms of financial stress Another thing that worries me is that we're starting to get some evidence of creative financing; as a concept, I think it is very worrisome and something we're going to have to focus on A lot of financial balloons have been put up in the air where people are disintermediating [from] the normal lending agencies and taking back paper on homes That is done on the basis of very questionable credit standards or none at all And I'm starting to hear more and more people, as I talk to people about housing finance, talk about possible problems in the area of creative financing  Finally, all over the District I'm hearing from small businessmen, especially dealers of US built autos and various other small businesses, that they are actually paying 1 or 2 points over the prime rate They support us tremendously philosophically, but they wish we would lower interest rates today because their survival is in question now I haven't been able to verify how much of that is true, but every time I go out to a meeting or sit down at a rotary club talk or wherever people get me in a corner and I ask them ""Do you believe in what the Fed is doing?"" They say ""Terrific, you're on the right track; hooray for you and Ronald Reagan"" Then if I ask how business is, they say it's terrible They say, for example ""It costs me more to finance a car on the floor of my showroom for one month than I can ever hope to make in profit, and I'm not selling it within a month"" So, my big worry would be the overall stresses and strains in the vulnerable areas on the financial side Overall, I would say the economy in the South is moving sideways We have strong areas that are booming balanced off by these areas of weakness We don't see a  -5-    5/18/81  big surge coming, but we don't think we're in a depression or a recession now at all  That very much summarizes what I'm hearing  I'd just like to ask you a question on the point you just made with regard to an old fashioned crunch I'd be interested in knowing, Tony, how serious you think this business is with the mutual savings banks up there [in your area] I hear that one of them already has a negative net worth and that a number of others are very close to that What do you see as the scene over the next three to six months?  That would mean early winter or late fall of this year  That's the biggest single worry I have heard from people in the thrift industry That they have something on the order of $50 billion in jumbo CDs that are subject to market confidence They are being tiered on the rates right now, similar to what happened to First Pennsylvania and other banks, as general recognition of a problem approaches I would recommend that we track that carefully on the early warning indicator I haven't personally verified that figure, but I'm sure Chuck's staff has good information--I hope you do --on how much jumbo CD money is subject to quick market judgments  I know that a number of them have had their ratings lowered I don't know about the volume, which is what you asked about I remember seeing that a number of them had their ratings lowered on paper, which should lead to the answer being that there has been a reduction in the availability, but I don't know that I hope somebody on the staff does  I just wanted to ask Scott if he could explain something I'm interested in this list of a total of $30 billion in swap lines I'm just curious to know how you judge, for instance, that the Swiss should have a $4 billion line, and Italy, which has more people and I think bigger [unintelligible] should have $3 billion How do you make a decision as to how big the swap line should be?  Is this $30 billion total here a historic high?  I come out pretty much on the consensus of between ""B"" and ""C,"" leaning toward ""C"" I share the concern about the great risk to credibility and the overriding need to meet the targets and to start now rather than to wait until later We've been fortunate that the seasonal adjustments, if I read the staff work right, had the effect of making the more recent aggregate numbers look lower They are below some of the others, which were adjusted upward, is the way I read that  Yes  Depending on how different Fed watchers interpret that, there may be a little vulnerability about some of the downward movement from pretty high numbers to quite low ones, even though in other timeframes they are offset Overall, I would say we'd have to go with a reasonably tight policy so as not to pay later, hoping it is true, as I think Governor Rice said, that we'll get slightly higher rates now and receive as our reward lower rates later in the year than we would otherwise have under ""B"" or ""A"" However, I'm very concerned about the fragility of the marketplace Fred Schultz in his comments mentioned the words ""financial crisis"" and it almost sounded casual to me, Fred I don't mean to insult you but I don't think that's something that we should--  You said there might be a financial crisis and I thought everyone would blanch I blanched, but nobody else did We're obviously not going to put that in the policy record, but I really do hope that we redouble our efforts to watch very carefully for possible problems arising in the most vulnerable sectors, the housing-related sectors, and try every device we can think of to help the thrifts that is not a bail-out, which would [subvert] monetary policy I'm referring to advocating right now federal preemption of the limits on due-on-sale clauses in 17 states, including some of the biggest ones, and things like that That would help them to reliquify themselves better without an outright bail-out, which would simply exacerbate our monetary control problems That's the only thing I would like to add to this process as we head toward this obvious consensus of ""B"" to ""C""--that we have to redouble our efforts in the area of monitoring and doing whatever we can that is not inflationary to help the [institutions that] bear the brunt of it I don't know that there's an answer, Chuck I know what you're going to say, but we had better be searching  No, but if you do the calculations on the amount of money they can recycle, that makes a big difference  Paul, in your statement a moment ago you asked us if what we are trying to say is that we don't care how far down [M-1B growth] goes My reaction to that is that we shouldn't have it open- ended at the bottom I think ""somewhat less"" is the right tone I wouldn't want to see the aggregates collapse again as they did a year ago and be at the floor [of the long-term ranges] once again  -40-    5/18/81  Stick to your guns  Are you going to leave out the fed funds range?  We're going to say ""lower"" not ""somewhat lower""? How far are you going with this?  Or ""slightly""  -55-    5/18/81 "
1839,1981-07-06," Paul, [our forecast is] much closer to the Administration's than the staff's but we're still well below the Administration's [Real GNP growth of] 52 percent [in 1982] does seem optimistic The question I have that builds on your observation about their T-bill rate [assumption] is this Jim, am I reading your charts right in trying to put them together for the corporate AAA bond rate, the T-bill rate, and the implicit price deflator in 1982? If I do the arithmetic correctly, are you really projecting that in 1982 the 3-month Treasury bill rate will be a flat 16 percent in the face of a 7 percent GNP deflator and an 8 percent CPI, yielding real rates of interest of 8 percent on the short end of the yield curve and real rates of interest of 7 to 8 percent on the long end? These seem to me awfully high real rates if I'm reading your charts right  If you lower that, it seems to me then that you can allow for a lower deficit, you can allow for more investment spending, and you can get a little closer to the Administration's real forecast, which is where we come in  Paul, may I just expand briefly on the point you made? Has there ever been a time in our history--I just don't remember seeing a good chart on this--when long-term and short-term [real] rates were both in the 7 to 8 percent range for a period longer than a year, which seems to be implied here? Right now we have high real rates, so it's not impossible We have them temporarily right now I guess one has to believe that anything that is reality has to be believable  Something does not add up  If the rates stay up  Well, I think we have to assume--we better assume it and if we don't assume it, we better pray for it--that what's wrong about the way [the components of the staff's forecast] add up is that they do not believe that real interest rates will come down and that that will be accompanied by a decline in nominal interest rates That's what solves the puzzle That's what we have to hope for  Perhaps what we have to do--I've been thinking more and more about this--is to consider another shift adjustment Now, listen fellows, if we project these kinds of interest rates of 16 percent out for another two years then I think we have to hire those guys to do the Michigan survey every month from now on I haven't had the benefit of [seeing] that but I used to work at that survey center so I know how they operate If I understood you right, you said that 18 percent of the thousand households that have such an account said they were writing 3 or 4 more checks [per month]  Yes, but that could be consistent Let me put it to you as a question Couldn't that be consistent with a much larger percentage of the balances in money market funds being drawn in the form of transactions if the wealthier households are the ones that are doing it? Each check would have to be a minimum of $500, right? Then there is a learning curve I would say that over the next year or two, if you guys believe that these high interest rates will last, that percentage of households and especially the percentage of dollars that get used as checking accounts--assuming Congress doesn't take your advice, Paul, and puts reserve requirements on them--[is going to rise] We are going to see a big shift The shift we're going to be talking about six months or a year from now isn't going to be the shift to NOWs out of checking; it's going to be the shift to checking in the form of MMFs And since normally we think of checking account money as an M1 type number and since MMFs we think of as M2, we may have to think some more about that  I'm saying that if you're assuming it, then you have to do some shift adjusting of this other type  That's the key to it  No And what's more, with regard to velocity and how much GNP can be supported, M-1B is what you gave us for the specification You did not give us [a specification] for M2 or demand that we respond [on the basis of] M2 It might be, if indeed the public meets more of its needs for money with these tricky MMFs used as checking accounts, especially where big dollars are involved, that lower money growth can hold up more GNP So, yes, we get more velocity; and it may be believable if this structural change that the Michigan survey talks about is happening  It's a distributed lag effect  The tax cut will pay for that union settlement  -27-    7/6-7/81  Yes, that's what I mean  It raises the M2 and M3 and bank credit ranges  On the substantive issues of where policy should go, I agree with your opening statement and with the consensus that's developing that, given that there are risks on both sides, we have to run the risk of holding tight  -55-    7/6-7/81  The holding tight  Next, with due regard for Nancy's and other people's concern about the thrifts, I very deeply share that concern, but I think we can lose with the thrifts either way in that there's a lesser risk of playing to win now in the next few months than by letting their equity run down longer and facing the same problem a year from now with less equity when that turnaround comes, as Fred so nicely put it Substantively, my thinking goes from that point That says then, concerning the '81 targets, to leave the ranges where they are There are two approaches the one Fred suggested or leaving the ranges where they are and explaining that we're willing to accept being at the lower end or even a little below [on M-1B] I'd put more stress on getting M2 within the top of the target, if we possibly can, even though the staff forecast suggests it will be a hard thing to do without blowing interest rates through the roof But I just am skeptical of that view, or I should say more optimistic about the outlook for interest rates than they show in their forecast We're praying for a better interest rate forecast than the one they have If theirs is right, we're in big trouble with the consensus that we're developing here  Concerning the 1982 targets, like a number of previous speakers, I think we need an alternative to the ones shown Basically, it's alternative II with a modification on the M2 target I'd like to see M2 kept where it is because if we set an M2 target with a cap of 9-1/2 percent, that would be the highest rate we've had at any time--if my table here is correct--since July of 1977 And I'm worried that even though there are technical reasons for seeing M2 as being somewhat more expansive than previously, the markets keep records of this stuff and if they see us moving M2 to the highest range we've set in four years, that could hurt our credibility and exacerbate the problem of getting within the targets So, I'd say let's go for alternative II on the M-1B range, but cut M2 down to the present range of 6 to 9 percent [despite] the grounds that it's hard to cut it given the structural changes that Steve and the staff have pointed out to us Concerning the short run--well, we don't need to talk about the next quarter yet since you want to do that after lunch The only other thing I'd say is that, Frank, you're not completely alone in the woods I have developed a touch of Morrismania and I'd say we should move in the direction of considering dropping M1-A immediately I'd go at least that far with Frank  And step two toward Morrismania is at least to restate our concerns about the very substantial structural problems with M-1B Deemphasizing M-1B a bit in our statements would be the way I'd lean toward Mr Morris's position on which aggregates to emphasize  I come out close to ""C"" with the fed funds range of ""B,"" as Roger has just said, or better yet widening the band further or certainly not narrowing it because fed funds today I'm told are trading at 19 percent A couple of people have suggested that we put the cap at 20 percent; were that to lead the Desk under any circumstances to start injecting funds after we walk out of here, that would undermine the whole philosophy or strategy that you laid out at the beginning of the meeting So, I think we either have to widen the fed funds range or for sure not lower its upper end to avoid giving any signals in the next few days of loosening policy significantly I am concerned about the target base drift question, which only one person raised--about where all of this leaves us at the end of the year, depending on where we come out in the range, and how we adjust to that I don't have the answer, but I want to share the expression of concern--I think it was Willis who put it on the table--that we should think ahead as to where this short-run decision we're making today leaves us at the end of the year in terms of bringing the aggregates in line with the longer-range objectives that you have to talk about on the 21st of July I just need more information from the staff as to whether we face a base drift problem that is the reverse of the usual drift up If I understood Willis right, he was implying that if growth comes in low and we have trouble getting M-1B up into the range, we might have a reverse base drift problem I don't know about that I'd like to hear more So, put me down for a little less tight than ""C,"" keeping the fed funds range about centered on where it is now, 19 percent, and either loosening that up or certainly not lowering the top  It's 16 to 22 percent now  Yes, $15 billion seems consistent with that; I'm not exactly sure  It's over 9 percent now  Paul, you read us just a small part of the suggested language; I take it there's a lot more on both sides of it that doesn't leave the impression, as that one paragraph does, that this whole decision--even though it's the most conservative choice-- sounds expansive You have 7 percent--  It's a helluva formula! "
1905,1981-10-05," We're getting the same picture In terms of specifics, the optimistic points I found are the high-tech companies in the Southeast, such as and so on, which I visited in the last few weeks They are all super    10/5-6/81  optimistic about the way things are going Their earnings are growing in the 20 to 30 percent range or higher The technical service industries of that type are doing very well The weaknesses that we find are in the areas that one would expect We're seeing more and more classified loans to developers We also have in our section of the country--in Atlanta, for example--a very high office vacancy rate that is beginning to approach the problems we had in the mid-1970s in terms of percent of vacant floor space and things like that So, we're finding significant signs of weakness both in commercial and residential construction and in the lending institutions other than banks, ie the thrifts I find these days that just about every S&L executive carries around in his pocket a schedule of weeks to go or months to go in terms of how long the S&L's equity will last based on its current earnings There's a lot of worry in that industry The tourist industry in southeast Florida is way off The state had its slowest [tourist] season in the last ten years in the southern part of Florida and that also affected related industries The lumber industry, which is big in our area, is also in dire straits because of the housing situation; the carpet industry in Georgia, where we have the capital of the world's carpet business, is beginning to come under some stress Putting all of this together, my feeling is that overall we have a mixed picture The economy is moving sideways Some of the industries are prospering and the ones we would expect to be hurt are being hurt  Building on the remarks that a number of people have made, including what you just said, I would come down on alternative B Our feeling in Atlanta, in looking at behavior of the aggregates, is that the alleged undershoot on M-1B is probably overrated as a worry We feel that some adjustment should be made for the money market funds Even if we put it at a tiny fraction of the money market funds, we would say that M-1B has been somewhat stronger than it appears in the adjusted figures So I'm not too concerned about the undershoot, although the direction of the shift would be toward getting us back into the range Looking at the alternatives that the staff has prepared, the one that looks most reasonable to me is something like ""B"" with a side constraint of some sort on M2 so that we stay around the upper end of M2 while we are at it The fed funds range, if we are going to continue with the process, is sort of centered on where the fed funds rate has been in the last day or two, so that doesn't look bad to me either So, I'd pretty much go with the targets of alternative B  Yes, but we have had a number of days in the last two weeks when it has been down around 13 percent, haven't we?  All I'm saying is Let's not lock ourselves in so tightly Let's go in with something like the alternative B range  We're not cutting them in half, Henry The funds rate never averaged over what, 20 percent?  -52-    10/5-6/81 "
1931,1981-11-17," In looking at your calculations of the effects that the different alternatives we're considering would have on rates, I noticed that you're projecting that from today until our next meeting in December, which is a period of 5 weeks I believe--and coming into this meeting I thought Peter said that the fed funds rate is running a little over 13 percent right now--  So, you're saying that were we to choose to expand M1-B over the next 5 weeks at a rate under 9 percent, we could have a 100 basis point drop per week in the fed funds rate potentially That is the worst we could have, is that right?    11/17/81  Is that right?  Well, that did happen for a while As I recall, when we put on credit controls over a year ago, we did have the rate dropping 100 basis points a week  I'm wondering what is in your modeling That was a very unusual period If we were trying to achieve some step-up in M1-B to get back to our announced targets for this year, I'd be surprised, in the absence of credit controls, if we were to get anything like the kind of precipitous drop in rates that we had under credit control Wouldn't you? How does your model generate this?  Do you mean, in other words, that this is an adjusted number [from what the] model--?  On the credibility question that you mentioned, Peter, are you concerned also about our credibility in terms of the aggregates and whether or not we're trying to keep reasonable the [deviations from] the long-term paths we've set? Isn't that also a credibility problem in addition to the worry about what happens if the rates drop?  In making your judgments, then, how do you judge one kind of credibility against the other?  We had some builders circling the statue in front of the Atlanta Fed and they were thinking about hanging Mr Volcker in effigy Their argument was What are you guys doing? You're not taking care of things You ought to stop worrying about these rates and let them come down We are dying    11/17/81  In that connection, I noticed in the Greenbook that your housing forecast for the fourth quarter, Jim, shows 870,000 starts on average That must mean there's a bottom below that, which we're going to face either this month or next month, where housing starts are going to be reported at under 800,000 units Is that what you [expect]?  It has to be If you have an average of 870,000 and you have 918,000 for the first month, where is the bottom? I'm worried They came circling our statue of the eagle when starts were 900,000 What are they going to--?  I have it in a chart  If you took the '79 base that [Mr Winn] mentioned and [drew] a cone out from '79--in other words, if there were no base drift--the growth of M1-B that we've had would put us inside the range, just below the middle according to my chart  I had Frank down for ""A"" Are you saying you agree with Frank?  I'm concerned about the appearance of setting a goal Maybe I have a problem with understanding the philosophy of these statements even after hearing them discussed so often As I understand it, the philosophy when we set a target is that it is a target and we may not always achieve it We have a problem now because we've been underachieving both the short-run and the long-run targets on one of the things we look at, M1-B Were we to put out a directive that appears to have set tighter targets as we're facing the prospect of what may be a very serious recession, starting from a disastrously low level of economic activity in major industries such as housing and autos, we could scare the devil out of everybody by having people perceive that we're trying to be very tight So, the concern and all the talk about how to couch this is very important I'd be inclined to err on the side of staying with the target that we may not achieve, the one we had last time, and not narrowing the funds band again but allowing it to have a little more leeway on the down side I'd go with something more like Emmett Rice's prescription of a  -40-    11/17/81  ""B+"" or ""A-"" type prescription, with a borrowing assumption of perhaps a quarter billion dollars or somewhere in that range and a wide funds rate range If I counted right, 4 or 5 times earlier this year we set a 6-point range Why not set a 6-point range of 9 to 15 percent, sort of centered on where we are now and allow ourselves a little more leeway?  You're right There's only a difference of $2 billion in M1-B on ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""C"" It's less than the amount of change we've had on the last two Fridays  So, the whole question is what the market [will think] If they think we're tightening--  And that we wouldn't be surprised  Unless you lower the discount rate by about 3 or 4 percentage points  It depends on what [the Reserve Banks] recommend to [the Board]  The appearance matter that Nancy mentioned is the one that keeps coming up in my mind If this reads that we tightened the bands for the aggregates and we did not lower [the funds rate range]--we're at 12 to 17 percent now and you say we're going to go to 11-1/2 percent or stay at 12 percent, as a number of people have recommended--it's going to come off that the economy is crashing down and the Fed is cheering it on, possibly Possibly  The range is 12 to 17 percent and if you're saying we are not even going to lower the range--  Because then it will be perceived that in the last three meetings we've closed in on interest rate management We would have gone from a 6-point spread to a 4-point spread and the charge will raised that we're managing interest rates  Is that the end of it, Paul?  I don't think we should do this now With a range of 6, then 5, and then 4 points, we're going to be charged with coming every time closer and closer to managing interest rates Whether or not they perceive it correctly, that's what is going to be said  If that's what you want  SPEAKER(?) Fred, did you hear that?  Let's try it and see what happens!  We can do a definition shift  Instead of base drift, we're going to use definition shift  We're becoming predictable  The market can adjust it to that point, so long as we stay consistent  Yes, Henry, but we'll send you a recommendation on the discount rate "
1958,1981-12-21," There is a revision that was passed out Did you see this here?  On some of the points you have mentioned, in our end of the so-called Sun Belt things are not really all that sunny Specifically, for example, on Nancy's point about the pre-sales in the retail area, we are definitely seeing a whole lot of that We have 45 board members in our District and a number of them are retailers; they have been telling us that their sales are flat to down in real terms They may have a nominal increase in dollar sales, but a lot of that is coming on white sales that were taking place in December and November instead of in January and later So, they are a little depressed about that The tenants in the large Atlanta malls are concerned about their inventories being high and are having to do heavy promotions to keep their sales up On the employment side, we are seeing some rather heavy layoffs in the more industrialized areas of our District, particularly in the housing-related carpet industry We produce half the carpets in the United States in northern Georgia and they have experienced a 50 percent drop in production in the last few months So, we are seeing big problems there Some of our major  -13-    12/21-22/81  employers, like Fruehof in Florida and even Excel in Orlando and the Ford glass plant in Nashville, are all laying off big chunks of their labor force In the service industries, which someone else asked about, we are finding some problems Air Florida, one of the more robust regional airlines, has had a very heavy cutback on its employment, as some of you may have noticed in the newspapers So, we are seeing pretty much across the board in both the service and the manufacturing industries that the recession is deepening throughout our area In some of the [most depressed] parts, in Alabama in the industrialized areas, we have unemployment rates approaching 12 to 13 percent They are a little [higher] than the northern version in Detroit and that area So, we are seeing the recession come down in the Southeast pretty heavily  That eats up another part of the $33 billion you are talking about You have $5 billion going for payroll taxes?  The question is how much does bracket creep do?  $15 billion? So it uses up a little more than half? In other words, is there a real reduction in the effective tax rates counting everything?  That is half of it  -32-    12/21-22/81  Before I make my comments, I'd say on that last point that I have heard, but I haven't seen evidence, that a lot of smaller businesses tend to use these money market funds as a demand account That reinforces Tony's point, I would think I don't know how prevalent that is but certainly in the partnership areas a number of professionals tell me that they just use their Merrill Lynch account for all the bills of over $500 that they have to pay  Yes, maybe they are putting in the--  Well, that then leads into another suggestion I have but first, with regard to M1-B, we feel we can be comfortable with the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent tentative target we announced or with 2-1/2 to 5 percent, either one I don't think the 1/2 point makes a big difference I have some sympathy with what Si said, certainly, of not making the range too much wider Dropping the NOW account adjustment seems to make lots of sense So, we would say Let's go from the end of year [and use] the last quarterly average as the base, as we normally do and as I think is recommended in the Bluebook, and go with perhaps the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range But we are very concerned about the nature of the innovations that will be coming along, some of which we hope will be at least partly visible by the time of the next meeting Nancy just mentioned that she thought we ought to do some more research on some of these things such as the  -37-    12/21-22/81  MMFs I would suggest that we gear up either at the Washington level and/or at some of the Reserve Banks to get on top of the IRA developments, because the potential there is tremendous If you take the number of American households and even if you assume that only 10 percent of them go into a $2,000 IRA, it comes to something on the order of just under $15 billion that could be moved around And if you assume it is 20 percent or--  Yes Okay, there you go  Right, [that needs to be done] early on I would say even before that if there is any way to find out intentions--that might be too romantic for research--it would be interesting to find out not just how many households but obviously the source [of the funds] If people shift out of NOWs, obviously that is one thing; if they shift among M-2 type assets, then it is less scary I'd be curious to know whether people are just going to take a large percentage of the funds out of their NOW accounts or whether they will shift out of other M2 assets or whether the funds will come from things outside of M2, all of which have very different implications I'd just encourage everybody, especially our Washington leadership, to look at the early returns on IRAs  While we are at it, if we could find out anything about these sweep accounts, they, too, as a financial innovation have tremendous potential for bombing us on M1-B So we should take a look at whether among some of the major institutions there really will be an outbreak of virulent competition in that area, which could further put us in the box of having undershoots on the M1-B target and possibly overshoots on M2 What concerns me most is the fact that all year long--while Jerry's calculation was a very elegant one and speaks well for how we actually came out on M1-B--I've had the feeling that we were undershooting one target and overshooting the other And for the next year we ought to try to figure out a way, if we can, to get out of that box so that we are not always damned on the one side for being too tight and damned on the other side for being too loose  Well, if the research supports it and if the early returns on IRAs give any evidence that we should expect M2 to get looser and wider, I'm leaning to the view that we ought to consider just biting the bullet and raising the upper end of that target while  -38-    12/21-22/81  doing other things to indicate that it is consistent with a lower or tighter target on M1-B For example, we might choose a base that involves a little less drift--take the year-end M1-B figure if it happens to be lower than the quarterly average Or if there is some other way we could start from a lower point, keep it down at 5-1/2 percent and do something which in combination says we are anticipating that M1-B already is going to be overshooting, so we are tightening up in that area and we think financial innovations really are going to make M2 behave in a way that suggests we can anticipate a higher upper end if the research supports it That is why I hope we [won't] wait until--  We can't know, but don't you think we can learn a little about IRAs because by the middle of February we will--  Then maybe we have to go to Mr Morris' idea that we look at some other things, although my thrust in the research would probably be different than his I'd say, if we are going to reexamine what we shoot for, that we ought to pull out the monetary base and total reserves as possibilities, along with whatever [measures] he has in mind, although those two present difficulties that everybody here has commented on at one time or another Where we are presently structured, as I see it, is that we are making ourselves subject to the same problems we had this year And I would be inclined not to give up so easily, Paul, on being able to find out something about the trend in financial innovation You may well end up being right, but I would want to come down on the research to see if we can find out something about IRAs and sweep accounts at least  I don't know about the public sector, but our own benefits people are putting it into our plan to make it easy, in line with the comment that Jerry made  SPEAKER(?) Yes, we are proposing to do that  It may be that if all other government agencies are going to do that, we might have a big chunk [of employers doing that] I don't know  Maybe we ought to do a little survey of major employers or something like that  -39-    12/21-22/81  Yes  Yes, I'm sorry I just hope you are not right about it, Paul; you might well be right But I would hate to give up so easily on saying we can't foresee innovation in the financial markets  You're saying make the fed funds range 10 to 15 percent, Tony?  I want everybody to know that I am the one who first said that I don't think anybody here is wise enough to determine interest rates except Solomon! I, too, tend to agree with him This is getting to be easy except that I'd like to reinforce one point he made and that relates to the fed funds rate range If I read the Greenbook forecast correctly, the staff is saying that in the first quarter of next year we're going to have a negative GNP of 22 percent, a GNP deflator of under 7 percent, and unemployment approaching 9 percent And with a GNP deflator that low, other price indexes are probably going to be down We're talking about real interest rates on average in those three alternatives of 5 percent on ""A,"" 6 percent on ""B,"" and 7 percent on ""C"" I think we should at least allow the possibility of seeing [real] interest rates get into the single digit range at the nadir of this deep recession So, I'd argue for ""B"" with a wider fed funds range, maybe going from [a lower limit of] 9 percent and centering on the present rate, which I understand is just over 12 percent  I didn't hear that Could somebody repeat it?  Yes  That's right  That is exactly what was going through my mind Suddenly, it becomes our long-term forecast  Nobody can spot something he wishes he never said? "
1986,1982-02-01," It has a lot to do with the FDR television show It has been on every channel and everybody is reading about it or looking at it every night  May I ask what the staff does know on that subject? I have the same feeling impressionistically--that there are two or three of the major airlines, a substantial number of thrifts, Chrysler,--  SPEAKER(?) International Harvester  Yes, at least two of the major farm machinery manufacturers So right there, just based on impressions, I can come up with over a half dozen big corporations But has anyone looked at the so-called raw z-scores, the predictors of bankruptcy, as to whether the actual number of firms that in all probability are close to bankruptcy is rising sharply or--  Would that be interesting do you think, Mike?  May I ask if, as I take it, this chart show is correlated with the projections in the Bluebook? It is There's something very interesting in the chart of long-range projections that I think is wonderful, but I don't understand how it can happen That is, on strategy 2 you have the fastest money growth associated with the lowest interest rates and the highest inflation How did that work out? Do you see what I mean? On the strategy 2 you have the highest inflation with the highest money growth, which I would expect But then you also somehow get the lowest interest rates out of it; that's the part that puzzles me How would you explain that?  Well, if I may, again on the same question that the rest are asking If you do calculations on trends in real rates and compare them under the three strategies--strategy 1 being the one that I assume starts with 4 percent growth--the way it seems to work out is that by 1984 under strategy 3, which is really tight money, the real rate of interest is 86 percent versus 31 percent under the most expansionary monetary policy And if you give any credence at all to the expectations notion, it would seem to me that after 3 years in a row of tight money and dramatic reductions in inflation down to 3 percent, the real rate of interest would be smaller under that strategy than the others--certainly not 3 times as high as it is under strategy 2 by 1984  In other words, if instead of just the T-bill rates shown here you also had shown, say, rates on 5- or 10-year notes or bonds, the apparent inconsistency there would be less apparent That is, you could have the [lowest] long-term rates under the tightest monetary policy  Does your model put out a long-term rate or a 5- or 10-year rate?  As you requested, we did a survey And if it's bad to contribute, then we're guilty, because our growth in the last month has been distinctly above the [national] average both in demand deposits and other checkable deposits We've had a particularly strong kick in terms of percentage growth in NOW accounts, the area that you expressed an interest in There was virtually no change in ATS-type accounts I asked my staff to take a sample of the banks around the District that were contributing particularly to this growth above the trend growth for the whole nation and, like the others who commented, we could not find any clear, simple, new explanation The facts we came up with were that virtually all of it was in existing accounts--to address the possibility that you raised, Frank We did not see any surge in the number of new NOW account openings; growth was in existing accounts    2/1-2/82  We didn't pick that up There's a drift higher Right now in our District there's very heavy competition among [financial institutions] on pricing of all types of deposits, particularly the IRAs And the terms and conditions for IRAs seem to be getting more and more competitive from the consumer standpoint I didn't check any trend on NOWs, but I haven't noticed it I just don't know So, we didn't get any strong indication of any surge in new NOW account openings It's just the existing accounts that are building up  As far as the speculation as to why, a couple of bankers said that they think people are holding off, waiting to see what develops in IRAs, and are just parking money in these NOW accounts until they figure out the best IRA deal, at which point they will switch to an IRA The IRA deals are still being unveiled in our District Another explanation is the simple old one that people are just saving more and spending less It seems consistent with other information we have There's nothing really exciting, though, on the demand deposit side; we don't see anything particularly interesting there We looked at it and considered it normal corporate window-dressing during this year- end period; nobody believes it's an unusual amount of corporate window-dressing  When the rates rise  When they drop, you would expect them to converge, wouldn't you, because of this other phenomenon?  Would you also shift to the lower end of the M2 band Henry, to at least be consistent between M1 and M2? I'm serious I'm not kidding  How can you rationalize shifting M1 up from the actuals to the bottom of the band unless you also do the same thing by shifting [M2] on some end of the band?  When my turn comes up, I'll--  I have some sympathy with Fred's view, too, given all that has been discussed, that we should stay basically with the longer-run targets that we already set but [I would] pay a lot more attention to trying to get back into the ranges on both if we can With regard to base drift, I'm very concerned about how this discussion is going Look at the history of what we've done and think back to last year's big debate about what to do about base drift It has been suggested, if I understand Henry right, that we not only change the way we handle base drift from last year by going to the lower end of the M1 band instead of the actual [outcome] but that on M2 we do yet another thing My feeling is that the market people will take this to say that we're just fooling around so much that we're purposely trying to manipulate the game so that it will come out the way we want it If we go with the established procedure, as I understand it, of not drifting the base a new way but the way it has been drifting--  Yes, so? If we stayed with it on M2, it probably would solve the problem of having to adjust the M2 band upward because we would be starting way up there and will in effect have incorporated    2/1-2/82 -41-  some of the past problems We'd be able to project the existing band off the higher [base] The real problem comes on M1 I think we will address that tomorrow morning when we get around to the question of how fast we will try to get back into the band That's the place to discuss that problem So, I would say, for the sake of the appearance of consistency certainly and to avoid the appearance of purposely manipulating the base drift issue, let's stick with the ranges that were already announced and then concentrate tomorrow on trying to get down to the question of how hard we should try to adjust to what has happened  What base would you go for?  Of what?  I thought you were going to do alternatives I and II  And that puts you between ""B"" and ""A,"" not between ""B"" and ""C""  I'm reasonably close to where you are, if I understand you correctly--that is, ""B"" with a slight tilt to ""A,"" which would say--  I understood it to be the same  I would lean a bit toward the tighter end of what you're describing by saying that we ought to assume $15 billion on borrowing, especially given that the funds rate today, as it was yesterday, is coming in close to the upper end of this band and we ought to continue with the common sense notion of bracketing the funds range around where it is when we leave this room and allowing some leeway on the upper end of that range I know that's not going to be real--  Alternative A shows 3 percentage points [of leeway both above and below the midpoint of the range]; the others show 2 points If you are saying that you want to peg the fed funds and not hit 16--  I can understand on an intra-day basis and it has been 16 percent or right--  -66-    2/1-2/82  Still, I'd go along with ""B"" and the zero growth rate for M1 and something like the [alternative B] M2 figure, but I'd want to give ourselves a little room to breathe on where the funds rate goes  All right I think that's a great idea  We say we're shooting for zero growth in M1 and no rate restrictions  That's one way it would show up, but I would  -79-    2/1-2/82  That's not what he's talking about  He said--I saw him--that he is going to be consulting with you very shortly  Yes, on the Today show, I think it was  That is right  They would say it is a one-way deal and we are faking it It comes across as being dishonest  Well, of the two approaches you have described, I would very strongly prefer the one you described when you started talking a few minutes ago of implicitly leaving the base unchanged the way we have been doing and taking the hit on the [range] Then, if we need to come back, I'd overtly state what we are doing, which is that we have decided for good and sufficient reasons to raise the band I'd be up front with [it]  Well, I would say change the band We would be doing the same thing either way It is just a question of which is--  It is not going to do much for our credibility  Why not drop [those two targets]? "
2013,1982-03-29," Yes, as I understand it, this Arima statistical adaptation method makes no effort whatsoever to consider an institutional change, like a fundamental change in the tax law, that impacts during this particular period we're talking about They're just attempting to take the knowledge from past cycles and apply that based on--  In that connection, Peter, we now have five months worth of data on the deficit and so far it is running about $2 billion behind last year's deficit, is that right?  And yet all of the revisions to the forecast suggest that this fiscal year's deficits will be higher and higher while [actual results are] running behind Obviously, with almost half the [fiscal] year gone, somebody is programming either a colossal explosion of spending or a colossal reduction of tax receipts or some combination of the two What is your technique?  If he says $108 billion and so far we're running $2 billion behind a $58 billion annual rate, that would mean a $50 billion swing in the deficit in the last 7 months of the year It would add approximately $7 to $8 billion per month of extra deficit from now on to average that, is that right?  Well, if you go from $58 billion to $108 billion, that's $50 billion and there are only 7 months left to create the extra deficit, right?  $40 billion? The end of [the year] is when it just blows--  SPEAKER(?) Well, it's partly seasonal, though  Surplus?  I was just looking for something to be hopeful about, but you're making me feel depressed  Yes, this question came up, not just from the usual monetarists but from a variety of sources when we had a huge group of people at our Atlanta conference A number of them, like Larry Klein, were very sympathetic to us But it was remarkable how many--not just the standard old line monetarists--had questions about this The way it came out from some of them was this If you say there will be wider variations in interest rates, should you try to control the [monetary growth] path in some way to take some of the fluctuation out? Implicit in that statement is the hidden assumption that we're now successfully operating counter-cyclically in fine- tuning the economy, and they question whether that can be so I guess the question is Do you really feel that you're working against the swings in rates so that if we somehow had smoothed the [monetary growth] path it would have produced more violent fluctuations in interest rates than we've seen?  I pass  Well, in terms of our view of the staff outlook, we always compare the staff's forecast to a variety of external forecasts, including DRI, Townsend Greenspan, Chase Econometrics, Citibank, and so forth I am impressed by the fact that the staff forecast for the next 2 or 3 quarters is by far the most pessimistic of any of the forecasting services That doesn't necessarily say our staff is wrong, since the record of the forecasting services isn't that great either in terms of the ability to project where the economy is going or what inflation is going to do But looking at our District, given work we've done with local groups, we do share some of the pessimism that has been voiced, particularly with regard to the agricultural sector We're having a large problem in our agricultural areas as well as in our forest-related industries; and in the carpet area, we're having a near economic disaster since we produce a third of the world's carpets and they are laying off people by the thousands in that [industry] in northern Georgia So, we now have four of our six states with more unemployment than the national average, even though we're supposed to be the Sun Belt  Yes, that's what they say, in northern Georgia  And it's very depressed, just as a reflection of the trends in housing And then we have the heavy industry over in Alabama and in Tennessee, which we're discovering is more industrialized than the rest of America I always thought of it as a rural state until I started traveling around it We have numerous counties throughout the States of Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi that have unemployment rates of around 20 percent, which you don't read about in the newspapers So, there is a lot of pessimism in rural areas and in those specific industries, and certain aspects of agriculture and the housing-related industries are in deep trouble On the other hand, our service industries and our high-tech industries are doing very well in Florida in an emerging Technology Belt that we have down there  Overall, my view is that there's not a feeling of depression in our area as some of you seem to be reporting We tend still to have some guarded [optimism] Or rather, I like the way Ed Boehne put it In a range from uncertainty to pessimism, our business people are  -23-    3/29-30/82  more on the uncertainty end of it And except in the industries that really are getting clobbered, including the thrifts, the home builders, the forest industry, and farming, people are still reasonably persuaded that the economy will turn around and pick up in the next few months as this staff forecast has it People aren't lining up to jump off buildings or bridges in our District That would be my summary of it  Yes, it's in the fourth quarter  Yes, I'd agree with that It's farther out, in the fourth quarter, that they have the lowest GNP, fairly high unemployment, and low inflation For the year they are a little more pessimistic  The Bluebook only shows it through the fourth quarter of 1982  I come out for the ""B"" solution that a number of people have expressed We also have gone through this exercise that was just mentioned of making some allowance for a small fraction of the money market funds being transaction oriented and other adjustments like that And it seems to indicate, if you give any credence at all to that, that we are pumping in enough money to keep the economy going I hope the staff is right with all the Arima stuff that if and when we see this pop in the numbers early in April it will be corrected before we get back here at the end of May Well, I don't know if you said May and June Did I hear you right that you would anticipate if we did get a big problem in early April that it would be [unwound]?  -40-    3/29-30/82  That's right; so we won't know The timing is bad I certainly hope you guys are right about that coming down In the meantime, I would be willing to take the risk of going as high as ""B"" or just a little below ""B"" in the hope that you're right even though we are going to be in a very uneasy position the next time we meet since we may have seen the high numbers you are worried about without having time to have seen whether or not it tails off I think some caution is in order and, therefore, I'd avoid going toward ""A"" so that, with this neat little table you've cooked up on the bottom of page 10 [of the Bluebook], we leave ourselves some room to breathe in case you're wrong about that That's why I'd say ""B"" would be a good place to be, with a borrowing assumption somewhere near where we are now, around $14 or maybe $13 billion; you suggested $1-1/4 billion In sum, I believe alternative B and somewhere in the $1-1/4 to $14 billion area [on the borrowing assumption] would be reasonable  I'd go with the borrowing assumption associated with ""B"" rather than lightening up on it as Tony suggested The staff suggested $1-1/4 billion, as I read the Bluebook, and currently I'm told it is at $14 billion Is that right?  The objective, yes So, I'd stay somewhere around what is in alternative B rather than lightening up on the borrowing That's because, if we're worried about a big explosion in early April and if that were accompanied by an explosion of borrowing, I'd say we ought to hustle back toward the path  Yes, but Chuck--  I like the combination that you cooked up here, Paul, if I understand it correctly You are saying to the Desk, as I would interpret it, to anticipate unusual growth in M1 and don't get excited about it unless both M1 and M2 get completely blown away, with a very high M2 growth rate and an M1 that was going over the estimate that's built in The Committee would be saying, as I understand you, start to close in on the path and come back to the path fairly rapidly only under those conditions--if both M1 and M2 were being blown away On the other hand, also resist, if it turns out that the professors and Arima are right, and you find that early in April the money supply is fading away on us Don't necessarily just sit by with that either and let us get a collapse  You wouldn't mind?  And do you go for this widening of the funds rate band to 11 to 16 percent?  Well, you said $11 or $12 billion Why don't we put it at $12 billion and everybody might be happy?  Let's not hold our breath waiting for that!  Make a proposal, Mr Chairman  Well, why don't you name one and let's vote on it? "
2036,1982-05-18," I was thinking the same thing, Paul  Has the Treasury asked us to do anything specifically?  Are the positions you're talking about mainly in longer maturities?  You don't know?  I'm just trying to think through, Paul, how it could foul up our operations in New York One obvious channel would be if the losses hit the reputable dealers to the point where it imperils their capital position That would obviously be of great concern to us  They're in the middle of an election campaign, are they not?  And in Mexico, as I recall the history of that country, traditionally if there is a change in such a period, there is an outflow of investments which come back after the new president gets in Isn't that the way it usually works?  Yes, the timing is terrible This guy is barnstorming all over the country telling the people the great things he's going to do for them and the question is whether he can [carry out] an austerity campaign under those conditions that satisfies them  Well, moving down the East Coast, we feel fairly gloomy, as Ed does We now have in our District, in the supposed Sun Belt area, raw unemployment rates that exceed the national average, which is very unusual for us as you may know That's weighted for the fact that our two most vigorous states, Georgia and Florida, especially Florida, do have [relatively large] populations If you weighted it by the population, they would still look reasonably good If you just take our six states, we now have an unemployment rate that averages just under 10 percent And that's due to the fact that we have a southern version of Detroit going for us over in Alabama for one thing and the--  In Birmingham, for example, we are down to one US Steel blast furnace in operation and there's a lot of talk that it may be shut down in June That would create another problem for us in that area and [contribute to the process of] deindustrialization in Birmingham Other things that had been sustaining our regional economy are also beginning to waiver Most particularly, we had the energy boom going for us over in Louisiana--a lot of gas well drilling and so on--and there has been a precipitous decline in that kind of activity We've had heavy layoffs in oil field drilling operations and related activities there Most discouraging is the fact that even in our high-tech belt, which is emerging around Atlanta and in Florida, we've had companies such as Scientific Atlanta laying off people for the first time in anybody's memory there Companies that we think of as having a regular 25 percent increase in profits year after year are starting to feel the pinch So, things are looking  -14-    5/18/82  pretty serious around the southeastern states in our District The only thing that seems to be encouraging in our area is the fact that we have the World's Fair going on, which is attracting a lot of people to Eastern Tennessee and compensating somewhat for the manufacturing weaknesses in that state  On the subject of housing finance that you raised, Chuck, while I do think the investment aspect of buying a house is fading somewhat, there's a very strong feeling--I do know a lot of the builders in our area and talk to them regularly, and thrift executives as well--around Atlanta and around the Florida Keys that they are just waiting to get out there Builders are chomping at the bit We've had steady increases in permits and housing starts in a number of our major metropolitan areas, although they are still at depressed levels And I would say our residential markets will come back, though perhaps not with the same vigor as when housing used to be a sure-fire investment as well as a place to live We have a lot of pent-up demand for housing in Atlanta itself due to some unusual developments there like Georgia-Pacific crossing out ""Pacific"" and coming back to Georgia We have a pretty good [housing] market So, we have some encouragement from that side  We have another big minus force and that is that farmers in the Southeast are getting clobbered credit-wise--almost like Mexico, you know The story is that they are overextended on their debt We're watching the markets for land very closely, trying to detect signals of any kind of collapse in land prices and we're not seeing it because it seems as if the lenders just don't want to liquidate people unless they absolutely have to So, we're really not seeing a lot of turnover of property, but we are hearing from a lot of bankers in rural areas that they are not happy about their farm loan portfolios in terms of credit quality And that just reflects the fact that our farmers are having a tough time throughout the District Overall, I'd say that the bloom is off the Sunshine states in our area, and that except for a few areas of brightness we're feeling the recession pretty heavily And there is a lot of worry and concern among business lenders in our District  I come out right about where you do, Mr Chairman I like ""B"" I'd like to see the federal funds rate range widened somewhat I would not be concerned, as Lyle is, if rates were to drop now I don't see why rates can't drop, with the high level of real interest rates that we're currently suffering under, toward a single- digit range That ought to come sooner or later, so I'd want to widen the band, certainly on the lower end And given the uncertainty that we're facing presently with the Drysdale situation, I'd perhaps just widen the band on both ends I always like to do that And a borrowing assumption of $800 million to $1 billion, or somewhere in there, sounds reasonable to me I am concerned that we not go too far  -34-    5/18/82  beyond ""B"" toward ""A"" because we don't yet know what will happen as we get into the second half of the year, and I wouldn't want us to give up all our leeway as we look ahead to the second half of the year My feeling is that we should go generally for ""B"" with a somewhat lower initial borrowing assumption, though not a lot lower than we had last time, and a wider fed funds range--dropping [the lower limit] down to perhaps 10 percent and making the range, say, 10 to 16 percent That would widen the range to 6 points as we had it some time ago It would allow for more unusual variability [given] the current conditions that we face with the special situation in the market "
2062,1982-06-30," Picking up on what Nancy said, I really wish that we could wish away the problem of having to decide But as the Chairman pointed out, we have the law to contend with and we have to get up there and say something [about the ranges] Looking at the budget picture If you figure that this [fiscal] year, which is 2/3 behind us, the deficit has run right around $100 billion, the difference between the first projected resolution on the budget and the actual has averaged over $50 billion per year for the last three fiscal years, including this one My feeling is that the market, as suggested in the summary we got from the staff, is looking at $104 billion as pie in the sky and that something more like what the staff put in is what the market would consider realistic, based on differences between previous first resolutions and actual performance recently And that says that fiscal policy is very expansive and unlikely to improve in the context of an election campaign  Were we to come in behind that and give the signal that we're purposely changing the monetary track to move to a more expansive mode by raising the targets on top of the existing fiscal situation, then we would appear to have both a more expansive fiscal policy and a more expansive monetary policy Our so-called flexibility wouldn't achieve the results in the area we get the most heat about, which is interest rates--""the results"" being a reduction in interest rates with the hope that it will relieve the pressures on peoples' balance sheets and the interest payments they have to make, for those who have to make them We could well find it to be counterproductive in the area of interest rates because the market would simply mark up the real premium in demands in response to both fiscal and monetary expansion So, I'd go with the group of people who have said ""Let's not change the stated range"" And certainly let's not make a superficial change that has a  -13-    6/30-7/1/82  definite signal value by adding 1/2 point That gives a signal but it really doesn't amount to anything quantitatively; we would be throwing in the towel symbolically without doing anything substantively Therefore, I come out for staying with the range we have for the long term At this point I don't feel inclined to continue to drop the range in any significant way for next year I'd rather hold off for a while on that until we get more information So I come down with people who say--it seems like the majority of the people here--we should stick with what we have on the range that we have stated and continue to say we're trying to get within the range and pray like the devil that we're in the range this week and don't get blown out of it  I'm inclined, obviously, not to question this decision; I think we have to do it But I am concerned about some of the ramifications I recall from when I used to travel and study in Mexico that there is a distinct pattern--I think you mentioned it briefly--in that normally in the heat of an election campaign, whatever else is going on in the economy, there is an outflow of funds from the country And then after the election is over there is a reflux of their own people's money coming back in--I'm not sure about the pace of it--provided they sense that the new government is going to take hold and everything is going to be cool It seems to me that if we're going to do this poking around--as Henry was saying this $600 million is peanuts against the magnitude of the problem--that what would be most helpful to the Mexicans, if we want to help them, is not just to give them this money, but to get together not only with our own Treasury but with the IMF so that after the elections are over we can get them to say that they have a program that's serious and that the IMF is with them and America is with them The hope is that we  -27-    6/30-7/1/82  could get at the element of the flight of capital so that it doesn't exacerbate the basic economic problem  Have we looked at the banks? That is another concern The last time I looked at the major US banks, many of them had half their capital committed in Mexico  Except that if I read the memo right, the minister overstated their reserves by--  The way I understand the Mexicans' mentality is that they think of themselves as being on the brink of or already in the class of industrialized nations And the view is that only so- called developing countries go with hat in hand to the IMF, getting instructions on how to behave That is how I see it  What about making the line bigger?  Are we going to call this the Beryl Sprinkel seasonal?  On a weekly, daily, or monthly basis? Well, you are proposing a significant change in policy  Are you proposing a 15 percent cap, too?  What range of rates are you looking for, Nancy?  Well, I sense a rather interesting shift in the perspective of the Committee I will talk about the things I agree with first I was happy to hear you, Mr Chairman, indicate that there is some chance that the economy may be getting better I guess I'm a hopeless optimist, but I always notice that economists have a penchant for gloom and tend to acknowledge that a recovery has happened after it has happened I hold onto and cherish this ray of hope that the economy may actually be turning around now, with three upward ticks in the leading indicators and all the other positive things that one can point to if one wants to be a little optimistic It may be improving right now There is, of course, the downside risk that everybody has expressed That can't be discounted or ignored  I certainly am not a fan of high interest rates, but I very strongly oppose any shift in policy toward putting on a maximum rate cap, particularly the notion that a number of people who have already spoken have expressed of setting a rate cap at or below the present level This week the fed funds rate is averaging around 15 percent and I'm told that it's a somewhat unusual week But I certainly wouldn't want to vote for a policy that said that rates had to be at or below their present level, with the further notion that if they should move even a little above the present level we'd automatically validate that with whatever increase [is necessary] in the money supply So, I guess you're going to have to put me down for being closer to Mr Black in that I [would not] vote for something like the rest of you [have advocated] I put most of you down for ""A"" or ""A+"" or ""A-"" Put me down for ""B"" with a borrowing assumption around where Lyle Gramley and Bob Black had it, at about $900 million And like Mr Black, I very strongly favor always having a range of interest rates that is broader rather than narrower I would say we ought to allow for at least some movement in both directions from where we actually are the day we make the decision Therefore, I'd go for a fed funds range up to 17 percent before we would get on the phone [to  -47-    6/30-7/1/82  consult] and down to 10 percent or below if we should be lucky enough to see rates happen [to move] in that direction So, I come out at ""B"" with a borrowing assumption of around $900 million and a fed funds range that is as wide or wider than we now have  What is your borrowing assumption?  Do you want to cap interest rates, too?  He said it would be similar  Are you implying that there wasn't a change in October '79? If I understood you, you said it would be similar to pre-October '79--that there is precedent for it  -55-    6/30-7/1/82  Before 1979  That's the thing to worry about  I'd get very nervous around 6 or 7 percent I'm serious!  That would still be positive  Well Mr Chairman, since you quoted one of your favorite philosophers earlier on I'd like to quote one of mine The quote goes something like this ""I think we tended to make mistakes in the past not at the end of an expansion or the end of a boom, and not so much in a recession, but by providing too much stimulus during the early part of an expansion period when things tend to get out of control before one realizes it I hope we don't make that mistake again"" I think you know who the philosopher is that I refer to I like that statement That was made two summers ago I think we're right there again  The point of this quote is that we always realize too late that we put in too much stimulus So, I feel strongly that we should never set a cap on the funds rate at right where it is We have to allow at least for a little change We're talking about putting it at 15 percent when it is already--maybe for window-dressing purposes--right around 15 percent We have to give ourselves some room to breathe on rates and not give people a formula to work with which would allow for a very rapid expansion when we may regret it later So, I'd be more cautious I'd set the borrowing at over $800 million and put a wider range on the funds rate to include something above where it is I always get nervous about setting the interest rate cap--    6/30-7/1/82  I think when we say ""about,"" everybody reads it to mean ""or more""  It's going to reduce Henry Wallich's expense account!  It always comes late Bank losses always peak a year after the recession I shouldn't say they always peak; they rise after the recession develops  That's why I gave that quote  Now that's being specific!  So, you want 16 percent?  It's now 10 to 15 percent Do you really mean to raise the lower limit to 11 percent? Did I hear you say 11?  Well, I'm not proposing to raise the lower limit; I want to be clear about that  At least 1 percentage point [on the upper limit] to allow ourselves a little breathing room from where we are the day we start, that's all  SPEAKER(?) Yes, I agree with that  A range of 10 to 16 or 9 to 16 percent at least gives us some room to breathe  SPEAKER(?) 10 to 15 percent toward 10 to 16 percent?  It's not my objective to force them down  I like the rest of the specifications; it sounds reasonable to me  Use the lower number and keep pumping  By itself  It was the death of a sovereign ruler  It's the same percent of GNP as our budget deficit  You're the captain of the ship  Well, in addition to the good staff analysis, there is the difference between the $104 billion in the first resolution and the $160 billion or so that our staff comes out with based on a different economic forecast I'm not sure how to handle it politically to make it seem non-antagonistic, but if we could find a diplomatic way to do so, I'd point to the difference between the first resolution and the actual deficit in the last three fiscal years There has been a difference of about $52 billion, if one projects the deficit at $98 to $100 billion With two-thirds of [the fiscal year] behind us, we come out this fiscal year--and have in the last two fiscal years--with about a $52 billion difference between the first budget resolution and the actual deficit I don't know what you might attribute that to but I attribute it to the fact that the reasoning our staff does makes sense--not just prospectively but in fact, looking back, it makes sense  Not unless we widen the band!  I wouldn't put the last phrase quite that way, but the idea--  They are closer to ours, you say? "
2089,1982-07-15," Paul, this is Bill Ford in Atlanta I want to express myself on the side of the last two speakers but add to what you're saying I'd be inclined to go ahead with our program that we established a couple years ago of continuing to try to notch the target down a half point a year but perhaps add on the caveat you just expressed that we are anticipating a normal cyclical positive factor to [unintelligible] for adequate growth in the economy, and should it develop--  In any case I would prefer to stay with the program at this point, with a caveat that allows some leeway on--  I don't really believe that a 5 percent increase is as low as we ultimately want it to be I don't know if you regard that as the lowest we ever want growth in the money supply to be in the future  Yes, that's right But normally we don't see velocity at zero when we are where we should be in terms of the stage of the cycle  The way I see it, Chuck, what you're proposing, as it is in the telegram, is doodling with the numbers because the market is anticipating that we're going to continue to bring the planned rate of expansion in the aggregates downward for some time yet I don't think anybody I've talked to in the market thinks that even 5 percent    7/15/82  is the ultimately appropriate rate of growth in the aggregates So the doodling in my view is the one that does not reduce the rate 1/2 percentage point That's the change in policy  I think those are good suggestions  Paul, this is Bill Ford I think the last language that Chuck Partee said just might do it [unintelligible]    7/15/82  There's a real chance of it being interpreted as dealing with the [unintelligible] demand  I'd feel a lot more comfortable with something like Bob said  One more thing on that, Paul I'd like to hear what Pres Martin says about that because his comments earlier about what the market thinks were interesting to me, and I've been very worried, as everybody is, about the possibility of another Penn Square or some other institutions that we don't know about or even some institutions that we do know about That's where I see the distinction in what Mr Black is saying that the market emphasizes [unintelligible] and that if there are real liquidity problems evident, then none of us is going to be in favor of clamping down on the market and threatening or precipitating a financial crisis  We're talking about the liquidity problems in-- "
2107,1982-08-24," Are we going to offend the French, Tony?  Yes, just in a few industries But in real terms, taking out price changes, our regional economy is flat, which is better than in the rest of the nation  Yes, I come out leaning toward ""B,"" too While I sympathize with the notion that we have had three months of weak M1 growth and that we certainly don't want to let it fall out of bed for another whole quarter, the trend seems to be toward its moving back up And just for the pure cosmetics of it, as one other speaker mentioned, since there is so little difference between the two alternatives why not let the market know when they get the news on this--whenever that is--that we're shooting to come in within our [monetary growth] target at the end of the year? There is so little difference between these that I think our credibility is worth going for the ""B"" alternative because it does show us allowing money to grow by a reasonably respectable rate over the rest of the year should we maintain this policy, which is a point Larry and others have expressed concern about It would still leave room for interest rates to moderate, I think; I certainly wouldn't expect voting for ""B"" to result in a huge jump in rates from their present levels because in my mind, as John Balles mentioned, this great decline is long overdue And I'm always for widening the [fed funds rate] band so that we do focus on trying to steady our performance and make ourselves more believable and predictable So, I come out for ""B"" with a borrowing range around $350 to $400 million I'd like to see the fed funds range widened and I'd like to see the [Board of] Governors vote to lower the discount rate before we leave the room  Yes, how is it going to be read when this--?  Well, what would you have done if we had set a 3 percentage point range six weeks ago when it actually moved more than that?  Could you read that again please, Paul, so we can study it a bit?  I don't know that there is I think we have a sizable minority who are concerned about sending out a signal that we're going back to managing interest rates  Yes, except--  What I'd like to know is this Right now the fed funds rate is 9 percent and we're talking about a period of six weeks between August 24th and October 5th Are you really saying that you would define market conditions as volatile if in six weeks the fed funds rate went up by 2 percentage points from 9 to 11 percent?  How can that be volatile? If you look at a hundred years of history of short-term money rates, that has happened lots of times  Well, obviously, the shorter the time horizon the more [it might be considered volatile] I think if it happened in two minutes we'd all agree it's volatile But we're talking about three to six weeks And it really does bother me to think that every time we walk out of here we are setting--or it could be conceived that we are setting--a cap on the fed funds rate for six or eight weeks from now at either right where the rate is or a point above  SPEAKER(?) Or four  Yes, but then we're managing interest rates; that is the image given I'm very worried as to how the market would take this  Yes  -36-    8/24/82  The market will wonder why [we said that]  Well, if I heard correctly Paul's response to what I asked, he said that if the funds rate were 11 percent six weeks from now it would worry him a lot less than if it were 11 percent tomorrow  Depending on what else is happening When I look at what has been happening at the Desk in New York in terms of the Manager making adjustments in the reserve paths for various reasons at various times, it seems to me that we still have the latitude to take into account what is happening, how fast it is happening, and so on, without giving this overt signal in the directive That's why I say stick with a range of 5 points If we don't want to center it on where the funds rate is, center it a little below where it is if our bias is in favor of seeing rates come down, and certainly mine is Then use discretion at the Desk to see that it doesn't happen in two days rather than two months Then we'd have a much stronger consensus on the Committee and the market would be less likely to misread the strong change in language  Isn't that less information? The market is supposed to have good information from us, not something more vague    8/24/82  At least that's within the range of ranges we have been using  And at least that's as narrow as we've had it in the last year  That wouldn't be as unusual as the other stuff  I'd rather go along with that 7 to 11 percent idea than what we've had  We've had 10 to 14 percent and we've had 11 to 15 percent; we've been as narrow as 4 points "
2125,1982-09-24," Paul, this is Bill Ford What exactly does the policy change you are proposing for the next few days mean? Do you want to cap interest rates at 10-1/4 percent? What are you proposing?  Up from $300 to $350 million, right?  In other words, we are just moving the path up by a couple of hundred million    9/24/82  But you are not saying that we are capping the funds rate at 10-1/4 percent? "
2143,1982-10-05," [If] we can't get the new legislation and this ruling gains weight in the marketplace, what restructuring would you anticipate in the market with regard to day-to-day operations? How would the market accomplish that?  I have one quick question about your forecast Looking at your forecast compared to others we track yours against-- Townsend-Greenspan, DRI, Citibank, and Chase--you are uniformly the most bearish for the next three quarters, and by a substantial margin You have far and away the lowest GNP growth rates, the lowest inflation forecast, and the highest unemployment forecast, which are all consistent in a very bearish pattern I just want to understand if what you said in answer to a question--from John, I think--was that your next-best forecast was even more bearish  You are saying they are right  One thing that worries me is what none of us expects We are all very bearish and you are very bearish Do you give zero probability, then, to the possibility of a surge in the economy? The consumer's car is getting older and older; more and more consumers are looking for a place to live as all these baby boomers get married or whatever [and create households] With household liquidity getting stronger and stronger and with savings up, you don't see any possibility of a surge in the economy?  This is sounding more and more like Pericles' oration on Caesar's burial!  Excuse me, who is this group?  Any pressures?  I beg your pardon? I don't understand where you're going to add a sentence or two  I'd like to start with a technical question If we put in this 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent [range for M2 and M3], where does that put the broader aggregates by the end of the year? I didn't see that projected  Before it's published?  The market will start to see the results of this  What you are saying quite plainly, if I hear you correctly, is that you think rates are too high now and you don't want even a tiny increase from the present rate of 10-1/4 percent on the fed funds rate You don't want it averaging 11 percent  You want literally to cap interest rates where they are now, or better yet, to drive them down  I want to say, respectfully, that I'm flatly opposed to this If we were to do this, especially now, I think it will consolidate any adverse opinions against us that are already out there about our motives for doing this at this particular time At a breakfast meeting with the leading bankers in Atlanta 72 hours or so ago, at which Mayor Young was the guest of honor speaking to us, he volunteered in front of all the bankers in the room a comment--we were discussing the city's problems--that he was instructing his staff to issue some municipal bonds immediately in order to do a certain project in the city of Atlanta I said ""What's the rush about this, Andy?"" And he said ""You guys are going to change policy right after election day and now is the time to do it"" This was Andrew Young I've heard from more people than I care to describe to you comments questioning our integrity and our motives in the context of an election campaign  First of all, I'm not convinced that pegging interest rates at today's level or trying to push them down is best for the economy Secondly, changing policy now in this context and saying overtly, as you said it, that we should hold interest rates where they are and try to push them down is going to make us extremely vulnerable to charges--unfounded I feel, because I don't question the motives of the people here who would vote for this I think the repercussions of this are going to be terrible  People are going to come down all over us  I'm not trying to defend M1  I'm reacting to what the Chairman is telling us, which is I think commendably honest, in that he is saying he really doesn't want to see interest rates raised That's what I'm reacting to regardless of what it says here And I think that will be apparent in the marketplace well before this is published and our integrity will be brought into question if we proceed along that line  My vision, yes  Mr Chairman, you did say you were planning to make some kind of public statement about this rather than just waiting a month [or so] until after the next meeting When, roughly, were you planning to say something about this?  Well, if a portion of the money market funds currently in M3 were to shift into M2--  Who says they won't like some of these new instruments the DIDC is going to invent?  How about just saying that the fed funds rate will not rise above 10-1/2 percent? Isn't that what we mean? Why not say what we mean if that's what we mean I don't mean to be facetious, but if we wanted to convey the true feeling of the group, I think that's what we mean, so why not say it? That would be conveying accurate information to the market as to what our objective is  Just out of curiosity, what are you leaving in--7 to 10-1/2 percent? "
2169,1982-11-16," Excuse me, in that regard, was the newspaper article accurate that the DIDC has approved in addition to the six transfers--three checks and three preauthorized--telephone transfers without limit at least until the next time this is looked at?  Into one's own checking  On top of the other six transactions  Was it a 3 to 2 vote?  Will it include something about your idea, Frank, of how to control total credit? What would the control mechanism be under your idea? Would that be in the paper?  Well, I would say I get pretty much the same readings I've been through three of my six locations in the last two weeks and there was a marked change from the last go-around About half of my branch directors and Atlanta directors are now saying some positive things; it's pretty much concentrated, as others have reported, in housing and housing-related areas, which are sensitive to rates One of was absolutely euphoric He said he had an infinite improvement in building permits; in Montgomery, which is a city with a few hundred thousand residents, permits went from zero to thirty Of course, that was [unintelligible] Another reported that he'd seen trucks going out of the local lumber mill for the first time in a long time; that is housing-related and is supported by some statistical data that are coming out  We did a special survey of thrifts with regard to the questions that Governor Martin reported on and also the question of where the money is going We looked at nineteen of the biggest thrift institutions in the Southeast and they account for $1 billion of the nationwide total of all savers certificates Half of it disappeared    11/16/82  We compared September 20 to October 20 to see what happened to the money, and about $500 million ran off from the all savers certificates The thrifts were pretty cheered by the fact that the biggest chunk of it--$150 some odd million--went into passbook accounts; they wish it were permanent, but they doubt it will be Another big chunk--about $30 to $40 million--went into IRAs, which is long-term money That might be the partial answer for why NOW accounts and IRAs and deferred comp accounts are starting to build up Basically, I guess I have to go along with the general thrust of the reports here, which is that the only real optimism or rays of hope that we see are in housing and housing-related industries There are a few minor exceptions; there's a bit of tourism and a little improvement here and there, but overall it is in the rate-sensitive sectors  May I ask a quick question? If I did my arithmetic right, the midpoint of the fed funds range in ""B"" is about 1 percentage point below the current fed funds rate  And in ""C"" the midpoint is about where today's rate is  Well, I think you have characterized it exactly right, Mr Chairman, in saying that we are at a point where we are weighing the [unintelligible] The consideration is whether or not we're in a historical discontinuity When I first joined this Committee I thought it was a line-up of Keynesians versus monetarists as to just what we needed to stimulate the economy I'd like to review briefly what kind of stimulus we are now putting in from both [the fiscal and monetary] sides As everybody knows, the deficit spending of the government really didn't explode until the second half of the last fiscal year That is, through the spring we were running a deficit about the same as the previous year at about a $60 billion annual rate It was in the last six months ending with September that on a seasonally adjusted basis it went from around the $60 billion annual rate up to $110 billion That means that fiscal policy has only recently become dramatically more expansive We now apparently are running a deficit somewhere in the range of $120 to $130 billion [or as much as] $150 billion for this fiscal year In other words, fiscal policy was made much more expansive in the last few months  Likewise, as Lyle mentioned last time, the question of what is happening to the real money supply depends on what kind of monetary theory one likes If you look at what is happening to the real money supply--I'm sure you've all seen the little chart that shows that it has only been since last summer that the nominal money supply, M1 and M2 both, has been growing And with the drop in prices, the fact is that what is happening right now is that the real money supply is expanding very rapidly whether one measures it in terms of M2 or M1 That, too, is a quite recent phenomenon; it has only been occurring during the last few months Those two conclusions, together with the normal lags in the impact of fiscal and monetary policy, lead me to  -32-    11/16/82  the conclusion that the current set of policies on both the fiscal and monetary sides are very expansive In terms of the fiscal thrust, the deficit is running at 5 to 6 percent of GNP; in terms of the full employment deficit, [the federal budget] is now in deficit at any reasonable definition of full employment Real monetary policy is just expansive And all that says to me is that we are sitting here reading each other the gloom and doom report, but unless we are at a historically discontinuous point in our economy, which a number of speakers have suggested in different ways [may be the case], we are running a high risk of throwing both of the throttles in our economic airplane fully to the wall and the plane has to take off The great danger is that it will surge forward in the next few months after the normal lags on both fiscal and monetary policy take hold and then we will be in a position of having the worst of all worlds, namely, higher long-term interest rates--we may manipulate the short ones, but the long ones will get to us--higher unemployment, and price inflation starting to turn around against us, all without any significant drop in unemployment And that's the scene that concerns me on the other side of this judgment we are making  Given that we haven't allowed for the normal lags, I would say we need to wait a little longer and risk keeping policy where it is--that may mean something more like ""C,"" whose average interest rate is right about where we are now--and see after another quarter if the economy does or does not respond to this tremendous stimulus we're giving it now If at the end of that time, by late in the winter, we still see everybody pushing their forecasts of recovery forward, I would be more inclined to share the judgment a number of you are making, which is that we are already at a historical discontinuity Then I would say we should go into our mode of being preventors of the great depression If the problem is that we have had not just four or five quarters of unusual velocity behavior but that we are looking at six or seven quarters of it and the number is getting bigger and bigger in the wrong direction, at that point we should push this kind of stimulus But until then I want to emphasize the risk on the other side, as noted in the comments of Mr Wallich All the business folks are saying they will give us a period of grace of, say, seven months; they will watch this and after that the indicators of expectations turning against us should probably start to break I look at four things in terms of those indicators the price of gold, which is turning against us; the exchange value of the dollar, which is currently all right or more than all right as a number of you noted; long-term interest rates, which are still declining, and as you said the market hasn't turned on us yet; and sensitive commodity prices, which are still reasonably okay But if we go for ""A"" or anything like ""A"" to ""B,"" I think we will start to see these things turn against us, and with the economy surging we really will be in the soup six or nine months from now So, while I'm worried about what the Congress is going to do to us and I'm also very worried about the fact that most of you may be right and we may be [witnessing] a historical discontinuity, I still think we should lean on the side of not overdoing the monetary stimulus to complement the excessive fiscal stimulus that everybody agrees we now have I'd go for ""C""  Is that what he said, or did he say since 1960?  From what to what?  You're taking the alternative C growth [for M2] of 9-1/2 percent? Do you mean for October to December?  So you're on ""B"" for the growth  10-1/2 percent is where it is now, right?  SEVERAL No, 9-1/2 percent  The present range is ""B,"" right? So if we drop it to 10 percent, that indicates a further loosening of policy in the sense of where the band is  -40-    11/16/82  May we ask what your feeling is on the discount rate? Should it be dropped another notch or left where it is?  That puts me on the other side of the river  Paul, this really raises the question I wanted to ask, which is based on your perception of the usefulness of M1 I have the feeling that in your mind M1 is permanently [distorted], especially in light of what the DIDC is doing [and] the all savers certificates If the consensus of the Committee is that M1 will never be used again, or at least not in the foreseeable future, then I think we ought to come out and say it and see what happens  Why don't you change the reserve requirements from 1 percent on transactions to one that they allow? When you get to 12 percent--  Are we looking at John's [version]?  May I ask this? My feeling about this has been that we don't discuss it with outsiders, as you suggested, but that [is] the role of a Federal Reserve official, a senior Federal Reserve official especially, giving you the first shot at talking For instance, the last time you should have had the first shot at that  -55-    11/16/82  meeting down at the Greenbrier Now you are telling us you are going to do it tonight But after that--  If one is on the [morning] call and can't share [the policy decision] with our [appropriate senior staff], whoever that is, I don't see how we can have a meaningful thing to say other than to listen to the bell ring on the call My people go to a lot of  -56-    11/16/82  trouble to keep track of your procedures As I understand it, if we are on the call, we are supposed to be a representative of the group; we do not reflect our own views but whether we think the policy is being instituted in accordance with whatever the decision was To do that we need somebody to try to track at least roughly how the calculations and decisions are made  You're positing that the band would be widened at both ends  -59-    11/16/82  Wait a minute I have to defend Nancy on this The logic of it has to be that at the end of a month--with our next meeting only being a month away--they will have it But somewhere between releasing it the same day and after one month, it becomes a non-story That is witnessed by the fact that we usually don't get stories about the minutes when we release them  I hear rumors--I don't know because I wasn't here --that we've had sporadic leaks over the years You may be right that we have fewer leaks than, say, Treasury, but haven't we had problems with leaks of this type for many years?  Are you saying there has never been a leak until the last two times?  I want to call facetiously for a vote, so I could be recorded as voting with Nancy on this  That says a lot "
2195,1982-12-20," May I ask what the limit is now?  We can verify that at Lockheed in Georgia We had this political battle on getting the C5A versus some 747, which is    12/20-21/82  made out in Mr Balles' District and we won it So, I asked the head of Lockheed Georgia, Mr Ormsby ""When do we get these thousands of jobs due to our big political victory?"" He said it will start about two years from now The lead times are quite awesome, in terms of gearing up an assembly line to produce a big plane like that  Well, I'm on the side of the twinklers, without any doubt, although the picture is mixed, especially with the things that Lyle mentioned going on In our heavy industry belt over toward Alabama up to the lower end of the Midwest, we are getting clobbered We're still losing jobs; and parebacks and efficiency-type cuts are going on very heavily in some industries But we are getting the same signs of the nation's recovery, a little stronger I would say in some sectors, mainly in housing For instance, we are getting a lot of optimism and a pickup in permits in a number of major urban markets around our area One of my directors quipped the other day that he actually saw a lumber truck going down the road, but he didn't think it was heading for the bankruptcy court So, we are starting to see a housing pickup The two big air carriers that operate in our area, Delta and Eastern, both reported advance bookings up pretty sharply for travelling to our area So, there are some signs of light I wouldn't bet my life savings on there being a boom just now We have the same mix of concerns that others have Residential construction is good, but other construction looks weak  We've had a lot of new mortgage money flow into our ""price riot"" institutions Over a billion dollars flowed in two days into the institutions in Atlanta that did the 21 and 22 percent pricing; they have to lay it off somewhere and we're hoping that some of it will go into housing  The S&Ls that did it are really talking about going out--you might know more about it personally The ones that did it are very euphoric; they got a lot of money  For 30 days, until January 13 They're going to make 30-year mortgages with 30-day money, I guess!  He kept looking for the bottom line!  And no minimum size of check  -19-    12/20-21/82  You could always change your inflation forecast  You're saying you have to agree with their nominal GNP forecast?  Does that mean you have to agree with their inflation forecast?  What is motivating me in my approach in this very complex time that we are going through is that the more complicated things get, I tend to react to them by going back to the more simple things we know more about There are two things that worry me One is what worries everyone else on this Committee, and that is that the tune is changing on us in our waltz with M1 or M2 or anything else we use And if, as a result, we don't provide enough liquidity, then the economy is [going to be] down to where the chart outside your door shows it is I think there was a time when we had charts on the monetary aggregates on the wall, but there are none left now it's just interest rates and the unemployment rate by your door When one looks at what is happening in the world, we are worried seriously about creating a depression here That is implicit in Chuck's question How do we know velocity won't be even worse? The obvious answer is that usually we'd be thinking about [the economy] going the other way in a normal, cyclical manner His feeling and that of many of the people on the Committee is that we basically are in an historically discontinuous mode Things aren't relating in the way they used to; innovation is messing up the picture and, therefore, the big danger lies on the side of retaining some kind of religious commitment to any one of these monetary variables we're fooling around with and overstaying the period of recession and causing a crash That is what is on our minds; that's what it's really about At all costs we must avoid not doing the number one job of central bankers, which is to keep enough liquidity out there to keep the economy going That is what you are worried about and that is what we are reacting to  -30-    12/20-21/82  and that is why we are backing away from most of these things The innovation arguments are part and parcel of that  There's another thing that worries me It comes from my background as a professor of economic development and history And that is that if you look at the longer-range experience of what central banks in this country and other countries have done wrong on numerous occasions in this century--especially in other countries earlier in this century--there is another thing we can do that would be terribly wrong I think we're doing it now And that is to validate the classic mismanagement of public policy of a government, and I mean both domestically and in foreign countries What I see happening in our own country under Reaganomics is that we have had an enormous increase in the size of the public sector relative to the private sector There has been a tremendous increase in public spending and, under Reaganomics, it has shifted away from investment- type activities toward consumption-type activities; defense expenditures can even be called consumption  Around the world we are looking at Mexico and asking what is wrong with Mexico The answer is that the Mexicans are consuming publicly much more than they are willing to produce and to tax themselves to support There, too, the problem is public sector expansiveness that they have validated internally with monetary expansion and that our banks have helped to fuel with excessive loans, which we are now choosing to call performing loans when the truth of the matter is that they are not performing loans The same goes for Poland Look anywhere in the world where there's a crisis Another way of looking at the crisis is that one dimension of it involves too much public sector expansion that the country is not willing to finance [by reducing] current consumption in the private sector So, they're trying to have everything at once And to me that is the nub of the problem that we're facing as we look around the world, both in international and domestic affairs So, I see us getting into a different danger than the one that many of you are worried about and that is, through everything we're doing right now, the danger of monetizing excessive public consumption at home and abroad on a very large scale and using all these technical arguments as a way, in effect, to validate it That to me is an equally great danger that is every bit on a par with the depression worry that worries all of us, especially the rest of you It can lead to exactly the same place  If I am right about this and it's the second danger that we ought to be focused on, then a year or a year-and-a-half from now there will be a tremendous fiscal stimulus plus the monetary stimulus that is now building up, not just here but on a global scale We are talking about increasing the IMF [quotas] by 50 percent or 100 percent and pretending that all those loans are good, and forcing the banks to increase [their loans] by 5 to 10 percent When I add all that up, that worries me From the other side, we can create a further expansion of credit, which will blow up in our faces and leave us right at the place that we are worried about anyway As I see it, when we stand back from all the technical issues we're dealing with here, we have to ask ourselves what we are doing as policymakers We have to recognize that we can go wrong either way And I think we're going wrong in the second direction right now    12/20-21/82  It is with that background that I looked at this long paper, which comes to some interesting conclusions My conclusion was that there is something wrong with every single measure M1 has a few problems, as do most of the other [measures] Nobody would argue that M1 is perfect I surely wouldn't vote for it But I don't think some of the other things mentioned, like credit or debt, are perfect as measures Frank was for L for a while; then he abandoned that one and came up with debt The problem for me with debt is not timeliness; if I were arguing Frank's case, I'd make the argument that if we made the same effort to get timely and comprehensive data on debt that we do on M1, M2, and M3, we could solve the timeliness part of it with less resources But the question is the causality argument in terms of what is happening to the composition of debt Let's not ignore the fact that there has been tremendous innovation in debt instruments and in composition of the debt, just as there has been on the liability side of the things we are talking about And the view that the history there is any more relevant than the changing history of the M1 relationship, I just don't see, frankly  So, my bottom line on this is that we should remember we can lose in either direction and the danger is that we will err on the side of monetizing public sector consumption that is excessive not just here but also abroad If we do that, how will we know when we're doing that? I would say we ought to look at everything the market is trying to tell us, not just what Lindley Clark says or what others say I have pages of them here, if you want to see them, and it's not just from one side The bottom line of this one is that there is no doubt whatsoever that the Fed is inflating again; that pretty much summarizes what the market watchers are saying, whether or not they are right But I'd complement that by looking not at what they say, but like everything in life, at what they do Gold is up by $150 since June Some of the commodity indexes are starting to turn up The bond market is starting to get a little shaky on us Many of you seem to think the dollar is automatically over-valued; I don't know that If you take a look at all these things--what is happening to gold, to the commodities futures markets, to the bond market, to foreign exchange markets, and you see all those things start to look like the world is telling us we are going too far, we had better stop before we go too far down that track And I think we're starting on that track Therefore, my bottom line on all this is that, yes, we have to compromise some with M1 due to all its imperfections But let's not err on the side of expansionism too long because we have already done a lot of expanding in terms of policy and we haven't yet waited to see what effects it will have There's a long lag We are looking at today's unemployment rate but doing things that will [not] be felt for months And the actions we took a few months ago will show up hopefully in the first and second quarters, when I still think we are going to have some recovery, and I hope things will get better Overall, that's how I see all this And I hope these few comments will help some people to understand why I tend to be on the conservative side of this policy debate we are having Thank you, Mr Chairman  I'm wondering who is in favor of bigger swings in interest rates than we've had I didn't hear anybody say that  May I ask what worries you about M1 in November? I, too, noticed that the amount of change in M1 went way beyond anything we were looking at in terms of all savers certificates, and there was some thought that the [maturing] all savers certificates would give it pop and then would phase out But the fact is it's more than that  It's worrisome It's well beyond what we were talking about  May I ask your perception on one other thing you said? You mentioned that you feel we are not managing interest rates But when you just look at a chart of daily deviations in the fed funds rate and actually measure the variance on a daily basis before and after October--  If you talk to people on the street that I talk to, they are saying that we are not only managing interest rates but are steadily pushing them down and reducing the deviation and that that is our policy That's something I hear I would like to ask Tony or you whether you hear or sense any of that and whether or not you feel there is some element of truth that that is what we're doing  I certainly don't like those wild swings in rates Looking back, there's an obvious difference of opinion as to what caused that Some people would say that the very fact that we never did stabilize either the base growth or the M1 growth may be what caused the fluctuations, which nobody liked, including me But looking ahead, I get the feeling that we are being perceived as very tightly managing day-to-day short-term rates and that the market is looking at us that way I wonder if my perception is wrong Tony, what do you think? Is the market thinking that or not?  The one before that was down to zero, so it's now back up to 1 percent?  So that puts it up close to 50 cents for the mark?  SPEAKER(?) Yes  When is then?  The question is Do the central banks take them out of the risk    Why are we doing all this? We are not a full- fledged member of the BIS, as I understand it, for historical reasons I take it the reasons we're taking BIS out of what appears to them to be a substantial risk is because they are performing the service of getting these other central banks in on the deal and that's the most efficient way to do it Is that it?  Get your Ayatollahs straight!  Why 50/50? Even in the United Nations, we don't take 50/50 any more  Ahead of us, behind us, or at the same time?  In other words, we're not just making a decision to re-establish our $700 million swap; we're re-establishing it in a less creditworthy position in the line-up That's what it boils down to  I'm still thinking like a commercial banker  First of all, the question is What is happening to global monetary liquidity as a result of all of these things? You can take it either as a statement or a question The statement is that there's a danger that global monetary liquidity can be excessively expanded through all of these credit [extensions]  The other aspect of this that bothers me is the fact that the Presidents of the [Reserve] Banks that I have talked to are all very uneasy about having someone in their Bank make phone calls in which we are in effect saying to the banks If you will put forward your share of the new package of $4 to $5 billion, we would wink at the realities of the creditworthiness of your loan That makes me very concerned  What I'm saying is that that is certainly the way it's being interpreted in the marketplace  We'll pretend it's in dollars  I don't want to prolong the discussion, but obviously there is a substantive distinction To be sure, all debt  -72-    12/20-21/82  grows over time as assets grow and nobody ever pays off big loans That's one argument one could make But one way to look at is to ask If these banks could do these loans over again, what would they do? From the phone calls that we've had, these banks would all want to be out tomorrow  And the new element is that the IMF is requiring it Isn't it the first time in history that the IMF is saying We're not putting up ours unless you put up yours?  He's been writing diligently  Nothing but the history of every other recovery we've ever had  Whenever you wait until the recovery is obvious, you wait too long  That doesn't square with table 4, does it?  Page 11 of the Bluebook If I read this Bluebook summary of your estimate of the shifts right, it says that for the December-to-March period we're talking about you think the shift in M2 could be as little as 1 percent and could be as much as 5 percent Oh, you're getting 3 percent by averaging  The borrowing assumption in this package is $175 to $200 million?  If all goes well  Could we pick a date tentatively today? "
2218,1983-01-14," Ditto Atlanta    1/14/83 -5-  This is Bill Ford in Atlanta I'm in the middle of a board meeting right now that I had to step out of, and our directors just reported that in the Southeast we are starting to see  -11 -    1/14/83  some pickup in forest products and that in certain regions around here there are some very sharp improvements in housing conditions and so on But I guess I'd go along with the consensus that says any sharp tightening in response to these money numbers would certainly be questionable policy On the other hand, looking at what is happening to sensitive commodity prices, including gold, silver, copper, and various other things, and the dollar against certain currencies, I think it would also be a serious blunder at this point to give any sign of pushing rates down further in the context of the uncertainty that we're facing as to what's happening both in the real economy and with the money numbers So where I'd come out would be to even keel it for awhile until we have better information "
2247,1983-02-08," Value added?  Net interest margins  Excuse me, Jerry, but I didn't understand the logic of what you just said Why are you more optimistic--just because it's a message that doesn't work out?  We already are starting to see some  We've had 3 or 4 of our leading businessmen tell us that [price measures are not properly weighted], when one takes account not just of the price but of the nonprice cost factors, like service and whether or not transport charges are loaded on heavily or lightly and so on They swear that the PPI has been understating things--that the drop hasn't really captured the full extent of price deflation There's a big gap in there So, we have a research project going on because a number of our industrialists have told us we are--or whoever puts out that index is--full of baloney on that  May I ask a couple of related questions of the staff? Another thing I heard from a number of businessmen is that our capacity number--we put out the industrial capacity numbers that everybody quotes, do we not?  That tells us that industrial capacity is now running at 67 percent or something like that I had a number of people, including the principal shareholder of  and a number of other major industrialists who really look at this stuff, say to me that our index is really poor--not in the way we're doing the statistical work, but the meaning of it The argument goes like this If they really ran mills at 100 percent of capacity in the way they think we measure it, they still wouldn't make any money on some of their mills, especially those that don't have today's oil prices factored in Any piece of equipment or any plant that's over 10 years old should not be counted as part of capacity is what they're saying If one made this adjustment, they say that the measured total against which we measure underutilization of capacity would be lower and, therefore, we'd have a higher-than- recorded utilization rate Related to that, one of the biggest components of our industrial production figures that we report is electricity production and other kinds of energy production, right? I don't know how big a component it is, but the argument is that with the huge jump in oil prices, even considering the recent modification, there's a trend factor toward conservation which is very strongly reflected in things like energy per unit of output overall If one adjusted for this in thinking about industrial production, probably the last 3 months instead of being down might actually be up, net of the conservation effect Do any of these thoughts from businesspeople make sense to you, Mr Zeisel, or Mr Prell, or any of you?  Just in terms of economic logic, it would seem to me that right at that point when we had that huge jump in oil prices there should have been a substantial increase in the year-to-year change in obsolescence--just a priori  It did show up in the survey?  Thank you  And it comes down to--  If I may just tack on On that chart we're talking about, right about now the federal government share of total credit flows is at an historic high For a few weeks it's zooming skyward and all of a sudden it levels off, while your forecast projects continuing increases in the deficit, including the structural part How do those things add up in the flow of funds [accounts]?  One other thing, while we're on this page Given the growing interest of the Committee in credit aggregates as a possible way of tracking or influencing real performance, could you say just a little more about that very unusual divergence between the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt and GNP?  I was listening to you when you said that you wanted to get back to ask if there were any fundamentally different things that the Committee wanted to consider In listening to what we've all said here, where we are headed--unless somebody does come up with a different approach--is to [take a decision that would] add to the noise in the marketplace I want to be specific about what I mean If you take all the things that have been mentioned here today so far, and that a lot of people nodded their heads in favor of, what they come to is this We haven't voted on it yet but I'd be willing to bet money that by the time we're done voting we will have agreed that there are going to be more aggregates to look at Specifically, we're going to add a credit variable or two We're generally in favor of leaving Ml in, although with much less emphasis There's strong acceptance of the reality that there is going to be more base drift this time than ever before--and if I remember the numbers right--both on M1 and M2 A number of people, at least Jerry, Ed, Lyle, Roger, and a number of others, have said ""Let's look through all this to the real economy"" That to me is another way of saying we're going to try to impact the economy directly And I don't think it's too much of a stretch of the words to say we want to [fine] tune the economy in reality We think we can do it We've all used the word flexibility Everyone who has spoken so far has used the word flexibility, which is another way of saying wider bands and more allowance for moving things around And everyone is advocating the wider bands themselves  When I take all of these feelings that we've expressed, Mr Chairman, it raises the question in my mind, in line with your question Why are we dealing with monetary aggregates at all? If you go back to how we got there, the monetary theorists who pushed this whole concept had as one of the fundamental parts of the concept that we shouldn't try to fine-tune and especially shouldn't try on a short- term basis to be flexible about a lot of things We should be looking at some aggregate that hopefully has some relationship to what we're really trying to do over a long period of time and just let it go in a steady way and the market will know what we're going to do next And    2/8-9/83  with these six or seven dimensions of flexibility that we're putting on everything--! There are two or three people down this side of the table who in different ways all stuck to it Karen almost jumped on the table and then backed off Nancy said it What we're doing is we are looking at the real economy, trying to manage it in real terms, and de facto we're using interest rates as the principal variable to attempt to do that That's what we're doing  So, my answer to you would be If we're going to do all these other things, then it would be in the interest of not creating more noise in the markets just to say that we are now going to attempt in our collective wisdom to manage the real economy out of a recession without managing it back into inflation and the principal thing we're going to do is move short-term rates Because I think that's the truth Isn't that what we're really doing? It looks that way on the charts to me So, just in case somebody wants a fundamental alternative--all the rest of the things all of you have said are variations, I argue, on this theme of flexibility, more targets, and wider bands--I'll offer a basic alternative, if for nothing else but the sake of discussion, which is to stop all that stuff and tell people that we're trying to set interest rates that will get us out of the recession and hope that it won't have side effects that will get us back into another round of inflation after it's over That would be in my view a more fundamental change and one that I don't want to say I'm personally advocating 100 percent; but if the drift of the opinion around this table is to do all these other things, let's at least consider that as an alternative  They tend to go in opposite directions  On the credit [memo]?  Is that going to sell? Can we sell that?  I'm serious I don't mean this as a facetious question  You're going to eliminate unemployment for Fed watchers if there is anything difficult!  But Lyle--Mr Chairman, may I address this? It seems to me one should think about the overall balance sheet Now we're talking about the other side of the balance sheet than the one we normally talk about Isn't your argument tantamount in some sense to saying that there's a low saving rate in our economy, which we have in our forecast and which affects the flow of funds overall plus other things? You're suggesting we take it as a given--as something that we implicitly accept--that there's going to be a huge bite of federal sector borrowing as projected in the nice charts we had yesterday, even with the cheery assumption that it's going through the roof right now but it immediately levels off for some reason I still don't understand the chart from yesterday's presentation Another way of saying what you're saying is that if we choose these numbers we're talking about now, we're not leaving room for the private sector Doesn't that translate into saying ""Let's monetize the federal debt""?  Why not? It would be nice if you could have it It depends on the policy guide  That comes out of this chart show  I would say the opposite You're talking about long-term rates when you're talking about capital What we have to worry about in the marketplace, if we do some of these things--set the aggregates too high and throw in this credit aggregate with it--is that the bond market, which seems to have flattened out and is starting to tick up now, could take off on us and we could get the exact opposite of what you just said I'm still trying to figure out where the bottom line of the paper is that the staff did But I read one thing over and over again In terms of comparison with money measures M1 performs as well as the best of credit measures Look at this chart that was given out yesterday, which shows the huge increase in velocity there That's the same thing you guys are complaining about--the monetary velocity  It was a dramatic change  So why add another obfuscating factor to the set of already imperfect measures? What Lyle is saying--if we were to state it in [our targets] and then take it seriously--could be interpreted in the money markets as saying that we are worried about adequately financing the federal deficit Another way of saying what he's saying is Let's monetize the debt  And you can't say Let's take the government part as a given and then add on and make sure there's enough there for the private sector, which is what I hear Lyle saying That's another way of saying we will monetize the debt no matter how big it is  It was 13-1/2 percent in 1978  You sound like Everett Dirksen--a billion here, a billion there!  Think of it as 50 percent more than GNP Right?  How can you miss a target that's 50 percent--?  The last time it was below 9 percent the economy was a lot healthier than it is now, gentlemen That's what we're trying to do, isn't it? I'm not kidding about this That is the other way of saying it  There was accelerating inflation in that period  Remember, if you don't like the crowding out argument in that we're taking the government's share as given, another thing that's implicit in what Lyle is arguing is that you will increase financial leverage of corporations Because what you're talking about providing them adequately with is debt, which as Governor Martin noted, has to be related to equity And what he just said is that there's not going to be equity forthcoming for whatever reason That's in the forecast I'm not arguing with it But the logical conclusion is that if we put a high number on the range and if we make the credit available to the private sector after the government gets its share, the net result will be an increase in the debt/equity ratio of corporate America And that ratio, if I'm not mistaken--I'd like to ask the staff--    2/8-9/83  What kind of evidence may I ask, Paul? Remember, if you go back not 6 weeks but back to last fall when we were arguing about M1 in a discussion like this, we were saying that we were worried about what would happen when the all savers [certificates] matured and we were worried about what would happen with MMDAs But we had double-digit growth of M1 before October and after October,  But what Jerry is saying is Why should we start out by assuming anything except that velocity is going to make a comeback? And the weaker language we put in now will probably be--  All I'd say, along the lines of what Jerry thinks, is that the farther we let this horse out of the corral, the harder it's going to be to jump back on it when we think we need it  You can intentionally monitor your speedometer while going 85  The question is where you put your foot!  It depends on whether it's a governor on the motor  Well, I disagree with that But I think you're right that the consensus is there I thought you were asking ""Is that the consensus?"" And I think it is But I personally disagree with it because I think we face the possibility of a very vigorous [economy] Suppose these events continue and all these things--the real things that we lack such as housing starts and auto sales--start to take off coupled with all the aggregates, however defined, continuing to grow at scary rates Then what would you do?  That's quite a critical period At the risk of embarrassing John, who may want to refute what I'm going to say, he was just showing me some research that he likes, which seems to indicate that the traditional problem the Fed has faced in the past is overstaying ease because we're always talking about what is happening in the economy today when the decisions we're making will impact with a lag--in the summer, the fall, and the end of the year So, I don't agree with the consensus, but I think you correctly identified it  That's why I didn't bring it up  How can we do that? We already have it down to $200 million  Make it a minus?  In doing this, you're still limiting it to those in consensus with the whole thing, right?  What you really mean, don't you, is assuming that the real economy is going down at that time It's possible that the  -94-    2/8-9/83  nicest thing that could happen would be that that would happen while the economy is still going [up], meaning that velocity has turned around And would you still want it in there?  Any doubt that it will jell?  Do you mean about monetary management? "
2273,1983-03-28," That's too frank!  Burt Lance is going to be relieved to hear this!  Mr Chairman, I would suggest Let's sell marks and buy yen Really, that would solve it  We like to think that, but I think we know [better] Didn't you say you tried the arithmetic on this a lot of times and you could never figure out a formula for intervention?  For the remainder of '83 or are you talking about next year too?  My next door neighbor is one of those independents who is a millionaire a number of times over He told me there has never been a better time to buy rigs and leases--that right now is the time to get in I always wondered--  He's doing it  What's that--a rig equity investment trust?  Mr Chairman, on the general economic outlook that we've been talking about, I come down on the side of Lyle Gramley and Preston Martin When you look at the major sectors of the economy, the only thing I see to worry about is the one that has been noted; export growth is likely to be weak for the reasons we're all aware of, namely, that the buyers abroad are financially strapped and can't afford to buy But if you take all the other sectors of the economy, in government spending, for example, the surge is just starting to hit in our part of the country and spending is going to come down like manna from heaven as far as the military buildup and the other sectors of government are concerned It looks as if federal spending is just starting to surge through as a stimulant to the economy I agree that there will be a sharp inventory turnaround; there almost has to be All of the businessmen I've talked with in our area are saying that the [inventory] pipelines are dry The orders are starting to pick up in our area It's also showing up, as was noted, in sensitive  -38-    3/28-29/83  commodity prices; virtually everything except oil and precious metals is surging The BLS 22 commodity spot market index has been up 14 weeks in a row Scrap steel, lumber, aluminum, wheat, corn, soy bean, cattle, cotton--everything--is going up and going up fast, which is a further indicator that the pipelines are rather dry as prices get bid up  The big thing that we have to watch for, though, which will determine which of these polar forecasts is right, is exactly what the consumer does When you look at the consumer's potential, the consumer really hasn't hit the market at all and he's in excellent condition to do it The only thing that consumers are buying is new homes; and there's a little more resale house business We haven't yet seen it feed through to the related industries in the consumer durables sector other than autos I think that's bound to come with the employment picture brightening; the consumer's balance sheet certainly allows it Then there is the profits surge that allows business to finance the inventory buildup So, when you go through the different sectors--and the internal arguments we have at the Atlanta Fed have been on how vigorous and how quickly the surge is coming and so far I'm ahead--I think it's going to be a vigorous spring and summer for us And I'm worried about what will happen at the end of the year and early next year--whether it's sustainable, given what we're doing with the monetary aggregates while this deficit spending is going on I'm worried that we'll have a vigorous recovery and a drop through the floor about a year from now or maybe sooner That's where I come out on it I'm not worried about the next few months I think we're going to be--  I think what is going to happen is that when we do raise the rates, and I think we are going to raise the rates within a year for the reasons others have given, we're going to put the economy back in the tank And it will come when we finally pay for all the monetary expansion that has been going on We are going to have to pay for what we're doing now; we can't put off the day of reckoning forever We can put it off for another 6 to 9 months and then we will pay One way or another--  We will pay when all this borrowing in the private sector that has to come in order to continue the expansion much beyond a few months comes into conflict with government [borrowing] Then we are going to have to blow the whistle on it And when we do, we're going to drive up rates and put the economy back down  Yes, I see a vigorous recovery  Another surge and then a drop-off  -39-    3/28-29/83  That's my forecast boom/bust  Yes So far it has been rather moderate as far as the private sector tapping the market But it has to come, don't you think?  What I'm suggesting is that the thing to do is to think in terms of moderating a boom now so that we don't have to come down as heavily about 9 months to a year from now  He said 10 minutes  Just thinking about it in terms of a priori logic, with real interest rates coming down, I don't see that the cost of holding cash has changed that much in favor of using more cash So that wouldn't be a [reason]  One thing we have noticed in Miami is the cash flowing into the Miami branch We had a big surplus of cash flowing in versus payouts, on the order of a $6 billion differential in '81 I forget [the exact amount]--I wish I had brought the figures--but I did notice in reviewing the [more recent] Miami currency report that we're getting a slower inflow and Miami is less of a net cash generator for our big branch down there Paul, one possible explanation would be that Venezuela, for example, has just put on exchange controls France is putting on limits as to how much cash one can carry out and Mexico is putting on limits I'm just thinking aloud Could it be that to the extent that dollars show up in these economies through the underground economy, or however they used to remit them back when there was no limit on carrying money in and out of Venezuela, they're stashing more cash down there?    3/28-29/83  Yes, but if you buy the fact that the cash has been flowing that way--for example, into Columbia and Venezuela as a result of the black market--the cash was going in and then it would come back and end up in our banks and end up in the Miami branch  I agree with the people who see problems in velocity, but as Mr Roberts put it, we have to be careful how we interpret what is going on with velocity In the last 7 months we've had double-digit growth in Ml in every month except January, when it was 98 percent The average is 13 to 14 percent With regard to velocity, when money is increasing at that rate I don't see how we could expect the economy instantly or in a very short period to expand with a positive velocity on top of that The point is that just that rapid growth in money itself is driving the velocity down in the near term And the question is Will we pay later? Now, being fair to the other side of this argument and looking at the reduced-form models that attempt to predict that, even over a few months or quarters with the normal velocity trend Ml does seem to be overpredicting the growth of the nominal GNP But I think we have to be awfully careful in assuming that this will go on and especially in overinterpreting the relationship For instance, in February we had a 212 percent growth rate of Ml; we have to expect velocity to go down on a current basis when we're expanding the money supply like that  With regard to the other thing that everyone is so concerned about, namely the shift in the composition of the aggregates, I'd like to make two points If you just review what we've said at these meetings about distortions, I recall that back in September or October we were saying that we knew we were going to have trouble with M1 because of all savers certificates There were $50 or $60 billion of those out there and most of them were coming due in October Therefore, we expected M1 to go up more sharply than usual in October for structural reasons It came in at 142 percent But most of that money was back in by November, and in November we still had vigorous growth of 136 percent in Ml Then we said that when the MMDAs started we expected them to draw money out of Ml and, if anything, to give us some moderation in M1 That did not happen Ml continued to expand in spite of it Now we're saying, based on Jerry's argument, that we have yet a third argument about what is happening structurally--namely, that the Super NOWs are more super than we thought and, therefore, this will be a good reason not to be concerned about further double-digit growth in Ml I just think month by month we're coming up with some story explaining what it is Honestly, I think we are kidding ourselves If you go to the reserve base to see what we're doing to reserves--and I don't want to be too deferential to St Louis, but I think it's the right base to use because it takes account of the shift in the composition of deposits--on that basis the reserve base has been going through the roof And we just keep accommodating all the demands at the window and allowing for reserve expansion that's very rapid  So, I think the risk is on the side of our paying later for allowing ourselves to be too persuaded by the velocity argument and the composition of deposits argument The risk is that we will get a return toward normal velocity It doesn't have to be much when we're talking about these kinds of growth rates of money; any drift back to normal velocity could just boom the economy right out into the stratosphere So, as concerned as I am about unemployment, housing, the fragility in the international markets, and all the other things we've said, I think we also have to worry about the other side of it Unlike Mr Roberts--I don't know how he comes out with exactly this line of reasoning and then comes down on ""A""--this brings me to a policy of gradual snugging I would emphasize what he says that an  -60-    3/28-29/83  abrupt change from where we are now would be disastrous A gradual snugging is called for and a move back toward [aggregates] targeting is called for I would come down somewhere in the ""B"" to ""C"" range to allow for some gradual snugging According to what I read in the Bluebook, that wouldn't necessarily imply any dramatic upward change in interest rates, unless we went all the way to ""C"" And even that only talks about a moderate increase in short rates, the way I read it So, I'd go for a policy of ""B"" toward ""C,"" gradually reining in growth and version number II of the statement, which moves back toward using the traditional methods of targeting rather than the pure discretion that we have now If you look at the changes, we are targeting interest rates so clearly that it's just amazing how steady it is The standard deviation of the weekly average of the daily fed funds rate has come down by 60 percent since October It's now down from 1/2 to 3/4 of a percent weekly fluctuation to less than 1/4 percent, so we're just perfect We're just shooting right at an interest rate target That's what we're doing And the market is starting to see that And I think it's a mistake to go to interest rate targeting, especially in that narrow a band It's incredible how much we are targeting interest rates We're back to it; it got us in trouble last time; and we ought to start leading ourselves away from it That's the argument I would make on where to go from here "
2310,1983-05-24," What about military procurement prices? Procurement is picking up Is that captured in any of the other indexes or is this the only one that really captures what the government is paying for all this defense [spending]?  The WPI ought to capture some of it  What I'm hearing is that the government is really paying up for spare parts and things like that because capacity to produce has been run down in a lot of specialized activities Do you hear anything like that--that now's the time to be selling nuts and bolts to the government?  Don't push them!  I'll very quickly report on our region We are fairly optimistic about the near term I come out with an overall feeling much like Jerry Corrigan's that the next two or three quarters look fairly decent Current performance is pretty positive all the way around on employment Most people are starting to notice that we are really getting into a very heavy wholesale buying center role down in Atlanta All the merchants for hundreds of miles around come down to our merchandise mart operation and buy, and one can really see what is going to happen in the next few months At least the sentiment of the buyers is up; the buying of clothing for fall and winter and spring is way up over last year And our taxable retail sales [gains] are well up into the double digit range, contrary to the national figures As somebody said earlier, and I agree with it, the Redbook doesn't seem to agree with the national figures at all Our District certainly doesn't Two areas of great concern to us are the area that's adjacent to Bob's territory, which until the oil bloom came off was always one of our greatly optimistic areas and now that has reversed There the drilling came down and all the people in oil and energy-related activities are very deeply concerned about the decline of drilling, defaults on the loans, etc Relating to that is the banking stability picture Most of the concern expressed around the table has been about the international concerns We are still experiencing very severe difficulty Governor Partee, I don't know why you're smiling up there  Yes You should all be aware of the fact that there is to be more excitement in Tennessee in the next few days, as Governor Partee and some of you may know, because the Tennessee banking situation really is quite desperate There is a substantial number of banks--even a few beyond the Butcher bank empire--that look pretty shaky to us And when you look at the national figures for banking--! We've just finished looking at the FDIC summary of the whole industry and I was amazed to see something like a 72 percent increase in write-offs in 1982 Write-offs for the whole industry net  -15-    5/24/83  of recoveries went up from under $4 billion to $6-1/2 or $7 billion I don't know whether any of the staff people really follow these numbers but usually the huge increase is the year after the recession So, I'm beginning to wonder what the poor bankers are going to have to write off in 1983--if they had to go up from under $4 billion in write-offs to almost $7 billion in 1982--with the lags in recognition, if they are forced with all that's going on in the international area to put in bigger provisions for any of the Latin American and Eastern European [loans]  Yes From the reports I've been hearing from Dresdner, Commerce, and so on, it sounds as if they feel that they've taken the heavy hit and really worked hard at cleaning up their books  So, I'm as concerned about the condition of some of our banks as the rest of you are concerned about the condition of the international banks I'm not sure [about the latter] In the macro picture I come out where Jerry does The next few quarters look pretty good to me The big question is the one we were raising about whether the staff will be right I've never wanted to pray harder that they're right But I must say I share some of the skepticism that has been voiced about whether we can continue to keep inflation down as well as they say we will I hope they're right, but that forecast is hard to visualize against the monetary and fiscal backdrop that we have right now  May I ask one question? Someone was talking about counting on a $30 billion tax boost Where is this fiscal [legislation]? Is that tax reduction in the bag now or is somebody talking about trying to recapture some of it?  I know what it is The question is--  So it is in the bag  So, it's the indexing that's up for grabs now, the way you read it  -16-    5/24/83  These are countries that aren't having all this deregulation business So it's--  What do you make of it? I infer from what you've said that except in Canada it's not due to deregulation, so that would mean that the staffs of other central banks can't be telling them what ours is telling us about it all being due to shifts and stock adjustments, etc  Yes, but my question is How are they explaining it? We're explaining it away as shifts in demand  I'm with the group that wants to snug moderately for one reason I'll confess to paranoia about Ml, especially when it's happening on a global scale and in countries which don't have the institutional problems that we have to explain it away I do think the worldwide expansion of money as conventionally measured is of enough significance to warrant conservative action on the part of our central bank With regard to the timing, I think we have to remember the lags related to what we do now If we wait until we can see the real economy exploding in front of us, then we're doing what we always do--we're too late What we do today basically affects what will happen in the economy one year into the recovery And that's why we should do it now, not later So, I'm for a slight snugging, with perhaps a borrowing requirement of somewhere around $400 million-- enough to let short-term rates go up to give a signal to the market that we are not going to ignore completely all of what is going on in the monetary area and in the real economy  Yes, the market might understand what you're trying to do if it got to 9 percent! Seriously, isn't it slicing the bologna a little thin to say we're going to snug up 1/4 percentage point or less than 1/4 point if we average it?  You're back to adjusting by eighths, Mr Volcker  You don't have to go!  It could be perfectly consistent  April was clearly the aberration It's not 6 months; it's 8 months Since last August we've had double digit growth every month except January, which was 98 percent and April which was -31 percent So, the trend is clear for Ml You can't say [May] is a one-month observation You could say you don't believe in Ml, but you can't say there has only been one month of abnormal growth We've had essentially 9 months with one [exception]; if anything, April is the freak month  By a statistically deviant amount!  I think there's no danger that the market will think that's what we're doing now when we adjust the rate by 1/8 or 1/4 of a percentage point  At $350 million, it's minus $42 million; at $400 million, it's plus $8 million  I don't see, unless you don't want to snug at all, how we can snug with any less vigor than that statement If I had a girlfriend that snuggled like that, I'd fire her!  You can't vote twice!  At least use the left hand and the right hand  Can those who are not voting not be starved into submission?  SPEAKER(?) No  SPEAKER(?) Sorry  I'll verify that you're a snugger  The legal counsel is-- "
2371,1983-08-23," So that I understand, I'm trying to summarize for myself what you said just now Would it be fair to say that you're saying either do it whole hog or don't do it?  I'm just looking at the trend for the last four quarters Starting with the third quarter of 1982, Ml has grown by 61, 13, 14, and 12 percent and nominal GNP [growth] was well below it for the first three of those four quarters Then in the last quarter, the second quarter of this year, velocity has finally made a comeback and is now running ahead That reinforces in my thinking what John is saying about the likelihood of a rebound toward more normal velocity What worries me was that we could really see this surge M1 was surging way ahead of nominal GNP and now all of a sudden nominal GNP has zoomed ahead on a concurrent basis That obviously isn't the right way to look at it, but that's the way a lot of people around here have been talking about it for the last few quarters So, if you want to continue talking in that vein, we should now be concerned about the fact that the second-quarter nominal GNP went up by 13 percent when Ml went up by a little less  Nationwide?  It seems high  Since you asked yesterday for some comparisons I don't know how many of the models you follow, but we do that all the time And I feel great listening to Steve and Jim and so on, if one can only believe all this The others that we track, such as Townsend-Greenspan, DRI, and Harris--your alma mater is forecasting even lower rates, as you must know--and Chase all are giving forecasts very similar to what the staff has So, that kind of alternative makes one feel better I think it would be beautiful if it comes true, but--  That's what worries me  No  Well, I just have the T-bill and the prime rates All four of those outsiders expect, by the second quarter of 1984, the prime to be the same as it is this quarter on average and T-bill rates to be maybe 1/2 percentage point or more lower I don't know about bond rates; I didn't get that  -17-    8/23/83 "
