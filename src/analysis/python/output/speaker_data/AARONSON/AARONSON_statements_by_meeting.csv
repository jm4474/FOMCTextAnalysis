8364,2008-12-15,"  I will be referring to the exhibits that follow the green   nonfinancial cover page  The indicators that we have received since the last FOMC  meeting suggest that real activity has been contracting rapidly, and as Dan has  described, financial conditions have continued to deteriorate  Starting with the labor  market, private payroll employment (the inset box in the top panel) plunged 540,000  in November, and the figures for September and October were revised down  noticeably  All told, November’s drop brought the three-month decline in private  employment (the black line in the top panel) to an annual rate of 42 percent—a much  steeper pace of job loss than we were expecting in the previous Greenbook  The  retrenchment in November was pervasive across both goods- and service-producing  industries  As shown in the middle left panel, initial claims for unemployment  insurance have continued their steep climb since the November survey week,  consistent with a further large drop in employment in December     Meanwhile, in the household sector, nominal sales at the retail control grouping of   stores (the inset box in the middle right panel) declined 15 percent in November,  which given a large energy-driven price decline, translates into an increase in real  spending for the month  We had been expecting real outlays in this category to fall  further  As shown by the rightmost blue bar, with the latest retail sales number, we  now think that real PCE on goods other than motor vehicles is on track to fall at an  annual rate of 5¼ percent, not as bad as the 9¼ percent decline we projected in the  Greenbook but still very weak  Near-term indicators of consumer spending point to  further weakness in the coming months  Notably, the Reuters/University of Michigan  survey index of consumer sentiment, plotted in the bottom left panel, remained at  recessionary low levels in the first part of December  Sales of light vehicles (the  bottom right panel), which slumped in October, fell further in November, to an annual  rate of 101 million units, a much slower pace than we had anticipated  Anecdotal  reports suggest that sales are soft again this month  Given the weak fundamentals for  demand and tight credit, we project vehicle sales to remain depressed over the next  several months     As shown in the top left panel of exhibit 2, residential construction has continued   to slide  Single family starts fell further, to 441,000 units—somewhat lower than our  expectations—and permits continued to move down last month  In the business  sector, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft (the red line in the  top right panel) dropped for a third straight month in October; and with orders falling  below shipments for a second consecutive month, the backlog of unfilled orders   December 15–16, 2008 107 of 284    shrank further  Yesterday, the Board released data on industrial production in  November  Total IP (the inset box in the middle panel) fell 06 percent in November   Excluding the effects of rebounds from the Boeing strike and September hurricanes,  IP moved down 16 percent last month  The black line in the panel plots the three- month diffusion index of manufacturing IP, a measure reflecting the net fraction of  industries that experienced an increase in production  As you can see, over the past  few months that number has plummeted to 21, indicating that the contraction in  industrial activity has been remarkably widespread  Overall, the incoming data led us  to steepen significantly the contraction in real GDP that we are forecasting for the  current quarter and the first quarter of next year  In these two quarters, we expect  output to decline at an average annual rate of nearly 5 percent  In both quarters, a  significant chunk of the revisions has come in private domestic final purchases (lines  3 and 4 of the table)  In addition, the available indicators suggest that firms are acting  aggressively to limit unwanted increases in their inventories  As shown in line 5,  firms have been drawing down inventories at a moderate pace in the second half, and  we expect even faster liquidation next quarter in response to the sizable contraction  under way in final sales       Your next exhibit focuses on the medium-term outlook, starting with some of the   key background factors that have influenced our thinking about the outlook since the  October Greenbook  On the downside, as noted earlier, financial conditions have  deteriorated further in recent weeks  As can be seen in the top left panel, the index of  financial stress that we track continued to rise sharply  One important component of  that increase in stress has been the further widening of corporate bond spreads for  investment-grade issues (shown by the gray shaded area in the top right panel)  In  addition, equity prices are lower than we projected, taking an even bigger bite out of  household resources  Meanwhile, in the external sector, the path of the dollar (shown  in the middle right panel) is somewhat stronger than in our October forecast, and the  outlook for foreign economic activity has weakened further  Shaghil Ahmed will  have more to say about these developments shortly     As you know from reading Part 1 of the Greenbook, in light of the intensification   of recessionary forces that emerged over the intermeeting period, we based this  forecast on the assumption of a lower level of the federal funds rate than in our  previous projection (not shown)  In addition, we now assume that $500 billion in  new fiscal stimulus actions will be enacted early next year, on top of the roughly  $165 billion in the stimulus package enacted earlier this year  These assumed fiscal  actions include permanent tax cuts for most individuals, higher transfer payments,  grants to state and local governments, and support for housing  As shown in the  bottom left panel, these new federal programs boost the impetus to GDP growth from  fiscal policy considerably relative to our assumptions in the October Greenbook   Two other factors also provide more support to real activity in this forecast  First,  mortgage rates (the bottom right panel) have fallen about ½ percentage point since the  October Greenbook  With the spread over the 10-year Treasury yield still quite wide,  we project that mortgage rates will fall further over the projection period  Second, oil  prices (not shown) have fallen more in recent weeks than we anticipated in the   December 15–16, 2008 108 of 284    October Greenbook; the lagged effects of these declines provide a greater lift to  spending in 2009       The top left panel of your next exhibit summarizes our medium-term projection    On balance, we expect that the factors restraining activity will far outweigh the  supportive influences, with real GDP falling at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first  half of next year  The decline is led by a steep drop in business fixed investment  (lines 5 and 6)  In the second half of the year, real activity begins a slow recovery as  PCE (line 3) picks up and residential investment (line 4) begins to stabilize  In 2010,  the recovery is projected to gain momentum as household spending strengthens  further and business purchases of equipment and software begin to rise  As is typical,  the recovery in nonresidential investment is expected to lag     By postwar standards, we are projecting a deep, prolonged recession and a very   sluggish recovery  The middle left panel provides some perspective  The black line  shows the level of real GDP, indexed to its own peak, in the second quarter of 2008   By way of comparison, the red and blue lines show the paths of real GDP during the  recessions that started in November 1973 and July 1981, respectively  As can be  seen, the projected contraction in real GDP in the current episode is about in line with  that experienced during those two earlier “big” recessions, but our projected recovery  is noticeably more prolonged  The box to the right summarizes some of the important  factors that impede the projected recovery  First, we think that the economy will  continue to face significant (albeit moderating) financial headwinds over the next two  years, with elevated risk premiums, restrictive lending conditions, and general  uncertainty restraining real activity for some time to come  Second, tight monetary  policy did not help generate the current recession, and we don’t see monetary ease as  likely to generate as much impetus to recovery  In fact, as the third bullet point notes,  the federal funds rate is already close to the zero lower bound, greatly limiting the  scope for conventional monetary policy to provide further stimulus to real activity       The importance of this last factor is illustrated by the bottom set of panels  The   exercise is similar to the simulations presented in the Bluebook, except that this one  allows the federal funds rate to turn negative  The green line in the bottom left panel  shows the simulated federal funds rate path  If unconstrained, the optimal funds rate  would fall below zero in early 2009 and drop to negative 5½ percent in the third  quarter of 2010  In this scenario, the unemployment rate, shown in the middle panel,  peaks at 7¾ percent in 2009—about ½ percentage point lower and a year earlier than  in the Greenbook projection  The four-quarter change in core PCE prices, shown at  the right, bottoms out at just over 1¼ percent in mid-2010 and then turns up, in  contrast with the continued deceleration in the extended staff forecast  In the context  of the zero bound, achieving an outcome for real activity and inflation consistent with  the unconstrained optimal control exercise would likely require some combination of  greater fiscal stimulus and nontraditional monetary actions than we have built into the  current projection        December 15–16, 2008 109 of 284    Your final exhibit summarizes the outlook for inflation  As shown in line 1 of the  top left panel, we now project that total PCE price inflation will slow to about  1 percent in 2010, while the core rate (line 7) falls to 08 percent  The decline in  inflation reflects a combination of widening slack in resource utilization, reduced  energy and materials prices, and a net decline in core import prices; these factors also  push down long-run inflation expectations  I should note that we received data on the  November CPI this morning  The total CPI fell 17 percent, driven by a sharp drop in  energy prices  The core CPI was unchanged last month  We had been expecting an  increase of 01 percent  One measure of resource utilization, the unemployment rate,  is projected to reach 8¼ percent in 2010  In our forecast, the wide unemployment  rate gap puts substantial downward pressure on costs and prices  However, as  suggested in the middle left panel, we may be overstating the downward pressure on  inflation caused by slack  In particular, the current cycle has been associated with  especially large employment declines in several industries, notably construction and  finance  If these declines are leading to an unusual amount of employment  reallocation across industries, structural unemployment would increase, which in turn  would raise the NAIRU       The remaining panels present some analysis of the issue using a measure of   sectoral reallocation and a set of Beveridge curves  The middle right panel depicts an  index of sectoral employment reallocation across industries  The index is based on  the growth rates of employment in 15 industries relative to the growth rate of total  employment, adjusted at the industry level for typical cyclical movements in  employment shares and is similar in spirit to a measure constructed at the Chicago  Fed  As can be seen, even after removing the typical cyclical behavior, increases in  sectoral reallocation often occur around recessions, which is not surprising since each  business cycle produces a unique set of imbalances  Indeed, the amount of sectoral  reallocation indicated by this measure has been rising over the past year or so   However, to date it remains low relative to previous spikes in reallocation  Another  way to determine whether there has been a rise in structural unemployment is through  the so-called Beveridge curve, two versions of which are shown in the bottom panels   The version at the bottom left plots the unemployment rate, adjusted for the  Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, on the horizontal axis against the  job openings rate, measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey  (JOLTS), on the vertical axis  The bottom right panel shows a Beveridge curve  calculated using the Help-Wanted Index as the measure of job openings  If there has  been a significant increase in structural unemployment, then one would expect that  for a given level of the job openings rate, the unemployment rate would be unusually  high—that is, to the right of the plotted Beveridge curve  This might occur, for  example, if many of the job openings were for nurses but a disproportionate number  of the unemployed were bond traders, who are not qualified for the job openings   [Laughter]       So, what do these Beveridge curves say about structural unemployment?  The   blue and red circles in the two panels show the data points for the third quarter of  2008 and for the most recent months available  The latest readings from the JOLTS   December 15–16, 2008 110 of 284    do stand to the right of the estimated curve, while the latest readings from the Help- Wanted Index are closely in line with past experience  At this point we are reluctant  to draw strong conclusions from just a couple of observations from either measure,  and we read the evidence as consistent with at most a small increase in structural  unemployment thus far  Of course, these data do not tell us what will happen in the  coming quarters, when we anticipate further job losses in financial services and  continued weakness in construction and manufacturing  Shaghil will continue our  presentation      I’m Stephanie Aaronson   December 15–16, 2008 118 of 284     Exactly  It is a Lilien type of dispersion index  This isn’t actually   how we calculate it, but it is essentially how the industry’s share of employment changes relative   to total employment  So it is the growth in that industry’s employment relative to total   employment  What we do is that we know that over the business cycle each industry has a   typical pattern—durables employment goes down a lot during recessions whereas, say, health   care doesn’t go down that much  Those types of changes aren’t typically associated with sectoral   reallocation  That is, we don’t really think of those things that are typical over the cycle as being   associated with an increase in the NAIRU  We want to take those out, so we take out the typical   cyclical movements, such as manufacturing always goes down in a recession and finance is   acyclical    Housing and construction always go down, so we take that out, and   then we say, okay, so now there are these atypical movements that are greater than we usually   December 15–16, 2008 119 of 284    see  That is what we would consider the sectoral reallocation  That is what is left over  You can   see, as I mentioned in the briefing, that actually during recessions there is a lot of sectoral   reallocation, even once you take out the usual declines in employment that differ across   industries  That is because each recession has different causes  Different industries have grown   a lot during the boom—like finance recently or, say, communications during the late 1990s—and   those sectors are going to shrink more than usual during the recessions and get back to more of   an equilibrium state  That is what is going on here    I have looked at that, and actually, it doesn’t make that much of a   difference  Construction goes down in every recession, and so by that measure sectoral   reallocation is higher in every recession  I mean, construction is contributing more to sectoral   reallocation here than in previous recessions because the declines have been larger  So that fact   December 15–16, 2008 120 of 284    is captured  The fact that construction is having a larger-than-typical decline is precisely what is   captured here  But even if you said, okay, well, maybe in every recession industries shrink and   that is associated with some sectoral reallocation, the measure actually looks very similar—not   just across the current episode but across all the episodes    Minimizing the unemployment rate and the deviations of inflation from   its target    If I can also just put this in a little more context—by the end of 2010,   the gap on the unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control is about   1 percentage point  So if you use a simple rule of thumb from an Okun’s law type of model, that   would be a couple of percentage points on the level of GDP  GDP would have to grow a couple of   percentage points faster over 2009 and 2010 to close that 1 percentage point gap in the   unemployment rate between the baseline and the optimal control  "
