41,1976-04-20,"  It would have some implications for the yen-dollar [relationship] since  there will be more purchases of yen and holdings of yen, but in our experience the yen-dollar  relationship is independent of the [dollar’s] relationships with [currencies in] Europe, so it’s sort  of in a separate channel  So we’ll not have a generalized effect, as far as the US dollar is  concerned, against other currencies     No, I don’t think so, perhaps over the long run some of the other countries  in Asia might make specific use of the yen as an intervention currency, but that’s a long way  down the road     874-875     When I talked with them, I made it very clear that we would look to their  Fund drawing rights as a takeout if necessary  This is the way we have always handled it,  making very clear what the takeout would be, but not [making a specification] as we have in the  Italian case and, as Alan has suggested, in the British case  That is, not making it a specific firm  condition of the drawing that the funds be there  They understand the background to it, but we  haven’t formally made it a condition of the drawing  "
119,1976-07-19,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     That’s right, this Thursday  An exchange of cables has been made  And  we fully expect them to repay the other [unintelligible] at least by maturity     Yes, well, the Mexican situation is stable, but it hasn’t turned [out] as  favorably as they had hoped  They had the large outflows at Easter time, occasionally drawing  on us, and then several newspaper articles in the US suggested they might devalue, which  halted the usual reflows after the Easter period  Now the outflow from Mexico has slowed, but  there is still a steady drip drip of outflows  They’ve passed their election period, they have their  new President, but there remains a lack of a reflow to--     7/19-20/76 - 21 -     He will be inaugurated on December 1, and most of the people in the  financial community are counting every day until that is done     Well, they’ve lost confidence in the current President, and there are  serious labor negotiations that are under way now  The talk is of 15-25 percent wage increases,  which could seriously undercut all of their efforts at this stage to restore stability     Yes, painfully  We have the remaining $824 million equivalent of the  Belgian franc drawing coming up to the 20th renewal for their [unintelligible]  We’ve made  good progress on this one, and with any luck we might even be able to repay the full amount  within the next three months  On that basis I recommend renewal  The Swiss franc swap  drawings in the amount of $11472 billion are also up for their 20th renewal on August 13   Although the Swiss franc rate has stabilized, it is still at an exceedingly high rate, and I see no  immediate prospect of our beginning to acquire significant [unintelligible]  I recommend  renewal there, too  "
144,1976-08-17,"  The snake is essentially a political animal, and if the governments make a  political commitment to continue it, then it will continue  It surprises a lot of people that it has  lasted as long as it has  It’s hard to make any projection simply on a market orientation or on an  economic orientation     The small countries want to continue the snake  They feel very strongly  [about it] and want to have a fixed relationship with the German mark  But the continued  repetitive blowouts in the exchange market make it very difficult for them to continue it  It could  break up     It would be the second time, coming early October     Yes, that would be the end of six months     There are some in dollars as well  "
165,1976-09-21,"  I have a kind of answer to that question  We were talking to people in the  market on that  As soon as they devalued, the Mexicans called a number of the US banks to see  if they could get additional credit lines and did obtain some credit lines with New York banks   Several of the people in New York say that the image of Mexico is somewhat tarnished  [regarding] borrowings  So they may say they’re getting a lot of money, but it’s on the basis of a  major effort they have made, and, as I say, this word “tarnished” has come up     The Treasury still has all that gold that the swaps were entered into to  protect, so the loss that we have now is the value of gold--   ]  Mr Chairman, at the Desk, I have been going under  the assumption that we have no takeout and no assistance from the Treasury  That every  operation has to be self-liquidating in the exchange market, and every swap line liquidated  throughout the operations in this--     9/21/76 - 8 -    "
189,1976-10-19,"  I hate to break the mood with my usual list of horrors from the exchange  market here       [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     In order to resolve the current situation, yes  But I wouldn’t know how far  to go in order to resolve the current market situation  I think more depends on the other  measures that have been taken over the course of recent months to deal with the underlying  problems  the tightening of monetary policies, the tightening of fiscal policies  There have been  a number of measures in dealing with the basic wage cost push that these countries have  But  they had hoped to buy some time with this; I’m not sure that they did--that they bought sufficient  time     Yes--that they paid us and that they drew on the Treasury line  "
228,1976-11-16,"  It’s a goodly number, I think 10 or a dozen     Right     No, I think the swap arrangements, as they are set forth now, cover the  ground well  I think in the context of the recent experience we’ve had with Italy, Britain, and the  Mexicans, we can, on a case-by-case basis, make the adjustments we need in swap arrangements  to appropriate provisions at the time  We have thought very carefully in New York that there  might be some suggestion of changes in the swap arrangement itself, but at this stage I see no  reason to do so  Rather, I would prefer to continue it as now, on a case-by-case basis, to make  determinations of conditions to fit the situation     And Britain and Italy     No, nothing formal at this stage  Feelers from time-to-time  "
254,1976-12-20,"  We even consult with the foreign monetary authorities     Alan Holmes and I have gone over this document with great care from the  beginning  In effect, this describes an even more flexible approach than we are currently  following  So we are quite comfortable with the overall limits that are placed here  I’m happy to  be securely secured in line because I don’t want to have too much rope to hang myself  There is  enough risk in the operations that we have, so that we want to consult frequently and in detail on  the kind of operations we have       12/20-21/76 - 18 -         We will make every effort, and have made every effort, to consult in advance, and even in  the case that Henry Wallich mentioned, just recently, where Charlie Coombs had to go into  market, he was in the process of making phone calls [at] 15-minute and half-hour [intervals], and  secured what clearance he needed  So this is a fair document  It describes what we have been  doing up to this time  We are very comfortable with it, and we will be operating on an even  more narrowly restricted basis in consultation with the Chairman and the subcommittee and the  full Committee     Taxes  The Europeans find it’s taxes  As incomes rise and time structures  stay the same, the bite out of income becomes greater, then you have the wife more inclined to  go out to work     Governor Partee, it was early in the period when the drop in rates was a  lot more than the drop in the funds rate  Most recently, the funds rate has, in my view in any  event, caught up a little bit, but not entirely, with the drop in the market  The three-month bill  rate started out below the 5 percent funds rate, of course, where the funds rate was at the time of  the Committee meeting, and has dropped not too differently from the funds rate  And most  recently, for example, the commercial paper rate has come up a little bit, so the bill rate again  has dropped more  So I think there’s a little bit of anticipation in the [unintelligible] funds rate  decline, but not a large anticipation  I don’t think we’re very far out of line, we’re just somewhat  out of line with the [unintelligible]     I think so  "
281,1977-01-17,  Yes     It’s using a different instrument     I talked to the Deputy Governor last Friday  
306,1977-02-15,"  All press releases we have had have indicated that it would be done  directly [with the Swiss authorities] to avoid any market impact     No  It is one of three options  And to some degree we are buying German  marks and French francs in the market, which we then supply to the Swiss when they need them   And the other options  "
332,1977-03-15,"  There is an ambivalence there     It was reported in the last Basle meeting, though, that there has been more  investment interest from the United States to be seen in the European gold market--investor  interest, whatever that means  But both from the spot and the futures market  "
357,1977-04-19,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Now by a net of 1-1/2 percent ,and that’s from the December figures  We  started at around 279, got down to 271   "
446,1977-07-19,"  The Bundesbank reaches to the beginning of 1976, and they say it’s on the  order of 19 percent     One of the problems that we’ve had with floating exchange rates is the  tendency to overshoot and to have exaggerated movements of rates  Many people in the central  bank community have been rather pleased that they have avoided some of these wide swings that  we had in ’73, ’74, and coming into ’75  And now, partly [given] the perception in other  markets, but more on the basis of these announcements, we have a very sharp swing effect   There’s no stopping the sharp swinging effect  We’re running the risk [that] other wide  fluctuations will perhaps have to develop later on, which, as far as US policy is concerned,  would be embarrassing  So it’s better to have something that is in line with fundamentals than  exceeding it     Probably a statement by the Treasury that it’s satisfied with the rate  movement would help a heck of a lot more than any intervention     The Treasury could have bailed us out     7/19/77 - 8 -    "
473,1977-08-16,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Yes, 35 plus 43     Oh, well, in the total operation, it had been somewhat over $100 million  between June and July  And $88 million reported last month     I’m building up balances very gradually, dollar averaging as the dollar  rate rises  Buying marks at times when the dollar is rising particular sharply, again on the idea of  avoiding disorderly conditions     Yes, I think the central banks have found that, as we did in the fixed-rate  world, that the last place you want to be is at the upper limit with no flexibility whatsoever, just  taking in taking in currencies or handing them out  And that to maintain the flexibility of     8/16/77 - 2 -           intervention, it’s better to start somewhat earlier, and the central banks in the EC snake group do  intervene in dollars at their own discretion and with the approval of the group prior to reaching  the outer limit  And the practice in recent months has been to avoid getting to the outer limit if  they can  That’s when the big speculative pressures, one-way pressures, are likely to emerge     They have from time to time, but not in transactions outside the fund, the  pooling arrangement  There are all kinds of bonds that are being issued, and so forth, and  currencies come into their hands  We have the odd situation where the Bank of France is now  operating much more in German marks, and at one stage they were buying dollars and selling  marks, trying to position the franc somewhere in between the dollar and the mark as the two  currencies were moving  So there’s a lot more flexibility on the part of the central banks both in  and out of the snake, in dollars and other currencies     Morning telephone--     Yes, well they have consultation calls three times a day  And that’s  working out fine  We, of course, receive a call--from the so-called captain of the day, after they  finish their day--and get the full information  We ourselves make an early morning call, around  7, and several other [calls] during the course of the morning, and pick up the same sort of  information  Now that they know that we are hooked in on the system, it’s working very well     Not full exchange, but much more than there used to be  There are still  some elements, particularly on some of the more delicate intervention operations, which are  passed at a higher level  But we get the information we need     No recommendations     8/16/77 - 3 -          "
501,1977-09-20,"  Are you talking about foreign exchange?     Yes, they do operate in the New York market     Yes, we call them, and they inform us if there is any extra on the next day  "
525,1977-10-17,"  It depends on who you talk to within the New York Bank staff     All right  I’m not a forecaster  I think that most economists would come  up with a forecast very close to what Mr Truman has just outlined  I’m skeptical, myself, of any  forecast on the trade account  In recent years we’ve had errors on the order of $20 billion--in ’75  and ’76     Yes, but the people in the exchange market are following these numbers,  [and] to the extent that the trade balance does improve or weaken, this will influence thinking  about the dollar     We’re about where we closed last night, but the dollar was lower earlier  today and other central banks [unintelligible]     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     It was taken out of context  This was a press conference on other matters,  and someone asked him [paraphrasing], “Well, what do you think about the rise in the Japanese  yen lately?”  And he said, “Well, there hasn’t been much rise, has there?”  And they said, “Oh  yes, it’s gone up such and such,” and got into a discussion of the appreciation, which has been  only about 1 or 2 percent  He said, “Well, that’s not very much  If you really want to have an  effect on the trade balance, you need a very large appreciation”     Yes  It was in an “if” clause, however, rather than a--     He said “if”     That’s right, but it’s the way it was interpreted, and it was yanked right  out of context  It’s like any--     That’s right     Well, he was making an analytic point, that, if you’re going to have an  effect on the trade account, you’re going to need an awfully large change in the exchange rate  under the current circumstances  But he wasn’t advocating that, it’s just the point he was  making  But the Reuters people, who weren’t there at the time, went over the transcript and  yanked these two or three sentences out of the transcript  Everything else that he said     10/17-18/77 - 30 -         disappeared--was not used by the press  And it came at a particular time when the market was  quiet  You have this tendency of the press to use these things     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     I have a brief bit later on  The economy is not performing that badly; we  have growth here  Other countries don’t have much growth  Our rate of inflation is lower than  in most other countries  We’ve had currencies that are rising--their rates of inflation are 10, 12,  15 percent  The market has lost perspective on many of the fundamentals with this exaggerated  focus on the trade deficit and what the United States government is going to do about the trade  deficit     And interest rates have risen     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     At the moment, the market is not focusing too much on interest rates  At  the moment  But if some of these other fears were calm, then they would be focusing on interest  rates  The general feeling, perhaps, is that there might be further firming of interest rates here,  but I don’t think people expect much further rise     Well, at the Desk we haven’t had any pressures to do more  We’ve been  working very closely, of course, with the Bundesbank, the Swiss National Bank, but there have  been some rumblings from the Swiss, particularly, that the US ought to do more  But that’s  again in the context that the Bundesbank had done $900 million and the Swiss $1 billion, and  they still haven’t really resolved the problem they face in the market  The Swiss have a  particular problem because their currency is rising against everyone, once again; it moved above  parity with the German mark just today  So they’re more concerned  But I think in this episode  we have less pressure on us now from the others than we have had with earlier episodes  But at  the same time, we’re on a spot, since it is US policy which is in question, and a number of times  the market participants have called us and said we’re glad to see you in the market today     10/17-18/77 - 31 -           Oh, yes, disappointed     At base, this is one of the elements, but I think as central bankers, we’re  all more concerned with the financial flows and the relative stability of our market  To have  these vast amounts of money moving across the market is a problem for any central banker  I  think, though, in response to Governor Wallich’s point, that if the market felt that we would be  prepared to do $20 billion, then that amount of intervention would not be needed by anybody   And it’s a part of the question whether we are prepared to support, defend--whatever word you  want to use--our own currency  And any indication coming out of Washington or anywhere else  that the US wants to see a particular result starts a new wave of selling the dollar     Right  The British, if they buy another dollar today, it’ll just go right into  their reserves and into our bond market  If we were to buy another dollar today it would have  more effect on market psychology  This is what we’re facing--psychological markets     Well, it’s hard to measure  At the request of the Chairman a few months  ago, we have been watching very carefully for any concrete indications of shifts of funds by the  OPEC central banks, in particular, and it’s very hard to trace this because they are very  sophisticated in the manner in which they carry out their transactions  I had a feeling, [during]  this last go-round of big payments to some of the OPEC [countries] at mid-month, that more of  the funds were converted out of dollars into marks and Swiss francs than we’ve had in recent  months  But this was more from comments we heard from the market and the reaction we had  when we went into the market ourselves--that it took more intervention on our part to quiet the  market on a particular day than we would have otherwise     Yes, and we don’t get very concrete answers either  But they do point out  that they are concerned about the dollar and point out the scenario that, if the dollar continues to  decline, then they have no other choice but to continue to diversify to Swiss francs, marks, and  other currencies, yen, in order to maintain the value of their international reserve     It varies with the country     But in some cases I think they’re just not telling us the [truth]--they say  they’re still in dollars, investing in dollars, and so forth, and yet we hear from the market that  they’ve been buying other currencies  Since they operate in the Eurocurrency markets, no one  can see them very well, even the others     It’s a process  It’s a management process  These people are all studying  and have advice from consultants in the US and London on how to manage their reserves  And  you’re talking about portfolio management     Well, this is what the policymakers are saying  I’m talking more about  the ones who are managing the portfolios, or funds, whoever deals in that area  Sometimes it’s  the same person, but we’re talking about two different questions     That’s one of the manifestations, I think     Yes  This is part of the reason why it’s so difficult for us to say  categorically that, at one given week or one given month or quarter, there’s more purchases of  D-marks by OPEC central banks then at other periods  We don’t have a link to the direct  transactions picture  The problem in the market is that there are certain banks that operate for  these fellows  Any time those banks appear as heavy buyers of Swiss francs or marks,  everybody rides on the back of us and says okay, here we go, the dollar’s going to decline again  because we’ve got OPEC in the market  And so we do have the psychological reaction to  something, whether it’s real or not     Certainly     It’s perhaps a contributory factor, but I would not call it a major factor     To the extent that we have seen, there is some, perhaps some increase, it is  a factor  We’re not calling it a significant factor  I’d rather place the policy concern on these  other matters that I outlined     But the fear of this--we’re dealing with market fears  We’re not dealing  with facts, we’re dealing with fear  People worry about all of these things to the extent that these  fears [arise], some of them confirmed, then the market jumps  At this stage, the market is  jumping to sell dollars at any opportunity, at any event that somehow can be interpreted as a  negative for the dollar     10/17-18/77 - 34 -           It’s just a matter of erasing the market’s worst fears rather than turning  upside down all the rest of our policy  The market needs reassurance in this       Well, they’re afraid that we want it     Well, this is more the US Treasury than the Federal Reserve     Well, we can’t devalue against the Saudi currency or the [unintelligible]  currency or [against] all these other countries that we’re having a deficit with  The Japanese  [unintelligible]  We have a surplus with Western Europe  And you get into the argument as to  whether a devaluation at this stage would help us  The Treasury’s thinking at this stage is that it  won’t  And this was the point Secretary Blumenthal was trying to make, but the press twisted it  and made it sound as if he was talking about the dollar     I have no formal recommendations, but I would briefly note the situations  which could lead to requests for swap drawings by other central banks    [Situations noted by Pardee not recorded]     But in an exchange market, there’s no direct relationship between the  money supply and what are demands for dollars  At 400 on Thursday afternoon, everybody’s  making a bet on what the numbers are going to be  It’s just like betting on football games on  Sunday  And then, when the numbers come through, they jump one way or the other  Now the  reaction has been, definitely, the aggregates coming in strong, and this would have the  implication Governor Wallich suggested, that interest rates sooner or later will rise, therefore the  dollar would be stronger  But what I’m afraid of now, however, is that some market participants  say that if [the monetary aggregates] continue to come in strong, then you have an adverse  reaction that the dollar will be lower on the kind of considerations Governor Wallich mentioned  "
579,1977-12-19,"  [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Certainly, we have had a number of very interesting and useful studies,  including the studies by the Board’s staff recently, on the real rates of exchange  But at this  moment, and under these conditions, the exchange market is not focusing on rates of inflation as  such  There is concern, and the concern about potential rates of inflation, and I think that’s more  important as one of the many factors influencing the market now than any new and recent figures  we might have on inflation       Well, I’d prefer to be more forceful at the moment and hope to save  overall in the amounts that I use  The problem is, now, we lack credibility  And so to the extent  that we do intervene, people say, well, they’re not going to do very much, so we can rake them  over the coals  If we could be more forceful when we do approach the market, then we might  have more effect  On the other hand, we are facing a market in which it’s a gambling  atmosphere here  We raise the ante, they’ll raise the ante; until we have a change in one or  another of these underlying conditions, it would be very difficult for us to have a major  turnaround in the market simply on our own methods      Well, we have to live up to our responsibilities, and this is a very  disorderly market  So we should be there  It’s a question of how to minimize the damage to us  while we’re also trying to contain the disorder  It’s a very difficult situation      One of the concerns of the marketplace is that the US government wants  exchange rates down--the dollar rates down  Many statements have been made by government  officials, and ourselves when we have had the opportunity, to try to dispel this impression  But it  remains in the market  The fact--     I would not put a strict amount on it  I think we would have to be  prepared ourselves to commit, on a given day, $100 million, $150 million      The thing is, it’s the preparedness, not the amount  I’d say $2 billion or  $3 billion and it would be meaningless  If we started and [gave] the impression to the market  that we were prepared to deal effectively with the market, then we wouldn’t need the big  numbers that I would put on the table     None       You’re right  Once they see the domestic market implications of our  intervention in their currency, they would shrink from it  Even the Bundesbank is beginning to  have second thoughts about how many marks have been created in recent weeks     They are selling dollars right now, and a lot of the transactions in the last  few days have been by US corporations under FASB 8 to straighten out their accounts and  taking their losses--     Not in the market we are dealing with now      Right  I think of that every night before I go to bed     No I used the terms “contained the disorder,” “rear guard action,” these  are the--Mr Volcker also even used the same terms  This is what we have at this stage  We are  waiting for this opportunity which Chairman Burns has suggested, Governor Jackson suggested,  when there is a possibility for a turn in market psychology from other policy changes  Then I  agree with the Chairman, a more forceful approach would be more effective       12/19-20/77 - 41 -         At this moment, if I were to go in and offer $100 million worth of marks and try to choke  the market, the market would gobble them up and say, “Have you got any more?”  Until we have  some help from other policy, we have to continue this very painful operation, which is  embarrassing to me because I often advocated more forceful intervention and in bigger amounts  than we had to  But the amounts out in the marketplace now are so huge that even the modest  approach we’ve had has run up a bigger bill than I would have liked to come to the table with  today      That’s the problem, and that’s why I’m going day-to-day in having it     Well, if we do--     I think, if there is no change in the oil price this week, that will help a  great deal; that’s one of the matters that’s terribly troubling to the market and one of the areas in  which public pronouncements by government officials have been most twisted by the press in  recent months  Get that out of the way and you have some benefit  If there is some agreement  on the energy package before Christmas, that is another area that--at least the language, the  uncertainty--will be reduced  So we can have some benefit even in the next two weeks  The  more fundamental change is further down the road     If something’s done; one of the problems is that nothing is being resolved,  everybody is discussing the same thing  The press is filled up with the same stuff day after day   And if some of these issues just get off the front pages, or off the financial pages, then we’ll have  less to talk about and more time to think about interest rate differentials and rates of inflation and  more fundamental economic issues   [Chairman Burns temporarily turns meeting over to Vice Chairman Volcker]     Well, I do have a recommendation that we have some six swap drawings  in the amount of $136 million equivalent marks coming up for renewal by next FOMC meeting;  and this is the first renewal; it’s not for a formal approval     Yes  In the swap arrangement with the Germans, it’s one renewal, and  then after six months, we have to repay it either out of the market or in direct deals with them   So we have to face a six-month limitation     That’s possible, but we would have to negotiate, and I would have to  bring it forth as a specific recommendation to the Committee for the Committee’s authorization     We’ve done bigger amounts   SPEAKER(?)  Huh?     We’ve done bigger amounts before  "
597,1978-01-05,"  Mr Chairman, we have been following the positions of the banks very  carefully  There is a lag of about two weeks in getting the numbers on positions  We do not have  access to all of the numbers       We have been [seeing] small [moves to] larger positions than normal  But  the banks do not take large positions so that they can turn them very quickly        Basically, the decisions are being made overseas  They are still dealing   with us--or were until this meeting  We are now out of the market  They either are dealing directly  with the New York Reserve Bank or through their branches and agencies here  It is a service task  as far as they are concerned       It depends entirely on the approach  If we approach the market forcefully,  then the market responds favorably  But if we start falling back and act defensively, as we have  over the last three or four months, then we will spend a great deal of money and perhaps lose what  credibility we have regained       In my judgment that should be favorable for us now  Many of the  corporations that had a loss before the end of the year actually sold dollars to take those losses to  their balance sheets  So we could have either a buying of dollars or an absence of offerings of  dollars early in this year, once we get the change in market psychology that we are looking for    "
620,1978-01-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      First, I want to assure everyone that we do not have a rate objective in mind    We do not know what the appropriate rate is or should be  There are no long-term equilibrium  conditions  The underlying elements are changing every day, every week, every month, as changes  in oil prices and changes in other fundamentals take place  So, there is no way in which we can  establish the right rate or hope to establish the right rate  But there are times when the market does  overdo it and moves beyond where we feel the current rates [ought to be based on a] broad element  of judgment in terms of economic fundamentals, market sentiment, and policy considerations   They are exaggerated rates; they’re wrong  This is the term “erratic fluctuations” that people have  used and written into the official literature from time to time      Now, this is seen in the marketplace, and market sentiment is very important  A reading of   market sentiment some say is very important in deciding whether a market is disorderly or not   And some of the elements that Chairman Burns and Mr Volcker mentioned earlier are very  important in my mind in determining whether I think the market is disorderly or not  What are  people thinking?  How are they reacting to the market?  What is the business manager or what is  the foreign exchange trader thinking at the current moment if he sees day after day that the dollar is  declining, when in his better judgment he thinks it shouldn’t be as low as it already is?  [If] he sees  when he comes in each morning that the dollar is 1 percent lower, then he is not going to buy  dollars  He is going to sell dollars even though it’s against his better judgment  So, one of the key  elements of a “disorderly market” is the response of the business manager to news or rumors--we  even had a rumor of a rumor a couple of weeks ago  [For example,] he overreacts to whatever  adverse news or rumors come through and yet when positive news comes through, there is no  reaction  We had a 64 percent unemployment rate [reported recently]  I went into the market  afterwards trying to reinforce what I thought would be a positive reaction  It was a big intervention  for naught  The market just absorbed the [news]  I got out of there as fast as I possibly could  The  market didn’t want to hear good news for the United States dollar     This is the kind of situation in which there is an element of only one-way risks; the trader sees   that the dollar is only going to go down  He himself cannot stand up against the market  That’s a  disorderly market  Now, it’s hard to measure  We can’t [define it quantitatively]--what percent  movement per day or what the width of the spreads are; these are elements in it  But it is a question  of reading the judgment of the people who are the participants in the market  This is what I’m  dealing with  I’m trying to persuade enough people--managers of funds, exporters, and importers-- who all are moving dollars in foreign exchange that tomorrow the dollar won’t be 1 or 2 percent  lower; it might just as easily be 1 or 2 percent higher, or perhaps it will be about where it is now   So, they can make longer-term business judgments and not have to worry about this tugging match  or football game or craps game that has been going on in the exchange market     1/17/78             13      [As for] the risks of disorderliness, I think the Chairman answered that   before in terms of President Roos’s question  If we back out and we have a disorderly market, then  all these other things--       Well, at this stage as long as only a one-way risk is perceived--that the dollar   can only decline--then we’ll have the results the Chairman outlined  Until a two-way risk  reemerges, which is what we’re trying to establish, [that will be the case]  Once a two-way risk is  seen, then we’ll have better markets, and I can’t forecast where the dollar will be       Well, I think--      My estimate is that the biggest portion of funds that go through the exchange   market essentially comes from the corporations--the broad economic relations that we have in this  country as against other countries  We did have a discussion about the role of the banks as  speculators during that interim FOMC [conference call] and I’d rather not pinpoint the speculators  as the problem  The speculators can go either way; if they felt that the dollar would rise, they’d be  buying dollars  This is what I’m trying to persuade a few of them--that maybe the dollar will rise   I think it’s more the broad [unintelligible] and not just multi-nationals either  A lot of people buy  and sell dollars internationally so I can’t quantify it, but I think it’s easy to overplay the role of the  speculator  It’s easy for us to overplay it ourselves since we’re dealing directly with banks and  occasionally we have to deal with some of these fellows who want to move the rate and it does  become a contest of wills  But I wouldn’t want to overemphasize it  I think, as Paul outlined in  that [conference call], we’ve got to persuade the whole market that we mean business       I could give you all kinds of examples, but I don’t want to because I’m afraid   I’ll be giving a misperception      Well, the last two days the market has been settled and we have not had to   intervene  I haven’t talked with the Desk in an hour and a half, but--      I think the point that the Chairman outlined has been gotten across--that the   US authorities are there and that this earlier credibility--      You didn’t let me finish; I was going to give the qualifier  I share your view   but so far, so good      I would simply mention that four swap drawings on the Bundesbank in the   amount of $123 million equivalent of marks are coming up for renewal between now and the next  meeting  These are first renewals and need only to be noted by the Committee at this stage       April, I think   "
645,1978-02-28,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      I=m sorry, but we haven=t had a period of relative calm in which we could   really begin to unwind our positions        That=s right, but it was a very, very tenuous one  During that period, as I say,   the same issues that everybody else was worried about were still there  And if we were seen as a  buyer of [marks] in that period, we could have had a bigger problem on our hands  We had  discussions on several occasions with the Bundesbank on the possibility of their picking up some  marks for us and on a couple of days we might have ended up with some if the market had turned  in our favor  We also carry at this stage a rather substantial accounting loss on the operations we  have engaged in up to this point; and when the turn comes, we should be in a position to take a  profit  I=m rather reluctant to start unwinding this early, both because of the sensitivities of the  market and this profitability question in the back of my mind       2/28/78           5      The two-way approach does provide us with marks  And once the market   turns in our favor, then we will be net buyers of marks without the market necessarily paying much  attention to it  But  if we go into the market flat out and simply start buying ourselves marks, it  would be a matter of a day or two before they=ll say,  “Aha!  The Federal Reserve is covering its  debt; that means the upside risk of the dollar is limited”  Already the operation with the  Bundesbank, which has a serious liquidity problem as a result of the international [situation] in  reabsorbing some of that, is seen in the market as putting a damper on the dollar rate  It=s a very  sensitive situation       In the past we have done both, but we mainly look to the earliest maturities   if we don=t face this problem with the second renewal  Usually, in the cycles that we get into, those  are also the most expensive swaps, so we do take our losses early in the repayment cycle and the  profits later on  But following the normal approach, if we were to acquire marks over the next  couple of weeks, we would repay first those swaps that are coming up in April and take the  substantial losses, reducing our average rate as time goes on  We also have--       We also have a substantial negotiation with the Treasury because they are   in debt, too  And sometimes we have to make accommodations for our part in the operation      I just mentioned them; I didn=t go into a description  If you wish, I can   describe the reasons behind them      Well, the thing is that we have operated exclusively in German marks since   1975, but that=s not the only currency that is the source of the disorder or unsettlement in the  exchange market  Occasionally the Swiss franc clearly is  This very morning we have a higher  Swiss franc, which tends to be pulling up a number of other currencies  And I had to discuss with  people at the Desk whether we should today consider operating in Swiss francs  Our view is that  when the Swiss franc is the source of the unsettlement, then we should consider intervention in  Swiss francs to see if by calming that market we can calm the broader markets for the dollar  But I  know what the criticism is and I feel it very strongly myself  We got into a very deep hole in Swiss  francs  It=s not that important a currency in the broad spectrum of international financial relations  and I have been very sparing in use of this agreement that we had with the Swiss National Bank--to  the extent that at the outset when we decided to go into the market, I negotiated with the Swiss  National Bank that half of our operation in New York would be for our account and half for theirs   Now, the agreement is that the first $25 million that we do in New York is theirs  And from there  on, we might consider whether we would intervene or not  So, on that basis, I have limited our  intervention to $69 million  We have made a gesture in the Swiss franc market  On the days that  we have operated, we have been reasonably effective  But we cannot get ourselves into a stampede  in that particular currency, given this loss problem on our earlier debt  I would also [note that]  there are times when there is a technical case and a philosophical case for intervening in other  currencies But we have avoided that because of the broader policy consideration on maintaining  this operation strictly in marks, with occasional operations in Swiss francs, when I think it is  absolutely defensible to the Committee and to the world at large       Well, I=m hopeful it is defensible to the Committee  I have not heard any   direct criticism and I=m willing to hear it      They have agreed at a policy level, but they have warned us to be   light-fingered  And I have been      They don=t       2/28/78           11      They do very closely coordinate their operations  They=re on the phone back   and forth most of the day      Since 1973 we have operated in five different currencies--the German mark,   Swiss franc, Belgian franc, Dutch guilder, and French franc--under conditions in which those  markets were particularly disorderly  This is the one occasion where we have limited ourselves  strictly to the mark and the Swiss franc  The question of having a rate objective is a delicate one   The market thinks and wants us to have a rate objective quite often  As I mentioned, the market is  pushing us to these benchmark numbers, but we are trying desperately to adhere to the floating rate  principle of not having a rate objective and avoiding the kind of box that other central banks have  moved into when they were actively intervening  The Bank of England did, as does the Bank of  Japan regularly  They tend to fix on a rate--peg a rate and then have to back away  And that=s  when your scale of operations has to grow very big and then you have to have a disorderly retreat   Well, we have had to retreat but we tried to limit the disorder in those periods of retreat  It=s a  difficult gap to fill, but I think our main emphasis is avoiding pegging the rate       It=s a question of the trigger point in the scale in which we are prepared to   operate at the moment  In the early operations back in October, November, and December, we  were prepared to allow a quarter of a percent or a half percent drop in the dollar rate before we  went into the market  And at that moment we would offer 20 million marks perhaps, and then back  away  We backed away repeatedly as one or two or three banks each saw us there and said, “Aha!  They are not willing to do 50 million marks” and they blew us out of the market repeatedly We  came in and we reported to you big operations, big increases in swap debt--$600 million in  December, I think it was--and we were not being effective in the job we were trying to do  One of  the important shifts for us on this active approach was the ability to stay in there when we did go in  and take these fellows out of the market  Sure, on the days that we are operating we will operate on  a bigger scale, but we=ve also been out of the market  There was a period of nearly four weeks in  which we were completely out of the market except for some modest operations       This is not so much on a quarter percent or a half percent  Yesterday I let the   dollar drop a whole percent before we made a gesture to the market, which was sufficient at that  stage  People saw us, [said] “Okay, fine” and then they went back about their business and the  dollar rebounded  It=s that kind of credibility that we need; then we don=t have to operate on a big  scale  As soon as the market recognizes that the Federal Reserve is [in the market they say], “Fine,  we can buy dollars now”  But it is when the market turns to us and says, “Where are you fellows?”  that we then have to do the big amounts  That=s the scale of disorder that we=ve had       There were some sales in Swiss francs going into marks but the basic unit for   dealing [in the market] is the dollar  The dollar rate moved generally across the board against other  currencies  There will be some movements in and out of these other currencies and between these  other currencies        Less so in the spot market than the forward market       Oh, yes    "
684,1978-03-21,"  Thank you Mr Chairman  [Statement--see Appendix]      During this period they have been in full agreement with what we’ve done   I have not had any pressure from them to do any more or any less  Their view has changed with  the atmosphere, too  But currently I’ve had no difficulty       Oh, yes       3/21/78              3    We bought marks from correspondents rather than--      Oh, yes  If I have a rising market, I would like some marks      If I had walked into the market on those days, I would have given the   market an indication of a policy      It was thin  But there were policy discussions going on and [activity by   the Desk] might have given a misleading statement to the market  I wanted to stay on the sideline  because if I had been either a buyer or seller I would have added to the market confusion as to what  official intentions were       It’s one reason why people were so disappointed  Nobody really wants   exchange controls; it’s just that people felt that this would be the next move on the German side  And the Germans have rejected controls very forcefully both publicly and with our counterparts in  Basle  So, as I say, people were watching what the Swiss have done, which actually forced money  out of Swiss francs  And they are afraid the Germans might have to resort to similar controls   There is a lot of talk in the market about the United States imposing controls and I think that has  been firmly rejected by everyone I know on the official side  The great disappointment, I know,  was more over these bonds  The German banks and Swiss bankers--I have talked to some of these  fellows--said they sold dollars out of anger that they did not get the bonds they wanted  They  thought [such bonds] were going to be very attractive for them to hold and to market and they were  looking for those to be in the package When they didn’t see [any reference to them], then they just  sold dollars       Well, Alan was going to cover this question      It’s taking a lot of time      On days in which we are active in the exchange market we may spend up   to an hour or more discussing where we stand under these various limits and it’s taking up the time  of the people who actually have to make the decisions and evaluate the movements in the market   And to the extent we are discussing matters with people here in Washington, we want to discuss the  policy implications and not whether we have $5 million left under this limit    "
708,1978-04-18,"  [Statement--see Appendix]     4/18/78             2       Well, I haven’t seen--  We had one day or two days on which the dollar rose  We do consider the disorder in the context of time  We have been discussing at the Desk--and I  have discussed with members of the Committee--the possibility of our initiating a program of mark  purchases  And this would be done in the context of a firming dollar  But I did not detect any  evidence yesterday or Friday of a disorderly market as far as the dollar was concerned       We have been buying for correspondents and in fact one of the big orders  that we had where there is a question of diversification was 250 [million] marks  We put half of  that into the market and kept [half of] it  There is a judgment that we can make as far as  correspondent businesses are concerned whether we put it into the market or not  We have not  gone out into the marketplace and bid for marks  We have considered it  I was prepared to do it  yesterday if the dollar had continued to rise--again, with the disorderly market consideration  It  had risen at one stage by over a half percent from the fixing range, but things quieted down in the  afternoon        Not in theory, but in the world that we are in right now there is a basic  judgment on the part of the US and German authorities that the dollar is oversold and   undervalued--each individual country uses a different term--or that there has been a movement of  the rate too far in one particular direction  So to the extent that the dollar rises, then this would be  more consistent with underlying conditions  But I am prepared, if the dollar rise becomes too  [sharp] and we have the kinds of conditions which are in the marketplace [unintelligible] I’ll buy  marks  We did on a number of occasions [unintelligible] but we are doing a two-way operation       Mr Chairman, the paper characterized the market yesterday and on Friday as  being broad  Now, perhaps the paper was incorrect  The foreign exchange market was strong and  broad; there was active trading     4/18/78             3       We’re still in losses  Our average rate on our swap drawings is 2125 and  the current rate in the exchange market is 205  That is one of the reasons why I am reluctant to  buy heavily at this stage       I didn’t say euphoria; I said that they are just less pessimistic than they were  before  The exchange traders are still very bearish toward the dollar  They have the same kinds of  analyses that are in the Greenbook  I feel rather surprised that this demand for dollars keeps  coming out of the woodwork  And as I say, it is largely the leads and lags which are being  unwound, which we may not see in the actual transactions  The transactions that are done before  that would not appear in the market now       $304 million       The second renewals  But I have a list of first renewals that I still have to  ask for here before we--       Not yet  As I say, they came to the point where the next generation would  have had to be SDRs  They began to buy some of the marks that we were picking up  So they     4/18/78             6  have a cushion of $60 million worth of marks  They are not interested in making repayments at  this stage but are rather eager also to start buying marks in the market  It’s a first [unintelligible]       As Henry mentioned, we are awaiting specific proposals from the  Bundesbank on the swap repayments, so I won’t go into that  During the month of May, the  System has nine maturing swap drawings on the Bundesbank totaling $304 million and four on the  Swiss National Bank totaling $50 million  These are all first renewals  I recommend that the  Committee approve that these swaps be renewed    "
748,1978-05-16,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       It’s 60-40  [Statement continued]       Well, we haven’t had too many days on which the dollar was rising in what  we would technically call a disorderly market  Last Friday we did have almost a 1 percent rise and  that was the day on which I bought marks--almost $40 million worth of marks       In the market  We went in the market and we used some techniques similar  to those we had used on the downside  That was our first occasion  Now, my sensitivity is that  we’ve gone through a period since last June in which many people in the market were persuaded,  from all of the things that had been said, that the United States government wanted the dollar down  And the massive effort we have engaged in both in the market and through our public relations  techniques--and even now the gold sales--to reassure the market that we don’t want the dollar down     5/16/78              2  has helped  But if we appear in the market in a way which would suggest that we are holding the  rate down now, it would reconfirm a lot of those earlier fears  I think we are in a better position  now to buy in the market than we were a month ago or a few weeks ago  And as far as I’m  concerned, whenever a mark comes in my direction I want to take a look and hope we can take it in  for repayment  I’m prepared now, in these nonmarket transactions, to take everything that the  Bundesbank offers to us  I think with rates at these levels we can pull out all the stops in  repayment, including [buying] in the market  We’ve had the question from the Treasury this  morning, should we buy marks today  The dollar is up 30 points  Should we go in to a market that  is not in any sense disorderly or frothy and buy simply to repay?  That’s the hard decision; I am  prepared to buy more quickly now than I was       Not yet  They’re wondering where we got the marks       Actually, Governor Wallich has just reviewed the three major points, so I  won’t go into them unless people have questions on this  The only action needed by the Committee  in this procedure would be to [vote] on the renewals of the swap drawings as they come due  through the three renewals out to 12 months  But so far with our repayments, we’ve been able to  liquidate the swaps that would run out in October and November  We’re taking the oldest swaps  first, thus gaining two months’ time before we face the 12-month deadline  For today, we have five  swap drawings for a total amount of $257 million equivalent coming up for first [renewal] and I  recommend that they be renewed for a second three months       I’m prepared to take all of it now       It does have a domestic monetary effect       But there is a domestic monetary effect  They are trying to absorb domestic  liquidity through this mechanism  Governor Partee is correct  And they did exceed their monetary     5/16/78              5  target early this year; it was 8 percent and they were running 12 to 15 percent  Now, they pulled it  down to 7 percent in April, largely as a result of these operations, sterilizing marks--pulling marks  out from, let’s say, capital export conversions       But in billions of dollars, they add up       As I noted, we reduced our net open position in the last period by over $300  million  It’s just under $15 billion  And indeed, last Friday we even had the satisfaction of having  to request the Subcommittee to approve, pursuant to the procedural instructions, our continuing to  buy marks as we approached the $300 million limit on changes in the net open position between  meetings  That was a pleasure       Oh no, that’s fine  No, they were   But it’s a pleasure on this side  Now,  late last year and early this year, as we moved more deeply into debt, the Committee approved  additional leeway for operations under the authorization  The net open position had been raised to  $225 billion, I think back in March  And now $225 billion gives us more leeway than we  need--$750 million--so I recommend that the Committee reduce the net open position to a limit of  $2 billion       That’s music to my ears    "
775,1978-06-20,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       $879 million       6/20/78                2     Dollars       That=s why I stressed that we bought $200 million worth of marks in the  market and that we=ve acquired over $100 million worth of marks through our agency, the BIS,  or the Bank of England on days in which the dollar was steady or firming in the European  market       We=ve been in a period in which the dollar has been declining on more  days that it was rising so I think it was maybe five, six, seven days--or a quarter to a third of the  days       No  I was just saying that we would work this out in close consultation  with the Board=s staff  Remember the day on which we did exceed the gross transactions limit?   We had consulted; we had informed the members of the Subcommittee that an operation was  under way that would lead to substantial operations  We just didn=t pin it down by asking for an  approval    "
800,1978-07-18,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       Unrealized is about the same  Our average rate is 207; the current market  rate is around 206-1/2       Yes  In the Far East, the Japanese came out with some more trade figures  that suggested they would have a bigger trade surplus in June--$23 billion  But we have a case  where--that’s why I pointed to interest rates here--the dollar tends to firm up in our hours  The  dollar was up just before the meeting       Over the course of last fall and winter, many of the corporations did cover  well in advance their needs in currencies that they thought would rise  They were, in effect, short  of dollars, and that position built up rather substantially  I think a good bit of that was either run off  or covered in March and April  Some good [sources] in the market who have contacts with these  people think that most, if not all, of it has been run off  I would say that quite a bit still remains to  be done  That is, we have leads and lags that could shift in our favor should the dollar continue to  firm  This last monthly period has been a very delicate one for these people  They didn’t know  whether suddenly, with the EC meeting, the Bonn conference, and the dollar declining, they might  not go into a new series of selling dollars forward to cover on the expectation that perhaps the  dollar will continue to decline  We haven’t seen that  So it’s a tenuous situation but at this stage I  think if the dollar were to start rising, there would be more covering and we’d have a sustained rise  in the dollar and a technical reaction on the favorable shift of leads and lags  But there’s still some  to be done     7/18/78              2       Well, some of them have been [doing that] in recent weeks  But when you  tip a table and something starts rolling down, the question is how much suddenly slides off  When  the market balance tipped against the dollar, some of it did slide  We know of some covering that  took place  That is, the selling of dollars forward did take place but it wasn’t the massive amount  that we had last fall and winter       Yes  It’s simply that in August we have coming up for maturity ten  individual swap drawings in the amount of $315 million equivalent of German marks  These will  all be for second renewal, which is agreeable to the Bundesbank in view of the progress that we’ve  been making  I don’t know if we’ll be able to pay them off by the time of maturity--but we’ll do  our best--so I recommend that we renew them    "
825,1978-08-15,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       I think at this stage very little  It comes back to the question of how the  marks are pulled out of the market  That is, the marks that we have acquired have been directly  from the Bundesbank, which itself has been absorbing marks from the market in connection with     8/15/78             3  capital export conversions  We have not been buying in the market itself and we have not been  perceived as a buyer of marks in the market itself, so that would not influence market psychology  So I don't think it has had an effect       We've announced it, yes       Well, there are a number of ways you can look at it  As I say, these rates  have moved [substantially]  The Swiss franc has moved practically 50 percent in the past few  months and the yen the same--just in terms of how far the rates have moved in a very short period  of time  Yesterday the Swiss franc moved by 5 percent  And to the extent that anyone goes to  these countries and finds how expensive it is to do anything--in terms of inflation differentials or  those kinds of analyses--I think you'd find that the dollar is currently undervalued relative to these  currencies  As I say, I am essentially trying to report to you what people are telling us from the  market  These are the people who are selling the dollar       Well, in fact it is, but I don't want to interpose my own views because, as I  say, we have been inundated with calls  People out of retirement have called and said, we want to  find someone we can talk with to express our concern about what is happening to the dollar  We  think the situation is ridiculous, it’s overdone and we want to see what can be done at this stage to  turn this thing around  It’s hard to follow the market and to do what little intervention we've done  while getting all of these other phone calls from people who want to talk for half an hour and  explain their frets         Well, under floating exchange rates, Mondays are usually the bad day  because everybody--at least outside of New York--has newspapers to sit and read and Sunday  newspapers tend to pick up all of the tag ends of [the news]  And when there's bad news for the  week, that's the time when money managers begin to mull things over in their minds as to what  they are going to do  So, quite often Monday is an exaggeration of whatever problems we had the  week before and, therefore, we had a more serious problem, I think, to some degree  Phil Coldwell  asked last month whether the corporate treasurers were moving, and we had a feeling yesterday that  the corporate treasurers were now moving in bigger volume to sell dollars to cover their positions   [They apparently felt] that the decline of the dollar had gone so far that they could no longer sit  tight and say this will blow over  We had been describing this as a professional market--traders  dealing with each other--but we are running into the situation now where there's more money  coming in from treasurers outside       We had a big volume  Anything we wanted to do could have been done  We could have done $1/2 billion, if we wanted, in intervention  That would have satisfied some of  the pent-up demands for other currencies  If you're not there, then not so much will go through, but  the rates will move further       But it’s not a final sell-off; these things can go on for a longer period       But it’s a climatic situation       By all [means], when the Swiss franc moves by 5 percent       Well, the dollar was lower and now there has been a technical rebound in  the last half hour  The Swiss government is having a cabinet meeting tomorrow and, as I say,  people worry about their Draconian measures  The Swiss have taken several Draconian measures  and people worry about them before they are taken and after they are taken  They say, well, that  won't work and then they buy Swiss francs anyway  The Swiss went and                                                               this last month by, as I say, creating                        worth of Swiss francs, which  turns out to be about       percent of their monetary base, simply as a way of trying to flood the  market with Swiss francs and turn the thing around  But the Swiss franc is up about 15 percent  So  anything they have done has been thrown right back in their faces and they are rather frantic at this  stage  They do have their own economy to manage under these circumstances       Right  On the renewals of German mark swaps, we have four drawings,  totaling $246 million, coming due in September  These are second renewals and the Bundesbank  has agreed to renew them  And I recommend that the Committee approve their renewal       I'd like to add that Mr Gleske of the Bundesbank has written to Alan  Holmes with some points that the Germans would like to reconsider in the basic swap agreement  with the Bundesbank, which would be up for renewal in December  They are raising these points  now so that we can consider and discuss them in due time      First, they suggest that the even sharing of exchange risks on drawings be dropped so that  we would bear all of the risk  They are prepared to accept that drawings be at their interest rates,  which are currently 4 to 5 percent below ours, rather than at US Treasury bill rates  So there is a  tradeoff that's involved in that point  Second, they would like to have any renewals made at current  rates of exchange rather than at the rate of the original drawings  This would mean, in effect, the  booking of profits and losses on individual swap drawings on a quarterly basis  Finally, they would  like to have the language tightened up on the mode of repayment, making clear the principle that  first efforts to acquire marks would be in the market      I have nothing to recommend today in this regard  All of these points require study  But  we are preparing a memorandum to lay out the issues before the Committee  Some of these  proposed changes are of a fundamental nature, such as the 50-50 loss sharing and would have to be  extended to the swap arrangements with other central banks as well as with the Bundesbank  We  have to consider them carefully       No       No, not on the Bundesbank swaps  They are doing it for their own  account       This would be a rewriting of the swap [arrangements]       Right       Any time is fine; moving to 8 percent is not going to have much effect       It would add to the package, but if it came earlier that would be fine, too  The market is waiting for something       It's not in, but they've indicated that they'd be very quick to agree       Hopefully, yes       Now that's a bigger complication       That would change the nature of the swap arrangement that we have with  the Bank of Japan and would be a difference between the swap arrangement we have with them  and those with other central banks       Well, the magnitude can be very big  The Japanese themselves did                    of intervention in March, as the rate moved against them  And many people felt that they  were just sitting ducks  Each day they moved, you’d throw another $100 million at them and  they’d move again  You’d take your profits and then throw another $100 million  They were  sitting ducks because they were alone  As far as the market is concerned, if the United States is  prepared--just the gesture at this stage--to provide its resources to support whatever the Japanese  are doing, not necessarily the rate, [it would change the psychology] just that we've got this  agreement between the United States and Japan  The isolation of the Japanese at this stage in the  exchange market is very important        8/15/78             38   So, we can talk in terms of big numbers, but you're frightening me a little bit in how big  they are because my objective and the type of negotiation I have in mind is to talk to them as we  have with the Swiss  That is, all right we'll intervene in New York and commit our resources  because it is important for the United States to commit its resources at this stage to get the  psychological benefit in the market that the United States is cooperating  But there will be days in  which you'll want to intervene in your own market and in New York when it is not in the US  interest, in our judgment, so we would not want to commit our resources  [That is what] we have  done with the Swiss  So that some days we're in on a 50-50 basis--half theirs and half the US  authorities, and on other days we're simply operating on their behalf  On a cumulative basis they’d  end up intervening a lot more in New York than we're likely to be because we are very cautious on  the days we bring the System and the Treasury's resources to bear  But we will still have made this  very important gesture, showing that the United States is prepared to do something about this  disorderly market in yen       So we can talk in terms of big numbers, again, for the psychological benefit  But I would  hope that, as we did on July 4, we’d start off with a splash and then if we win on the psychological  effect, we wouldn't have to do very much later on  But that requires some of these other elements  such as the policy actions that Chairman Miller mentioned  And a few people on the Japanese side  have to keep their mouths shut afterwards and stop criticizing the United States  Because if we're  in the middle in the exchange market intervening and we have another one of these comments that  the United States is doing this, that, and the other thing, then there's not much help we can give the  exchange market or the rate that [unintelligible]  So we have to have a cooling of tempers a bit if  this is going to work       We would still have a floating exchange rate and the key element in our  experience with the German mark was not to peg the rate  Once we peg, then we provide the  substitution facility and everybody will come at it  But as long as they recognize that the risk will  go both ways--       That's right     8/15/78             39       Well, it all depends on how the market takes it and what happens  afterwards  The first day or two I would anticipate that we should be there forcefully when the  market tests this  We will be tested by the market Remember, back in January we had a testing  period       In marks, and we may be tested in other currencies, including Swiss francs  So we ought to be thinking in terms of a budget in the first couple of days of $200 to $300 million   If we aren't prepared to spend it then, we'll have to spend it later on  But if that doesn't work--of  course, you'll have other elements in the package, and so hopefully that will do the trick--then we’d  move into the kind of pattern we've had with the other currencies  When we feel it's important,  then we will intervene  It may be $10 million or it may $50 million on a day-to-day basis  But [I  prefer] not to think in terms of an overall budget except [with regard to the limits] under the  authorization and the other guidelines we have, including the procedural instructions       I'm not thinking in terms of billions  But if that is part of the  announcement, then that would help--that the amount that we might have to deal with is credible    "
852,1978-09-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]      It will be closer than it was before now that we are drawing on the basis of   50-50 but we are repaying on the basis of 60-40  Rounding it off, we have about $700 million left      It's close, yes      This is a very difficult question because the market is now so pessimistic,   so bearish, and so negative on everything that comes out  It's not everybody; many people out  there feel as we do that the dollar is oversold, unrealistically low, undervalued--all of the terms that  we bring out under these circumstances  But there are so many bearish people who have an  economic stake in having a lower dollar  That is, they have short positions in dollars and they're  prepared to throw big money [out there] to maintain those positions and make their profits  It's a  very speculative atmosphere in the exchange market [and it’s] not only the banks  You have the  IMM in Chicago and you have some pretty big corporations in Europe; I don't necessarily see  much from the US [corporations]  And, of course, the last two days there have been rumors about  Middle East money, following the Camp David [meetings]      So it's hard to know  There's this speculative atmosphere  How are we going to persuade   those fellows that they can't make profits by selling dollars?  I think the approach that’s been taken  this time of a sequence of things, which are clearly positive themselves but not necessarily  sufficient, at least has kept the market off balance  The dollar is higher than it was in the middle of  August  The atmosphere is not as horrible as it was at that time  So there is a feeling that the US  government does care, President Carter cares, and the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are taking  steps and have taken steps  But now you come to the hard part of your question  Well, they  haven't done enough  This is where we come back to the energy program and really [coming to]  grips with inflation  Until we have some positive numbers, a combination both of trade and price  figures, I think we're going to have a bad market  In July the market jumped on us when we had  good trade figures and poor price figures; in August they jumped on us after getting good price  figures and poor trade figures  What we need is a month in which both the trade and price figures  are better       I think it will help, and it may give [the dollar] a brief rise  But I'm   disappointed in the reaction of the market to the Camp David [outcome]  They were all focusing  on it, speculating up and down last week  And then when it went through positively, for all intents  and purposes, the dollar is now lower than it was before  So it will help in the long run to get this  whole controversial issue out of the way and in the short run perhaps will give a lift to the dollar  but, until we get some good numbers, I think that will pass very quickly        It was                  in March alone   "
876,1978-10-17,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       Yes, I think there is a very substantial oversold position against the dollar  that could be unwound at some stage  But it's one of these problems that we have in economics  where you have a curve and you can slide down the curve but you may not be able to slide back on  the same curve  And my fear is that people are now deciding [that] the dollar is not going to  recover over the next few months or the next few years and they're going to change their  investment and money management habits more or less permanently  Certainly, right now I think  there is a substantial technical position in favor of the dollar should we get a change in market  sentiment  It may be on the order of tens of billions of dollars, but we won't see it until there is this  turn in sentiment       Well, as I say the main concern is inflation  People are now focusing on the  anti-inflation program which has been indicated by President Carter and other advisers  Every time  there's a new announcement that it's going to be delayed, that tends to lead to a new bout of selling  pressure on the dollar  But there is a problem that every time this question comes up I give you  something new that the market's looking for--[something] to be done in terms of raising of interest  rates, an energy program, and all these other things  There's just a general lack of confidence the  things will be done quickly enough  But as I say, fortunately, many of the fundamentals are  moving in our favor now and I think it's just a matter of time before the underlying elements are  recognized by the market as turning in our favor       10/17/78 2                  They do recognize the absolute differential but you're talking about day-to- day speculation in the market  If you can make 1 percent overnight, that's a differential of 360  percent per annum       Yes, it has to, but it hasn't; and we've been going several months with the  same problem  As I say, the Dutch took the trick of raising interest rates very sharply on call  money--that is a technique of forcing shorts to cover--and then bringing the rates down       That's right       Pretty much       I'm saying that is what the market is saying right now       It's been saying that, but the moment it comes through if at the same  moment an OPEC seller is selling $100 million against marks, then everyone is going to shrug it  off  This is the problem  The market forces have taken over and they're driving the dollar lower        10/17/78 3             And market forces somehow have to be stopped, whether by a change in market sentiment or what  I don't know  But it's a serious situation       Oh, they don't want a recession  They're not dealing next year; they're  dealing with today and tomorrow, the next week, and the next few weeks  And we have this  cumulative process under way   No, I've argued with people  And I spend more of my time  arguing these days than intervening and they're both equally frustrating  No one wants a recession,  but they don't like what they see at this moment       It's hard to see directly  We have seen some transactions It's in what is  called the second tier central banks outside of the OECD  The smaller central banks in OPEC,  Latin American central banks, central banks in Asia, and so forth we know have been diversifying  to some degree  The central bankers themselves--we've had many of them in recently or talked to  them on the phone--claim that they are very cautious but many of them also admit that they are  diversifying  It's not so much the central banks as other government institutions  Many of the  OPEC countries have development banks and development funds and portfolio managers who are  very big and very clumsy in their operations  Yesterday, for example, the word got around that one  of the German banks that handles big accounts for OPEC was a large seller of dollars at eleven  o'clock our time, and that knocked the stuffing out of the market for the day  So you get these  kinds of reports almost every day now  At one point or another, some big holder of dollars has sold  dollars in a clumsy way       Not as far as the central banks are concerned       I don't think they're worrying so much about a technicality of that sort       We are approaching the [limit in the] authorization on the net open position  But Alan and I have decided that we're going to try to hold as well we can within the current  authorization over the next month  And if we have to, then we'll come to the Committee       But it would be in the context of this interim limit       We've got room       10/17/78 5                  The bigger interventions are normally in the other market       Also, Chuck, you never hear from us about all the urgings we get from  central banks where we do not intervene  We are constantly bombarded, particularly in times like  this, [with requests] for us to intervene in other currencies like Belgian francs, Dutch guilders,  Austrian schillings, and Scandinavian currencies  But we don't bother to report that to you         10/17/78 9                Well, we do it in our own interest    "
900,1978-11-21,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       I think it probably depends on how you measure; [they’re] roughly about  the same over the whole period  We've taken a bigger share than we normally have  Since  November 1 our share has been bigger than the others       Well, [it’s] the totality of central banks; a lot of central banks ended up  buying dollars due to the Swedish [unintelligible] Riksbank       Mr Chairman, in response to President Winn's question, since mid- October the total foreign intervention was $56 billion, of which $600 million was through the  Desk  And since the beginning of November the total foreign intervention was $33 billion, of  which $500 million was through the Desk       All of our intervention in New York, which has been in German marks, is  for our account  It’s just in the case of the Swiss that--       Well, on the first question, I think many people felt that one of the items in  the November 1 package was a sharp rise in the federal funds rate  And to the extent that it has  drifted back in the last few days, we've had a number of people calling us wondering why the  Federal Reserve has trimmed this back, and there has been some comment that this has hurt the  effort on the dollar  But that's policy here     As for the other question on the recession, I'm not being so receptive to the comments on  this point that people from the market are making these days because I think some of them have  become so frustrated and cynical that they argue that we should have a recession--that we somehow  should purge our souls from all of these terrible things that we have done  And my reaction is  precisely what you've said, namely that the risk is that we will not only have a recession in the  United States but that we will have a broader decline or a recession in other countries as well  So  they've got to be very careful of what kind of policies they're trying to push on us in the United  States and on the other countries at this time  So they haven't recognized that there is this broader  risk; they're still thinking in terms of some kind of purging on the part of the United States       Well, I've said the same to some of our central bank colleagues in Europe  as well       The rates are where they closed yesterday  The weakness occurred  yesterday afternoon and our market is just drifting back a little bit, so at this stage it's quite [calm]  and hopefully may be steady for a while  But we're prepared to operate; we did intervene late  yesterday afternoon when the rate was drifting off    "
924,1978-12-19,"  [Statement--see Appendix]       Yes, well, if I seem a little agitated, I’ve just gotten off the phone with the  Bundesbank on that precise point  And all I got was a lecture  Obviously, this is not official policy  on the part of the German government or any other government, but I was told it was about time  that we did something on fundamentals and all that  So it’s not the official policy but it’s one of the  things in the market that’s poisoning the atmosphere and leading to further sales of the dollar  We  ourselves found in our intervention yesterday that we got an unusual cluster of Middle East names        12/19/78          2     SPEAKER(?)  What does that mean?       Well, the selling was coming out of the Middle East more  The New York  market itself was quiet; it was quiet from noon on  It was a heavy cluster of names that came out of  the Middle East       You also have had the kind of psychological imponderables and the one  that Henry raised       You also have the psychological imponderables beyond just the  forecasting tools the economists normally use in terms of the expectations towards policy   Governor Wallich raised one point--that the Europeans may allow their rates to rise  And there is  the feeling that perhaps the United States may let the dollar drop as a way of financing this  So it’s  not just taking previous trends and projecting them forward  It’s this policy context we have to  consider         He said higher interest rates  He said it three times  And I said, “We’ve  got higher interest rates”  So we got into jawboning back and forth  Let me get back to fiscal  policy, the whole range of things that we’ve been discussing over the month  The problem is  simply that the numbers haven’t come through to support all of the things that we said over the  months about winding down inflation and turning the trade balance around  The trade balance is  improving--that [will happen] in time  But it is more a question on the inflationary front  I  wouldn’t accept what the Bundesbank has to say about our policy  We have to have our own  deliberations  They wouldn’t accept what I had to say about their policy    "
949,1979-02-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see  Appendix 1    I don’t think I am qualified to answer that, but  I don’t know of anything    Yes, I think it would Perhaps more time with a  sense of stability in the market and a less jittery atmosphere [would  help] We had a very jittery atmosphere in January The dollar has  shown more resilency over the weeks since January 1 It was able to  absorb the impact of the measures taken by the German monetary  authorities S o  it's a matter of [some additional] weeks of stability  in the market; and, of course, it would help to have some improved  fundamentals Nevertheless, I was surprised myself that the market  weathered the German actions as well as it did    It depends on what else is going on in other  places The same numbers can have a different effect if they come  through one day [versus another day]    When the Germans tightened, they first had their  vice president give a speech that made everybody mad and had people  expecting a very sharp tightening of monetary policy  tighten, it was less [than expected1 and a lot of people had to  scramble to cover positions So it depends on how it's done and what  the context is at the time   When they did     2 / 6 / 7 9  -3-     It’s a question of credibility We have gone  for so many months trying to establish credibility and it is a very,  very slender reed at this stage As I said, the initial reaction to  the statements coming out of Washington was negative, or skeptical  It was filtered through the various news services Chairman Miller in  his speech to the Economics Club in New York managed to talk directly  to market participants and finally they [understood] what he has been  saying rather than having it filtered through the press So if it’s  just a statement of what you are doing, that won’t satisfy people  unless you can really impress them    If it is perceived that way, but I'm not sure it  would be written that way  "
973,1979-03-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see  Appendix 1    I don't think there is any sense that the market  feels we have fixed rates There is a sense in the market that at  current levels there is a great deal of resistance I haven't heard  anybody saying ""pegged"" as such They just notice that if the rate     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -3-    [moves] 50 points, there is considerable resistance--quite often not  by the central bank--and shortly thereafter the central bank might be  in But I don’t hear anybody complaining that we are pegging at the  moment    Some people feel there is, yes  "
1082,1979-07-11," [Statement--see Appendix]    I think they would have been better It depends  on the timing--when [an action was taken] during the course of these  weeks That would have helped, but we still would have had to  intervene There is a lot of negative sentiment, particularly with  regard to the energy situation    If it gets down there, I think they would  Their approach is not to peg the rate at any particular level AS I  indicated, we did have   They have been very forceful in the last week or so and they were  forceful this morning But we are living in a world of floating  exchange rates, and I myself am not sure I would advocate holding it  at 180 if the pressures mounted that much    Well,--    It's in the minds of some people You talk to  different people, you get different answers Some people have  mentioned that    Again, it differs with different people  Certainly we have plenty of free advice and you can guess what it is  These are financial people; they're interested in financial flows  And we do have a phenomenon going on in Europe and a ratcheting up of  interest rates by the central banks and in the markets It's partly  related to the EMS in that it's very difficult now for these countries  to make adjustments in exchange rates within the EMS; and a number of  countries have raised their discount rates recently simply to protect  themselves within that context Now, the interplay of forces between  the dollar/mark and then the mark and the other currencies leads to  combined strains So if the European interest rates are going up,  then they turn and look at us Again, I am very chary of talking too  much about these things because at some stage, we have to turn around  and tell the market that we're only part of the economy and the rest  of the economy has to be considered    Some people in the market would like higher  interest rates and they will tell us so, and they'll tell you so But  you have to consider the broader picture    Some will admit it But then again, people I'm  referring to are more interested in what's going to happen in the next  15 minutes, the next few days, or next month than over the next 6  months    It sounds sound to me    No, the swap drawings that we have outstanding  are simply from this last month, so there's nothing--     7/11/19 -51-    No I’m just wondering [howl we would come out  on it and what somebody will say to the Mexicans that will--     7/11/79 -54-     MY problem on this is that there may be an  advantage in our relations directly with the Bank of Mexico There's  a concern that they have and that we have on the financial side  There are a lot of political deals being struck on oil, on emigration,  and so forth [Say] all of a sudden the State Department on our side  and whoever it is on the Mexican side come to some agreement and then  the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Mexico [are given] some sort of  order Okay, you fellows, to finish whatever discussion has been  going on, here's your part of it If we separate this discussion on  the swap increase to some degree--and it is costless if they're not  going to draw--then we've got a better line of communication directly  with the Bank of Mexico Again, if we let them down gently, like  saying at the end of the year or at some appropriate time we select we  will talk about increasing the line, at least we have the good  communications with the Bank of Mexico--and with the least cost, if  you want to consider it that way It's a hard one to handle  "
1148,1979-08-14," Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   To some people in the market it would be helpful, yes Others would not pay too much attention to it, particularly since it's something that had been announced before as part of the November 1st package But a package usually has something for everybody and there are some who would think that the Carter bonds would be important   It depends on what's coming along with it The forward market operations right now alone, without any other change, would be seen as a tactical exercise It's in some ways weaker than spot operations and may be seen as a fallback position on the part of the authorities Forward operations combined with other activity could add, but I personally would prefer to continue doing spot operations   Well, I don't know; war is a very strong term But clearly, as I indicated in my [remarks]--and we've felt this for    8/14/79  several months--the response of the central banks and the authorities in Europe is that with higher rates of inflation coming about from the oil price increase and from stronger domestic economies, they have raised their interest rates The ones within the EMS have a particular problem in that it's harder now for the governments to come to an agreement on changing their exchange rates within the European monetary system; they have to get the agreement of the agricultural ministers as well as the finance ministers And so particularly the Germans have raised their interest rates over the course of the year in response to these inflationary pressures and expansion of bank credit demand Others have found they've had to raise their rates to defend their currencies in the exchange market and to fend off their own inflationary pressures--some a bit against their will, I think And from the United Kingdom side we had a decision on the part of the new Administration there, the Thatcher government, to raise interest rates by a full 2 percentage points back in May, which has set a new course for sterling And that has occurred I wouldn't call it a war but other countries have been raising interest rates There have been several rounds of interest rate hikes, and it's a different atmosphere than we've had in earlier years   There is a feeling that there is a war going on I think it's overstated   If you talk to different people, they would give you a different [answer regarding the] nature of the apprehension I gave you a list of the things that people are bearish about with respect to the rest of [our country's] economic policy and there's still some hope that the Federal Reserve is here and doing its job [As for] what job that is, you talk to different people and you get different reactions    8/14/79   No, no These guys are making bets--and that's what they're doing--on whether interest rates are going to be higher after the meeting or not And how much higher is part of the bet   Certainly, if there was a feeling that the actions of the Committee would lead to a reduction in inflation But again, I'm very cautious about what people are doing on the Friday and Monday before an FOMC meeting They're just aligning themselves to be in a particular position to anticipate some action which if it comes, they will make money and if it doesn't come, then they won't But I would not want to overinterpret what these day-to-day swings [mean]   Well, it would help with those who are interested in responding to that sort of thing But as I say, there's a deeper root of concern about the dollar As long as the Federal Reserve is doing what people think the Federal Reserve should do--and again these are people in financial markets and they are more inclined to look to interest rates as a guiding light--then they will be a little more relaxed But they're also worried about the question of leadership and economic policy more broadly So we might buy ourselves some more time--which is what we bought [with] our intervention in late July and the interest rate hike that took place then That bought us some time But part of our problem last Friday was that people were calling in and saying all right we know what you've done and we know what the Federal Reserve is trying to do--you have a new Chairman and all that--but another bad price figure just came out How long are these price figures going to continue? So long as the United States continues to have a higher rate of inflation than Germany, Switzerland, and some of these other countries, it will help [if our rates go up]; it will buy time But it won't solve the basic problem of confidence in the dollar, which has been troubling us throughout this past year or so   Well, I don't know which attitude you mean Again, they expect us to be there If we aren't, then everybody will be very disappointed and we'd have a real problem on our hands So we have to show up when the problems do emerge    8/14/79   Oh, yes they are   Well, that's part of the package idea There are those who are touting a package, who call in and say you guys need a package and one of the elements is the fact that $30 billion won't do it As for the November 1st package, for all we know you've spent it all already It's that sort of thing So then you get in the idea that Henry raised of Carter bonds and hikes in interest rates; the list is just as long as one's arm depending, again, on which person you're talking to And they're still prepared a little to challenge us in the market but not quite so much What we did in late July really stopped a number of the players And our operation last Friday quieted a few others But it's temporary; they'll be back   I don't know I'm trying to interpret a wide range of things without trying to interpose my own views, so I'm not sure In view of what was going on at that time, I think what was given was a signal of concern by the Federal Reserve, and that's what the market wanted That's what it got, and anything more than a signal is-- It could have changed a number of people's attitudes temporarily, but as I say the market is looking at a lot of other broader problems A half point as against one point is not so important as the fact that the half point was done   Well, I just had a lecture from a chartist so I'm not sure what weights to apply myself these days I think basically we come back to the fact that [market participants] are looking for fundamental improvement This is what the market is looking for This is what the corporate treasurers are waiting for At this stage they are very pessimistic that there will be fundamental improvement So in the meantime we end up with this--   With some it would help It will change the balance in the market   Well, simply that it's the Manager's job to make a recommendation and I personally favor this But [let me cite] the kinds of arguments that the Mexicans raise   From $360 million to $700 million   No, [what you said] is fine  -9-    8/14/79   Paul was the one who held the discussions I was interpreting his--  -10-    8/14/79   May I speak to this question of precedent? We've had discussions with these other central banks over the years and told them ""no,"" and we can tell them no again Mexico is a different country from these others We do have criteria in the files from 1967 and we published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin at that time the criteria for swap partners Now, we're a long way from 1967, but those criteria have protected us a lot from the possibility--in cases where discussions were getting started on a very informal basis --that the discussions would get much further But I think we're protected on the economics as well as the convertibility of currency [and] our relations with the central banks We have a very good relationship with the central bank in Mexico At some of the other central banks we don't know who the Governor is from one month to the next So we can protect ourselves, and we have And I feel I'm one of the first lines of defense on this   That's right   There's nothing coming up before the next meeting that is of importance, so I would pass on it "
1178,1979-09-18," [Statement--see Appendix]    We’re in the process of preparing a paper on  that, which I hope we will be able to circulate to the Committee  They have dollars in their portfolio They sell those dollars spot to  the market in exchange for marks Since what they are effectively  doing now is simply selling a participation in their holdings of  Treasury bills, there are no dollars rattling around in the exchange  market It‘s simply that the Geman banks come in with marks on a  spot basis and they will be getting them back in 1 month or 2 months,  depending on the maturity of [the bills] So the operation is  absorbing marks coming in from the banking system One of the  problems that the Bundesbank has with this operation is that they may  be taking liquidity away from the German banks by this process, but  they are not mopping up really the [other] side--the effect on the  monetary aggregates of the demand for deposits with German banks    Well, the market is concerned about inflation  however it is induced There are some monetarists in the market who     9/18/79 -2-   do follow closely the aggregates, but they are just one segment  There are others who worry about other things There are even some  chartists out there who couldn't care less about any of these broader  numbers that we work with But they are concerned about inflation,  however it is induced    People in the market have a lot of questions as  to what happened over the weekend--there was no communique--and I  really don't know anything further As for a devaluation of the  dollar at this stage, there's no mechanism to do it since we are on a  floating rate basis As I Said, we have been looking at this 180  [German mark] rate that the market has, but we're not wedded to that  rate any more than we were to other rates It's just that we are  caught in this box The moment we back away or seem to be somehow  weak in any sense, all of a sudden the speculators--and these include  people on the I M M  and some of the banks--jump on it And even more we  have corporate treasurers and foreign central banks outside the G-10,  who as I say may be sitting on their hands at this moment But if the  dollar should suddenly start [falling], then they will sell It's a  very highly unstable equilibrium condition we're in now, where as soon  as the dollar begins to weaken, then we have selling pressure rather  than sort of an equilibrating inflow of demand for dollars So as  long as the environment remains this highly charged, with so many  silly things going on--1 had one fellow tell me that the dollar was  going down because it always goes down in September and that's why he  was selling dollars We have the IMF meeting, we have all these other  meetings, and obviously the dollar, for one reason or other, isn't  going to come out of this period strong Yet these people are willing  to admit that they see around the corner an improvement in the  underlying conditions because of the data that have come in over the  past month and other recent months    I don't think we're operating as if we have a  fixed exchange rate    The Swiss also have bought dollars once the  market psychology tipped in the other direction So their earlier  sales were in conjunction with a policy of aligning their rate with  the mark and, as I said, that did trigger some sentiment that the  Bundesbank was hitting on the exchange rate But once the franc began  to rise, they bought dollars just as vigorously as they'd been selling  dollars before and they are still prepared to do so They're  interested in stability    Well, if you want to cover them now, yes Over  the next month we will be going through the first cycle of renewal of  the swaps that we incurred in the operations in late June and in late  July These involve some 17 swaps, totaling $1,797,000,000 It's the  first renewal; I'm just reporting it  "
1197,1979-10-05," Well, the exchange markets are currently very  chaotic The dollar is higher than it was early this week, largely  because of supportive intervention by the Bundesbank and ourselves  But the number of rumors and the types of rumors that have emerged--  many of them are incredible and some are credible--have dominated the  exchange market thinking over the whole week The one that Chairman  Volcker has resigned, with all the elaboration of the scenario under  which he resigned, has been going around for the last 2 hours I hope  it is denied very quickly so that at least that rumor would be put to  bed But everyone is waiting for whatever the Federal Reserve is  going to do this week, and basically the dollar has not moved very  much in the last 2 or 3 days  "
1235,1979-10-22," Very briefly, the dollar continued steady  against the German mark, on either side of 180 marks to the dollar,  and against other European currencies The yen is a bit weak but that  is a separate case We have not had to intervene in support of the  dollar but neither has there been a reflux of funds into dollars  following the heavy outflows of recent months The oil price  situation is a major concern and there’s plenty of pessimism remaining  about the political situation [in the United States] and U  S   economic  policy generally Market participants tell us that they are taking a  wait and see attitude toward the Federal Reserve‘s new approach And  the higher cost of borrowing dollars is cited as deterring people from  taking new short positions in dollars but it has not brought them to  sell other currencies to came into dollars as yet They say they are  waiting for evidence that the money supply is, in fact, under control  and that inflation rates here are declining That’s my report  "
1258,1979-11-20," [Statement--see Appendix]    They believe it will come sooner or later, but  they’re not going to bet on it   M R   WALLICH Do you think they’re looking beyond the  present cycle toward a more distant future in evaluating the  improvement in the current account, which is cyclical?    Well, again, there’s the oil price situation  and the Iranian situation Any forecast one would normally make would  be positive for the dollar, but people are not willing to bet on that  forecast given the uncertainties in the oil area and the Iranian  situation   M R   WALLICH Do you see any important central bank  constraint in the use of the dollar for intervention purposes because  of not wanting to do damage to the dollar?    They’ve talked of it a little but I don‘t see  [a lot of that] The Swiss National Bank has been careful not to sell  dollars this time around Remember, back in August their selling of  dollars was one of the elements that triggered the adverse market  sentiment They finally decided that the Swiss franc had gotten so  weak that they would start selling dollars; the first time they showed     1 1 / 2 0 / 7 9  -2-   themselves in the market then, the market moved away from them very  quickly so they actually did not sell any dollars But they're being  much more cautious this time around than they were back in August in  selling dollars    Interest rates? I would pray that I wouldn't  but they face some of the same inflationary pressures we do The oil  price has continued to move up Many of these countries buy their oil  in the spot markets, and to the extent that spot prices have continued  to rise this fall it's possible that they will have further inflation  feeding into their economies So--    That's why I say I would pray that [the answer  is no] for the time being since everybody has raised their interest  rates--the Germans, the Japanese, the Swiss, the British, the  Canadians, and I'm not sure how many more--since October 6   The  Greenbook has a list I would hope that they're all done for the time  being--for the rest of this year But the fundamentals are still a  problem   M R   EASTBURN Scott, how understanding would they be of a  decline in interest rates here? If the economy weakens substantially,  would they understand that?   M R   PARDEE If '""they"" is the central bankers, they might  understand it or explain it What has happened so far--the backing  off of the funds rates and some moving back of [other] interest rates  from the peaks in mid-October--has been taken in stride probably both  by the central bankers and the markets But there is some sort of  trigger point where people will begin to wonder whether we have lost  our resolve I don't think that has happened up to this point    Not everybody has the same perception of what  our control over the aggregates is It's the reading of the economy  and the economy is softening Surely if we could get better control  of the aggregates as well, some people would say that's fine, the  Federal Reserve is doing its job AS long as inflation remains very  high there are still the real interest rate arguments Most Europeans  believe that interest rates have to be positive in real terms in order  for monetary policy to have an effect; and many people in the exchange  market believe that    I have two, one with respect to current  operations and one with respect to the swap arrangements themselves  Between now and December 28 we have eleven swap drawings for 1 billion  654 million dollars coming due with the Bundesbank These are all  first renewals and need no formal action by the Committee A second  renewal--and this is the first one in all of these operations we've  taken since last June--for 88 million dollars equivalent will be  coming up in that time span I will need Committee approval for that  now so I can renew it should we not have the opportunity to repay it  by that time That is my first recommendation    The Bundesbank    Well, during the last month the Bundesbank has  been very helpful in channeling marks to us from their non-market  transactions That's how we have been able to repay the 300 odd     11/20/79 -4-    million dollars worth of swaps If the Iranian situation quiets down  and we can resume these kinds of operations, the 88 million dollars is  at the head o E  the list to be repaid We try to repay the longest  maturity first, so I would hope by that time we will have repaid it  But [if not], this would be a second renewal and that is always one  that requires Committee action    Yes Between now and December 28 all of the  swap arrangements themselves mature We have arrangements with 14  central banks and the BIS and I simply recommend that I be authorized  to renew them all as they stand As you recall, last year we entered  into extensive discussions with the Bundesbank over eliminating the  50-50 even sharing of risk clause on our drawings [That was to be  done] in exchange for shifting to the use of their interest rates  rather than ours on the investment oE the dollars that arise out of  our drawings There is still much to be said for the change and we  found at that time that the US Treasury agrees in principle, but the  Treasury is still reluctant to make the change, particularly now given  that we are heavily in debt to the Bundesbank once again Up to this  point the Germans have not pressed the issue this time around I  would hope we can wait for a more opportune time So I’d rather renew  the swaps strictly as they are without any change and review the 50-50  problem at a more opportune time That is my recommendation    Well, they’ve seen some turn in their capital  accounts They‘re hoping that their trade account will turn later  this year, just as a sort of very short-term bridge They are still  discussing other measures they might take if they need to on various  capital controls And they thanked us very much; they are grateful  that we have agreed in principle on the swap drawing and they will be  back to us if they need it They don’t need the money; it’s just the  question of having this gesture of cooperation from the United States  authority at a moment of a little bit of isolation for them Theirs  is the only currency other than the dollar that has been heavily sold  in this experience  "
1286,1980-01-08," [Statement--see Appendix]   They've been discussing that off and on Who announced it? If it was the Saudis and there's a general agreement, then it could lead to selling of dollars But if it was the Kuwaitis or some research economist in one of these areas or newspapermen, it's unlikely to be [more than] a momentary blip in the market   No, in fact they have been rather out of the market They were a major factor early in December as they transferred some of their profits and earnings home During the late part of the month and early this month, in our conversations with them, they said they just don't know which way to go They're very nervous [about the situation] politically as well as with respect to  -47-    1/8-9/80  other elements But they haven't been moving funds very much The real problem for us in the exchange market, as far as dollar sales, has come from the diversification by the Iranians and perhaps other central banks On the other hand, the risk of talking to corporate treasurers is that they start warning us that if the dollar begins to decline, they will sell dollars; it's that sort of thing We have not heard of major shifts by corporations They're not very optimistic   Well, we are now getting into the phase of second renewals of swap drawings and I do need authorization Some of the drawings relate to our operations last summer, in July We have eight swap drawings in the amount of $335 million that are up for second renewal between now and February 14 I would like to recommend that we roll them over once again, if we haven't had the chance to pay them off before then "
1314,1980-02-04," Every time somebody mentions the international value of the dollar, I don't know where I am I feel like the zoo keeper who is worrying about lions and tigers and bears and is told that the animal kingdom is improving or not improving during the course of the day I am working in a different world than the one we've just come from, though I have great sympathy with many of the things that were said [Statement--see Appendix]   We have a bit of a dilemma It would be rather nice to see the dollar rise at this stage, after all the pressures that the dollar has been under for these many months And on that basis, it's awkward for us to see the Bundesbank go into the exchange market and sell dollars and thereby keep the dollar from rising as it might otherwise At the same time, we have $26 billion worth of swap debt remaining and I am going to have to ask for a second renewal on a good chunk of that swap debt And the US Treasury has a very substantial short position in that it used a lot of the resources of the earlier Carter notes in the intervention last fall So, we have a rather great need for marks We have to balance off our wish to see the dollar rise a little to reinstill a bit of confidence in the market in the dollar against this need for mark resources   That's right   I am if the dollar remains where it is [or] continues to rise There is still a rather substantial calendar of mark-denominated issues coming into the international markets, which will be converted at the Bundesbank And this rediversification-- there's no term for it and the politics only goes one way--this flow  -17-    2/4-5/80  of funds back into the dollar provides us with opportunities The Bundesbank had one offer put to them this morning on which it decided it didn't like the exchange rate We would see quite a bit of that as well People coming back to the dollar, selling large chunks of marks on the exchange market, and either the Bundesbank or ourselves taking those [marks] off the market   Well, there is a certain urgency as far as our repayment of debt is concerned And whenever the dollar is strong enough to take it, we open doors and windows We have not gone into the exchange market as an open buyer of marks That's one point I was making in my [report] But to the extent that someone comes along and offers marks to us, we will take them and use them to repay debt   We've had swap drawings outstanding since last June and we're going into the second renewal on a number of these   I don't have the numbers, but between now and the end of February we have a rather substantial list of swap drawings, totalling about $18 billion, coming up for second renewal   By the end of February   Not until March 28th   Yes   It's not merely the annual date; I think I have a responsibility to the Committee to keep these things short term   Oh, no, I am not trying to go in that direction, as far as the policy is concerned But in terms of my own responsibilities I feel that I have an urgency to clear this up Now, there is a tradeoff--we have to choose--because we're covering this debt at a rather substantial loss to the Federal Reserve And if we waited three months or six months, the exchange value of the dollar might be such that we could repay at a profit On the other hand, experience has shown that to be a 50-50 [probability]; we might be paying it off at a substantially greater loss I would rather get it off the books while we have the opportunity and free up our resources for later problems   Well, we're having daily conversations with them on their pace of selling "
1356,1980-03-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, not US banks A few of them have operations in gold, but they are mainly merchandisers of gold in that they buy from either the IMF or out of European markets, or in the past from the US Treasury   One or two European banks could be sitting on losses On the other hand, they are very well capitalized I think they can withstand such losses   No, one of the reasons we repaid our debt so quickly was that there is the risk of a snapback As I say, the only thing that is supporting us at the moment is really the interest rate differential Market expectations toward the dollar are still very bearish   Well, the rise of the dollar has been almost totally during the European hours, and the Bundesbank has been prepared to in one operation or the other By the time we come in, the market is pretty limp We have been able to do small amounts We haven't wanted to do too much for fear that the market psychology would turn against us saying ""Aha, the United States is trying to drive the dollar down again"" So it's a very, very delicate question On the other hand, the Bundesbank has had some of the same problems with the mark that we had back last fall when the dollar was going down and we were having trouble stopping the slide, even though we were intervening in big amounts   We have been prepared to operate a little, but [the dollar] has been pretty steady in New York   For once I don't have to recommend any swap renewals But I do have a rather complicated transaction to describe, so that I can be authorized to complete it When the dollar came into demand in late February, early March, the Bundesbank supplemented its spot sales of dollars with forward sales of dollars against marks for delivery in early May The choice of dates was related to the    3/18/80  domestic liquidity situation in Germany Mark liquidity was expected to be more ample in early May than in early March, so the forward sales of the dollar would help mop up some of that excess liquidity The total was equivalent of marks Since the Bundesbank was sharing half of the mark proceeds of its spot sales of dollars with us at the time, and we had no idea how long the dollar would remain in demand, we asked them if they might also share the proceeds of the forward sales It took them several days to come back with an answer; and when they did, they set some conditions that required consultations on our side within the Federal Reserve and with the Treasury In the meantime the dollar continued to rise and the System continued to make good progress in repaying swap debt In view of the Treasury's need for marks to cover the Carter notes, we finally decided to offer the forward marks to the Treasury, and the Treasury agreed In response, the Bundesbank raised no objection But after further review on their part, they insisted that the Federal Reserve as the central bank of the United States be the direct counterparty on the forward contracts rather than the US Treasury  Subject to your approval, the solution we have worked out is that the System would enter into two sets of forward contracts one with the Bundesbank to obtain the marks directly from it, so that as the central bank of the United States we are sharing in that operation; and the other between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to pass the marks directly on to the Exchange Stabilization Fund These transactions would be at the same rates, so there is neither profit nor loss to the System The reason I am laying this out to you is that the Bundesbank  As Manager, it is difficult for me to argue that these transactions would be  Exceptions have to be expressly authorized by the Committee Consequently, I am requesting authority from the Committee to make an explicit exception to the rule so that we can complete the deal The Treasury needs the marks since it still has a short position of $33 billion of marks under the Carter notes Since some of the Treasury's mark debt is at even higher mark rates than those on these contracts, the cost comparisons are not excessively unfavorable to the Treasury Moreover, should the System need to incur additional swap debt before May, the Treasury is willing to cancel all or part of its purchases from us so that we could use the marks in repayment The transactions are quite complicated but essentially mean that the US authorities will gain an additional worth of marks to work with should the occasion arise That's my recommendation   Yes    3/18/80   We don't know where the rate will be in May   It's a matter of that nature, yes They prefer   No, but they were the ones who suggested that we should raise the question of this 50-50 sharing with the Bundesbank As soon as they heard about it, they were the ones who pressed the Desk to inquire whether the Germans would be prepared to--   There was no objection raised by Treasury, or for that matter by the Federal Reserve   Well, I am sure the Treasury would insist on a rate of around 175, 176 The average rate is 175-1/2 or thereabouts   No, if the situation arises, I will [undertake] a very complicated negotiation to avoid our getting stuck with them   Right   Yes, liquidity   In fact they are now   $33 billion Yes, we can continue; and they are continuing to share   Yes, $100 million worth of marks   Yes, everything The problem will remain if the dollar comes under selling pressure I think we are going to have to give quite a bit of ground before we start operating very vigorously in defense of the dollar because the Bundesbank certainly won't help us for a long ways down "
1378,1980-04-22," [Statement--see Appendix]   Much more important are the interest rates On the Iranian situation, when you talk to different people they'll give you different interpretations even on the same day For the moment interest rates are the dominant factor in peoples' minds in the exchange markets   In a couple of months the exchange traders might be thinking about something else The [focus of their] attention tends to shift from time to time Currently, given that there is a feeling that we're in a period where interest rates are topping off and people are uncertain as to how far interest rates are likely to go down or whether they will stabilize, rates are the dominant factor The exchange market people look a little at the aggregates I was a bit surprised and rather pleased that the decline in the aggregates reported on Friday did not lead to a sharp sell-off of the dollar, given the sensitivity the market is showing toward monetary questions in the United States at this point But they look mainly at interest rates and less at the aggregates   It depends in some banks on whether they have monetarist economists that they have to listen to; but they work with interest rates And I'm afraid, with this 14 [number released] this morning, that we're hearing again from the market that there has not been any improvement on inflation in terms of the CPI   It's a question of [timing] We surveyed corporate treasurers yesterday to find out what they were thinking at this moment Several of them related practically the same view They expect that sooner or later interest rates may decline in the United States--that it's necessary--as we move into a recession But as I indicated in my report, if interest rates come down faster--before there is a demonstrable improvement on inflation and internationally on the trade [and] current account balances--then we're heading for trouble So there is some expectation that interest rates may recede, and certainly plenty of hope that they will at some point, from this particular group of people But the traders and corporate treasurers are telling us that it's a matter of timing in terms of when the interest rates come down and when these other things start improving   They are beginning to level off, I'm afraid, certainly in Germany and Switzerland where they are running around 6 percent or 5 percent Wholesale and producer price indexes are still very high in many of these countries Japan is still reporting very high increases, but they are beginning to level off, too, as the oil shock gets filtered into their price mechanism But the consumer price indexes are behaving better in some of these countries   Today they're off a little The Euro-mark is about 9-1/4 percent and the three-month rate on interbank [loans] is down below 10 percent   Euro-marks as against Eurodollars were around 17 percent as against 9 percent We're still at a differential of about 7 to 8 percentage points, depending on which measure we use   Well, it was at about 10 percentage points before, close to 10-1/2   There are several people who might be able to answer that In terms of the non-oil-[producing] less developed countries, there is a lot of discussion about that   I think both the Board staff and our staff, as well as other staffs, are looking at this very carefully We're moving into another period where the whole discussion of recycling is very important Since the 1974-75 period scared so many people, perhaps we're in a little better shape coming into this one People talk about Brazil and a few other countries that will have big problems, but of course the [unintelligible] decided not to talk to the IMF I don't know, Ted; you might want to comment on that     On the capital conversion? No, they haven't had many issues lately   Right   There are considerable lags You're talking about effects in 1981-1982, not now   Well, the whole package, as I indicated, is that as long as the United States is exposed, whatever we do to act unilaterally in Iran is seen as bad for the dollar The indications out of the European ministries meeting today are that perhaps they will help us, and that is giving the dollar a little lift But, as for individual items within the package we put together, it's hard to isolate what the effect on the dollar has been "
1398,1980-04-29," All I can say is that since the FOMC meeting, the dollar has declined by about 3-3/4 percent against the German mark and has declined against other currencies pretty much across the board Again that largely [reflects] the decline [in US rates] in relation to the climb of [foreign] interest rates, which has been particularly precipitous in the Eurodollar market We also had the effort to release the hostages, which when it occurred did lead to some selling of dollars At the moment it occurred the Bundesbank went quickly to the market and intervened We have not intervened in big amounts We've done about $150 million worth of marks and some Swiss francs The Bundesbank has done about We have not been in a mode of trying to resist very heavily the movement of the dollar, given that the market perception is that the problem is not intervention but a decline in interest rates   As I outlined at the FOMC meeting, it's a matter of timing in that interest rates have come down before there was any indication that we were making progress on inflation or on the trade balance The market currently is waiting for the trade figures this afternoon   It's 1795 It was 186 at the time of the FOMC meeting    4/29/80 "
1441,1980-05-20," [Statement--see Appendix]   I have seriously considered putting in a double shift--that is, having people in the trading room at the Desk during the night hours when the European markets are open We already monitor the Far Eastern markets, but there have been occasions when there was a slippage between the time operations ended in the Far East and the Bundesbank picked up its operations in Europe But for us that's a major expenditure of personnel and other resources, and I'd rather do that only if I felt it would be worthwhile for our people to stay up during those hours   [I'm talking about monitoring] operations and whatever feedback we might get from the European markets We would be monitoring their intervention as well as what is going on in the market at the time   There is no one more reluctant than I am A 24- hour day is unthinkable   They've done more on the way down in recent weeks as a result of these mutual concerns They're afraid that the dollar will start declining and [the monetary authorities will] have to intervene and undercut their monetary policy, and they want to maintain a certain policy restraint And we have this other risk that we are running with a sharp decline in interest rates and that a sudden decline in the dollar will trigger a speculative crisis against the dollar   Yes, I agree with you They sat very heavily on the dollar when it was rising, and ferociously so And they didn't help very much at first when the dollar began to decline But again, in more recent weeks with this convergence of interests, they have been very helpful We haven't had to intervene much, partly because of this atmosphere we are in And I still feel that the environment we've had since October 6 has been conducive to effectiveness of intervention because exchange traders are nervous; they are concerned that if they take a short position in dollars, interest rates might all of a sudden back up and it would become a very expensive speculative bet for them So, since October 6 we have not yet had to do the type of massive intervention in support of the dollar that we had to do before, even with the environment we have had in the last month   We didn't show up in the market until the dollar was around 190   Yes The Swedish Riksbank has asked if the Federal Reserve would increase its swap line by $200 million to $500 million You received last night two memoranda on the Swedish situation--one by me and one by Mr Caprio of the Board's staff As I indicated, the Swedish authorities expect a financing problem on the order of $4 billion, which this year they plan to cover largely through official borrowings abroad Of this, some $2-1/4 billion has already been arranged and additional loans are in the early stages of discussion In requesting an increase in the swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve, Governor Wohlin of the Riksbank expressed concern that the Riksbank needs more backstop in the form of short-term bridge financing than it currently has The Riksbank uses an intervention approach based on a currency basket and finances its intervention out of the proceeds of the official borrowing In light of the current economic and political uncertainties, the krona is vulnerable to a sudden burst of selling pressure, and the Riksbank may be obliged to [obtain] dollars in the market at a faster pace than they are raising them through financing In their view, the increase in the Federal Reserve line would give them an added cushion in addition to their dollar reserves and their other short-term facilities Governor Wohlin has stressed that the Riksbank has no immediate need to draw on the Federal Reserve, but he does not wish to rule out the possibility that they may come in for a drawing at some point  Now, as you can see from the memo, the Swedes are passing through a difficult time But under Governor Wohlin the Riksbank has acted to firm up short- and long-term interest rates and is pressing with some success for a reduction in the fiscal deficit The Federal Reserve's agreement to increase the swap line could strengthen his hand in some of those negotiations at home On the basis of these various considerations, I recommend that the Committee agree to the $200 million increase But given that we are living in a world in which we haven't had many changes in swap lines in recent years and haven't had much experience with drawings on those lines, I would like to introduce one wrinkle That we make the increase for one year and that we review the whole matter at the end of the year when we consider the renewal of the whole [array of] swap lines and decide then whether we want to put it on a permanent basis or not So, I would recommend a 1-year increase from $300 million to $500 million, with a review at the end of the year   Well, I'm not fully clear myself [but] the Bundesbank does allow other central banks to accumulate marks up to a certain amount before they ask those banks to cash them So, it is more of a facility on the reserve currency side The Swedes are borrowing marks quite frequently and they might want to keep some of them for a while That's the arrangement   Roughly   They are borrowing   Yes, they are making official borrowings in the Euromarkets   Because that's the seat of the European Monetary System and the members of the Board there are--   They have a swap line they just--   It's million On the point of when we impose conditions, I would rather wait and see what the circumstances are when they come in for a drawing We can then review it with the [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee and put on the conditions that are more or less specific to the circumstances at the time That is why I think this review procedure and a 1-year limit on [the increase in the swap line] gives us a little more control They are not in good shape, but this all relates to 1980 We don't know what 1981 will bring But I think our side will be better able to monitor it if we do it this way   As little as possible We were discussing having it come out on a Friday afternoon It's coming very shortly after this strike, and they did not want the market to think that they were acting in response to the adverse publicity of the strike   Well, we can say that the Federal Reserve and the Riksbank agreed on an increase in the swap line from $300 million to $500 million Full stop, unless we want to add that this shows a cooperation between the two central banks--or some language like that which we have worked up in the past   I'm sorry, I have some other comments I'd just note that there will be some first renewals of swap drawings in the days subsequent to the next FOMC meeting Normally, in our renewal cycle we report on these at this time [Each] is just a first renewal, so no action by the Committee is needed We have swap drawings of $141 million worth of German marks and $74 million worth of French francs that are up in July I would hope that we would have paid them by that time, but for the record I am mentioning them now "
1462,1980-06-05," I'm here There was some pressure on the dollar just after the last FOMC meeting and we did have to intervene, and in bigger amounts than we had before But the market has quieted down since then, given some good coordination between us and the Bundesbank in our intervention And the firming of the domestic rates and Euromarket rates particularly helped The market is currently quiet but very, very uneasy I think we've been lucky that there's a lot of selling of US dollars out there but money is going into the Swiss [franc], the Japanese yen, and the pound sterling rather than into the mark So people have not been interpreting it as a general weakness for the dollar However, we do have an ominous rise in the gold price--it touched $600 this afternoon in the [Comex] and the silver market prices are still creeping up Whether or not we're getting more speculative influence creeping in the markets, I don't know   I haven't found a satisfactory answer from anybody It broke out of a trading range People are worried about the oil price that will come out of the OPEC meeting There are a number of things in the Middle East that are bothering people as well as these general fears of inflation that still haven't been killed completely   It's supposed to be next week I don't know if the date-- "
1489,1980-07-09," [Statement--see Appendix]   About $65 billion   We have about $2 billion left   We've used $11 billion   Six billion    7/9/80   The swap line is $6 billion   The Treasury considers itself short right now under the Carter notes by over $3-1/2 billion, [so] we are in a hole   The answer to your question is that we can get more resources at some stage if the Treasury wants to go back and negotiate a new Carter note   The man who negotiated the last Carter notes is sitting next to you He's not at the Treasury now   I'd simply note that first maturities of six swap drawings on the Bundesbank in the amount of $190 million will be coming up over the period before the next FOMC [meeting] I expect to roll those over, renew them, if we do not have a significant reflow in marks that would enable us to repay them "
1536,1980-08-12," [Statement--see Appendix]   They are fully covered on the Carter notes The francs that we have accumulated recently have been put aside for payment of interest on those notes They [have] discussed a little the issue of accumulating additional francs [They are leaning to the view] that if we don't want any more they will acquire them But we still have very modest balances for the System   It could, but the question of financing their deficits is very important And they want to maintain a strong currency so they can get the funds There's a tremendous amount of competition among the authorities to get OPEC funds at this point Any slippage on your currency means that the money just isn't going to come in your direction   No they want strong exchange rates rather than fixed In fact, a gently rising exchange rate is--   Well, on that particular occasion, I talked to several people who tried to interpret it As you recall, on that Friday there were two other elements [involved] One was that the federal funds rate did ride up and the other was that a large increase in the aggregates was published later in the afternoon   Several [market players] sent out letters or cables around the world from New York and other centers over the weekend trying to assess the implications Those who said that the rising federal funds rate and the aggregates were important were right And those who said that the Europeans were going to react negatively to the discount rate were wrong They are very sophisticated but they can make mistakes, too It's very hard to judge which way to read it I raised the question with some of our senior people in the market as to whether the people who don't understand the Federal Reserve are making money at the expense of those who do I think the [answer] is that it's more haphazard That, in effect, handing the decision of determining interest rates over to the market on the domestic side is very much like the exchange market where we've turned to floating exchange rates I had to scold some of the fellows a little in that they had been so pleased to have floating exchange rates and they should be able to take advantage of the freer market for money But they're very nervous about it So if sophistication is part of it, there's also a difference in the market now with these OPEC funds The OPEC funds come right into the Eurodollar market in overnight money It's sitting there Where is it going to go? It's not going to stay necessarily in overnight money And the sensitivity to interest rates is much greater than we have felt for some time If the federal funds rate goes down, it means that the next day the Eurodollar rates will trail off in the Eurodollar market, which means that the fellows in OPEC and others who are moving money on that day will make a decision to put those funds that they are moving into marks or sterling or some [other currency] at that particular moment If the federal funds rate is moving up at that point, giving signals to the Euromarkets to firm a bit, then the money will come our way It's a very knife-edge sort of thing There's much more volatility in the dollar exchange rate than we've had in other periods when not much was really going on   It's not a question of hurting or helping at this stage; it's just that there's more volatility    8/12/80   [It is] if all of a sudden we have a cumulative movement that is triggered by it   No we haven't We haven't had it this month and we've been rather quick to operate Of course, we're basically interested in acquiring as many marks as we can to clear the decks for the next problem   In that case the surplus did disappear over the course of the next two or three years By 1977-78 there wasn't much surplus left   Yes, a lot of that came in directly into US Treasury bills and so forth At that time there wasn't quite so much diversification as there is now Also, the other central banks and authorities were not bidding so eagerly for the funds Now the German finance ministry is working very hard to get as many marks in as possible The Swiss have been very active, as have the Japanese It has not been very open, but a lot of work is being done And, of course, the French have quietly opened all the doors and windows for people to invest in francs In some ways that's healthy since they are deficit countries and the money has to go some place, so it's better to go in places where it's in strong hands But there is a difference this time The OPEC countries are not so automatically putting their funds in dollars and holding them there, particularly in open ways such as in Treasury bills And the others are pressing hard for funds to come to their way  -4-    8/12/80   Simply some renewals With the Bank of France we have one swap drawing for $26 million We've been repaying our mark swap debt but we have coming up in the next period some seven swap drawings in the amount of $382 million All of these are first renewals   If necessary "
1573,1980-09-16," [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, in terms of first renewals on swap drawings, there are six drawings on the Bundesbank for a total of $3012 million And there are three drawings on the Bank of France for a total of $85 million, one of which is a second renewal for $24 million The second renewal will require authorization by the Committee   Both; [the first discussion was] about two years ago   They are prepared to at any moment "
1595,1980-10-21," [Statement--see Appendix]   Sterling, gold   A lot has gone into sterling, into Swiss francs, and particularly into yen The Swiss franc has advanced in the last few days against the mark   It's probably in between There are footloose funds, but what we're hearing--we don't have a real term for it--one might call reverse diversification   Shifts of funds out of the German instruments and the dollar [It may involve] OPEC, a central bank, a noncentral bank It's on the margin that these people operate They're getting so much money each month, they decide which way they're going to move it; or when there are maturities, they move the money at that time   I know That is one of the questions that even some of the seasoned traders are asking Why now and not two months ago when all these factors emerged? It's a coalescence of things In some ways it reflects the post-electoral situation In Germany it was important for the Bundesbank to maintain high interest rates through the election because the whole idea was that they were fighting inflation Now that the election is over and they're looking at very slow growth and other domestic problems, the market may feel that the Bundesbank may ease up at this stage Also, some comments were made during the IMF-World Bank meeting that afterwards rattled around the press pages for several days suggesting that President [Pohl] was talking in terms of lowering interest rates He had not said that but that's the way the press played it after a while So there had been these expectations And by the time the Bundesbank did act, no one was listening It's one of these bearish situations where anything    10/21/80  positive for the currency is ignored We've seen it so many times on our side; we know all of the symptoms But as I say, it's essentially a bearish market It could pass They may have some good numbers coming up If their economy does slow, then their current account will improve   Official reaction?   On the outside they are playing it very cool because it's hard for them to know what else to do They are very concerned Of course, we have helped them a great deal; we are buying these marks in very close consultation with them And our two central banks are coordinating their intervention very closely So, we haven't had a panicky situation in the exchange market In the way they handled the rollover of one of these provisions of liquidity they did move the interest rate up a little to warn the market that they aren't caught in a fixed interest rate situation where they can only go in one way But it's a very uncomfortable situation In fact there have been crazy rumors in the market One was that they were going to put on capital controls There's no way [a government] can answer that sort of rumor when it comes out It can't deny that it's going to put on capital controls because then everybody will say Aha, they're denying they're going to put on capital controls; therefore, they're going to do it Yesterday there was a rumor that Russia had invaded Poland It hadn't happened, but it added to some of the flavor of sales of marks So there is, as you put it, outward cool But they are quite concerned about the situation   We are seeing the type of traditional strains within the European monetary system that we frequently saw in the earlier ""snake"" That is, the mark is declining and pulling other    10/21/80  strong currencies within the band down, like the French franc and the Dutch guilder In the past when someone left the snake or there was a change in par values, the whole thing snapped back giving profits to everybody on both sides So, if the pressure continues to build, we could run into one of these classical speculative sprees that we have had in the past, this time with the mark on the bottom   Well, in fact it's quite the contrary This is an operation for the Treasury We're doing it as quietly as we possibly can We've only talked with a very few people in the market The objective is to see if we can acquire more marks [through] a few people who have good corporate customers When the corporation calls in and says it has some forward marks to offer, then the trader can offer them to us The Treasury, of course, has its own maturities to consider on the Carter notes So the forward marks in addition to what we're buying spot are simply placed with the Treasury for that purpose We're doing it as quietly as we can and on the idea that it would have less impact than intervention in the spot market There's a great deal of flexibility in the forward market and it doesn't have the same influence We're doing it also as quietly as we can because our experience in the past is that once the forward market gets active and finds us there, then we can do billions without blinking an eye So it's a very, very dangerous operation But the Treasury wanted it and they're getting it   There's $160 million left under the limit on marks We've already purchased $55 million worth of marks this morning and we would under the--   It doesn't matter how much reserves you have; [what matters is] the determination that you're going to use them and the market's confidence that you're prepared to back your policies You can have an infinite amount of reserves--   Right   That's right I would have a hard time coming to you in November with a whole series of new swap arrangements for you to approve once again if I hadn't had a chance to negotiate these particular items   In November, because the first renewals are in early December So we have to act between now and November   Yesterday we bought $200 million equivalent of marks On other days we've bought $10 million The amount varies depending on the pressure Today we've already done some $85 million   To be split between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury We're splitting it down the middle all the way, except there are certain transactions that the Bundesbank insists the Federal Reserve take rather than the Treasury But basically we're splitting it   I don't want to buy $1 billion in Swiss francs "
1622,1980-11-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   It's an interesting exercise in how we achieve a certain objective In order to maximize our purchase of marks, we have to have a rising dollar market So each time the dollar would rise, we would be in the market either in New York or in Frankfurt through the Bundesbank But we would do small amounts And to the extent that we would be perceived as operating we would [then want to] be perceived as backing away It's quite different from an operation in which we're trying to stop a movement in the rate The idea was to allow the rate to continue to move and thereby we would continue to amass marks Once the exchange market comes to a stable point, it's very difficult to dig many marks out of it   It's very possible that it could have gone over 2 marks to the dollar, but with a much more volatile market, much greater pressure on our foreign central bank counterparts to do something in response to the decline in their currencies, and much greater pressure on the EMS snake relationship   I tried to phase it artfully I don't see that necessarily as an objective of policy No one has told me that it's an objective of policy I'd say it's more a result of the policy   Well, the only instance of foreign support was from the Bundesbank on that Tuesday morning Since we are operating through them to buy marks, there is the possibility that we would complete the circle and ask them also to sell marks for us The risk is that once we start intervening through the Bundesbank really in support of the dollar, then we will take over all of the operations on both sides of the Atlantic, which could be very expensive So on that morning, I talked to my friend from the Bundesbank who said he had no particular interest in buying dollars that morning, but he did notice some conditions that he considered to be disorderly--that is widespread, sharply moving rates--in the market So he did step in and buy dollars even though as far as his broader interests were concerned there was no need to step in at that time But we did have good cooperation I hope our operations now are buying a good bit of cooperation for the next sequence of difficulties for the dollar   Exchange markets are very volatile We have periods in which the dollar rises and we have periods in which it drops And as I indicated, to the extent that interest rates level off or drop back, we may have a decline in the dollar And to the extent that the markets tend to overreact then, I am sure we will be back in the market on the other side This has been the way of life since 1973   You might know more about that than I do, [Ted]   I am open to discussion, but--   The Germans have had a  have taken up a great deal of their time So what we've had in terms of economizing time, is that the Bundesbank officials--   They've been worrying about the mark/French franc relationship and we have been worrying the mark/dollar relationship We have been providing them with orders, which would be roughly the type of operations they would have in line with our objectives and in line with the kinds of operations they have conducted in the past as well   In fact, to the extent that we backed away--   To the extent that you back away, you leave an impression in the market that you're not holding the rate or, in fact, that your operations are not effective in holding the rate where it is So you are helping the rate to move along that way   Yes   Well, before the Carter notes on a couple of occasions we held $300 or $400 million worth of marks It was in that range, but not substantially more  SPEAKER(?) We hold quite a lot of yen   Yes   This is what I am telling the Treasury anyway   We might be As I said, in marks we now have $11 billion against [an informal limit of] $15 billion The maximum for the total open position was left at $8 billion from an earlier siege; that we have not changed  SPEAKER(?) In all currencies?   Yes   Technically under the directive we have two reasons for intervening One is to counter disorderly conditions The other is to change balances in light of future needs There is a very weak need [currently] for piling up lots of marks, but in light of future needs it's something we clearly have in mind Also [the directive requires that] we have close and continuous consultation with the Treasury And right now the Treasury is in a mood to have us buy as many marks as we can   Well, we've had substantial movements in interest rates  -11-    11/18/80   There are wider and wider differences between dollar rates and foreign rates   I don't know of anything other than [that]   Yes, the swap lines are cleared But between now and the end of the year all of our swap lines with 14 foreign central banks and the BIS come up for renewal for a further 12 months As in the past, I am recommending that the Committee approve the renewals at this meeting, so there will be ample time for the formal exchange of cables with our partner central banks who must also go through their formal approval processes This year the negotiations are somewhat more complicated in view of the Committee's decision to eliminate the risk-sharing provisions on our drawings and to switch to our paying of interest rates based on what one would pay on the currencies we borrow rather than on the US Treasury bill rate We have had no problem with substance with the other central banks which  -12-    11/18/80  are most affected by this decision They agree that this is a logical approach Indeed, I found out that the Bundesbank had been rather quiet about pushing the issue because they made some further calculations and found that it might be to their advantage to keep things the way they were, given the interest differentials But they haven't complained that we are moving this way For most we are waiting for each of the central banks to indicate which specific instrument in their market, a Treasury bill or whatever, corresponds most closely to our Treasury bill In most cases there should be little difficulty But in two important instances, with the Bundesbank and with the Bank of Japan, the corresponding instruments to our Treasury bill are not obvious We must be careful not to link our swap drawings to a higher cost instrument than a Treasury bill might be For swap arrangements on which we are not likely to draw, I see no need to negotiate a specific instrument on their side Nevertheless, we could come down to the wire on some of these negotiations, so I would like to recommend that the Committee approve the renewal of swap arrangements now subject to a final review and determination by the FOMC subcommittee when these negotiations have been completed that the terms and conditions are acceptable So it involves agreeing generally now that we can proceed with the negotiations and then a review by the subcommittee that the terms on the elimination of the sharing of risk and on the particular instruments that we will be using are acceptable to the Committee   But they are important elements of the negotiation   We want to know what interest rate we are going to be paying on the marks we borrow   Well, approval of the renewal of the [swaps]  -13-    11/18/80   Yes, December 4th is the first maturity for a number of them   Right They haven't said anything, so we have let sleeping dogs lie We have a sentence in the cable that will go out indicating that we are reconfirming the increase to $500 million through May, which is the date set [for the expiration of the temporary increase] We will make reference to the agreement of last May in this cable They might come back to us   Right I assume that at some point they will come back to us and ask us to make the increase permanent But since they haven't made it an issue, as I say, I have let sleeping dogs lie   No separate action for today   I am sure it will come up again because they will probably ask for a continuation; but at the moment they haven't "
1663,1980-12-05," Yes, we have The dollar has continued to be up a bit since the last FOMC meeting It has advanced by about 2-1/2 percent against the Deutschemark and by similar amounts against other currencies We have continued to buy marks in a large amount All of that to this point has been [unintelligible] to the Treasury The Treasury now, however, on the day's business is covered as far as the Carter notes are concerned The presumption is that we will now [revert] to even sharing [of purchases] between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury; [we have bought] $400 million worth of [marks] out of the $15 billion authorization to buy marks The factors relating directly to the [strength of the] dollar are mainly due to rising interest rates in the United States And in Europe we have a situation in Poland which has led to a number of [unintelligible] in the market [unintelligible] selling of the Deutschemark [and going] into dollars "
1683,1980-12-12," The exchange markets have all been going rather well, and in the last couple of days the dollar has continued to rise Today we are in a situation where the [unintelligible] was probably nearly a 2 percent range The dollar has moved above the 2 level against the Deutschemark It got as high as 203-1/4 this morning Again, it [unintelligible] interest rate The situation in Poland has been a matter of continuing concern And that brought [unintelligible] for the background in the last few days We are hearing, however, that a number of US corporations, instead of selling [foreign] currencies to buy dollars for their year-end [repatriation] of funds, are borrowing dollars in the Euromarket and using that as a mechanism to bring funds home This [reflects] the expectation that the exchange rate won't be so high for the dollar after the year-end But they are adding pressure to these Eurodollar markets; in one month the Eurodollar rate went as high as 24 percent-- that was this morning in the early hours We have [unintelligible] a big flow out of the Middle East Neither [unintelligible] in the last couple of days are the expectations that the rate will turn around We buy marks, [scaling] back our operations a bit now that the Treasury is covered on the Carter notes And we are almost fully [up to our limit]; we have about $145 billion worth of marks under our authorization of $1-1/2 billion They were sitting quietly on the day Of the marks we are taking on now [most] we have put on to the Treasury "
1703,1980-12-18," Yes, I'll discuss very quickly the agreement in principle on the two points we wanted to negotiate One was the elimination of even sharing of risk, which applied to five of the different swap arrangements The other was shifting to use of an interest rate in the foreign market as the basis for our drawings That is, we would pay their interest rates rather than ours Everyone agreed rather quickly, but it was rather complicated in view of the new procedures among the European Monetary System central banks They all wanted to sit together and discuss it among themselves before they came back Again, they agreed The second problem was to find an appropriate instrument in the other countries that came as close as possible to the US Treasury bill There aren't many countries in the world that have a Treasury bill, but we found in most of them something that was as closely comparable as [possible] The [major] negotiation on this, of course, was with the Bundesbank We are now in an end game with them because they don't have a Treasury bill Indeed, their Treasury tends to borrow at short-term interest rates that are higher than other short-term market rates So we're coming down to a formula [that is] now based on the interbank rate, with some discount for us since we think that the Federal Reserve is a better risk than German banks are to one another I'm reviewing this still, but the Treasury seems to think that that's an appropriate basis And we're having an end game with the French as well, where all of a sudden they have found that they don't have a Treasury bill whereas everybody in the world thought they did So these negotiations have become very complicated, but I think we can come out reasonably well on them   [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, recently, since we have come close to the limit we have for the Federal Reserve But at the time of the last FOMC meeting, we still had over $400 million worth of leeway   Marks and yen, specifically, yes   No   Plus whatever the Treasury has in the ESF, if you're looking at the government as a whole   I think there's also an expectation that interest rates will come down In effect, these are people who would be bringing funds home at the end of December for repatriating, for earnings, or whatever purposes Say they have their investments in Deutschemarks Rather than disturb those investments by selling the marks and buying dollars, they have borrowed dollars, say, in the Euro-market--even for one month They would bring them home and would    12/18-19/80  repay in January when the borrowing matures So it's an indication to me not so much of their interest rate sensitivity but of their expectation that the dollar will be weaker against the mark It is interpreted that way in the market as well, where it was reported   It's just under 199 It got up over 2 again this morning   No We're clear of the swap lines, and I've reported on our negotiations with respect to the renewals   But it is important to know that the limit on how much we can buy in Deutschemarks, which is $15 billion, has been set by the Committee It's not a formal action of the Committee as is the $8 billion limit on the open position, but I feel it's equally binding to me as any other action of the Committee  -9-    12/18-19/80   Well, I'm amazed that the discussion came close for the first time since I've known anything about the FOMC to a suggestion by somebody that we should buy sterling on an uncovered basis, given all the support we have given to the pound sterling over the years when it was weak I'm very much in favor of building up balances, of course, from my own bias as Manager in needing resources when we go into the exchange market I want to have enough in hand so that I can have an effect on market psychology and on the market I  -19-    12/18-19/80  think that's the important element How credible the Desk is at the moment when it appears in the exchange market  As for the comments about the possibility of pegging, I'd like to reassure everyone, having gone through personally the periods of fixed rates and the unwinding of fixed rates, that I do not want to go back to pegging I've avoided over recent years any drift in that direction and will continue to avoid a drifting in that direction This year we have gone through a Deutschemark rate of 170 to 203 That's 30 points, over 15 percent It's hard to say that that involves a pegging of the exchange rate even though we have [made] purchases and sales all the way through So I would like to reassure you on that issue But keep bugging me because then I can bug others who are likely to drift in the direction of pegging once again  I like Tony's argument that starting with balances gives us more flexibility, and then we can get into debt We have lost money on our swap drawings in recent years largely because the first drawing on the swap line was at a very expensive rate and very early in the sequence of operations And that drawing cost us money when we repaid it So if we start with balances, on which we might quite frequently be making profits, then we can protect ourselves a little better The flexibility that that gives us is important One other argument that has not been raised comes out of the experience we had with the Iranian freeze There are a lot of countries out there now that are substantial dollar holders who are not our friends, And they may use the weapon of a threat of large dollar sales in the exchange market When that threat was posed to us last year,  It's not that we necessarily need a war chest or big amounts of money in hand, but certainly having more than we have had [is desirable] And to the extent that these dollar balances abroad continue to grow, we should think in terms of having larger amounts in hand to deal with these national interest threats on top of the nitty-gritty types of things we have in the exchange markets on a day-to-day basis   Yen has a $1 billion limit and we've only used some $400 million of that And then there is a $500 million general limit [on all other currencies] of which we've used about $300 million That's mainly in Swiss francs   On these matters, I'm just as happy having the individual [currency] limits   $233 million   Nobody [has said] let's sell them! I'm not sure I want them any more "
1731,1981-02-02," I will try to be brief [Statement--see Appendix]   They've been intervening in bits and pieces all along when the rate moved sharply But they have made a decision that they will act vigorously both in the exchange market and the money market to counter the selling pressures, and I think the market has sensed that But we'll see how their follow-through is   No, I'm afraid this time most of the unemployment has [not] been exported They didn't bring many people back These are Germans who are unemployed now   The attitude of the Germans is that they can send the women back into the kitchen   I don't know The dollar dropped almost 2 percent today and almost 1 percent in 45 minutes; I think we may lose that feeling very quickly But, as I say, there has been this euphoria and a very strong feeling that everything the Germans were doing was wrong and everything we were doing was right These attitudes can change very quickly   It's a very, very psychological market we're dealing with right now It's very reminiscent of some of the things that we've seen ourselves when the dollar was weak   It was 14 They're getting the vicious circle element   Inside the Bundesbank they're talking about a 6 percent rate, but the official [forecast] is 45 percent   Oh, yes They have all those reserves they've amassed over the years And they've been picking up dollars from SAMA Every time SAMA wants marks, they go directly and--   We've had the odd situation in which both central banks were increasing their reserves at the same time over the  -149-    2/2-3/81  last few months The Germans are very worried about the 30 billion mark current account deficit they expect for this year and how much of that they might finance out of their reserves But they've been amassing reserves, as I say, until today when they really hit the market very heavily   Today's operation, yes But they're doing so many other operations with the money supply that it's hard to say what the net effect would be   I have no other recommendations now that we're clear on this one "
1844,1981-05-18," [Statement--see Appendix]   We've reviewed this and reviewed this and reviewed this, and ultimately when it comes down to policy the primary responsibility rests with the Treasury We can work on a consultation  -13-    5/18/81  basis and all of that, but if the Treasury objects, then the Federal Reserve, since I've been in it, has acceded to the Treasury's wishes   I'm not prepared to move at all until I get an authorization from Washington   No, I was holding that for my recommendations   I have no recommendations as far as any action by the Committee, but I want to inform the Committee that on the 23rd of May the increase from $300 to $500 million in the swap line of the Swedish Reichsbank that we put on last year for one year will mature The Swedes asked if it could be extended but felt they had no compelling reasons at this point to justify the extension of that increase They did use the line for $200 million and repaid, as Governor Wallich just mentioned But in recent months they have had a rather substantial inflow of funds as a result of policy measures they took early this year, so it's difficult to argue for a continuation of this increase in the current environment It's a hypothetical situation rather than an actual situation Discussions with Mr Solomon and Mr Volcker suggested that perhaps we should let the increase lapse I informed the Swedish Reichsbank that it would lapse, as it was proposed that it would last one year I told them, should they have further needs down the road, that the availability of the swap line is there and that if they want to discuss an increase again, we'd be happy to discuss it when they feel they have a compelling case They accepted that, so I am just informing the Committee rather than making a recommendation that the increase be extended   Back in 1967 we had an elegant paper that was published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin on the criteria for the swap lines based on financial data, reserve position, balance of payments, size of country, and so forth That was when we were in an active phase of adding countries to the list We haven't added anybody since I think the criteria are more what the problem is that we are facing at the time and what the financial interest is to the United States Our interests are much greater--certainly they were back in 1978 when we had the last increases--with the deutschemark, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen Those swap lines were increased at that  -17-    5/18/81  time So, it's more in response to the situations we face We do still review them; and the Board staff remember the criteria and bring them up from time to time when we are reviewing the size of the swap lines In the case of the Swedes, it turned out that on these earlier criteria, if we had continued at $500 million, then there might have been justification for some of the other Scandinavian countries to come in and ask for increases So, we still keep the criteria in mind, but the size reflects more the pressures at the time we are dealing with them   Well, it would have to be the high; it will go down from the high by $200 million   Collecting interest on our balances "
