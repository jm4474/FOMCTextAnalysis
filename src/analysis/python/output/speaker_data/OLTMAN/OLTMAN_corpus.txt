 Mr Chairman, there is authority technically to acquire cable transfers in foreign currencies As you say, in the early '60s [the issue] was thrashed out to reach the conclusion that we were authorized to acquire currency balances and essentially to set up the various swap arrangements   It was also noted in the Board's Annual Report at the time that an opinion had been rendered to the Committee that the Federal Reserve could engage in those transactions It is not any secret legal authority   You don't need to   Mr Chairman, this is Jim Oltman in New York Things here also seem not much changed We continue to see [activity] as flat, at best, for the foreseeable future--in the short run at any rate Our observation here, though, is that our directors and others have heard that projection for a while now and their patience for that explanation seems to be wearing a little thin It's not that there seems to be much around in terms of anecdotes about very pronounced declines, but it's perhaps more of a generalized sense of discouragement Indeed, I think our directors' response to our own presentations on the economy have changed from skepticism to discouragement And I'd like to echo what President Melzer said There seems to be a generalized feeling here that not too much at this stage can be expected of monetary policy   Mr Chairman, this is Jim Oltman in New York I think the mood here can be described, following on Peter Sternlight's description of the mood of the market, as one of cautious optimism I would say that with a fairly heavy emphasis on "cautious" There has been some improvement in the last several months in department store  -10-    3/11/92  sales and some uptick in new home sales, but there's a great deal of concern about the longer-term structural problems that may be lurking there--the kind that Dick Syron alluded to Bankers particularly, I think, are not at all convinced--assuming that this is a recovery-- that it is a recovery of the kind they are familiar with Refinancings of mortgages are going into shortening the terms of those mortgages to an unprecedented degree And, as has been mentioned by several people already, the movement [of funds] particularly into equity [and] bond markets continues at a significant rate Although I think there's a general attitude that things are not as good as had been hoped, there is some ground for increased confidence   Our projections are pretty close to the Greenbook projections, a little higher on GDP for 1993 but well within the [Committee members' central] tendency I must say I have to repeat the theme of uncertainty Among those we've talked to within the District, that theme is repeated often It seems sometimes only to be a [matter of] what is in fashion to cite as the focus of the uncertainty the health care reform or the fiscal package or the state of overseas economies affecting exports Overall economic activity in the District seems to be slowing somewhat but still growing at a modest rate There's almost a reluctance to concede this on the part of some of the people we talk to; they seem to want to make sure that we don't misunderstand that, yes, things are a little better but they're not as much better as they ought to be [so] don't get the wrong idea  -32-    7/6-7/93  As far as inflation is concerned, Gary Stern's observation holds for much of what we've been hearing as well There does not seem to be too much concern about inflation but there is some suggestion that [this view] results from the feeling that [the current level of inflation] is probably about as well as we can do and it's so much better than it has been, so let us not worry too much about that Some of our manufacturing contacts, for example, have experienced some mild increase in activity but without expectations that price increases are going to occur over the next year, or the next six months at any rate Credit demand, to hear the bankers, is not there; to hear the small businessmen the demand is at least a lot stronger than the bankers would have you believe When you begin to dig a little into that, you hear the familiar story of demand for higher collateral and a lot more paperwork, all of which is read by the potential borrowers as efforts to discourage them The bankers on the other hand insist, as some others here have said, that they are going out and beating the bushes and mounting serious campaigns to bring in borrowers How to square that is difficult to say; there probably is some truth on both sides To the extent that the borrowers are prepared to put up more collateral--in the case of small borrowers, for example--very often it is personal collateral, mortgages on personal residences and things of that kind That means an uncertain atmosphere generally for economic activity and a little more than a lot of uncertainty for the small business borrowers So I would say the overall mood is reluctantly positive   I would go to 1 to 5 percent both for 1993 and 1994 That was not my first instinct here I started with a feeling that changing the range at this point would imply that we know more about the process than we do But I've been convinced by the argument that this offers an opportunity to emphasize the technical nature of this and to further the divestiture of the policy component   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman Perhaps if we were starting from scratch, I would have some preference for symmetry but I don't think we ought to change [from asymmetry]
