4059,2000-05-16,"  The data on foreign economic activity that  have come in since your March meeting have run high relative to our  prior expectations  We have passed through much of this surprise to the  level of foreign output in our projection for the first half of 2000 but  have not seen as much reason to alter the pace of its subsequent  expansion     Despite the brighter prospects for the level of activity abroad, the   dollar appreciated 3-1/2 percent relative to the major currencies over the  intermeeting period  Evidently the upside surprises to activity in the  United States outstripped those abroad, and interest rates rose more here   Even after taking account of this widening of the interest-rate advantage  to US obligations, though, we have been hard pressed to explain much  of the strength of the dollar, especially relative to the euro  True, our  economic activity continues to expand more rapidly than that in the euro  area, and the cacophony of official responses to euro weakness raises  doubts that necessary structural reforms will be forthcoming     Be that as it may, with the strong external impetus stemming from   the weak euro and growing momentum to domestic spending, the euro  area should expand about 3-1/2 percent this year and next  Underlying  this forecast is the belief that the European Central Bank is very likely to  tighten in short order and eventually to raise its policy rate a total of      1-1/4 percentage points by the end of 2001  A downside risk to our  outlook for spending, however, is that European officials’ concerns  about the value of the euro in the near term will extend beyond the  essentially symbolic act of sterilized intervention, should that happen, to  a firming monetary policy sooner and by more than we have assumed   Of course, that is a risk that could be made more palpable depending on  the action you take today     We are concerned as well that Japanese officials will fail to deliver   the policy stance appropriate to ensure sustained economic expansion  sufficient to work down the considerable stockpile of unused resources   There is little doubt that near-term readings on the pace of spending in  Japan will be on the high side, even abstracting from problems with      20  measurement  As the news of this favorable first-half performance  comes out, the Bank of Japan is likely to pick short rates off their zero  floor, but only by a small amount   In our view, this near-term strength  in the economy is a temporary spurt--not much more than a bounce-back  from the sharp contraction in the second half of last year  Going  forward, households will still be burdened by doubts about job security  that will make them reluctant consumers, the lagged effects of the earlier  appreciation of the yen will cut into net exports, and fiscal policy is  scheduled to shrink its stimulus  As a result, Japanese real GDP growth  is forecast to settle at below 1 percent over the last six quarters of the  forecast period     Because the expansion of activity among our other trading partners   seems more assured, when we add it all up our forecast calls for output  growth in the foreign economies of 4-1/2 percent this year and 4 percent  next year  Of course, this outlook is shaped importantly by the past and  projected path of the exchange rate  With respect to flows, the exchange  rate acts to tilt global spending toward those regions where capacity  pressures are less binding  Thus, today’s strong dollar helps to direct  some US spending toward foreign markets, making our own substantial  pressures on resources a bit less intense  Over time, though, that same  level of the exchange rate contributes to a substantial--and deepening-- current account deficit and an increasing reliance on foreign investors’  willingness to hold increasing amounts of claims on the United States     We have not been able to convince ourselves that those foreign   investors will continue voluntarily to hold ever-larger stocks of debt at  the current level of exchange rates indefinitely  And so, we’ve written  down a path in which the dollar’s value falls over the forecast period   The sense that returns on dollar assets will look less attractive over time  to foreign investors also helps to explain the rise in longer-term yields  on dollar-denominated assets in Mike’s outlook  As any forecaster is  wont to do, we have projected a path for the dollar’s decline that is  relatively smooth  In part, that represents our equivocation on when that  process of adjustment will start  But when it does, it may not be so  orderly or well contained  Of perhaps most relevance for your policy  consideration, the decline in the dollar implies that the foreign sector  will no longer be a force helping to absorb robust domestic spending and  to restrain domestic inflation  Rather, less of any excess domestic  demand will be satisfied from foreign capacity, and import prices--and  likely tradable prices more generally--will be adding to domestic  inflation     The components of the revision to our outlook have offsetting   implications for net exports and the current account going forward  The  stronger level of foreign activity raises the world’s demand for goods      21  and services overall, to the benefit of US exports  However, because  the dollar begins our projected path of gliding down from a higher  altitude, relative prices over the forecast period work to favor imports  and discourage exports more than previously  The net of these forces is  incorporated arithmetically in the staff forecast as a shrinking negative  contribution of net exports to GDP growth this year and next that is  roughly similar to that in the March Greenbook  We also anticipate the  current account deficit to deepen to $525 billion by the fourth quarter of  2001  This deficit represents about 5 percent of nominal GDP and is  $20 billion more than in our March forecast  To the extent that you  agree with the staff assessment that the implied accumulation of US  obligations abroad will strain foreign investors’ patience, the likelihood  of the dollar depreciation we’ve projected--and the risk attendant to that  outlook--would seem just a bit more considerable       The models of optimal international portfolio diversification   would suggest that there is a long way to run because they conclude that there is a significant   home bias  That is, households in a domestic country hold far too much of their wealth in   their own currency and not enough international assets  So, from that perspective, both they   and we should be accumulating more international assets relatively  As a rough   approximation the answer you get is that the assets a country’s residents should hold ought to   be something on the order of their share of world GDP      Sure  I was talking about an environment in which there was an   equality of risk-adjusted returns worldwide  In that case the international portfolio   diversification of households would move toward--      Right  It would move toward those shares  But the fact is that   households hold fewer foreign assets than our models think they should  However, countering   that is a long historical property that they don't hold those assets, and we are testing the ranges   of reserve shares     Now to answer the factual part of your question, we don't have international flow of   funds accounts that would give us information about the levels of foreign assets and their   distributions across countries  We can get it from the perspective of the United States; in fact      28  there is a new survey coming out on that  But I can't answer your question for the Belgian   dentist or the Dutch broker     I think a significant fraction of the higher growth for 1999 and   2000 is cyclical because by our estimate there are output gaps to be worked down in many of   the industrial countries  And the fact that foreign growth in 2001 moderates in our forecast   really suggests that we couldn't find the new economy effects working as successfully abroad   as has been the case in the United States  Right now there are some tentative pieces in the   puzzle that suggest that productivity growth has probably picked up in Canada  And we have   raised our estimate of potential output growth for that country  Rising productivity is also the   case in some of the smaller European countries, particularly those that use information   technology rather heavily  However, those are the smaller countries and their contribution to   total foreign output is relatively modest  It won't be until we see something in the major   industrial countries that we are going to see foreign economic growth above the top line of our   forecast  And it's in the major industrial countries where the structural problems seem most   severe  Whether those problems will actually be a drag on activity, say, in Japan, or just   impede the progress necessary toward taking full advantage of the new economy, is hard to   say     And one reason we've been looking for it harder in the last   couple of months is that, in fact, equity prices have risen so much in many parts of Europe       34  And the better performance of IT-sector equities relative to the major indexes also has some   precedent in the US data     That was one of the small countries in Europe that I had in   mind  There is an OECD study that looks at a few of the peripheral countries and argues that   the trend in output per hour has picked up in them       Right now it is relatively modest  I don't have the numbers in   front of me, but I think it is on the order of 1/2 percentage point     What’s involved is the distinction between the level and the   growth of consumption  There will no longer be an impetus from wealth adding to or   boosting consumption growth, although the earlier wealth effect will still be supporting the   level of consumption  So just from the fact that the stock market levels out, we no longer get   that kick in consumption  "
4200,2000-11-15," The outlook for foreign economies in the Greenbook   should seem familiar  After all, it shares key properties with the past few  projections prepared for the Committee this year     For one, the staff anticipates that economic growth in most major   industrial economies and in the developing world will be solid over the next  two years, albeit somewhat slower than the rapid pace recorded in the first  half of 2000  This step-down in the rate of GDP growth owes both to the  aging of the expansion as pent-up demands are increasingly satisfied and to  monetary policy firming around the world as resource utilization rises  In  Europe, 1/2 percentage point of policy tightening by the European Central  Bank within the next year will work to offset the stimulus to net exports  emanating from the earlier depreciation of the euro, holding growth to around             16     3-1/4 percent over the forecast period  In the developing countries, output  ultimately settles at around a 5 percent pace     For another, Japan once again is an outlier  Our readings of incoming   data lead us to believe Japanese real GDP will be virtually flat in the second  half of 2000  The recently announced fiscal package merely keeps the level  of the deficit about unchanged, implying no net impetus to growth from  fiscal policy  With huge ongoing fiscal deficits and rapidly mounting debt,  policymakers in Japan will be looking for any opportunity to begin to scale  back government spending and raise taxes  Indeed, the mounting challenge  to the current prime minister appears to hinge importantly on calls to scale  back public works spending, which is increasingly seen in Japan as  ineffective  Meanwhile, households appear reluctant to spend  In that  environment, we see the Japanese economy as treading water for the next  couple years, expanding 1 percent and 1-1/2 percent in 2001 and 2002,  respectively  We think that slight pickup in growth, by the way, will provide  the Bank of Japan enough rationale to tighten policy by a small amount  toward the end of the forecast period     Taking our cue from oil futures markets, we again expect oil prices to   decline going forward, essentially reversing almost one-half of the run-up  witnessed since the end of 1998  Those futures prices align with our  assessment of fundamentals  We anticipate that current pressures will lift as  lean inventories are restocked in the near term and global capacity expands to  fill the increases in demand associated with steady world economic growth in  the intermediate run  Those lean inventories, of course, imply that there is  currently less of a cushion to absorb unexpected fluctuations in supply or  demand, placing a wide uncertainty band around our point forecast,  particularly in the near term      And, we are sticking with our outlook that the dollar will depreciate   going forward  The specific assumption in the November Greenbook is that  the broad real foreign exchange value of the dollar will shed about 2-3/4  percent next year and the year after  Again, this owes to our view that the  step-down in economic growth and profitability in the United States and  accumulating current account deficits will tax foreign investors’ willingness  to continue to add US obligations to their portfolios on net       While the basic structure of our projection does not differ much from   those in the past few Greenbooks, we tried to convey a sense of a changed  tone, in that the risks to the foreign outlook now seem better balanced  As  you recall, for much of this year we’ve been in the position of catching up to  surprisingly good incoming readings in most foreign economies  And our  projections for economic growth have accordingly edged higher meeting             17     after meeting  This time, backward-looking readings on activity have  unfolded in the past six weeks about as we had expected  And forward- looking indicators of spending in Europe and Japan, including surveys of  household and business confidence, have been a bit softer on balance,  leading us to notch lower our second-half projection of real GDP growth       In addition, the funding difficulties in Argentina over the past few   weeks serve as a reminder that old-style financial crises remain possible in a  new world economy, further underscoring the notion of downside risks   With a fiscal deficit of around 2 percent of GDP and external debt amounting  to about 50 percent of GDP, Argentina is overly reliant on the confidence of  foreign investors  While officials there have done much to extend debt  maturities and line up contingent funds, rolling over the bulge in debt  maturing in the next two years looks to be a close-run thing  The news out of  Buenos Aires and Washington over the weekend--including the promise of  government efforts to trim the social security system and rein in the civil  service compensation and provincial spending in return for funds from the  IMF and the multilateral development banks--was generally favorable   However, reports of late suggest that it may be difficult to get the provincial  governors on board a reform bandwagon  Our working assumption remains,  as in the Greenbook, that Argentina will squeak through these funding  problems and keep its currency-board arrangements intact  In any case, I  would note that the alternative simulations in Part I of the Greenbook suggest  that as long as any crisis is mostly contained to Latin American debt markets,  the effects on the United States are quite limited     And recent movements in the dollar might indicate the return of two-  sided risks about the economy in the foreign exchange market  While it is  true, once again, that the foreign exchange value of the dollar in terms of the  major currency index rose over the intermeeting period on net, in the past  couple of weeks it has moved lower on balance  The inflection point came  on October 27, with the release of a third-quarter US GDP figure that was  weaker than expected  This market reaction to slower US growth is an  example of the mechanism that we expect will sap the dollar’s strength going  forward  Increasingly, as investors come to realize that US growth has  stepped down, in effect trimming the tail on any “new-economy” premiums  expected in US returns, foreign obligations will look increasingly better   The resulting dollar depreciation--which we’ve smoothed through over the  forecast period for lack of any precise notion of when investor sentiment will  change--implies that the foreign sector will no longer be a force helping  restrain domestic inflation  It also implies that foreign industrial economies  will have to rely increasingly on the momentum of their own domestic  markets to sustain economic growth as the stimulus from strong US external  demands wanes                18        When we think about trying to do those sorts of things, we also   have the problem of what to assume about other asset market prices  If we adopt the path from   the futures market curve, then what do we assume for stock prices or what should we do for the   exchange value of the dollar?     But we don’t have as clear a road map for, say, the exchange value   of the dollar or equity prices as we do in the money market futures curve  "
4383,2001-08-21," Perhaps the hardest challenge confronting the  staff as we sorted through the incoming data over the intermeeting  period to prepare a forecast for the global economy was to avoid falling  into a self-reinforcing spiral of pessimism  As the forecasting process  unfolded, we marked down the outlook for economic growth abroad in  part because of weaker prospects at home  But this translated into the  expectation of both lower US net exports and a weaker global market  for technological products, trimming the projection for US GDP and  creating obvious implications for overseas activity  This iterative  process converged at a significantly weakened projection for foreign  economic growth relative to what you saw eight weeks ago  Still, we  think forces are in place that will foster a revival in growth, albeit a  little more delayed and to a somewhat slower pace than thought at the  time of the June meeting         As for the near-term outlook, real GDP in the foreign industrial  countries is expected to expand at just over a 1 percent annual rate in  the second half of 2001, about 1/2 percentage point slower than  forecasted in June We have also penciled in only modest expansion in  the developing economies of Asia and Latin America over the  remainder of the year that puts the level of their output at the end of this  year 1-1/4 percent, on average, below our projection in the last  Greenbook Three factors mostly account for our more pessimistic take  on the pace of global economic activity this year   First, incoming data on spending, production, and employment  have almost invariably disappointed  Output contracted in Germany  and Italy in the second quarter, and more forward-looking indicators of  household confidence and business purchasing intentions do not bode  well for growth going forward in the euro area  While domestic  spending in Canada has held up well thus far, employment is beginning  to sag And Japan appears to have slipped into another recession  Real  GDP is also declining in the developing countries of Asia that direct  much of their exports to the global electronics market and in those  countries in Latin America with trade tightly linked to the United  States Meanwhile, the prices of many internationally traded     8/21/01 9   commodities have continued to tumble, which is probably a sign of  falling contemporaneous demand         That leads naturally to the second source of downward revision to  foreign growth--the marking lower of the near-term US outlook   We’ve pulled down our projection of activity abroad both because  some of the adverse effect of more slowly growing demand in the  United States falls on foreign markets and because an important drag on  our own economy--reduced demands for capital attendant to the re- evaluation of the prospects for the tech sector--is also playing out in  many other countries   Third, it has become painfully clear that the financial crisis in  Argentina has already extracted a heavy economic toll there  Output is  contracting, unemployment is rising, and prices are declining   Meanwhile, risk spreads remain elevated and deposits in the banking  sector are running off rapidly Indeed, the most obvious vote of “no  confidence” in the current situation is what Dino already related--that  an estimated $4 billion of US currency was shipped to Argentina last  month Perhaps it evidences our lack of imagination, but we find it  hard to picture how the government of Argentina can extricate itself  from this situation in a manner that stanches output losses anytime  soon And without economic growth, its poor fiscal position stemming  from its high debt burden will only look more unsustainable than it  does today, and the threat of spillovers to Argentina’s neighbors will be  that much more palpable    After the forecast was put to bed, we received data on US  international trade for June that would not lead us to alter the top-line  number we wrote down in the Greenbook but that did serve to  underscore our sense of ongoing weakness in global economic activity   The US trade deficit on goods and services, at $29-1/2 billion, was  about what we were expecting and close to the number the BEA  assumed in constructing its preliminary estimate of second-quarter  GDP What surprised us, however, was that this deficit was arrived at  by shrinking the values of both exports and imports  Particularly of  note was the fact that the dollar value of capital goods crossing our  borders in either direction was smaller in June than in May, extending  the trend of the past few months   While I’ve emphasized the downward revision of foreign  economic growth in the near term, perhaps the most important feature  of the outlook is unchanged We still believe that economic growth  abroad will pick up next year to a rate not very much below that of its  potential This growth revival may be a bit more attenuated than in the  prior few Greenbooks, but it still relies on the same four forces     8/21/01 10   First and foremost, as David has already described, the expansion  of US economic activity is expected to step up in 2002  We think that  will be associated with a large positive swing in the growth of US real  imports that will benefit activity in our trading partners  Moreover,  given that the US growth pickup includes a turnaround in investment,  greater demands for capital here will brighten the outlook for the tech  sector worldwide   Second, while data on inventories abroad are spotty and unreliable,  we believe that part of the dynamics of the slowing of the past few  quarters in many foreign countries has included a production  adjustment in response to some stockbuilding that developed as demand  weakened unexpectedly  As inventories stop falling next year, that  drag on real GDP growth will be lifted   Third, monetary policy in many industrial countries has already  weighed in to support aggregate demand going forward We think that  most of those central banks will continue to ease and that some other  central banks will join in  In the case of the Bank of Japan, however, it  remains to be seen whether an elevated provision of liquidity, which  was announced last week, will bolster spending given that the policy  rate is already at its zero floor  The issues are more conventional when  it comes to Europe  In common with the net judgment of participants  pricing money market futures, we believe that the European Central  Bank will ease 50 basis points by year-end, as their task is made easier  by declines in headline inflation induced by falling energy prices   Fourth, with regard to energy more generally, the price of West  Texas intermediate oil has fallen about $4 per barrel over the past three  quarters, and our forecast, following oil futures markets, holds that  another $3 per barrel price drop is in store by year-end 2002  We  anticipate that this price decline has been and will be shifting income to  those residents of the global economy who are more likely to spend it,  bolstering consumption in many countries   Although we’re relatively confident about the existence of these  forces helping to shape a rebound in spending in 2002, their magnitude,  timing, and whether other sources of restraint will more than offset  their impetus are far from certain  Two prominent risks emanate from  global financial markets   For one, we assumed in our projection that the real foreign  exchange value of the dollar would follow a track tilted slightly  downward But the fact is that the dollar’s value fell more in the past  week than the decline stretched out over the next six quarters in our     8/21/01 11   projection This recent downdraft might be the first sign of a risk factor  that we’ve fretted about for some time--that foreign investors’ appetite  for adding to their holdings of US obligations will wane  But the  foreign exchange market has given us false signals before, so we have  treated this latest stepdown as evidence of greater odds on a downside  risk rather than as a reason to pull down our baseline forecast  To get a  sense of how events may unfold should that risk materialize, we  included an alternative simulation in the Greenbook in which the  dollar’s broad real value drops nearly one-quarter by early next year   From a US perspective, the resulting ratcheting higher of foreign  relative to domestic prices encourages exports and pulls down imports  to add about 3/4 percentage point to GDP growth in the first half of  next year and twice that amount in the second half  The impetus to  inflation is even more striking, with core inflation running 1-1/2  percentage points faster by the end of next year  The chief risk to the  global economy is that this relative price change off-loads some of our  ongoing weakness to our trading partners  With the nominal interest  rate already at zero in Japan and the fiscal deficit a source of concern,  Japanese policymakers may be poorly positioned to counter such  imported weakness and, unless the stronger euro emboldens the ECB,  European policymakers may not be willing to do so   As another risk, our Latin American outlook assumes that the  fallout from problems in Argentina will be relatively contained to that  nation’s immediate trading partners and other Latin countries reliant on  international capital markets  That assumption was based on the logic  that global investors have seen this coming and that the IMF’s stand-by  arrangement with Brazil will ring-fence that country  But part of  Argentine officials’ bargaining strategy of late has apparently been to  elevate expectations in the market of the size of a package in order to  put pressure on the international financial institutions  If either less  new money is forthcoming than those encouraged expectations or what  comes fails to cover Argentina’s subsequent reserve losses, then the  scope and severity of contagion may be more than we’ve built into the  Greenbook I don’t have a simulation to point to mainly because it  didn’t seem like a productive use of our large-scale macro models, as it  would be highly nonlinear and especially dependent on market  sentiment  That concludes our presentation, Mr Chairman   "
4430,2001-10-02," Actually, I think a large part of the reason central bank   liquidity contracted comes through in Dino’s inset at the top of page 6, namely that   intermediation wasn’t functioning when four out of the five federal funds brokers were   out of service As the fed funds market became operational and those with insufficient   positions could get their reserves from those with excess reserves, there wasn’t a need for   us to blow up our balance sheet to replace the unavailable intermediation  So I   interpreted the reduction in nonborrowed reserves and the decline in the Desk’s open   market operations as evidence of a return of the federal funds market to more normal   functioning    I’d like to add just one other point  In establishing a   reference point, President Jordan, you might want to go back one or two weeks from   September 5th Reserves are very erratic on a week-to-week basis and it looks as if from   a weekly standpoint your base point is a little low relative to the previous two or three   weeks  "
4474,2001-11-06," Historically, Mr Chairman, the Treasury has been concerned that an   environment in which investors are not sure they actually will receive the security they purchased   may turn off some investors  As Dino pointed out, during the time the fails were occurring some   foreign central banks were not making their securities available in the market because they were on   the receiving end of fails too They’d lend the securities out but weren’t getting them back  So they     11/6/01 7   decided not to participate in the market because they in particular like the orderly receipt of their   securities I think the Treasury’s argument is that if fails continue for a protracted period, then at the   margin at least some investors will pare back their participation in the Treasury market  "
4475,2001-11-06," Mr Chairman, if you wanted to appear more neutral, the verb   “detracts” may also seem negative    So if instead it said “is likely to slow the advance in measured   productivity” I think that would pretty much go in the direction of neutrality  "
4524,2001-12-11," Mr Chairman, they are highly correlated because they are functionally   related The prepayment speed is a function of the level of mortgage yields, and given the close   relationship--   Right And if you look at a short period where there hasn’t been much   change in the underlying pool of mortgages, that function is going to show up as much closer  If you   stretch this back over time, where there is a bigger diversity in the outstanding pools of mortgages,   then the correlation will be changing  So I think you’re right If you take a snapshot, a relatively short   window, they are going to be highly correlated because basically you are looking at prepayment speed   for a given set of mortgages that all have similar coupons      Exactly It’s a crucial element given the net extent of the distribution of   mortgages In a relatively short period of time, the distribution of mortgages isn’t changing so you        12/11/01 8    really see the function Over time, as the distribution of mortgages changes--as some age and as   prepayments occur--then you’re going to see a weaker relationship  So when Dino and his colleagues   go back and examine this, they’ll see a shifting relationship  In any short window, though, you’ll see a   relatively close one  "
4525,2001-12-11," Just an observation, President Minehan  It is certainly true that if you   look at implied volatilities on bond contracts, either the 10-year or the long-term Treasury securities,   they are very much elevated  They are in a range we haven’t seen since 1993; in some way it’s similar   to the observed volatility that Dino showed in his presentation  But the implied volatilities have come   off in the stock market, so it isn’t obvious--    It isn’t obvious that the equity markets are more uncertain now than they   were for most of this year  And in the Greenbook financial projection David didn’t respond   completely to the run-up in long-term yields over this intermeeting period in the same way he didn’t   respond completely to the remarkable and inexplicable decline in the previous intermeeting period that   was associated with changes in Treasury debt management  So if I were to add to your and Dino’s list   of market-specific events that have affected the amplitude of the swings in yields, I think I would also   have to include the discontinuation of the 30-year bond    So some of the run-up we’ve gotten in this period reflects some rollback   of what we saw last year    All the macro simulations you will care about will be at the shortest a   quarterly frequency; and probably you’ll really only want to think about it in terms of year-by-year   effects A lot of these market mechanisms, including the changes in the duration of mortgage-backed   securities, affect the amplitude of interest rates in a relatively short period  But I’m not willing to say   that the level of the long-end of the yield curve is noticeably higher because of these mechanisms   relative to a year ago--  "
4526,2001-12-11," There are two aspects to what you said  The first is, yes, the model   represents an average behavior over the historical period that was estimated  That by itself smoothes     12/11/01 73    the reaction of households and businesses to changes in financial market prices  It smoothes the   reaction in financial market prices to changes in behavior  Putting all that smooth behavior into the   model would, as your intuition suggests, allow short-term interest rates to move a lot in order to   stabilize the results But the second aspect is the word “deterministic”  This really is a perfect   foresight path It assumes that you know the whole future path of the outlook and you know what the   coefficients are precisely If you just had uncertainty about the coefficients in the model, and   depending on which coefficients they were, you might attenuate; you might not react as strongly to   that news So it is possible to construct an optimal path in the presence of uncertainty about both the   model and the shocks that, depending on the objective function, potentially will have the property of   moving the funds rate in the outlook period by less  The shorthand way of capturing that without   working out the very hard problem of specifying the uncertainty about the coefficients and the shocks   in the model is to say, well, find the solution under perfect foresight but put a penalty on movements   in interest rates    Equal distaste    Just to underscore what Don said in terms of the robustness of   alternatives, it really depends on the duration of the other alternatives  Some of the types of shocks in   the Greenbook alternatives, which are relatively temporary, don’t perturb this path all that much  But   one can imagine other types of shocks, including different assumptions about productivity growth, that   could displace the path by much more because you are choosing an entire path  And here comes our   part of the presumption of putting this in the Bluebook  We had to make an assumption about the   Committee’s long-term inflation goal  These simulations were constructed using the assumption that   it was 1 percent But if you move that a bit, it will have marked consequences    One, for instance, is the Money Market Services survey  In last Friday’s   survey, twenty out of twenty respondents said the balance of risks would be tilted toward weakness    For the January meeting it was three out of twenty who thought it would go back to the neutral  By   the time you get to their expectations for the March meeting, it is half toward weakness and half   toward neutral  "
4582,2002-03-19," Actually, Mr Chairman, it’s a pretty easy calculation because foreign   and domestic holdings seem to be growing at just about the same rate      As we estimated it, the growth rates were similar  Looking at   currency shipments in January, overseas and domestic holdings were both growing at 12 percent    In February it was about 8½ percent for overseas and 13 percent for domestic    That’s in part how we get the numbers  It’s one way of estimating   this number; we look at that and the data we get from currency shippers  "
4583,2002-03-19,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that Carol Low distributed during the coffee break   The resilience of household spending, the signs of stirring of investment, and the  significant slowing of the inventory run-off that have become evident in the past  seven weeks would seem to reinforce the judgment that the Committee’s easing cycle  has drawn to a close The better news has cumulated to produce a 1 percentage point  upward revision to the staff’s forecast of real GDP growth this year and has been  associated with sizable increases in market yields all along the maturity structure,  presumably speaking to similar substantial changes in investor expectations  While  there have been favorable developments of late, for real GDP growth to persist  around or a bit above that of its potential will require household spending to continue  to be well maintained—despite the saving rate being quite low—and investment to  gather momentum, despite the fact that a recovery in profits has not yet been  established  Market participants seem confident that policy will be entering a  tightening phase, but no one expects the Committee to begin it today  That is  probably because those analysts appreciate that even a quick snapback in spending  will take some time to whittle away prevailing resource slack, and as a consequence,  inflation should remain low for some time  This would give you the opportunity to  await convincing evidence on the underlying support to the expansion of final  demand before you need to act to preserve low inflation     These considerations would seem to imply that the answer to the question, “When  should the Committee begin removing the unusual degree of accommodation put in  place last year?” is “Not today”  Rather, the more pertinent question would seem to  be how to assess the balance of risks if the funds rate were held at 1¾  On a surface  reading of market prices, it might appear that the pronounced upward slope of federal  funds futures rates implies that market participants assess the risks to be so tilted  toward inflation that you will need to begin tightening very soon  I’ll offer an  alternative interpretation that suggests that the structure of market rates may not be  inconsistent with holding the funds rate at its current level for a time  I will then use  that framework to consider a key strategic issue you face that, in turn, bears  importantly on today’s policy choice   The string of surprisingly strong data on spending and production released over  the intermeeting period prompted the 10 to 55 basis point upward revision to market  expectations of the federal funds rate shown in the upper left panel of your first  exhibit As a result and as plotted in the right panel, market prices now embed an   2 Materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                      March 19, 2002 Page 78 of 117  anticipation that the funds rate will rise to 5¼ percent in mid-2004  There are three  notable features of this configuration of rates that I list in the middle left panel  First,  federal funds futures rates move significantly above 1¾ percent in a couple of  months, apparently signaling the belief that policy will begin tightening on the heels  of the end of the easing episode What is puzzling about this should be evident in the  bottom panel, where I’ve split the path of the funds rate over the past two decades  into the obvious easing and tightening episodes  As shown in the panel at the middle  right, pauses since 1989 after a sequence of policy actions were lengthy  Second,  money market futures rates climb almost continually over the next couple of years,  implying that policy tightening will be extended  But as the middle right panel also  shows, phases of policy tightening since 1989 have usually lasted under one year   And third, these expectations of imminent firming are difficult to square with the  published forecasts of most market economists, who fail to foresee the sort of  pressures on resources that would require action soon   There is an alternative explanation that fits these observations on policy  expectations quite well and that also may help to resolve these seeming anomalies  In  a regime-switching model, we can view market participants as expecting the nominal  funds rate to return to a more sustainable level rapidly once the tightening process  starts but hedging their bets as to when that tightening will begin  The top panel of  your next exhibit gives a formalization of this notion  In particular, I assume that  market participants expect the Committee either to keep the funds rate at its current  level or to begin tightening Once a tightening phase is begun, everyone expects that  the funds rate will be steadily, but fairly rapidly, moved up to some sustainable level  with no reversals or pauses Lastly, if the funds rate has continued to be held constant  in any given month, market participants assign a constant probability of switching  over to a tightening phase in the next month     This model can be fit each day to the expected path of the funds rate derived from  futures markets  The upper right panel shows the evolution of estimates from this  model of the market’s assessment of the probability that the Committee will begin to  tighten next month Although the current reading of an 11 percent chance of  tightening beginning next month might seem small, these probabilities must be  cumulated when making forecasts several months ahead  As plotted in the middle left  panel, according to current market prices there is a one-in-two chance that the funds  rate will be rising six months from now  The right panel suggests how aggressive that  rise may be expected to be  Estimates derived from yesterday’s closing futures rates  suggest that market participants believe that once you begin to tighten, you will move  the funds rate up about as fast as you moved it down—within one year—or about at  the norm of the prior decade  However, presumably because inflation has fallen in  the interim, you’re viewed as likely to return the funds rate to a level of only 5¼  percent, lower than its level when easing started in January 2001   To be sure, you are deciding on the appropriate stance of policy to adopt today,  and what happens over time depends on developments that are inherently  unpredictable, so you may view this interpretation as unlikely in practice                     March 19, 2002 Page 79 of 117  Nonetheless, thinking in terms of the path of interest rates over the next several years  highlights a key strategic question you face  What inflation rate would you prefer to  prevail after interest rates and output have been realigned to more-sustainable levels?   To get some sense of the possibilities, my colleagues in R&S who maintain the  FRB/US model ran simulations, described in the bottom panel, that extend the  forecast until 2007, preserving the key features of the Greenbook outlook  Here is  our opportunity to dig deeply into the salt mines that Dave mentioned earlier  The  simulations used the version of the model in which workers and investors form their  expectations based on past observations of important macroeconomic variables   These scenarios envision the consequences of moving the real funds rate to its long- run equilibrium level of 3½ percent relatively smoothly in one year, along the lines of  the regime-shifting model  The simulations differed according to when you are  assumed to start tightening—next quarter, one year, or two years later  If deferring  policy action for another year or more seems like a long time, I’d note that the  cumulative probabilities derived from the regime-switching model imply the  expectation of about a one-in-five chance that you will not have started tightening by  the second quarter of 2003  That said, very little probability weight appears now  placed in the markets on the possibility that you would hold the funds rate at  1¾ percent for more than two years   These simulations, shown in your last exhibit, put numbers on the obvious  The  longer the Committee waits to tighten, the more unemployment will be worked down  at the expense of an ultimate step-up of inflation  What these simulations show is  how sizable those differences can be Were policy to begin moving the nominal  funds rate up next quarter—shown by the black line in the upper left panel—the  drifting higher of the unemployment rate to 6¼ percent by year-end 2003 in the  middle panel would open enough slack to induce core PCE inflation (the bottom  panel) to settle at around ¾ percent  Delaying that process by one year (the blue  lines) or by two years (the red lines) would forestall that rise in unemployment at the  cost of about 07 and 13 percentage points of higher inflation, respectively, down the  road   The ¾ percent rate of core PCE inflation achieved under the immediate tightening  scenario would be as close to a working definition of price stability as the US  economy has achieved in five decades  If, despite the associated ¾ percentage point  temporary rise in the unemployment rate, the Committee desired that outcome, it  presumably would communicate to the public that its near-term assessment of risks  was tilted toward inflation  After all, were your longer-run inflation goal to be  ¾ percent, the prevailing inflation rate of 1½ percent would seem to pose a greater  source of discomfort currently than the margin of unused resources  But you also  might find some appeal in moving toward risks tilted toward inflation if you were  worried that the economy could snap back more quickly than in these simulations, so  that holding inflation around its current level, let alone reducing it, was in doubt  before too long—that is, in the foreseeable future  The apparent turnaround in the  prospects for investment, favorable news on productivity, and recently legislated  business tax incentives represent a real shock that may warrant a real response in                        March 19, 2002 Page 80 of 117  short order In that regard, I’d note that some estimates of the equilibrium real rate  reported in the Bluebook rose as much as ½ percentage point over the intermeeting  period    It is also possible that the Committee might not see much benefit in defining  price stability as the very low outcome for measured inflation in the immediate- tightening scenario  There were times late last year when the prospects for the  economy were sufficiently gloomy that the zero bound to nominal interest rates  loomed large  Keeping a bit of an inflation cushion might help to reduce those  anxieties in the future in case aggregate demand weakened to the point where a  negative real short-term interest rate was called for  If you’re comfortable with the  prevailing inflation rate and think the Greenbook assessment of the underlying forces  shaping economic performance is about right, then either the staff projection or the  scenario I dubbed “intermediate tightening” would offer an outlook in the near term  with perhaps only small net deviations from your dual objectives of maximum  sustainable growth and price stability  Moreover, the odds on additional adverse  shocks, which darkened the outlook just a few months ago, might seem to be  considerably reduced If so, the risks might be seen as balanced  True, with the real  funds rate close to zero, the Committee will ultimately have to tighten  But  “ultimately” might be beyond the horizon at which you deem the foreseeable future to  end   The case for retaining the balance of risks toward economic weakness could  possibly be made based on the delayed tightening scenario  Were your inflation goal  really to be that much higher than recent readings, you’d presumably prefer to make  some inroads into current resource slack and might see the possibility of additional  easing as not too unlikely But allowing that much slippage in underlying inflation  seems too much at odds with what you have said and how you have acted in the past   Rather, retention of the tilt toward weakness would more appropriately be  underpinned on some combination of two beliefs  First, these simulations, as well as  the Greenbook forecast, might be viewed as being premised on too pessimistic a view  of the economy’s ability to use its resources without engendering inflation—a point  Governor Bies and President Minehan have made  If that were the case, you could  make those inroads into labor market slack seen in the delayed tightening scenario  without the worrying drift-up of inflation—indeed, if you didn’t, inflation might get  uncomfortably low Second, you might be concerned as to whether the expansion of  final demand will be well maintained, especially if market participants get ahead of  themselves in anticipating tightening if anything but the retention of risks unbalanced  to weakness were announced  Essentially, you might have viewed the risks as  balanced at the market prices that held in, say, late February, but the rise since then—  and the potential rise were you to change the tilt—might seem to you as tipping the  scales toward weakness    I think part of the answer, President Parry, is that it is beyond the   ability of our model to differentiate between the FOMC’s starting to tighten a quarter or a half   year from now and four quarters from now  Given the artificiality of the exercise I’ve done, it   may very well be the case that one would expect a much different configuration of market prices   as each month went by and the Committee did not act  So that is clearly a risk here  I think the   important point to get out of that true blue line is that it isn’t obvious that policy action is   imminent—that some element of delay is possible, and I’ve put it in these terms to help frame   the balance of risk decision    I would point to the regime-switching model, which I think speaks to   two things that you’ve said First, it isn’t necessarily the case that market participants have a   sharply delineated expectation of when you will start tightening So I think it isn’t obvious—and   I probably should have included this in my answer to President Parry—that failing to tighten   after a meeting or two will necessarily prompt a backlash in the market  If the market has a   15 percent probability that you will act, then it has an 85 percent probability that you will not act     The second part of the regime-switching model is the notion that the Committee can dip a   toe in the water and the markets will view it as purely that  I think part of the attractiveness of a   model like this can be seen in the experience of the tightening episode in 1994  The Chairman   went up to the Congress and told the world that interest rates would be rising  Many Committee   members shared that assessment of the economic outlook  Fed funds futures sloped sharply   upward But as soon as the Committee started tightening in 1994, those futures rates moved up    Essentially, the way I would view it is that the probabilities in the market that the Committee   would act were relatively high but that the act itself sent them all to 1  The markets envisioned   you embarking on a relatively rapid tightening phase and re-priced accordingly  So there is a   risk associated with taking some action and thinking that the rest will be deferred  In my view   the one opportunity in that regard, which some market commentators have noted, relates to the   wide recognition that at least a portion of your easing actions involved in some sense taking out   an insurance policy Canceling that insurance policy isn’t necessarily a commitment to   completely realign rates            March 19, 2002 Page 83 of 117   I think a message in the alternative NAIRU simulation that Dave put   in Part 1 of the Greenbook was that, if you believe the NAIRU is lower than the staff estimate,     March 19, 2002 Page 84 of 117  you could associate yourself with the red line in the middle panel and get an outcome like the   blue line in the lower panel or better  It’s just a question of what your assessment of the NAIRU   is    I would say that my confidence in the model is such that I   contemplated not putting numbers along that axis but just sending the message that it was now,   later, or even later  "
4628,2002-05-07," In terms of the facts, the ten-year swap over the ten-year AAA in the   latest observation is a differential of about minus 50 basis points    At the time of the last meeting it was minus 30, so it has widened by   20 basis points    Okay The other point to make, just in terms of intermeeting   developments, is that we haven’t focused as much on the AAA rate because it has been   somewhat distorted by the problems of GE    Okay We can do that                May 7, 2002 8 of 81 "
4629,2002-05-07," And that assumed dollar depreciation beyond the Greenbook forecast   horizon is really capturing the tension that Karen noted in her assumption that the dollar remains   flat There are conflicting tensions, of course, with the most notable one being that if we didn’t   have that assumed dollar depreciation, the current account deficit would continue to head south             May 7, 2002 65 of 81  There would be an accumulation of US debt abroad, and that would pose problems, particularly   when considering very long term simulations of our model    That is something we could easily incorporate in future Bluebooks,   subject to our ability to solve the model when the current account deficit begins to grind even   lower    I can talk about it; I’m not sure I’ll necessarily be wise!  I would note   that we see a substantial uptick in the upper bound to the equilibrium funds rate around the end   of 1997, the beginning of 1998  That corresponds with the introduction of the TIPS-based   measure because that’s when we had a fully articulated term structure  The observation you’re   making could be translated into a different puzzle, and that is why the real rates that come out of   the indexed debt market are so high or the corresponding inflation compensation measures we   get are so low It’s one of the reasons we do spend some time talking about liquidity in the         May 7, 2002 66 of 81  market  But to an important extent, it is a puzzle  There is a term premium that we can't   identify There’s a liquidity risk premium and an inflation risk premium  All those things might   be entering the calculation of, say, inflation compensation  That shouldn’t necessarily be   distorting—except the liquidity premium—our estimate of the equilibrium  But the main reason   we track it is that it’s the only market-based measure we have  And perhaps it gives us pause in   overinterpreting our model      Especially when there are significant changes in energy prices, which   could have a bigger effect on the indexed debt real rate    Yes, the fact is that the further-ahead futures rates from the eurodollar   term structure are much higher than we would have in the Greenbook forecast and would imply   real rates in the neighborhood—if you believe our inflation forecast—as high as these indexed   readings         May 7, 2002 67 of 81 "
4681,2002-08-13," Mr Chairman, one way to look at it would be the credit defaults swap   spread for GE Capital—this is for five-year protection against default—which is 75 basis points   versus 290 for GMAC and 455 for Ford Motor Credit  It did rise, however, about 15 basis points   over the intermeeting period  But in comparison, the Ford Motor Credit spread rose 265 basis   points over that period    Mr Chairman, one other aspect that was talked about at that time was   the financial strength of the parent There were a number of stories about GM particularly and   the unfunded pension liabilities associated with the declines in equity prices  So it’s also   possible that that could have affected investor sentiment toward those companies, independently   of what they sell            August 13, 2002 9 of 92   Also, Governor Bies, July was the first month in which commercial   paper outstanding increased this year One important reason was that there have been large   inflows to money market mutual funds and the fund managers had to invest those dollars   somewhere  So probably on the margin that made commercial paper a little more attractive    Yes, July was the first monthly increase in nonfinancial commercial   paper this year    Mr Chairman, I just wanted to point out that August 14 is the   deadline for corporations’ SEC filings and today, August 13, is the deadline for your filings   regarding special topics for the January 2003 meeting    My goal would be to distribute a memo to the Committee on Monday   that lists the results of your returns  So there’s still a little time to come in under the wire  "
4682,2002-08-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Talk about the dog days of  summer Over the intermeeting period, share prices rode a roller coaster that left  equity investors 7¾ percent less wealthy, key emerging financial markets flared,  rumors of funding difficulties at several large intermediaries surfaced, and incoming  indicators suggested that employment and spending growth had softened  It is  beyond my ability to explain why financial markets were so volatile over the  intermeeting period  However, I believe that three threads of the complete story bear  upon your policy deliberations today   First, as David related at the beginning and virtually every other speaker around  the table reinforced, the economic news, especially of recent vintage, proved  disappointing But, second, those economic data were more of a surprise to market  participants than they were to us  At the time of your first meeting in 2002, market  forecasts of aggregate demand and its implicit balance with aggregate supply were  such that the federal funds rate was expected to be 2 percent by now and to move up  to 4½ percent by the end of next year In the time since, the structure of expected  policy rates up to the end of next year has shifted down as much as 2¼ percentage  points One question is whether, in the process of adjusting their outsized forecasts of  economic activity and the attendant policy response, market participants have  undershot the mark as much as they overshot it in January   What was a surprise to us—and to virtually all other observers—was the  amplitude of the swings in financial markets  On six out of ten days during the  intermeeting period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved more than 100 points   At their nadir, broad share indexes were 20 percent below their June 25 levels but  now have rolled back almost two-thirds of those losses in a couple of weeks  This  leads to my third observation  To some extent, market dynamics feed upon  themselves  One mechanism in that process is the unfortunate tendency for large  swings in prices to expose weaknesses on some balance sheets  In the 1994-95  episode of a substantial runup in long-term yields, a few mortgage-backed hedge  funds and a county treasury of note were found to have feet of clay  In 1998, the  losses came from a hedge fund that was even more noteworthy  This time around, a  less receptive capital market showed that some firms in the energy trading and  telecom industries were not much more than Potemkin villages, hiding hollowed  balance sheets behind the glitz History suggests that there is a natural cycle of recoil,  recrimination, regulatory response with a lag, and relapse over the long run  With                        August 13, 2002 67 of 92  investors apparently still in the recoiling stage, the staff projects in the Greenbook  considerably lower equity wealth over the next year and a half than in the last  forecast   The disappointing economic data, the loss in equity wealth, and a tightening of  credit markets imply that the expansion has lost some traction in the second half of  this year But as these effects on the level of demand dissipate, the economy should  recover to a growth rate just a bit above that of potential output  As a result, the staff  is forecasting that more resources go unused for some time but that the extra slack  helps to hold inflation around its current level   Compared with the forecast in the June Greenbook, these outcomes are likely to  be less appealing to you in furthering the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate  But you  might still elect to keep the federal funds rate at 1¾ percent even if you thought the  staff outlook was the most likely to materialize  In particular, your perception of the  lags of monetary policy may be such that action at this meeting would not materially  influence economic growth over the balance of this year  That is, today’s setting of  the policy rate would mostly shape economic performance in 2003 and beyond  And  while there is a weaker demand component to the staff’s revision to next year’s  outlook, a significant portion reflects a reassessment of the growth of aggregate  supply that you might view as outside the scope of your influence   Moreover, you might have reason to believe spending will revive more forcefully  than in the staff forecast  Households have proven remarkably resilient over the past  two years and may do so again, a notion supported by continued strong auto sales   With a real federal funds rate close to zero, policy has provided forward thrust to the  real estate sector and has facilitated the ongoing extraction of owners’ equity,  evidenced in part by another wave of refinancing that seems not yet to have crested   The hesitancy of firms to hire and to invest may be due, in part, to elevated  uncertainty in financial markets  But if the deadline for executives to certify their  corporate reports passes without any major fireworks, perhaps that sense of  uncertainty will ebb and the advance of employment and capital spending will regain  vigor Indeed, the nearness of that date when uncertainty might be considerably  reduced may further recommend a policy of watchful waiting to the Committee for its  meeting today   The case for policy ease at this meeting would seem to rest on the sense either that  the staff’s outlook has it about right but the slow pace at which slack is whittled down  is unacceptable, given inflation holding steady, or that there are significant prospects  that outcomes could lean toward weaker aggregate demand and lower inflation than  in the Greenbook As to the former, the perfect foresight simulations reported in the  Bluebook accept the staff’s assessment of near-term developments and the FRB/US  model’s specification of behavior with complete conviction  Within that framework,  policymakers desirous of smoothing employment and output gaps would ease policy  soon—even if the inflation goal were as low as 1 percent  In that exercise, a little  more than ¼ percentage point ease would trim a few tenths off the unemployment                              August 13, 2002 68 of 92  rate while still putting inflation on a course that drifts lower  An inflation goal of  1½ percent could accommodate more-substantial easing now while moving the  unemployment rate down to 4¾ percent in the transition to its long-run equilibrium   These exercises, of course, convey a false precision about our understanding of the  workings of the economy or your ability to use policy to shape outcomes  But the  general message is also conveyed by the decline in most measures of the equilibrium  real federal funds rate reported in the Bluebook   Also arguing for easing policy at this meeting, the Committee might believe that  the staff was too tentative in reassessing the forces determining inflation  The sense  of heightened uncertainty, lessened earnings prospects, and withdrawal from risk- taking evident in the substantial declines in equity prices could also surface as  unusual restraint on the spending decisions of households and businesses in coming  quarters As Karen noted, the ongoing travails of key emerging markets also have the  potential for reducing demands for US goods  And the revisions to the path of  productivity now seem to accord a greater role to a reduced natural rate of  unemployment in explaining the good performance of inflation  If the natural rate of  unemployment is, in fact, south of the staff’s new estimate of 5 percent, even more  disinflation may be in store than along the Greenbook baseline  Such further  disinflation would erode the inflation cushion the Committee has to put real interest  rates sufficiently into negative territory at some later date if events warrant   As gauged by money market futures rates, the federal funds rate is now expected  to drop below 1½ percent later this year  Thus, viewed from financial markets, the  question is not if the Committee will ease but when  And the answer from those  markets apparently is not now but soon, in that recent surveys indicate that the modal  outcome for this meeting is that you’ll keep the funds rate at 1¾ percent  So as long  as you do not disabuse market participants of your willingness to ease policy if the  situation warrants in coming months, the economy will benefit from the expectation  of imminent ease—that is, from lower capital market yields  If events over the  coming intermeeting period call for an easing move, the Committee can confirm  those policy expectations at the next meeting—or sometime sooner if necessary—to  preserve prevailing financial conditions  If the current run of subdued economic  reports gives way to a pattern more consistent with sustainable economic expansion  and markets settle down, investors will roll back that putative easing in coming weeks  of their own accord   From this perspective, if you keep the federal funds rate unchanged, your decision  on the balance of risks depends on whether you share the assessment of risks apparent  in the markets  The retention of balanced risks to the Committee’s dual objectives  would work to send the message that it believes that market participants had swung  too much from their over-optimistic mood of the spring  Recent surveys and the  configuration of futures rates is consistent with significant probability weight massed  on a more accommodative message, so short- and long-term rates would back up  some if that proved not to be the case  If so, equity prices would soften                       August 13, 2002 69 of 92  If the Committee’s assessment is that the tail of adverse outcomes has fattened  sufficiently, switching to a balance of risks weighted toward economic weakness  would both more accurately convey that sense and likely encourage asset markets to  continue to support economic growth  Short- and long-term interest rates would  probably edge lower, and a bounce-up in equity prices would probably be in store   While there is a risk that market participants would interpret the switch to unbalanced  risks as evidence of the Committee’s doubts about economic growth going forward,  that could be mitigated by emphasizing in the press release that the economy is  expected to continue to expand    Well, the Taylor rule is supposed to be in part descriptive of policy   decisions That is, the parameters were fit to explain a good part of the 1990s  So in that sense   the Taylor rule is consistent with what the Committee has done in the past  The important piece   of information that the Taylor rule doesn’t have but the perfect foresight simulations do have is   the intercept—that is, r*  This particular picture has a real interest rate of 2½ percent  Well, if   you turn to chart 5 in the Bluebook, you see that just about all the model-based estimates of the   equilibrium funds rate are below that  So it wouldn’t take much shifting down of that intercept   in the Taylor rule to make them consistent  "
4733,2002-09-24," By our estimates, Mr Chairman, the foreign holdings of US   currency have fallen rather sharply over the last couple of months  Just for background, in 2000   and 2001 foreign holdings were growing at a clip of about 9 percent  Our estimates are that in   July their growth was around 8½ percent, and then it slowed to 4 percent in August and actually   has contracted in September thus far    In terms of the direction, it’s a variety of regions     Domestic currency growth is around 4 percent    The uncomfortable one is that domestic currency is   contemporaneously correlated with spending    The domestic component of currency is correlated with   contemporaneous spending  The correlation is not particularly high though    I hesitate to give you a number, but we certainly will     Actually, Mr Chairman, in terms of a staff model of currency the r   squared is around ½, and it’s highly correlated with nominal PCE with a significant t statistic  "
4734,2002-09-24,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to start with an  observation about the market reaction to the announcement after your August  meeting, using the materials that were just distributed  At that meeting, some  members stated a preference to retain an assessment of balanced risks as to your dual  objectives on the concern that market participants would read a shift toward economic  weakness as signaling an intention to ease imminently  In the event, as shown in the  upper left panel of your first exhibit, our estimate of the path of the federal funds rate  expected by investors shifted up a tad in the near term immediately after the release  of the decision Apparently, market participants interpreted the decision as evidence  of a reluctance to ease soon  But this apparent reluctance, the switch in the risk  assessment, and the associated words, against a backdrop of declining equity prices,  seemed to suggest a downward revision to the economic outlook consistent with the  federal funds rate being 20 basis points lower over the next two years than previously  anticipated   Most market yields—such as the ten-year Treasury yield in the middle left panel   —trended lower in subsequent weeks This movement is hard to square with    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                    September 24, 2002 75 of 115  economic data releases, which were mostly mixed  One way to quantify this is to  compare what happened with what would have happened had markets reacted to the  surprise component of those releases as they had on average over the prior ten years   I’ve marked the major data releases by vertical lines in the panel, measured their  element of surprise as the actual value less the expectation as surveyed by Money  Market Services on the preceding Friday, and estimated the average response with a  regression using the experience over the prior ten years  As noted in the middle right  panel, the estimated contribution of macroeconomic data to the change in the ten-year  Treasury yield over the past six weeks nets to about zero   That is pretty much how the staff reacted to the data, in that the outlook presented  in the most recent Greenbook does not differ materially from what you saw in  August One possibility explaining the 50 basis point drop in the ten-year Treasury  yield is that other events intruded, including warnings on earnings that further  deflated equity values, elevated concerns about another war in the Gulf that prompted  a bit of a flight to safety, and heightened mortgage-related hedging flows that Dino  mentioned  Another possibility, though, is that your policy choice at the August  meeting, amplified by subsequent public statements, sensitized market participants to  the potential for slower growth in spending and production going forward than  previously expected   While the near-term economic outlook was about unchanged over the  intermeeting period, you also received information in the Greenbook about the  anticipated performance of the economy over a longer period  In that first look at  2004, the unemployment rate ends that year about where it is right now—  ¾ percentage point above where the staff presently puts the natural rate of  unemployment  In the interim, the unemployment rate is projected to rise a bit from  its current level, a prospect that you might find likely given the stubbornly high level  of initial claims for unemployment insurance  As a result, the Greenbook poses the  possibility of the unemployment rate averaging close to 6 percent over the next  2¼ years   The “policymaker perfect foresight” simulations reported in the Bluebook and  repeated as your next exhibit offer potential paths for the funds rate that make more- substantial inroads into resource slack than in the Greenbook  To be specific, these  simulations take the staff outlook and the FRB/US model as assured representations  of how the world will evolve over the next five years and assume that policymakers  care equally about deviations of unemployment from its natural rate and core inflation  from an assumed target  Even with a penalty placed on changing the funds rate, the  perfect foresight policymaker embarks quickly on a path that sends the real funds rate  deeply negative by the end of this year—whether the inflation goal is 1 or 1½ percent   Much as in these simulations, you might view easing policy ¼ or ½ percentage point  at this meeting as taking the opportunity provided by the ongoing favorable inflation  environment to ensure more-solid growth of aggregate demand with an eye toward  making more progress in fostering employment gains                     September 24, 2002 76 of 115  Policy ease at this time could find additional favor for two key reasons  In  particular, the Committee may harbor concerns about the sustainability of the  economic expansion  In the staff forecast, household spending is expected to flag  sometime soon as the allure of buying still more cars and SUVs fades as incentives  become less generous  Real activity continues to expand despite this rough patch  because firms are anticipated to pick up their spending on capital goods and to rebuild  their inventory stocks In an environment of heightened risk aversion, businesses  may not be quite that willing to step into the breach  Moreover, economic growth has  cooled in many of our key trading partners, and you may have doubts about whether  policymakers abroad will have the willingness or ability to offset this weakness if it  should intensify   Policy ease might also be warranted if the Committee found the Greenbook too  pessimistic on an important aspect of economic performance  The staff has explained  the good output-per-hour performance of the past few quarters as actual productivity  drifting further above an unchanged trend of structural productivity  If, as noted in an  alternative simulation in the Greenbook, the staff has been too cautious on that score  and the trend line has in fact rotated up, core PCE inflation may be headed south of  1 percent by year-end 2004, potentially below the range many of you would define as  price stability This might be particularly worrying if you take the decline in some  measures of longer-term inflation expectations over the intermeeting period as  evidence that markets have put more weight on that possibility as well   Although simulations such as the ones on this exhibit might be taken to support a  move of either ¼ or ½ percentage point at this meeting, there is obviously a lot more  that has to enter your deliberations than the mechanical application of a model  In  particular, market participants will read what you do and say closely for signals on  your assessment of economic prospects  In the current situation, it may well be the  case that the stimulative effect of lowering interest rates would be offset some if that  action were accompanied by the retention of a statement that the risks remained tilted  toward economic weakness  If so, this might incline the Committee—if it thought  easing were appropriate—toward a larger move rather than a smaller one to allow it  to assert more credibly that the risks were balanced  An unfortunate aspect of this  sort of interaction between the decision on the funds rate and on the balance-of-risks  assessment is that it may make modest policy adjustments more difficult to  accomplish at this stage in the policy cycle  One potential way to ensure that the  policy process remains flexible is to consider the possibility of an intermeeting move  should incoming information indicate that spending was losing momentum or  geopolitical events turn adverse   But your outlook may be such that policy ease of any magnitude would be judged  to be inappropriate at this time  Making the case for keeping the funds rate at  1¾ percent at this meeting can be accomplished by listing what was wrong or omitted  in my discussion of the policymaker perfect foresight simulation—and some of you  may believe that is a long list indeed  But whatever its length, the list has two                    September 24, 2002 77 of 115  subheadings  inadequacies of the process itself and problems with its maintained  assumptions   As to the former, the process of calculating an optimal path for the funds rate  using the FRB/US model may lend itself to recommending excessive fine-tuning of  the economy for two fundamental reasons  For one, the model has the property that  US monetary policy has a small, but discernible, near-term effect on spending while  inflation depends on a long cumulation of output gaps  This offers policymakers the  opportunity to vary short-term interest rates at a high frequency to shape the near- term dynamics of spending without giving up much on inflation in the longer term   You may assess the ability of policy to affect aggregate demand over the current and  next couple of quarters to be much smaller than the point estimates in these numbers   For another, these model simulations are done under complete certainty, suggesting a  degree of confidence in the channels of policy that you are unlikely to share  In the  current circumstances, the Committee may be particularly unsure as to how financial  markets will react to any policy surprise  In the presence of this kind of uncertainty  about the policy multiplier, the Committee might want to shade its desired policy  setting toward that which will not surprise markets  With investors counting on  policy staying on hold, this would counsel inaction at this meeting   But the Committee may also favor keeping policy on hold because its outlook  differs from that conditioning the simulations I’ve been discussing  As shown in your  final exhibit, the real federal funds rate already lies below zero, and the gap from  most estimates of its equilibrium value remains substantial  While survey measures  of consumer confidence have moved lower, households have been avid buyers of big- ticket items, perhaps suggesting their spirits are undimmed  Additionally, the  Committee might be concerned that any additional policy impetus would flow  through a relatively narrow channel, feeding the recent rapid rise in home prices and  further encouraging households to stretch their balance sheets  While this might  support topline GDP for a time, it might also create imbalances that will pose  problems down the road  This, of course, is not a new tension in policymaking  By  definition, interest-rate-sensitive sectors bear the brunt of adjustments in interest  rates   With the outlook about unchanged, holding the funds rate at 1¾ percent would  seem to be consistent with retaining the balance-of-risk assessment tilted toward  economic weakness, especially considering what appears to be low odds of a pickup  in inflation in the foreseeable future  While it is true that two dates that caused  concern ex ante—the August 14 recertification deadline and the September 11  anniversary—proved uneventful ex post, enough in the world remains uncertain to  justify that judgment  Indeed, markets remain skittish, the potential for military  action in Iraq seems significant, and the threat of terrorist attack at home was raised to  “high” since you last met           September 24, 2002 78 of 115   The direction of the policy they would prefer  "
4790,2002-11-06," Let me conclude the staff portion of these remarks by  explaining what Dino and I hope to get from the Committee this afternoon  Basically,  we’d like your advice on what portions of five different items you want us to continue  to work on and what time frame, if you do want us to work on them, you think would  be reasonable  Specifically, we’re asking whether you want additional study on  (1) purchasing outright mortgage-backed securities underwritten by Ginnie Mae;  (2) acquiring foreign sovereign securities as collateral for temporary dollar  transactions; (3) developing an auction credit facility to complement Desk operations;  and (4) using an auction credit facility to substitute for Desk operations in an  emergency    The fifth item concerns the publication of the materials that the staff presented to  the Committee in January 2001  As you recall, at that time there was a desire to get  those materials into the public domain to inform both the academic and the  investment communities about the options the Committee was looking at  In  addition, it seemed desirable to have those in academia and the markets think harder  about the issues the System should consider in determining what to put on the books  of the System Open Market Account So the fifth item we’re asking for is approval to  publish this staff study in the upcoming intermeeting period once final edits are  completed  We’re not seeking a vote, as this study is not an official document of the  Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve Board, or Federal Reserve  Banks We intend to include a foreword to the document that will make that explicit   The foreword will also include an explanation that the study is a historical document  that represents what we understood in January 2001 and has not been updated  That  needs to be said in part because of—and the Committee hasn’t discussed them—some  procedural changes that have evolved since then, including importantly the adoption  of the Lombard facility  If you have any particular advice about what else should be  in that foreword, we’d appreciate having it  In summary, those are the issues on  which Dino and I would like to get your views today      Right We can include that in the foreword and also in the first   footnote to the ACF discussion in the study itself    We have more than sufficient direction, Mr Chairman  [Laughter]    I would suggest that Dino and I go back and look at the transcript of   this discussion [laughter] and solve that problem  One thing that’s clear is that Dino will be   studying the options associated with acquiring Ginnie Maes and then we’ll get back to the   Committee to—     From what I heard, and I hope Dino agrees, the Committee has taken   off the table accepting foreign sovereign debt as collateral at this time; and has also taken off the   table a contingency ACF The first order of priority, in terms of staff study, is acquiring Ginnie   Maes outright in the portfolio And you’re deferring to our judgment the issue of when resources   are available for further study of an ACF  The sequence may very well be that we will come   back to the Committee with a document about Ginnie Maes and ask at that time what you would   like to hear about an ACF  "
4791,2002-11-06,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the materials  that were distributed to you during the coffee break  As has been true at the past few  Committee meetings and as shown in the top right-hand panel of your first exhibit,  market participants expect the federal funds rate to turn a bit lower before moving up  in the summer of next year The nadir of the expected path of the federal funds rate is  now a touch lower than in August and September (the left-hand and middle panels),  although the funds rate ultimately rises to a level that is about the same as was  anticipated six weeks ago  The current situation is unlike that in advance of those  previous meetings in another respect, as seen in the middle panels, by the evolution of  an estimate of the probability of a ¼ percentage point move as derived from the front- month money market futures contract  At last night’s close, financial market prices  were consistent with a high probability of action today   Indeed, as seen in the first two columns of the table at the bottom of the exhibit in  the summary of the Money Market Services Survey of policy expectations released  on Friday, twenty-five of the thirty-six respondents expect policy easing, with fifteen  anticipating a cut of 25 basis points and ten looking for a 50 basis point move   Apparently regardless of the rate action, market participants expect you to retain an  assessment of risks balanced toward economic weakness  Moving further ahead, the  majority of respondents expect the funds rate to be at least as low as 1¼ percent in  late January, with the balance of risks still pointing toward economic weakness   Thus, the case for holding the funds rate at 1¾ percent today must recognize that,  as President Broaddus noted, some market disappointment would attend the  announcement of that decision  But you might be willing to accept that reaction  As  shown in your next exhibit, your aggressive policy actions in 2001 moved the real  federal funds rate, the dark line in the upper panel, from around 4¾ percent at the  beginning of the year, to about zero by year-end, where it has been held since   Although estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, represented by the  swath of blue in the figure, have also moved down, you’ve kept the real rate below  the lower bound of that range The red line amid the blue plots one particular  estimate, the FRB/US model’s view of the real short rate ultimately consistent with  sending aggregate demand to the level of potential output  The spread of the actual  real rate below this estimated equilibrium concept has been sizable for some time   Indeed, the bottom panel cumulates the effect of that wedge on the quarterly growth  of real GDP (at an annual rate), taking into account the model’s assessment of the  lags in monetary policy  According to those estimates, monetary policy stimulus  began to kick in only by the middle of last year, as policy easing was initially only  offsetting the cumulative effect of the real rate running above its equilibrium value  for much of the second half of the 1990s  The staff model would suggest that policy  easing thus far has been adding about 1¾ percentage points to real GDP growth this  year Given the lags in policy, the Committee’s prior actions will continue to impart  sizable, albeit waning, impetus over the forecast period   2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                        November 6, 2002 76 of 122  You may not be troubled by the assessment that the stimulus to growth of your  previous actions will erode if you also believe that the forces currently restraining  spending, including the lagged effect of earlier declines in equity wealth, credit  stringency both in markets and at banks, and the enervating effects of elevated  uncertainty on household and business confidence, will be lifting relatively quickly   In those circumstances, the current degree of policy accommodation would facilitate a  return of the growth of aggregate demand to that of potential output in short order   But that is not the staff forecast, in which events turn a bit gloomier before that  rebound in growth materializes   A mechanical way of responding to that near-term soft patch is offered in the  Bluebook in the policymaker perfect foresight simulations, repeated as your next  exhibit In this exercise, the FRB/US model with the extended Greenbook  assumptions is taken to be a complete, unerring description of the US economy  As  shown in the two upper panels, these simulations entail easing aggressively over the  next half year—and then tightening almost as quickly—to work down the resource  slack evident in the unemployment rate plotted in the middle panel  By these  calculations, policy ease would be called for even if your implicit inflation target was  1 percent (the red lines), let alone the 1½ percent goal depicted by the green lines   Indeed, in this framework, policy ease is necessary to prevent inflation from edging  below 1 percent, which might otherwise make the conventional estimate of the mean  bias in the PCE inflation rate of 2 percent loom particularly large  Given the concerns  expressed at recent meetings of the potential problems posed, should future adverse  shocks necessitate putting the real federal funds rate deeply into negative territory, the  Committee might have a preference for more of an inflation cushion than that   If you were inclined to do so, the extent to which you might ease probably  interacts with how you would assess the balance of risks at that new stance of policy,  the subject of your final exhibit At the top of the exhibit, I’ve listed how the  Committee described its disclosure policy when it was introduced in January 2000   As noted in the first bullet, the Committee has promised that its statement will  express its “sense of risks to the attainment of its long-run goals of stable prices and  sustainable economic growth”  However, as in the second bullet, that attainment is  assessed over the “foreseeable future,” admittedly an elastic concept about a  “relevant” period that may depend on economic conditions   A complication that several members have noted at the past few meetings is that  the balance of risks assessment has the potential to influence investors’ confidence in  the economic outlook as well as their expectations of policy  If so, you might be  concerned that a policy action deemed insufficiently stimulative to balance the risks  might be undercut by an adverse reaction to the policy statement  This interaction of  words and action makes it difficult to build the case for easing 25 basis points in that,  if you shared the staff’s assessment that economic momentum had flagged, such a  move would not likely put the perceived risks back into balance  It would only be if  you viewed the outlook as having deteriorated a bit—but not as much as in the                             November 6, 2002 77 of 122  Greenbook—that you might see 25 basis points of “insurance” as fostering a better  balance to the risks   Given the staff’s assessment of the economy, you might see a 50 basis point move  as a closer call on balancing the risks By way of example, the lower left panels give  the FRB/US model’s prediction of what would happen to real GDP growth, the  unemployment rate, and core PCE inflation were you to lower the funds rate 50 basis  points at this meeting and hold it at that level thereafter  This is the “lower funds  rate” alternative of the Greenbook, where the blue bars give the alternative results and  the red line depicts the baseline outcomes  As indicated in the box at the right, even  after ½ point of ease, the Committee might indicate that the risks were still tilted  toward weakness because in the near term—that is, before any effects of action today  would plausibly leave an imprint on the economy—resource slack builds  Moreover,  the uncertainty surrounding the forecast might seem to weigh particularly heavily on  the downside   However, as noted at the lower right, the Committee might put particular weight  on the observation that, after policy action, aggregate demand is expected to expand  considerably faster than aggregate supply in the second half of 2003 and in 2004, an  outcome that might be seen to offset the prospect of declining core inflation if the  “foreseeable future” stretches sufficiently far     It is also possible that the Committee might view action today as better balancing  the odds of its own future action, despite whether it saw the macroeconomic  consequences of an adverse outcome for spending as worse than would attend a  positive surprise  That is, easing today might make it a coin toss as to whether the  next move was up or down  Such an interpretation of the risk assessment, though,  might not be seen as progress in your disclosure policy  Three years ago, the  Committee abandoned the old “tilt” in the directive because it had become too rigidly  interpreted in markets as a signal on the next policy action  That completes my  prepared remarks    As I stated, there are two roles for the balance of risks statement  One   is as an indication on the course of the economy, and the other is an indication of the likely   prospects for policy over the foreseeable future To the extent that markets focus on the latter   and see the risks tilted toward weakness as raising the odds of action in December, then a cut of   25 basis points at this meeting with an unbalanced risk statement is going to get them to price in   significant odds of an additional 25 fairly shortly     From a macro standpoint, if the funds rate is 50 basis points lower by   December 10, it’s not going to make a whole lot of difference if it got there in one step or in two    But there is the first role for the balance of risks statement that I mentioned as well, which a few   members have emphasized over the last couple of meetings, and that is, What will it do to   business and investor confidence that the Federal Open Market Committee lowered rates but still   sees the risks tilted toward economic weakness?  You have to balance the two off      Well, it might be more efficient to have this discussion over lunch      That will be an FOMC discussion, however    We don’t close the meeting   [Brief recess]  "
4839,2002-12-10," I just wanted to note that by our next scheduled meeting, the Federal   Reserve System will have in place a new discount window facility  As the Lombard facility has   been thirty years in the making, I wanted to remind the Presidents that the Reserve Banks should   indicate to Jennifer Johnson by this Friday how they intend to set the initial penalty rate  We do   want this to get started the right way            December 10, 2002 77 of 87   January 28 and 29  "
4840,2002-12-10," As you noted, President Poole, M3 has been growing very rapidly    It’s on track for something like a 19½ percent rate of growth in November That is accounted for   mostly by the growth in money funds, which probably expanded at a rate of about 80 percent last   month That in turn is a direct result of the policy easing and the historical accounting in money   funds They pay the average return on their assets  When short-term market rates fell with the                  December 10, 2002 18 of 87  ½ point policy easing at the beginning of the month, investors rushed in to extract some of those   capital gains We think that pretty much has played out    A lot of them would involve some substitution from RPs in particular    But we think that, on net, there is some attraction from other sources of funds into M3    Not in particular, no     "
4841,2002-12-10," Actually, Brian Madigan will give the monetary policy briefing    I think one could also say that the mechanical application of the   policy made under a perfect foresight rule suggests perhaps more confidence in the exact         December 10, 2002 72 of 87  structure of FRB/US than anybody around the table actually has  In particular, one property it   has is the ability for monetary policy to have an almost contemporaneous effect—a one-quarter   effect—on real activity Therefore, it does lend itself to a policy involving sharp changes in the   funds rate That’s why we have to put in a penalty for smoothing the funds rate  So I think the   staff is in the position of not knowing your objective function nor knowing the median structure   of the US economy that would together form  the optimal policy path  The interest rate   assumption just tries to smooth through some of those problems  "
4893,2003-03-18,"  The other obvious factor, Mr Chairman, would be earnings growth    A willingness to run your book with a little less insurance might also be associated with efforts   to expand the overall size of the balance sheet and to increase earnings  In fact, Fannie’s   earnings growth has been faster than Freddie’s      The other point I’d make, Governor Bernanke, is that in the indexed   debt market in the United States, as the Chairman noted, the ten-year yield is down more than   1½ points over that same year  So we can’t rule out the possibility that what we’re seeing is a   shifting lower of world real interest rates  "
4894,2003-03-18,"2  Mr Chairman, Carol will be distributing some materials  that I’ll be referring to  With events moving quickly, I thought it best to start with  the snapshot in exhibit 1 of market participants’ current thinking about the decision  you will announce this afternoon  As shown in the top panel, at ten o’clock this  morning the April federal funds rate futures contract traded 9 basis points below the  current 1¼ percent intended level, consistent with a one-in-three chance of a  quarter-point easing  Survey responses collected Friday (the middle left panel)  indicate that the majority of investors believe that you will depict the balance of  risks as tilted toward economic weakness, a shift in sentiment (the middle right  panel) that followed the release of a surprising contraction in payroll employment   You might not want to bank too much on these readings, though, in that  expectations have been changeable of late and are now quite diffuse, as shown in  the bottom panel in the implied probability distribution of where the funds rate will  be in six months  Note both that the left tail of this probability distribution is  bunched at quite low levels of the funds rate and that one-fifth of the mass rests  above the current intended rate     Among the market participants who are counting on policy easing, recent   readings on the labor market—both the February employment report and the high  level of initial claims—seem to weigh importantly in their thinking  Moreover,  with equity wealth once again lower and consumers appearing less confident, the  expansion of aggregate demand seems to be on a slower track than we had  anticipated earlier  The declines in estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds  rate, plotted in your next exhibit, summarize that downward reassessment of  spending relative to potential output  Indeed, by these measures, maintaining the  current stance of policy would imply some tightening of the real funds rate gap  relative to what you viewed as appropriate with your easing on November 6  Note  also that this assessment is not just a characteristic of the staff’s outlook and  empirical models (the shaded region), in that the reading of the equilibrium rate  derived from the indexed debt market (the thin line) also turned down  With  inflation also inching lower in the projection, the Committee might view the cost of  another 25 or 50 basis point easing as small given the stability of long-run inflation  expectations (the bottom panel) relative to the benefits of some stimulus to  aggregate demand     For all the focus on weakness in hiring and in confidence over the intermeeting   period, other data have been mixed and on net have led the staff to increase the  level of real GDP in this quarter and the next compared with the baseline presented  in January  Indeed, as shown in exhibit 3, two- and ten-year Treasury yields                                                    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)      March 18, 2003 69 of 101    actually rose in the half-hour windows surrounding the key data releases  represented by bars in the top left panel  That is, as the tally at the right indicates,  the reaction to macroeconomic news cannot account for the net movement in rates  since January 29     The sharp and sudden movement in asset prices at times over the past few   weeks on rumors of war may reveal the extent to which the current configuration of  financial market quotes is only loosely tethered to economic fundamentals  It  seems that uncertainties about war and the economy are leading spenders and  investors to defer commitments, but we have no way of parsing the relative  importance of those two sources of doubt  Market prices, though, appear consistent  with the overall amount of uncertainty abating over time  If not, it is hard to  understand why, as shown in the two middle panels, risk spreads on corporate  bonds narrowed over the intermeeting period—as Governor Bies mentioned—or  why options on swap forward rates and oil prices imply that volatilities are expected  to move lower, as shown in the bottom panels     Given this prevailing uncertainty and skittishness in the marketplace, the   Committee might be especially unsure as to how investors would react to policy  ease at this juncture  Going back to the transcripts from the onset of the Gulf War  in 1991, more than a few members doubted the efficacy of monetary policy action  in spurring spending when global events were in the driver’s seat  As the  discussion about policy gradualism at the last meeting underscored, such  uncertainties about the policy multiplier, all else being equal, would probably  incline you to attenuate action, perhaps to the point of keeping policy on hold at this  meeting  With conflict in Iraq seemingly at hand, this is one of the few times it  could be said that some aspects of uncertainty will lift with the passage of time— although to what degree and how soon are not obvious at this point      Deferring action might also be seen as having the advantage of allowing the   Committee to calibrate its action more precisely as additional information about  geopolitical developments emerges  Indeed, the Committee might want to be able  to use a significant portion of the current 125 basis points of room above the zero  bound in a timely fashion if events turn sufficiently adverse  While research  generally counsels that the presence of the zero bound makes acting preemptively  superior to arguments about “keeping your powder dry,” that body of work  measures time in quarters  With war seeming about to begin, you may be  measuring time in days or weeks, and it is difficult to imagine that a short delay  would leave a discernible imprint on economic activity  But the Committee might  view those darker possibilities as quite remote  Rather, the Committee may be  reading the substantial rally in financial markets when coalition troops commenced  the Gulf War in 1991 as the more likely outcome  If it is mainly worries about the  world that are making households and businesses hesitant to spend, then the  successful prosecution of war against Iraq should resolve some of their doubts and  provide important stimulus to spending  That said, the current situation may not be  nearly as neat as in 1991 in that concerns about geopolitical tensions might not be   March 18, 2003 70 of 101    punctured by decisive military victory, given questions about the formation of a  new government in Iraq, the prospect for terrorist actions, and adverse  developments in other trouble spots  If that seems farfetched, I’d remind you that  we are once again at code “orange,” indicating heightened risks at home       Your last exhibit, besides providing a rationale for keeping policy on hold,   addresses the issue of the balance of risks assessment  If the Committee believes  that the cloud of war worries will soon dissipate to reveal an economy that is  fundamentally sound, then it should indicate so by retaining its risk assessment as  balanced with respect to both of its goals (the top left panel)  The Committee might  also opt for a balanced risk assessment if it feared that a change would convey more  conviction to market participants about the outlook than it actually had  If instead,  more weight were given to the downbeat economic data of late and the forecast that  inflation would move lower still from its already low level, the Committee might  favor a risk assessment weighted toward economic weakness (the top right panel)   According to the survey evidence, this outcome best matches investor expectations,  suggesting that it should be preferred if the goal is not to test the market’s resilience  to surprise  Still, such a shift might be read by the broader public as suggesting that  the near-term outlook was weaker than feared, a message that might be problematic  in a nation on a war footing  In fact, the public’s focus has shifted to a different  stage, and in light of the unusual uncertainties, what the Committee does and says  today is unlikely to be extrapolated too far into the future       The broader problem the Committee faces is whether it can usefully   characterize the balance of risks in an environment of such diffuse uncertainty   This is territory that Frank Knight trod eighty-seven years ago  As he noted then  and as is repeated in the middle panel, “we can only appeal to the law of large  numbers to distribute the losses and make them calculable    in so far as they  repeat themselves”  Moreover, Knight considered circumstances when prospects  were sufficiently diffuse that, as he wrote, “The conception of an objectively  measurable probability or chance is simply inapplicable”  It may be that the current  situation has transited from a sense of known possibilities with assigned  probabilities—that is, risk—to Knightian uncertainty  If so, Knight’s advice to the  Committee is that “the fundamental uncertainties of economic life are the errors in  predicting the future and in making present adjustments to fit future conditions”  If  the possibilities are that uncertain, the Committee could, as outlined in the bottom  panel, defer announcing an assessment of the risks under the rationale that it is  better to be unspecific than specifically wrong  Such a course would probably  require a promise of heightened surveillance to the public and a willingness among  yourselves to convene a conference call before the next meeting if events clarify the  odds  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Actually, Mr Chairman, I have had the staff start a fact book on the   zero bound situation, which will list the unusual actions mentioned in the recent speeches by you   and Governor Bernanke  It will include the authority under which the actions can be taken and   any historical precedent  The work has been fairly closely held because I had some concerns   about what would happen were it to become known that we were actively engaged in   contingency plans about the zero bound  I’ve also asked the staff to look into some other issues,   such as whether difficulties are posed already by the compression of deposit rates and money   March 18, 2003 85 of 101    fund rates  So, we are looking at that and questioning whether there are any other consequences   for the functioning of money markets—problems that the Bank of Japan sometimes complains   about—that would possibly incline you to resort to unusual policy actions before you get the   nominal funds rate to zero  I know that Dino, working with the Research Department at the New   York Fed, has been looking into these issues as well  I guess it might be helpful to get a little   guidance from the Committee about whether there is a memo in my future  [Laughter]     People are working on a couple of aspects of that  We’re looking at it   in terms of depositories, the compression of deposit rates and money fund rates, and just   generally wondering about market functioning  For instance, if the general collateral rate is   ½ percent, then the unattractiveness of failing to deliver securities is not particularly high    "
4942,2003-05-06,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that Carol is handing out now  The marked shifts over the intermeeting period in  market participants’ expectations about monetary policy are evident in the top panel  of your first exhibit, which plots the evolving probability that the funds rate would be  ¼ point lower by this afternoon implied by the May federal funds futures contract   Over the latter part of March and early April, before hostilities with Iraq were settled,  investors talked about the possibility of an intermeeting easing, making them  relatively confident that the funds rate would be below 1¼ percent by the end of  today  The cessation of hostilities and the related rally in the equity and corporate  debt markets, along with the perception that the Federal Reserve was not preparing  the market for easing, deflated that notion  As a consequence, market prices are now  consistent with about a 1-in-4 chance of action, about where that expectation has been  for the past two weeks     Market participants still expect the Committee to ease though and ultimately by   more than anticipated at the March meeting  As shown by the solid red line in the  middle left panel, the current path of expectations of the federal funds rate touches  1 percent by November and has shifted about 50 basis points lower at a longer  horizon  Indeed, the option-implied probability distribution of the funds rate this fall  (the middle right panel) suggests that investors are placing considerable weight on a  level well below 1 percent       Evidently, a string of weak economic releases—especially on production and   employment—more than offset the lift to the economic outlook that presumably  attended the decline in uncertainty, the fall in oil prices, and the run-up in share prices  over the intermeeting period  It is worth noting that the decline in uncertainty about  interest rates, the bottom panels, was pronounced all along the yield curve  The  narrowing of the width of the 90 percent confidence band for the federal funds rate  150 days hence derived from options on Eurodollars, at the left, was paralleled by  those posted by one- and ten-year-ahead forward rates on swaps, at the right                                                       2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to the transcript (appendix 2)   May 6, 2003 71 of 115    A more favorable backdrop of financial and commodity markets might be one of  the factors inclining the Committee to keep policy on hold at this meeting, a subject  treated in more detail in your next exhibit  The case for holding policy unchanged  would be supported if the Committee viewed, as noted in the top panel, the staff  forecast to be likely and, over the period that could be reasonably thought to be  influenced by action today, acceptable  Underlying that forecast is the judgment that  economic fundamentals will spark a relatively quick pickup in the growth of  aggregate demand over the balance of the year even holding the funds rate at  1¼ percent  This can be seen by the blue bars in the middle left panel, which show  the staff’s forecast that the growth of real GDP will step up from its sub 2 percent  pace to a rate first closer to and then beyond that of potential  While it will take some  time for this growth to eat into the prevailing level of economic slack, especially  given the lackluster performance thus far this quarter, monetary policy action taken  today would mostly be felt—at least according to the staff forecast—when the  economy already has gained a full head of steam     You may have reason to believe that economic acceleration will be quicker,   implying, as given by the second item in my list in the top panel, that economic slack  would be worked down sooner and disinflation would be less likely than in the staff  forecast  For example, while the extent of fiscal impetus in the current baseline  forecast is a bit larger than in the previous one, the Committee might believe that the  political compromise likely to be struck will take part of all the proposals currently on  the table so that the total ends up significantly larger than now envisioned  To give  you a sense of the upside risk, the Greenbook included an alternative simulation with  both higher government spending and lower taxes  As shown by the red bars in the  middle left panel, that would be sufficient to boost the growth of real GDP  1 percentage point this quarter and hold growth at the baseline thereafter  Even if you  are not confident that fiscal stimulus will be forthcoming—as gridlock is always a  possibility—you might want to wait for those prospects to come into sharper focus  before adding monetary policy easing into the mix     Another reason the Committee might not view the time as right to ease—even if it   were leaning in that direction—is that it might be worried that financial markets could  react adversely to such action, as noted by the third item in my list  As shown in the  middle right panel, markets have been on a tear in the past nine weeks, with equity  prices up 16 percent from the March 12 low and riskier corporate yields ¼ percentage  point to 1½ percentage points lower  That rally came even as expectations of very  near-term monetary policy ease, as I already described, were being rolled back   Investors might wonder how weak the Committee considered the outlook to be that it  was necessary to augment the already appreciable relaxation of financial conditions  since mid-March  Moreover, such an action would stand out all the more in  comparison with your recent behavior  The bars in the bottom panel record the  immediate surprises associated with Committee decisions over the past three years,  measured as the actual target rate decided at each of the meetings less the expected  funds rate gotten from futures markets the day before  As can be seen, a surprise   May 6, 2003 72 of 115    today on the order of 20 or 45 basis points, as would be the case if you ease 25 or 50  basis points, respectively, would be an outlier     Alternatively, you might see the need for easing, discussed in exhibit 3, as too   compelling to be countered effectively by arguments about timing and reception  As  noted in the first bullet point, in the Greenbook outlook resources remain underused  throughout the forecast period, shown in the middle left panel by the unemployment  rate, which stays at or above 6 percent in this and the next four quarters  While a  ¼ or ½ point easing may not materially influence the near-term contour of that path,  the projected almost 1 percentage point spread of the unemployment rate over its  natural rate at the beginning of next year is more likely to be within the ambit of your  influence     You may not be so sure that the economy will deliver even that performance,   particularly if you believe that chief executives still see capital stocks as excessive or  you believe that the prospects for economies abroad are especially gloomy  A failure  to get the forecasted rebound in growth raises the possibility that households’ support  to the economic expansion will finally sag, setting in motion adverse dynamics that  may be difficult to stop by future easing  Market concern about the economy may be  growing in that the implied probability of the funds rate sinking below 1 percent by  the autumn (the middle right panel) has risen of late  The insurance provided by a  prompt easing may be attractive when, as in the second bullet point, downside risks to  demand are more likely or more costly     Third, even if the Committee believes in a forecast that, to a first approximation,   meets its responsibility to foster sustainable economic growth over time, it has  another objective as well  Easing may be favored on the concern that, as in the third  point, inflation may fall further from an already low level and jeopardize your  commitment to price stability  The four-quarter growth in the consumer price index  is 14 percent at the end of the staff forecast, which is shown by the horizontal line in  the bottom panel  While such an outcome or lower has occurred about 30 percent of  the time in the postwar period, it has happened in only two years since 1965  True,  for part of that time the Federal Reserve had lost the anchor provided by price  stability, but you may have concerns that some costs arise from being in a region so  seldom traveled     Whatever the choice about the level of the federal funds rate, you will still have to   grapple with the risk assessment, as discussed in the last exhibit  The elevated  uncertainties of March that led the Committee not to characterize the balance of risks  have abated  Indeed, those uncertainties have probably diminished to the point where  the same rationale as in March could not plausibly be repeated to refrain from stating  the balance of risks  Still, judging from a recent survey of primary dealers, informed  outsiders are confused about the Committee’s next step  As reported in the top panel,  about half the dealers expect an announcement of balanced risks, while the rest are  split between a tilt toward economic weakness and no assessment at all      May 6, 2003 73 of 115    I think that there are three possibilities to consider  First, keeping policy  unchanged or easing modestly is unlikely to change materially the evident downside  risks to the path of inflation over the next several quarters, and the relative  distribution of the risks to sustainable economic growth would remain debatable  If  that is the period over which the Committee defines the “foreseeable future,” then it  could reassert the old language tilted toward economic weakness on the logic that the  weighted average of those risks represents a downside threat to its objectives   However, March’s deferral of a risk statement might make May an appropriate time  to drop the statement altogether, the option listed second  That might be particularly  attractive if you have been troubled in the past by the misperception fostered by the  existing language of trading off economic growth and inflation and the ambiguity  attached to the notion of the foreseeable future  In that case, this afternoon’s  statement could relate that the balance of risk assessment is no longer seen as helpful  in conveying the Committee’s views to the public  On the theory that you can’t beat  something with nothing, I’ve listed a third option  The Committee could augment the  risk assessment portion of the statement  One possibility would be regularly to  include two declarative sentences that describe the risks individually to the goals of  price stability and maximum sustainable growth and a third that summarizes the  balance of those risks  While this may convey the Committee’s view of the outlook  more clearly, it probably would be greeted with bewilderment by some Fed watchers  at the onset     While your deferral in March opened a window to change the balance of   risk assessment, you might want a bit more time than available today to  deliberate on a matter that will set a precedent  However, the problem that  you face is that anything you do today will be read as precedential  That  concludes my remarks, Mr Chairman       We have heard different things from different market participants    The Bond Market Association met in this room just last week and devoted one segment of the   session to complaining about the balance of risks statement as not being helpful  They indicated   a preference that we be a little more descriptive in the statement  But I think that would result in   May 6, 2003 74 of 115    some confusion because right now the balance of risks statement provides the comfort of giving   coded words  The problem is that the codes are a limited number of choices, and at least some   members have complained that they have constrained your ability to convey what you really   think about the near-term outlook  For example, in today’s case you might say that plausibly   under the language of the last three years, you’d have to state that the risks are tilted toward   economic weakness, whereas in fact most of the members have expressed concerns about further   disinflation from an already low level  So I think expanding the risks assessment on balance—I   hate to use the word “balance”— [laughter] on net would provide more information to the   markets and more flexibility to you going forward  But flexibility comes with a cost  You don’t   have those coded signals       Your remarks this morning and those of Governor Bies and others   around the table echo the comments I’ve heard from members over the last couple of weeks in   other conversations  So the Chairman has agreed that the special topic at the first day of the June   meeting should focus on alternative policy regimes in an environment of very low short-term   rates  Dino and I will organize the staff work on the strategy, tactics, and communication policy   associated with that  That does crowd out a bit of the background material that the Board staff   has prepared on communication policy more generally  What I’ll do is circulate that material in   a couple of weeks, and I’ll ask for guidance when you receive it on whether you’d prefer to   tackle the communication policy at the next two-day meeting in January or if you’d like to deal   with it piecemeal at meetings before then     "
4996,2003-08-12,"  I would point out, Mr Chairman, that growth in currency held   domestically also has been about flat, but that had been growing relatively slowly for the last   four months Where we get the slowdown is in our estimates of the currency held abroad  That’s   a fact, not an explanation     I would point out, President Minehan, that there’s some empirical   work that suggests that hedging flows on the order that we saw over the intermeeting period   would be associated with a 20 percent rise in implied volatilities on longer-term rates  So just to   August 12, 2003 11 of 110    get a sense of perspective, hedging activity doesn’t ultimately change the level of the ten-year   rate, but it does increase the amplitude  In the magnitudes that Dino has been talking about,   that’s the rule of thumb we’ve been using     Mainly, I should issue a warning that the next meeting will be a long   day for you  We’ll reconvene the meeting after lunch to talk about both the process and the   content of the press statement  That will be the first item of discussion on communications  And   then, depending on the outcome of that discussion, we’ll ask what you’d like to talk about at the   January meeting—whether you want to consider more aspects of communications in January     I don’t know practically how to do it any other way because—      We could start at 500 pm  For someone from California that would   be easier!  [Laughter]       If that’s what you would like, we can do that       It’s also the case that they often—but not always—ask when the   meeting ended  So we may very well have to explain why the meeting has been extended if we   reconvene after lunch     If an intermeeting discussion is held, it wouldn’t be announced until   later     Okay  We will arrange a dinner on Monday before the next meeting   to discuss communications  "
4997,2003-08-12,"  Well, like Governor Gramlich, I am not looking forward to the next   meeting       Everyone, both voting and nonvoting members of the group?  "
5024,2003-09-15,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that were at your seats when you came in, but you also received a copy of these  materials from me last Thursday  Please bear with me, but I’d like to begin on a note  of parliamentary procedure  It seemed to stretch to the breaking point any  interpretation of the Committee's rules to argue that members and their alternates  could gather to discuss its communication policies outside a formal meeting  The  choice, then, was to view this as an intermeeting consultation or an early start of the  September 16 meeting  If we had done the latter, our customary procedures would  seem to involve informing the press tomorrow morning that the meeting had actually  started early, risking the building-up of expectations that a major change in your  communication policy was brewing  We opted for the former because it permits an  ex post announcement of the meeting with the release of the minutes for the August  meeting on Thursday  To do this, we will circulate a draft summary of this meeting  to you tomorrow for inclusion in the minutes     I shall focus the bulk of my remarks on what appears to be many members'   immediate concern  the drafting and the content of the announcement  Those  concerns have arisen, in part, because there have been notable changes in the  announcement over the past four meetings  To facilitate your discussion on the  subject, my briefing will have four parts  First, I will offer five general principles that  the Committee may wish to weigh in choosing an announcement policy  Second, I  will review precedents established by the experience of foreign central banks and the  Committee’s own history  Third, I will suggest some options you might want to  consider on how to proceed with regard both to the process of preparing the  announcement and to the substance of the announcement  As to the latter, I will then  address some specific aspects of the language of the announcement, trying to keep the  discussion general enough to be appropriate for this evening’s discussion of the                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are attached to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 15, 2003 8 of 78    Committee’s procedures rather than tomorrow’s meeting on policy choice    Since February 4, 1994, the Committee’s discussion of communications with the   private sector has centered on the announcements of its actions  I’d note that the first  few such releases were explicitly billed as statements of the Chairman explaining the  Committee’s action  After mid-1994, though, this distinction disappeared  I am  going to assert that five principles governing the process of producing the statement  seem part of the received wisdom (or revealed preference) of the Committee, which I  list in exhibit 1       First, the process should respect the important role of discussion at the meeting    To circulate a single prospective draft announcement or several proposed alternatives  that isolate a limited number of the current features of the economy before members  have discussed their views of economic conditions and monetary policy generally  might stifle that discussion  At the same time, it is hard to imagine how nineteen  people around the Committee table could constructively edit a draft release after their  deliberations  The most repeated sentiment across the past nine years of transcripts is  that group editing cannot arrive at an acceptable result       Part of the worry, as in my second point, is that the Committee has not seemed to   want to complicate the forging of consensus on policy action  While words are  important, it is only because investors have come to expect them to be acted upon  consistently  The risk is that some disagreement in the future about a subordinate  clause in the fourth sentence of a draft release might cause a rift among members who  otherwise might agree on the policy action if not the exact words to describe its  rationale  The events of this summer have shown that the words of the announcement  can be powerful       My third observation is that you might want to take the opportunity that this   potential influence provides to increase the effectiveness of your policy actions  To  settle on a stripped-down announcement because it is hard to compromise on  anything more specific might represent an admission that the Committee is unable to  use a potentially important instrument at its disposal       Fourth, the Committee surely wants to avoid mistakes  From my experience,   drafting a press release shares some similarity with juggling chainsaws, in that you  mostly spend your time worrying about what can go wrong and then counting your  digits when you’re done  The less the time and the greater the number of last-minute  changes, the more likely there will be mistakes       Fifth, and this almost goes without saying, everyone should want to preserve the   confidentiality of the Committee’s decision until its release  I would not have raised  this but for the fact that just in the past year there have been several instances in  which we have read about the Committee’s deliberations in newsletters less than  twenty-four hours after the fact  Given that reality, the longer the time between the  decision and the announcement, the more likely it may become that there will be   September 15, 2003 9 of 78    leaks, either inadvertent or otherwise      In light of these five principles, the Committee might want to consider the five   models for drafting an announcement presented in exhibit 2  Some members might  consider the experience immediately prior to the introduction of announcements on  February 4, 1994, as relevant to today’s discussion  In those days, the Committee’s  decisions were signaled to markets through open market operations, and only those  associated with changes in the discount rate were announced to the public  Except for  discussions about the wording of the directive, which was released with a lag,  concerns about words did not intrude on deliberations  However, the Committee did  forgo a means of communicating with the public  A variant on this that you might  find appealing would be to release information limited to the Committee’s policy  decision—the intended funds rate, perhaps a simple risk assessment, and the  breakdown of the votes  The Committee would have to weigh whatever benefits are  seen accruing to its deliberations against a variety of costs, not the least including the  likely criticism that would be levied at perceived backsliding in transparency     The Committee might hope to avoid heavy criticism of a reduction in the   information content of its policy announcement by following the example of the Bank  of England listed in the second row  The Monetary Policy Committee releases a short  and direct announcement with its action and defers a more complete explanation until  the publication of its minutes about two weeks after its meeting  While stripping the  announcement of content beyond the policy action and, perhaps, a brief risk  assessment might seem a step backward on the communication front, the quicker  release of the minutes would provide a more nuanced description of policy choice  than can be done even in the current statement  That is why I placed a question mark  in the appropriate box in the third column on communications  I’m a bit more  confident that the expedited production of the minutes introduces a greater risk of  error  Because the minutes would be released while the circumstances they described  were still relevant, market participants would likely pay considerably more attention  to them than they do now  That raises the odds that news reports would latch onto  any differences of opinion that were highlighted or aspects of the outlook perhaps  underappreciated by the drafters and reviewers in the short window available to  prepare the document  As a consequence, the attention members pay to draft minutes  and probably the number of iterations in the drafting process will have to be stepped  up, with obvious implications for the schedules of nineteen busy people       If the Committee decided it was important that its announcement be accompanied   by a more complete justification, it might consider the example provided by the Bank  of Canada  As shown in the third row, policymakers at the Bank of Canada deliberate  on rate-setting and then draft the statement after the policy decision  In their case,  this means delaying the announcement until just before the opening of trading the  next day  By pushing your announcement past 215 pm, you might accommodate a  drafting session after your policy decision so as to release an announcement the same  day  That has advantages, in that the Committee’s announcement would reflect its  complete deliberations  However, an enhanced emphasis on the words of the  announcement could raise the odds that words would interfere with the Committee’s   September 15, 2003 10 of 78    achieving a consensus  Even more problematic, drafting on the fly risks making  mistakes, and lengthening the time between the decision and its announcement raises  the unwelcome specter of leaks     The Federal Reserve’s experience of the 1980s provides another model, shown in   the fourth row  At that time, the directive to the Account Manager contained  standardized concerns about the economy, but their order varied with circumstances   The Bluebook distributed to the Committee before the meeting discussed possible  alternative orderings to give members a sense of likely possibilities  In current  circumstances, the staff could identify potential themes for the description of the  economy in the first full paragraph of the announcement consistent with the policy  alternatives presented in the Bluebook (as we did in the section titled “Policy  Announcement, Directive, and Assessment of Risks” in the most recent one)  As a  further step, the Committee could standardize the language of its risk assessment in  the second full paragraph so that it would vote on what was to appear in the  announcement  In circumstances when a more substantive change in the  announcement was contemplated—say, as in March or May of this year—a memo  could be circulated in advance of the meeting no later than on Monday afternoon   Given these indications of what would appear in the announcement, members might  be more willing to defer consideration of the specific words until after the vote on the  rate decision and the risk assessment  Putting consideration of the words of the  announcement into play in advance of the vote on policy might complicate forging a  consensus, and routinizing the form of the risk assessment might limit its  effectiveness in communicating with the public  However, the Committee may well  view doing both as a reasonable compromise to ensure that its decisions are based on  full and complete information  This being the Federal Reserve, maintaining the status  quo is always an option  The Committee could routinely review a prepared draft  statement after the policy decision, with the advantages and disadvantages noted in  the bottom row     As to process going forward, of these five possibilities, implementing the models   of your Anglo-Saxon counterparts would probably require the most lead time  If you  decide to emulate the Bank of England, the Secretariat will have to speed up its  drafting schedule, which may take a meeting or two to implement  If you opt for the  Bank of Canada model, market participants would have to be given some advance  warning that the announcement would be delayed past 215 pm, perhaps in the  minutes that will be released this Thursday     Of course, the Committee could abandon or sharply reduce the content of the   statement at any time—it is only a matter of deciding when you are best positioned to  accept the criticism that may well follow  The rapidity with which you can make the  risk assessment more routine so that you could vote on what is published (as in the  fourth row) depends on whether you are comfortable with the current three-part  structure that was adopted in May  That is the first of several questions about the  content of the announcement that are flagged in your final exhibit  Again, are you  satisfied with a three-part assessment that individually lists the relative threats to your   September 15, 2003 11 of 78    goals of maximum sustainable economic growth and price stability and that weight  those threats in an overall balance?  The decision in May to split the old balance-of- risk assessment into the first two components has seemed to serve the Committee  well, as it appears now to cover all the relevant possibilities confronting the economy   But members have expressed differing opinions on the wisdom of then combining the  two different judgments in the third sentence      Individual words in the announcement also seem to have taken on different   meanings for different members at different times  In particular, as in the second  question, the Committee may want to settle on what it means by “sustainable”  economic growth  In the report of the Ferguson subcommittee in 2000, sustainable  growth seemed to serve as a stand-in for expansion at the growth rate of the  economy’s potential to produce  In more-recent announcements, the same words may  be read to imply the growth pace consistent with avoiding the creation of economic  imbalances, thereby implicitly introducing a notion of the level of economic activity  relative to the level of its potential  Members might also have concerns about  whether the word “risk” carries negative connotations that might be avoided by  speaking of the balance of probabilities or the odds of outcomes on both sides of their  median forecast  Fourth, Committee members may have doubts concerning whether  the “foreseeable” future is too slippery a concept to provide guidance to the public as  to its view of the outlook  But being specific about that time dimension now may  limit your options at a later date  Similar concerns may also be raised about “the  considerable period of time” in the last sentence of the August announcement, which  concludes my list of questions  I won’t speak about this issue beyond that because it  seems woven inextricably into the policy debate scheduled for tomorrow and is  unlikely to be a long-lasting feature of the announcement       These may be too many options to tackle at once  One strategy would be to   identify your main areas of concern and pick them off one by one in an incremental  approach over time  Another would be to use this meeting to identify problems and  charge the staff or a subcommittee to come back at a later date with more specific  alternatives  Doing so, however, may delay progress in improving the announcement  for a time  As to other issues not directly related to the announcement, the first day of  next January’s two-day meeting has been reserved to talk about the Committee’s  communication policy once again       Yes, in January     None whatsoever, Mr Chairman       I think we evolved into the current situation by working from what   was an imperfect assessment of the risks—that is, the balance of risks language  We tried first to   make that sow’s ear into a silk purse, and it didn’t quite work  Because the statements were   September 15, 2003 28 of 78    changing, it didn’t seem possible to be able to present to the Committee the exact words that   they’d be voting on  After the decision in May to split the risk assessment into two parts, with a   third sentence providing the balance—if the Committee feels that’s the appropriate structure—I   don’t think there’s any reason you couldn’t agree on a formulaic presentation of the risk   assessment that could be in the Bluebook     Everything—in the sense that the Bluebook has to be produced after   the Greenbook     It’s posted electronically Thursday night     One thing I would point out is that there’s a lot of inertia in the words   of the first paragraph on the description of the economy  So I think the Bluebook could highlight   that, if you decided to take this policy option, say, the sentence characterizing the labor markets   presumably would have to change  Implicit in that is the assurance that there would be no reason   to change a sentence that was still relevant given that policy choice  So it might not be that just   two-thirds of the words would be predicable in advance of the policy decision but closer to three-  quarters or more of the words     They all sit in the same room and have an editing session  They go   through the minutes line by line  "
5075,2003-09-16,"  Mr Chairman, “long-term” could be moved to the end of the   sentence  "
5076,2003-09-16,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the materials  that were distributed during your break, which may seem as if it was a long time ago   [Laughter]       I guess I could update the financial market quotes by now!  As  Dino has already related, the message from financial markets about today’s meeting  is fairly straightforward  As indicated by the path of the expected federal funds rate  in the top left panel, investors apparently anticipate that the Committee will stay with  the current level of the intended federal funds rate for about one year  As to other  aspects of today’s decision, the Domestic Desk’s survey of the twenty-two primary  dealers reported in the top right panel revealed that virtually all are betting that the  risk assessment to be announced this afternoon will be the same as that in August   Indeed, the probability that the nominal funds rate will touch a very low level in the  next five months—inferred from Eurodollar options—has receded considerably from  its height of early summer, although it has ticked up since the August employment  report  On balance, recent quotes on options produce a probability distribution for the  expected funds rate—the red bars in the middle right panel—not much different from  that prevailing just before the August meeting     Two other aspects of recent financial market experience that are shown in the   bottom panels are worth highlighting  First, the chart at the left depicts a measure of  the volatility of expected federal funds rates—the average of the absolute value of  daily changes in futures rates—across maturities measured on the horizontal scale   The average changes in futures rates over the past four months (the red bars) have  been much smaller at short maturities than has been the norm over the prior decade  (the blue bars)  Second, as shown by the bars at the bottom right, expectations about  the funds rate across the maturity structure have tended to move less on average in  response to the last four monthly surprises in the unemployment rate than was the  historical experience  Taken together, this suggests that the Committee has been able  to anchor expectations about the very near term course of policy—in effect making  them less volatile and less sensitive to revisions to the expected path of the economy     The case for contradicting those prevailing expectations by easing policy 25 basis   points at this meeting is presented in your second exhibit  As has been a feature of  the past few Greenbook forecasts, considerable resource slack is seen lingering over  the next few years  Indeed, as shown in the middle left panel, the expansion of  aggregate supply is now anticipated to be sufficiently vigorous that the  unemployment rate runs noticeably above the path projected by the staff in June,  when the Committee last eased policy  While monetary policy no doubt works with a  lag, action today should help to foster a quicker working-down of resource slack in  2004 and 2005     Another way of making this point is shown in the bottom panel  Given the staff’s   assessment of the forces impinging on the economy, the actual real federal funds rate  is not obviously below some estimates of its equilibrium value  The Committee may  harbor doubts that the expansion of aggregate demand will have as much vigor as in  the Greenbook forecast that underlies this analysis  For example, if your own  assessment of the prospects for capital spending is more similar to the “weak  investment” alternative in the Greenbook than to the baseline (including the financial  market repercussions), a ¼ point ease at this time may be viewed as desirable  As can   September 16, 2003 75 of 106    be seen by comparing the black bars of the baseline with the red bars depicting the  alternative in the middle right panel, the unemployment rate would be more than  1 percentage point higher on average over the next two years if you held policy  steady in the face of investment expanding 4 percentage points less than in the  baseline, at least according to the staff model     This scenario, however, is an alternative, not the baseline  As outlined at the top   of your next exhibit, the Committee may be willing to keep policy unchanged at this  meeting if it finds both plausible and attractive the forecast in that baseline that  inflation will hold fairly steady at around 1 percent, which might be seen as consistent  with a working definition of price stability  The Committee may be especially  inclined to keep policy unchanged, at least for now, if it thinks that there are other  sources of impetus to economic growth that may make it difficult to restrain inflation  to its current pace  In particular, as shown in the middle panel, the term structure of  nominal yields is unusually steeply sloped, at least by the experience of the past  twenty-five years  As was discussed earlier, in the staff’s view this unusual  configuration will not persist because longer-term yields edge lower as market  participants come to see that inflation pressures remain muted and monetary policy  can remain on hold for some time  But you may feel that the staff went only part way  in anticipating the market response should events in coming quarters convince  investors that both inflation and the policy rate will stay on hold  A more substantial  rally in the bond market in those circumstances would probably provide considerable  additional financial impetus to support capital spending and the housing market     The other way the yield curve could shift to a more typical configuration over   time is by its short end rising  As noted by the third bullet in the top panel, this  alternative seems part of the thinking of many market participants, who are  apparently expecting that building pressures on inflation next year will lead you to  tighten policy sooner than foreseen in the Greenbook  Some concerns in that regard  may be raised by the 50 basis point runup since June in inflation compensation  derived from the Treasury market, which is plotted in your bottom left panel  As  shown in the bottom right panel, the recent inflation forecasts of major investment  banks—listed in the second column—are generally higher than the Greenbook  projection, whereas their GDP growth projections, shown in the first column, are  uniformly weaker than the Greenbook—an observation several you have already  made  This apparently less appealing mix of output growth and inflation on Wall  Street might arise because market participants project either slower growth of  aggregate supply going forward or a less benign Phillips curve—either of which  would make holding steady seem more appropriate     In addition to its rate decision, the Committee faces nettlesome questions   regarding its assessment of risks to the outlook going forward, the subject of your  final exhibit  With three potential characterizations of risks—downside, balanced,  and upside—to two objectives (price stability, shown along the horizontal dimension,  and sustainable economic growth, shown along the vertical dimension) the current  policy announcement allows nine combinations  The Committee ended its August   September 16, 2003 76 of 106    meeting in the blue box, in which balanced risks to the growth objective and  downside risks to the inflation objective reduced to an overall assessment that the  risks were tilted to the downside  As was discussed last night, the meaning of words  does matter  If you take the phrase “sustainable economic growth” to stand in for the  growth rate of potential output, then you well may envision a transition from that blue  box to the yellow box directly below  In that case, the risks are individually  characterized as upside to sustainable economic growth and downside to inflation,  revealing the implicit judgment that the level of output probably remains below that  of its potential  The resulting balance of those two risks depends on the welfare  weights attached to those outcomes and span from upside to downside  While it  seems a stretch to consider such a change at this meeting, that shift seems more likely  in the near term than to either of the boxes highlighted in red associated with  balanced risks toward inflation, absent surprising developments     A more immediate concern is whether to retain the last sentence of the August   statement, which, as shown in the box at the lower left, held  that “the Committee  believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period”  In  last night’s meeting, most members expressed discomfort with extending some form  of commitment about the future path of the policy rate  At the same time, some noted  that, in unusual circumstances, guidance offered to market participants about near- term intentions could amplify the effectiveness of policy  It is probably the case that  the sentence about “a considerable period” helped to anchor near-term expectations  about policy in a manner reflected in the unusual behavior of futures rates I reported  on at the start of my briefing  But if you see the need for tightening closer down the  road than, say, in staff forecast, you may want to begin thinking at this time about an  exit strategy from this part of the statement  Market attention to those words and the  likely reaction were they to be excised, however, may make you hesitate to head for  that exit too abruptly     There is one aspect of the current sentence and one potential wording change that   might blunt a tendency for market participants to view the statement as a hard  promise to keep the funds rate at its current level—the notion so many of you  objected to last night  The first applies as a matter of meaning once again  The  Committee has indicated its expectation that policy can be kept accommodative for a  considerable period  Determining whether the stance of policy is accommodative is a  matter of judgment in setting the real funds rate some distance below an estimate of  its equilibrium value  In circumstances in which economic fundamentals are  improving, the stance of policy can be kept accommodative, even with increases in  the nominal policy rate, as long as the associated rising real rate does not move up  faster than the rising equilibrium real rate  It is instructive that, as shown in the lower  right panel, the Committee has been describing its policy as accommodative since  January 2002, shortly after the funds rate moved down to 1¾ percent and before two  additional policy easings  That said, market participants seem to have rebased their  view on what is accommodative to the current setting of policy  To avoid  disappointment in financial markets at some later date, it will be important that public  statements as a rule do not equate accommodative policy with the current level of the   September 16, 2003 77 of 106    nominal short rate  Second, the Committee might want to shade its current implicit  commitment away from being based on a period measured in chronological time to  one determined by economic events  For instance, the Committee could assert that its  judgment was that policy could stay accommodative for the considerable period it  currently assesses will be required to foster the containing of disinflationary  pressures  That concludes my prepared remarks    "
5134,2003-10-28,"  Governor Ferguson, may I just add an observation?  It is a low   inflation, low interest rate environment  It’s also one of an improving US economy     So for domestic assets it may very well be the case that investors are   thinking that recovery rates in the event of default may be better and the default risk itself may   be lower  Spreads could be narrowing independently of investors’ aversion to risk because their   perception of the risk has gone down   3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  called “Briefing on FOMC Communications Policy” that Carol Low handed out  while you were getting lunch  One of my favorite quotes, which offers some  perspective on my work on the Committee=s communication policy over the past few  months, comes from William of Orange, who held that “you need not hope to  undertake nor succeed to persevere”  When it comes to the structure of the  Committee’s assessment of the outlook, I can report to the members that your  Secretary has undertaken and persevered but sees little hope of success  To raise the  odds just a bit, I would appreciate it if you would use the time until 200 pm to  provide some feedback on a few key issues     To facilitate that discussion, I have listed in the first exhibit some alternative ways   of assessing risks  I started with the pre-March balance-of-risks language to establish  that some progress in the Committee’s communication has been made  The second                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   October 28, 2003 87 of 126    panel gives the current wording, the next is the proposal in my memo dated  October 22, and the last is the suggestion of Governor Gramlich circulated at that  same time  These panels are for your reference  What I will focus on are the four  questions listed in exhibit 2  In particular, do you have a clear preference for the risk  assessment among the various proposals that have circulated?  If there is a basic  structure identified today, then the task of homing in on specific language will be  easier       Second, in that process it would be helpful if the Committee provided guidance as   to whether it wants a bilateral or a multilateral approach to arriving at new language   By that I mean that I can get feedback from the members individually and iterate on  new drafting language or I can look for opportunities to schedule a discussion of these  matters by the full Committee  A middle ground would be to consider charging a  subcommittee with the task, but only a few members have expressed enthusiasm for  that       Third, how much importance do you place on wrapping up this issue quickly?    Many of you have expressed concurrence with postponing the adoption of new  language, often with the comment that you’d rather have it done right than done  quickly  A countervailing consideration, however, is the observation that the  economy seems to be improving, perhaps at a pace that would make you anticipate  changing at least some part of the risk assessment in the near future  If so, there is a  question of sequencing  Do you want to grapple with modifying the existing  language to express a new tilt, or would such a transition be an appropriate time to  adopt a new structure?     Fourth, when do you want to talk about this next?  Looking at the calendar, there   are three immediate opportunities  I could set aside time on the December 9 agenda  after the policy decision to consider the matter, and you could decide perhaps not to  be bound by the 200 pm deadline  I could arrange a dinner meeting on December 8,  the night before that meeting  Third, this could be the subject of the discussion on the  Tuesday afternoon of your next two-day meeting in late January  With any of those  options, though, you might want to take into consideration how the public will react  to news that the Committee is once again talking about communications, especially if  you are not certain that the conversation will bring closure, at least for now       The first question is, Is there any clear preference as to the basic   structure of the assessment of the outlook?     October 28, 2003 88 of 126      Although what you agreed on formally were instructions to the   drafters of the statement  I think in the proposal—      What Normand read was from the page in the Bluebook     The proposal was that, when you decide on a risk assessment, what   you vote on would be what appears in the directive  I think everyone agreed to that  The   problem for this meeting operationally was that, if you decided to adopt language that differs   from what you used at the last meeting, we would not have known what the alternative would be     Mr Chairman, in answer to President Moskow’s question, I would   make one observation  The Bank of England is the model for this approach, and they get their   minutes out in two weeks  They also have the advantage that everybody in the policy group is in   the same building, so they sit down and devote a half-day to editing the minutes line by line    The original assumption with regard to the January discussion on communications was that we’d   have this issue of the statement behind us by then  Our intention was to talk in January about the   early release of the minutes and an expanded use of the central tendency forecast  The forecast   would have a big role in the process because the forecast appears in the minutes and if the   minutes are out earlier, the forecast will be, too  The staff is preparing two documents related to   that  Right now the communication agenda is rather crowded, and any guidance as to   sequencing would be helpful     I think your next Secretary, Mr Chairman, will have a challenge    [Laughter]   October 28, 2003 108 of 126      We are preparing a document on the early release of the minutes     Of whom?   October 28, 2003 109 of 126      I don’t know the answer to that, Mr Chairman  I suspect it’s related   to the fact that the tape recording equipment is in this room  But that is something that we can   address  "
5135,2003-10-28,"  With regard to C&I loans, I would note that in the latest Senior Loan   Officer Opinion Survey, banks reported that demand had been weak over the last three months    That is consistent with declining inventories, although the answers to more forward-looking   questions provided a little glimmer of hope in that regard  As for the monetary aggregates, we   believe that the slowdown in mortgage refinancing has pulled down liquid deposits to a   considerable degree  We suspect that it actually pulled down M2 growth in particular—more so   than we’d previously been allowing for using our rules of thumb—and we were working in that   direction  Depending on the assumptions one makes with regard to timing—in terms of how   long the deposits sit there—much of the slowdown could be accounted for by refinancing effects  "
5136,2003-10-28,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the materials  that Carol Low handed out during the coffee break  As shown in the top left panel of  your first exhibit, investors seem to have raised the path expected for the federal  funds rate over the course of 2004  They are still counting on cumulative tightening  to bring the federal funds rate to 3 percent by the end of 2005, but they are now  betting on the Committee to be a bit quicker in getting there  That said, market  participants apparently don’t anticipate that process to begin at this meeting or the  next  Futures rates over the balance of the year are unchanged at 1 percent   Moreover, as shown in the table at the right, primary dealers do not expect any  substantive change in the economic assessment issued this afternoon  With only a  couple of exceptions, they expect you to announce that risks are balanced with  respect to your growth objectives and tilted to the downside with regard to price  stability, with the latter remaining the predominant risk       Other manifestations of this shift in expectations are given in the middle panels    The solid black line in the middle left panel plots a measure of uncertainty about the  federal funds rate expected in the next six months  For most of the summer and early  fall, investors have been relatively confident that the funds rate will remain near  current levels six months hence, no doubt importantly because of your assurances in  the statements of August and September that policy can be kept accommodative for a  considerable period  In recent weeks, though, there has been a growing sense that a  turning point may be drawing closer, and this measure of implied volatility has  moved higher  The middle right panel plots the distribution of the federal funds rate  about six months ahead derived from options quotes yesterday (the solid bars) and  just before the September meeting (the dashed line)  More weight is now being  placed on funds rates in the neighborhood of 1½ to 1¾, apparently at the expense of  odds on the funds rate holding at 1 percent or going lower  Aside from the                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   October 28, 2003 73 of 126    encouraging data on the economy, developments in financial markets may have made  investors more confident about the outlook  As can be seen in the bottom panels of  the exhibit, financial market conditions have eased considerably on net this year,  including a modest contribution made over the intermeeting period     I list this improvement in financial conditions first at the top of the next exhibit,   which outlines the case for an unchanged target federal funds rate  You may view  eased financial conditions to be one consequence of the current accommodative  stance of monetary policy  As shown in the middle panel, the real federal funds rate,  represented by the solid line, lies below the range of estimated equilibrium real rates   Indeed, a firming outlook for the economy has meant that r* is an upwardly moving  target  Keeping the real federal funds rate unchanged in such circumstances implies a  widening interest-rate gap  That may be especially troubling if you think that  pressures on resources may emerge a bit faster than the staff forecasts  As shown in  the bottom left panel, in the Greenbook projection, the near-term surprise in the level  of real GDP has been carried over the entire forecast period, the difference between  the dotted line for September and the red line for October  Particularly if you thought  that there was some risk that the most recent surprise also tilted up that red line some  or that the speed of its ascent represents looming pressures on inflation independent  of the output gap, you might be inclined, at a minimum, to keep policy on hold   Financial market participants may be expressing just those sorts of concerns in the  upward climb in inflation compensation as measured from the Treasury market (the  bottom right panel)  These measures have moved higher looking over the next five  years (the black line) and from five to ten years ahead (the red line)  Of course,  inflation compensation is a far-from-perfect proxy for inflation expectations, and  these measures have not broken noticeably out of their range of the previous four  years, but you might believe a neighborhood of 2 to 2½ percent to be on the high side  of your objective     To be sure, a pickup in pressures on inflation is not part of the staff forecast    Indeed, the case for easing 25 basis points, which is laid out at the top of exhibit 3,  could rest on the view that, as resource slack lingers, inflation may drift into an  unacceptably low region—if it is not already there  In the Greenbook baseline, the  unemployment rate, seen as a solid line in the middle left panel, makes only a gradual  approach to its natural rate of 5 percent by the end of 2005  Policy ease at this time  might be viewed as helpful in working down economic slack more quickly   Moreover, such monetary policy impetus would be welcomed after the fact if a less  robust expansion eventuates  In Part 1 of the Greenbook, the staff used the FRB/US  model to consider what would happen if the economic recovery faltered at the  beginning of next year, the implications of which are plotted as the dashed line in the  middle left panel for the unemployment rate and in the middle right panel for PCE  inflation  Worse still for the unemployment rate would be if this hesitation in  economic expansion led market participants to move up their desired compensation  for risk (the dotted lines)  In circumstances in which actual inflation is low, inflation  expectation are fairly well contained, and a sizable output gap remains, putting just a  bit of weight on the adverse outcomes of the dashed and dotted lines might incline   October 28, 2003 74 of 126    you toward policy ease  That inclination might be strengthened by the fact that  inflation is projected to fall to below ¾ percent in 2005 in either of these scenarios      Last, at recent meetings, some members took encouragement from the   performance of financial flows as evidence that there was some fundamental support  to economic growth  As reported in the bottom left panel, on a twelve-month-change  basis, M2 growth has turned down in its most recent readings  We think that relates  importantly to the effects of a slowing of mortgage refinancing on liquid deposits and  so is not a reading on the vigor of the economy, but we may be wrong  Concern  about the performance of M2 might be underscored by the fact that other financial  flows, including, as seen at the right, business loan growth, commercial paper  issuance, and bond issuance, have all been anemic of late     The remaining issue for your consideration centers on language, which is the   subject of your final exhibit  Two points of procedure about that language  First, we  included a fuller discussion of alternatives for the wording of the announcement in  the Bluebook, in the hope of getting some feedback from the members  We did get  some, and in the future we will circulate on the afternoon before the meeting a  summary of all the comments received by close of business Friday  Second, in the  Bluebook, we assumed that you intend to fit this afternoon’s statement within the  current structure and reserve any discussion of changes to that structure for later       Within that structure, the top panel repeats a table from the Bluebook and shows   that there are only a limited number of combinations of the assessments of the risks to  growth and inflation that seem plausible among the nine that are logically possible   The current words lie squarely in the blue box, in which risks to sustainable economic  growth are seen as balanced and inflation more likely to fall than not, with low  inflation being the predominant concern  While the economic outlook has improved,  much of that improvement remains a forecast, not firmly established in the data— especially so for readings on the labor market  That said, spending indicators have  shown vigor, and the most likely transition in the near term would presumably be a  move from that blue box to the yellow box, in which the risks to sustainable  economic growth are viewed as weighted to the upside  Moving the assessment on  the inflation outlook to balanced (the green box) seems likely to be a subsequent step,  given the current room for the economy to run before resource slack is worked down     The Committee’s willingness to change the language at all must presumably be   related to how it views the last sentence in the August and September announcements,  the relevant portion of which is repeated in the middle-left panel  You might be  comfortable in repeating that “policy accommodation can be maintained for a  considerable period” if you believe the Greenbook forecast is likely  The staff’s  assessment of the current shortfall of the level of aggregate demand below that of  potential aggregate supply, the likely expansion of aggregate supply over time, and  the relative unresponsiveness of inflation to diminishing slack in resource utilization  combine to suggest that the Committee could keep the funds rate at 1 percent through  2004 and foster acceptable economic performance  An examination of private-sector   October 28, 2003 75 of 126    opinions, however, may leave you with more concerns about the definition of a  “considerable period”  As shown in the middle-right panel, readings on money- market futures contracts suggest sizable weight on policy tightening that brings the  funds rate to 1¼ percent by midyear  Wall Street economists, the solid line  representing the median of a survey of investment bankers, also expect firming, but a  little bit more delayed  As outlined at the bottom left, dropping the sentence at this  meeting may risk an outsized market reaction, as investors begin to wonder if the path  for policy embedded in futures rates is not aggressive enough for your taste  One  possibility would be to convert the reference from calendar to economic time  That  is, the Committee=s definition of a considerable period could be made contingent  upon the outlook for further disinflation  One such possibility, given at the bottom  right, would have the statement read that “the Committee believes that policy  accommodation can be maintained for the considerable period it currently assesses  will be required to foster the moderation of disinflationary pressures”  The  Committee considered such a change at the September meeting, felt it to be a close  call, and ultimately decided that altering the language would draw more attention than  warranted  You may feel yourself still to be in that position at this meeting       Well, I would say that, on one level, rapid growth in aggregate supply   only raises the bar for the growth of aggregate demand that the Committee should desire to get   the outcomes it wants  So in that sense, there still could be unwelcome declines in inflation     But they would not be associated with problems relating to the   economic expansion  In general the linking of “unwelcome” and “disinflation” or “a pickup in   inflation” may pose a problem in the current structure of this language  It’s a problem that   October 28, 2003 76 of 126    President Stern also referred to in his discussion of disinflation as not necessarily being   problematic  But I would say that, from the Committee’s perspective, a decline in inflation from   current levels, while perhaps not posing a threat of serious damage to the economy if it is due to   a rapid increase in the aggregate supply, may send the inflation rate below your longer-run   objective     In that regard, you do have your other assessment to separate the   distinction between less unwelcome and more unwelcome  An unwelcome decline in inflation   that was associated with a growing resource gap would presumably be closer to those pernicious   deflations that members have expressed concern about in the past  A decline in inflation   associated with balanced economic growth or even upward pressures on economic growth would   have different implications for policy  One thing that’s fairly clear to me in working on the   communication policy is that Committee members really want a lot of different toggle switches   in the statement to express contingencies like this     I view that as a serious problem with the current structure of the   language  In the proposals discussed in the two memos that I circulated, I separated out the first   two statements as being declarative statements about your forecast couched in probability   terms—the probability of inflation rising or falling and the probability of growth above or below   a sustainable rate  Then I ladled in the welfare judgments, the judgments about relative costs in   your objective function  That is, everything that relates to risk management in a central bank is   put into that third sentence      What I propose, Mr Chairman, is for everybody to go get lunch and   come back to the table  When everyone settles down, I can read some brief remarks, and then   we can proceed with the discussion    "
5199,2003-12-09,"  I would point out, Governor Ferguson, that financial economists refer   to observed equity premiums historically in the neighborhood of 500 to 600 basis points as the   equity risk premium puzzle  The fact that it’s now a little high in the range that has prevailed   over the last decade doesn’t put it well out of the range of the last century or so  Economists   have a hard time understanding the pricing of equities importantly because it depends on risk   aversion and expectations  So I’m not sure that I’d feel comfortable saying that what we’re   observing now is particularly at variance with the historical norm  "
5200,2003-12-09,"  The other point I’d add, President Moskow, is that the difference   between the nominal and the indexed yield is inflation compensation that includes both inflation   expectations and an inflation risk premium  So it wouldn’t be that far-fetched to say that, while   market participants may not believe that the Committee’s views on longer-term inflation   expectations are materially different, people in the markets might be a little more uncertain about   whether that’s the case They might well have greater uncertainty about that, given various   comments about the range of views among Committee members in terms of how they interpret   their longer-run inflation goals     There are two points to make about that, Mr Chairman  The first is   that we do think the TIPS market is more liquid  That’s in part a reflection of the fact that more   instruments are tied to TIPS, including some exchange-traded products that are priced relative to   TIPS  So that provides more liquidity and more opportunities to trade, and there are more   mutual funds that use those products  So we think it’s a more liquid instrument and that is   associated with the declining bid–asked spreads and the increased trading volume     I’d also point out that one of the other briefings yesterday looked at the inflation   compensation measures from the euro market, Canada, and the United Kingdom  As was noted,   there was a considerable synchronicity to the run-up in inflation compensation in those markets    That would make one think that perhaps there was something about the overall liquidity and   arbitrage across those markets rather than an unraveling of investors’ confidence in the long-term   inflation target of three different central banks     In terms of implied forward rates?     Over the intermeeting period that forward rate structure really hasn’t   changed much at all     They don’t in part because the inflation risk premium and the   potential for differential term premiums between the indexed and the nominal securities drive—     Right  So one can’t read it as an inflation premium  We’ve found   historically that the slope of the term structure does not do a particularly good job in forecasting   either activity or inflation  There’s a little information on the further-ahead forward rates but not   a lot  It is the case that the very far ahead forward rates were up a bit up over the intermeeting   period  But the ten-year was actually down  So it isn’t as if there are some obvious sets of   signals there  Nor is it the case if you look at volatilities that we could get from swaptions  The   implied volatilities on ten-year instruments are higher, but all interest rate volatilities are a little   higher       And that’s where we are expending a lot of effort to try to figure it   out  "
5247,2004-03-16,"  The contours of the chart would be the same if one used the ten-year-  ahead forward rate less, say, the one-year-ahead forward rate  The amplitude would be higher,   and the spread would wind up at something like 5⅛ percent  "
5248,2004-03-16,"2  Mr Chairman, in front of you is a chart of the forward rate yield   curve that you spoke about during Dino’s briefing The red line is the ten-year-ahead one-year-  forward rate less the one-year rate, and the black line duplicates the line that Dino showed on his   chart  And, yes, it is the case that the spread is quite high when we look at it in forward rate   terms, and the amplitude of the swings is greater                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   March 16, 2004 54 of 107   "
5249,2004-03-16,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material  that was just handed out  This is another meeting about words, not action  Your  discussion about policy would seem likely to center on how to characterize the  economic situation and risks to the outlook so as to retain your flexibility going  forward  As is evident in the current readings on federal funds futures plotted in the  top left panel of the first exhibit, over the intermeeting period market participants  moved closer to the staff’s assumption that the funds rate will hold at 1 percent for the  remainder of the year  Indeed, futures quotes are now consistent, as shown in the top  right panel, with the onset of tightening being pushed back about three months—to  sometime near year-end       This message is similar to what primary dealer respondents reported to the   Domestic Desk in a survey last week (the middle left panel)  All twenty-three dealers  anticipate that the stance of policy will remain unchanged at this meeting, and about  one-third expect no action until 2005  The dealers apparently do not anticipate any  significant change in the language of your announcement, either  It is also worth  noting, as in the middle right panel, that market participants are fairly confident about  the near-term path of short-term rates, at least as judged by the low level of volatility  implied by options on Eurodollar futures  This strongly held sense in markets that  policy will be on hold for some time, along with the phrasing of the last  announcement—and the sense of quietude in many of the telegrams on the discount  rate sent in by the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks in the past few days— explains the lack of policy alternatives in the Bluebook, a document with the official  title “Monetary Policy Alternatives” To provide some perspective, the bars in the  bottom panel parse the reaction in markets at your meetings over the past five years  into that owing to the surprise on the policy rate and the residual, which presumably  is due to the words of your statement  The message to take from the chart is that  words seem to figure importantly as to how markets react to your decision     You might think that we’ve taken that principle to an extreme in the centerpiece   of the most recent Bluebook, the table I’ve included on the next page  The three  columns of the table present variations on the wording of the announcement  according to your view of the economic outlook  Alternative B, given in the middle  column and explained in more detail on the next page in exhibit 2, suggests only the  most minor variation of the wording that would be required to square the statement  with economic developments over the intermeeting period  To be sure, readings on  the economy of late have been disappointing, as is shown in the top left panel by the  staff’s estimate of the cumulative effect on the two-year Treasury yield of surprises in  key economic data releases, similar to indexes of market “surprises” that Governor                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   March 16, 2004 73 of 107    Ferguson mentioned  But the market reaction to such disappointments, on net, also  produced, as shown in the top right panel, a significant decline in investment-grade  corporate yields that worked to offset a decline in share prices and an appreciation of  the dollar  Thus, financial conditions, on net, probably do not differ much from those  prevailing at the time of the January meeting      While encouraging the expectation of more-accommodative policy would support   spending going forward, the lags in monetary policy might lead you to believe such  effects would mostly be felt when the economy was in less need of support  As  shown in the middle left panel, the period when any action taken today would have its  maximum leverage on the economy is next year, when the staff anticipates that real  GDP will be growing at 4 percent, following this year’s projected 5 percent  expansion  With inflation tame, the Committee might feel that preserving current  financial conditions would best foster the achievement of its objectives  Such an  attitude is consistent with the assurance made in the last sentence of the January  announcement, at the right, that the “Committee can be patient in removing its policy  accommodation,” an assurance that market participants evidently took to heart in  shaping their near-term expectations  If that is the case, as in the bottom panel, you  could stress that spending is continuing to expand at a significant pace  I’d note that  the description of the labor market in the second bullet is a little different from that in  table 1 of the Bluebook The feedback I got since distributing the Bluebook made me  think that the Committee would be more comfortable relating that “although job  losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged” Such an announcement would likely sink  quickly among the waves of economic news and be associated with little market  reaction Touching any other element of the January announcement would probably  prompt a more sizable response, which is discussed first for an easier alternative in  exhibit 3       As is plotted in the top left panel, the simple summary of the Greenbook is that   the staff now believes that the output gap will run about ½ percentage point deeper  than previously expected  That implies that about ¾ percent of the nation’s resources  are expected to go unused at the end of 2005  The fitful performance of the labor  market, seen by the shallow bars in the middle left panel, might pose a threat that  outcomes could be even worse than that  If households begin to doubt their income  prospects in the context of a poorly performing job market, spending may not fare as  well as in the staff forecast  The Committee might put some weight on an assessment  of such adverse alternatives  If the Committee’s characterization of the economy  leads market participants to expect a tighter stance of policy and adverse outcomes  for aggregate demand materialize—such as a compression of household spending— the cost in terms of lost output might well be higher than if the Committee seems to  be inclined to ease and the economy snaps back quickly  While investors do not  expect action at this meeting, to be sure, as shown in the middle right panel, the  distribution of possibilities for later this year implied by options on Eurodollar futures  rates has a noticeable portion of its mass below 1 percent—and more so than at the  January meeting  If you thought that you likely would be keeping policy on the easy  side longer than currently priced into financial markets, the Committee might want to   March 16, 2004 74 of 107    highlight, as in the bottom panel, the darker shades to recent economic releases  In  particular, it could point out, as in the second bullet, that “resource utilization  generally appears likely to remain somewhat below levels consistent with the  economy operating at its productive potential for some time” and could even tilt the  balance between inflation and disinflation more clearly into the negative zone     While such a shift seems consistent with the last few weeks of data, the   Committee might have more in mind the longer sweep of your policymaking history  As shown at the top of your last exhibit, the real federal funds rate has been negative  for the past ten quarters  Although a few staff models would suggest that the  equilibrium short rate may well be negative—that is the lower bound of the blue  region—you may well find it disquieting to be in an area traveled rarely by central  bankers who are favorably remembered  [Laughter]  Moreover, the estimate of the  equilibrium real short rate derived from financial markets—the thin line plotting the  far-ahead real forward rate derived from quotes on indexed debt—is now, and has  been for a while, well above the actual real short rate       A sense that the staff has a more benign view of the threat of a pickup in inflation   than other forecasters can be gotten from the latest Blue Chip survey of forecasters   Twice a year, the folks in Arizona ask about expectations over the next five to ten  years for several variables, including real GDP growth (plotted in the middle left  panel) and CPI inflation (plotted in the middle right panel)  As to the first panel, such  far-ahead projections of output growth would seem to reveal private-sector  economists’ notion of potential output growth  If so, forecasts of potential output  growth, with a median of just above 3 percent and spanning a confidence range from  2¾ to nearly 3½ percent, might be read as suggesting that pressures on resources  could emerge more quickly than in the staff forecast  As to the second panel, and as  President Parry noted, despite the good performance of inflation over the past few  years, longer-term inflation expectations may remain above your longer-run target  and, judging by the dispersion of the responses, may be less anchored than you’d like     Words to express such cautionary notes are given in the bottom panel, with the   important changes contained in the paragraph assessing the risks to the outlook  In  particular, if you think that you may be more likely to tighten than seems built into  market prices, you might want, as in the fourth bullet, to tip the balance of inflation  risk to neutral, from its current slight tilt toward disinflation, and qualify your  “patience”  The latter could be done, as in the last bullet, by noting that “the  Committee recognizes that the stance of monetary policy has been quite  accommodative for some time”  That would likely be taken in markets as a marker  that your patience was wearing thin       In retaliation for the hard questions President Parry has asked  the staff over the years, I will be delaying the start of his lunch!  [Laughter]  In doing  so, I’ll be referring to the memo I circulated last night  Commenting on the January  draft minutes, one policymaker suggested trimming the first four paragraphs covering  the Committee’s discussion of its communications policy  Four others recommended  that only paragraph 3, which reviewed issues related to expediting the minutes, be  shortened  I’ve included the full set of comments beginning on the second page of  the memo, showing potential additions in bold and potential deletions as bracketed  material in italics       Not to sound defensive, I started drafting the minutes on the assumption that you   intended to be transparent about your discussion of transparency  Providing a full and  accurate record of the meeting seemed to require describing the different aspects of  your discussion about the risk assessments, the minutes, and economic forecasts  To  my mind, the contribution of paragraph 3 was to lay out the pros and cons of  expediting the release of the minutes—in particular, the arguments against elevating  the role of the minutes, including feedback on the Committee’s deliberations—which  have not previously been well articulated in the public domain      That said, two changes do seem appropriate  For one, the last sentence of the first   paragraph—that’s lines 7 through 9—concerns the working group, which was  directed solely to arrive at formulaic language for the risk assessments  That sentence  would seem to be positioned better in the second paragraph, which is centered on the  risk assessments, so that people do not read too much into the working group’s  formation and dissolution  For another, the last sentence of the third paragraph— lines 38 through 40—suggests that it was premature to expedite the minutes, seeming  to imply that at some point the minutes would be expedited  On further reflection, the  one-sided nature of that statement appears presumptuous about your future decisions,  suggesting that a more neutral description would indicate that you have not reached a  decision  I believe that covers four out of five of the objections on that part of the  minutes       The rest of the possible changes have policy import, which is why I’m coming   back to the Committee  In particular, do you want to shorten the description of your  discussions about the formulas for the risk assessment, the minutes, and the economic  projections?  You might favor such a cut on the grounds that it’s not worthwhile to  talk about procedural issues in public  But the main points have mostly already made  it into the press, and this offers you the opportunity to frame the main issues in a  balanced way  I would also add that reducing the discussion to its bare bones would  offer more than a few commentators the opportunity for irony about the Committee’s   March 16, 2004 89 of 107    views on transparency, something I certainly wouldn’t pass up!  If you do, I take that  as direction on preparing the next set of minutes  That is, I should downplay today’s  discussion of your prior discussion of transparency  [Laughter]     Let me close with this observation  Given your decision to experiment with   accelerating the production of the minutes, you will not have the luxury of an  extended discussion of the minutes for this meeting and those for the remainder of the  year       Five     I have all the time you want  The Committee, however, will have to   vote on the minutes      For the Reserve Bank members, this will be the first experiment with   notation voting electronically  You’ll have to do that kind of vote in two weeks anyway for the   minutes of this meeting, which we will be circulating at that time     President Guynn, in the experiment with expediting the minutes,   we’re going to post drafts of the minutes every evening so you’ll be able to see how the   comments evolve  Then we’ll deal bilaterally with Committee members if people have specific   comments  When we talked about the possibility of forming a subgroup of the Committee, we   ran into the legal issue that the FOMC cannot delegate matters of monetary policy  If the   minutes are viewed as a part of monetary policy, you can’t—  "
5299,2004-05-04,"  I’d just like to report on the first dry run of our experiment in expediting   the production of the FOMC minutes  We were able to produce a proposed final version of the   minutes and get all twelve voting members of the Committee to indicate by our deadline that they   were inclined to vote to adopt the minutes at the next meeting  There was not a lot of slack in our   May 4, 2004 3 of 112       schedule, though, and we received the last of the members’ responses as to their inclinations on the   vote pretty close to the wire    Two factors contributed to the success of the experiment  One was contracting for an   outside professional to help provide a typed transcript of the meeting on an expedited basis  That   sped up the process of preparing the initial draft of the minutes considerably  For another, there   weren’t all that many comments on that first draft, so we were able to incorporate them and turn out   a revised draft in fairly good order  One problem, which we had anticipated, was getting   information to and from Committee members who were out of their offices  Needless to say, we   learned a few things about the process, and we will make some minor adjustments, but they will be   in the background from your perspective   Once the minutes were ready, we asked Dave Skidmore of the Public Affairs staff to prepare   some hypothetical headlines and the first few paragraphs of a news wire story on the minutes  Then   Board and New York staff members independently looked at that information as well as the minutes   and tried to estimate the likely market effects of an early release of those minutes  The results,   which should be taken with a grain of salt, suggested that there could have been a fairly substantial   market reaction, and that was because of the timing  These minutes would have been released on   the afternoon of the outsized employment report, and perhaps would have reinforced the market   reaction to the numbers released earlier that day   I’m sure you noted that in this exercise we asked you to indicate whether you were inclined   to vote to approve these minutes but not actually to vote on them  The reason was that if we had   asked you to vote, we would have to indicate in the next set of minutes that the Committee had   taken a notation vote on that decision  That’s why two and a half weeks after the meeting we’ll   May 4, 2004 4 of 112                                                         1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   continue to ask you to give us your inclination as to whether you would approve the draft minutes   but actually have you vote on them at the next meeting  Thank you     We did     Virgil thought that the wording of the request we sent around was   perfectly appropriate     Mr Chairman, you can see in Dino’s chart on page 2 that, when rates   are unchanged and are expected to be unchanged, the duration of a thirty-year conventional   mortgage levels out at around four and one-half years  So we have at most about another half year   to go if rates were to rise     No, that’s more a reflection of the mobility of our population  When   rates are unchanged for long enough, the economic incentive to refinance goes away, but people still   do prepay their mortgages because they move or they trade up  So, I think the four and one-half   years is not immutable, but it’s a reflection of deeper demographics     Yes   May 4, 2004 9 of 112         Yes  Just last night we received copies of the audit statement on the   System open market account and the participation of the Reserve Banks  We’ll be circulating those   to you in a couple days, and we’ll seek a notation vote  "
5300,2004-05-04,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the material  that Carol Low distributed to you during the coffee break  Market interest rates staged  a remarkable runup over the intermeeting period, spurred on by data releases that  surprised investors by their strength and by comments of the Chairman during  congressional testimony  As shown in the top panel of your first exhibit, the funds  rate expected to prevail one year ahead advanced 85 basis points  The red line in the  middle left panel indicates that market participants currently believe that you are on a  path to raise the funds rate 3 percentage points over the next two years—and that  you’ll embark on that journey sometime soon  Indeed, a full ¼ point tightening is  first priced in by the August meeting, and as shown by the bars at the right,  significant weight is placed on the funds rate being at least as high as 1¾ percent by  October  Nonetheless, no weight is placed on action at this meeting, although surveys  suggest that you’ll seek to carve out additional elbow room for future action by  dropping or modifying the “patience” language      The revision over the intermeeting period to the outlook for policy prompted a   75 to 90 basis point rise in nominal Treasury yields, which was recorded  predominantly in their real components  Despite some narrowing of corporate risk  spreads, an average of real corporate yields (weighted by capital spending and plotted  at the bottom left) gained 60 basis points since your March meeting  Adding in the  appreciation of the dollar and the small net change in equity prices, it would appear  that financial conditions tightened appreciably over the intermeeting period—a point  Governor Bernanke has made     An important element in your decision today is whether you view this tightening   as commensurate with the revision to the economic outlook  To help frame those  deliberations, three alternatives were presented in the Bluebook, which are repeated at  the top of exhibit 2  The wording of alternative A was designed to address the worry  that market participants may have built in excessively prompt and aggressive policy  tightening and that the associated firming in financial conditions could threaten  economic outcomes in 2005  Alternative B might be favored if you believe that  market participants have pegged about correctly your assessment of the odds of  policy action over the next few meetings but you also desire to emphasize that policy   May 4, 2004 70 of 112       firming will be gradual to limit the chance of an overreaction in markets when  tightening commences  In contrast, alternative C includes a ¼ point hike in the funds  rate, which might seem appropriate if you interpret the tightening of financial  conditions as the initial signs of building pressures on inflation or increases in  equilibrium real interest rates      Taking these alternatives in turn, the case for A, which makes only minor changes   to the wording of the statement and retains the commitment that you’ll be patient,  likely rests at least in part on dissatisfaction with the slow progress in working down  resource slack in most forecasts and perhaps, too, on concern about downside risks to  such forecasts  In the staff outlook, as shown in the middle left panel, substantial  resources go unused over the next one and three-quarters years, with the output gap  lingering at ¾ percentage point in the final quarter of 2005, while core PCE inflation  still runs at just 1¼ percent  Although readings on payroll gains and CPI increases  might indicate that businesses have become less hesitant to hire and that some pricing  power has returned, the two histograms derived from data since the early 1980s at the  middle right serve as a reminder that those monthly readings are very volatile  A  70 percentile range of the monthly change in payroll employment spans 300,000; the  comparable figure for CPI inflation is 03 percentage points at a monthly rate   Moreover, given the outsized increase in the core CPI last month and the evidence of  some tendency toward reversal, you might think that the risks around the next CPI  release are skewed to the downside       The Committee might be inclined to go slowly if recent developments seem   reminiscent of the false economic dawn of two years ago  Back in March 2002, as  sketched out in the bottom left panel, market participants were also firmly of the view  that tightening was imminent and priced in 1¾ percentage points of funds rate  increases over the balance of that year  Both economic data and the moral fiber of  some of the leaders of corporate America subsequently proved shaky, and those  expectations unwound, just as (in the bottom right panel) the consensus expectation  of the year-end unemployment rate rose       This time around may really be different  The discussion of alternative B in your   next exhibit begins by noting that members might find the staff forecast both  plausible and acceptable in its outlook for durable economic expansion and muted  pressures on inflation  A notable aspect of the economic releases over the past six  weeks was the consistency with which they surprised on the upside  But economic  forecasts are always uncertain  Some sense of that can be gotten from the middle  panels, which plot the distributions of three-quarters-ahead Greenbook forecast errors  for the unemployment rate and four-quarter CPI inflation, centered around the current  forecasts for 2004Q4  Those distributions—derived from the past twenty-five  years—are notably spread out  Over the last year or two, we’ve pointed to the lower  tail of the distribution at the right, in conjunction with the zero bound to nominal  interest rates, as a rationale for maintaining any unusually easy stance of policy   Now, with the risks of deflation substantially diminished, you may wish to shift your  focus more to the upper tail of the distribution  The possibility of significant upside   May 4, 2004 71 of 112       surprises unfolding in short order may make you uncomfortable with the commitment  that “the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy  accommodation”  But “patience” was meant to convey two notions  that the  Committee believed it could wait awhile before acting and that, once policy firming  commenced, it could be gradual in returning the real funds rate to its neutral setting   It is the former, not the latter, that at the moment may seem to be confining       In the Bluebook, we offered modified language that the “Committee believed that   policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace” to emphasize that  you see yourselves entering a tightening phase but one that likely will not be as  aggressive as in prior episodes  That emphasis seemed important because, as in the  table at the bottom left, market participants currently anticipate about 200 basis points  of firming in the next year  That is probably influenced by the experience of the three  prior tightening phases, in which the funds rate moved an average of 2⅔ percentage  points higher within the first year  But with inflation lower now than in those prior  episodes, you may see less need at this juncture for such firming, perhaps viewing as  more likely something on the order of the 100 basis point increase assumed by the  staff  In the Greenbook, the gradual realization by investors that you will not need to  tighten as sharply as they now believe imparts an accommodative offset to your  policy firming  Without that offset, you may be concerned that the swing of both  monetary and fiscal policies toward more restraint may slow the growth of spending  next year even more than is built into the Greenbook        There are potential costs associated with delaying tightening and conveying a   sense of gradualism  The recent increase in short-run inflation expectations—say, as  measured by inflation compensation in the Treasury market as in the bottom right  panel—may represent a cautionary flag in that regard  But inflation compensation  between five and ten years from now seems much better anchored, perhaps  encouraging you to believe that a statement along the lines of alternative B would not  cause market participants to question your inflation-fighting resolve       If you think that the odds are higher that inaction might prompt building of   inflation concerns, you might opt for alternative C, which is discussed in exhibit 4  In  particular, a ¼ point firming might be favored if you are of the view that inflation has  more than bottomed—that businesses have regained a considerable measure of their  pricing power and intend to use it rather than absorb higher costs by cutting into their  fat profit margins  In that environment, persistent monetary policy accommodation  may spell trouble down the road  And as shown in the middle left panel, monetary  policy has probably become more accommodative of late, as higher inflation by some  measures has sent the real federal funds rate further into negative territory and the  brighter outlook for the economy has been associated with an increase in the  equilibrium funds rate  Such concerns would be heightened if you suspected that the  natural rate of unemployment was higher than the staff currently assumes  As an  alternative simulation in the Greenbook indicated, a natural rate of 5¾ percent,  instead of less than 5 percent as assumed by the staff, would add more than   May 4, 2004 72 of 112       ½ percentage point to the inflation forecast for next year (as shown in the middle right  panel)       One consideration regarding the timing of such a move is that, as in 1994, it could   spark significant financial market turbulence  Indeed, as shown at the bottom left, in  both episodes the Committee kept rates low for a protracted period  This time,  however, market participants seem better prepared, in that the expected path of the  federal funds rate (the dashed red line) points decidedly higher than was the case in  1994 (the dashed blue line)  Moreover, the large upward revision to expectations  over the course of 1994 should not necessarily be taken as evidence of the primary  role of a self-feeding dynamic in which policy tightening prompted investors to  expect more tightening  Rather, a portion was due to the response to incoming data  that suggested a more rapid improvement in the labor market, seen as the downward  drift in a consensus forecast of the unemployment rate at the end of the year (shown  at the bottom right)  That said, you should be prepared for a sharp revision to  expectations and heightened volatility should you surprise markets by firming today,  especially acting so close in advance to key readings on employment and inflation   That in itself may be sufficient to dissuade you from such an action before making  your intentions more clear        In the last exhibit, I provide an updated version of the table from the Bluebook   that gives the statement wording for the three alternatives that I have discussed  Of  particular note across the columns is the characterization of inflation risks as now  balanced—which was driven by recent data—and the promise that policy tightening  would be measured under B and C  Based on feedback I got since the Bluebook was  distributed, I offer three changes to the suggested wording, one in the rationale  paragraph and two in the risk-assessment portion, with all three highlighted in bold   First, some members were troubled by the characterization that inflation was well  anchored, so that has been softened to “contained”  Second, it seems appropriate to  stress that the outlook has changed by noting that “the risks to the goal of price  stability have moved into balance”  Lastly, to be sure that the qualifier “likely”  obviously applied only to the pace that you intended to remove policy  accommodation rather than when you’d start the process, I redrafted the last portion  of the last sentence to read “policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is  likely to be measured”  That concludes my prepared remarks         To what significant digit?     I think we can agree on the sign  The experience of taking out the   promise of remaining accommodative for a “considerable period” and substituting what seemed to   be a similar concept of “patience” was that it prompted a good-sized market reaction  Similarly,   “patience” has now become a loaded word, and the first thing traders will do at 215 this afternoon   is to look to see if that word is in our statement today  If there is nothing there at all, then I think   you should expect a movement up in forward rates on the order of 10 to 15 basis points  Leaving   the sentence there but changing the language and using the term “measured” will send them to their   dictionaries where they will find that the second meaning in most common dictionaries is “connotes   a gradualism”  In my view, that will prompt a reaction on the order of, say, 5 to 10 basis points    I’m looking to Dino to see if he agrees or disagrees     The other point I’d like to make, President Moskow, is that in the total   scheme of things, any reaction to the wording today is going to be dwarfed in significance relative   to what happens at 832 Friday morning after the employment report comes out     Yes, but it will also influence how market participants subsequently   react to the data  That is, their view of the employment report or the CPI is going to be filtered   through the lens of what they think the Committee is going to be doing  In that sense “measured” is   a speed bump to them as well, in terms of overreacting to the data  So it’s not just a matter of what   happens this afternoon; it’s what happens over the next six to eight weeks     In the survey by the Desk, the question we asked market participants   was whether they expected us to drop or modify the word “patience”       It’s hard to know how to interact with market participants about   potential wording  Obviously I am making a guess here, but it does seem, on the basis of reading   various newsletters, that the preponderance of economists who write about the issue expect the   Committee to modify rather than to drop the word “patience”  But that is a guess  I once asked a   Nobel laureate what he thought was the best way of finding out how market participants would react   to wording in the statement  He suggested that we do what those in the survey industry do—have   focus groups and really experiment with traders  My reaction was that the only time I’ve ever   thought about experimenting with traders it involved cattle prods!  [Laughter]  It’s just hard to—     I think you would take this word out if you envision circumstances   comparable to the latter part of 1994 where you’d be moving, say, 50 or 75 basis points  In other   words, if it were February 1994 and we were using this framework, we probably would have sent   you a Bluebook that said “policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace”  Most likely   that would have stayed in the Bluebook until July or August when you felt you were behind the   curve and had to do larger increases       In some circumstances it might be helpful to keep in the “measured”   phrase even in the act of tightening so market participants don’t extrapolate that tightening more   than you think appropriate  "
5347,2004-08-10,"  Another way of putting it, Mr Chairman, is that the wave of refinancing   has made the distribution of mortgages more concentrated, and it isn’t until rates get down to the   levels they were a year or so ago that we would really hit the mass of that distribution  While it is   August 10, 2004 7 of 103          true that the amount of new financing in the last year hasn’t been all that great, a lot of it has been in   ARMs  And if rates were to decline some, we might see refinancing out of variable-rate and into   fixed-rate products  So, there is some scope for refinancing    With regard to the first point you made about the anchoring of the term structure made   possible by the Committee’s measured pace of policy action, I’d note—and this is something   you’ve noted in the past—that the term structure is also anchored at the long end The ten-year-  ahead one-year-forward rate has moved in a very narrow range, and that has very powerfully   lowered the volatility of the longer-term instruments that Dino showed  I think we have other   manifestations of a sense of lower volatility—perhaps also bearing on risk aversion  The equity   premium is in the middle of its historical range, and risk-neutral bond spreads also seem to be in   their typical range  And while volatility is low, the market reaction to news has been rather high    Just think of what happened in response to the employment reports and the CPI      It really does look as if that line has rotated  So although volatilities are   low, that isn’t preventing the market from repricing when news comes out  That may say   something about market functioning, and that would be a more favorable interpretation than the   lesson you took away       I have three brief items to bring to the Committee’s attention  Let me   deal with the two bureaucratic ones first  Dick Porter, now of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,   conducted a survey of readers of the Bluebook to see how they felt about the content and the   distribution of that document  There are thirty-six separate responses from people at the Board and   the twelve Reserve Banks, expressing a very wide range of views  Indeed, the range is sufficiently   wide to make me glad you’re asked to vote on my appointment as Secretary only once a year!    [Laughter]    As to the content of the Bluebook, there were some suggestions about the structure that I   think we’ll be able to fold in over time  As to its distribution, there was widespread enthusiasm for   the Secure Document System as a way of delivering that document more quickly to the Reserve   Banks  But there were also some suggested changes, a few of which would involve changing the   FOMC’s Program for the Security of Information  A couple of the suggestions we can put in place   fairly quickly, including allowing access to SDS through laptops, given that NRAS provides a   sufficiently secure platform for that communication, and also allowing differential access to those   with Class I versus Class II access  So we’ll be doing that  As to the number of staff with access to   SDS, I got very conflicting guidance on that, so I’ve asked a couple of people here at the Board to   work with the research directors at the Reserve Banks to spell out some potential alternatives   Second, I surveyed the Committee over the period on preferences regarding the special topic   for your two-day meeting in February  A clear winner emerged among the thirteen potential topics   August 10, 2004 89 of 103          I listed  Three out of four respondents listed a discussion of the Committee’s inflation goal as the   preferred item, with the second most cited item being a discussion of inflation targeting and   communications in third place  Anyway, I rated the responses by the order in which they were   cited  The inflation goal seemed to be the favorite topic  So Chairman Greenspan has asked me to   put that topic on the February agenda, with the intention of discussing the appropriate inflation goal   for the Committee and potential means to communicate it to the public, if appropriate   Third, events evidently pushed further into the future your consideration of the structural   tension of the risk assessment paragraph that I discussed in a memo distributed to the Committee on   August 5  That is, the language about removing accommodation at a measured pace gives the   public some sense about the direction of rates independent of your assessment of risks to the   economy  You might want to bring more content into that economic assessment, which would be   especially important when the time comes to eliminate the removing accommodation sentiment but   might also be viewed as useful independent of that  I had one proposal to do so in my memo, and I   would appreciate your feedback over the next couple of weeks, as it will influence the policy   alternatives presented in the Bluebook  "
5348,2004-08-10,"  Mr Chairman, I might just point out that the sentence before that—  where we say that a portion of the rise in inflation is transitory—is itself predictive  So, it isn’t   unprecedented to be giving some sense of an outlook in the rationale part of the statement  "
5400,2004-09-21,"  But, Mr Chairman, the alternative would put Dino in the position of   giving a signal of your action at the upcoming meeting      We often consider alternative ways of implementing policy, and in   light of this discussion, the committee of two will look into the issue, for sure, Mr Chairman  I   would just note another observation that Dino made in his briefing, which is that implied   volatilities are quite low  So the cost associated with a somewhat more volatile overnight rate   doesn’t have much consequence if the Committee also has anchored down expectations about the   target rate     And I’d make another observation  If one looks at the pattern of fed   funds futures contracts, in the months in which there are no meetings scheduled, one can see that   the probability of an intermeeting move has gone down to as low as it gets  The Committee’s   decision to remove policy accommodation at a measured pace has signaled to markets that it’s a   decision that is made at meetings  So they have a fixed target, and that, therefore, puts Dino in   the sights of the fed funds traders  But the consequences, in normal times, seem fairly   manageable     I just wanted to give a quick report on the experiment with the   expedited minutes  Once again, we got the Committee to indicate its inclination to approve the   minutes in time to meet our deadline  That is, we would have been able to publish the minutes   two and a half weeks after the August meeting  Once again, it was a close call  The Chairman   has asked me to put a discussion of the minutes experiment on the agenda for December  I’ll   brief you then on some of the lessons we’ve learned and ask for guidance going forward  Now I   think the Chairman has a report on other developments relating to the Secretariat  "
5401,2004-09-21,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the help of the first exhibit  in the material distributed at the break, I want to begin by pointing out several notable  features in financial markets over the past six weeks likely bearing on your policy  deliberations  As shown by the solid line in the top left panel, short-term interest rate  futures indicate that market participants currently expect the Committee to tighten  gradually over the next year and a half, with the funds rate reaching 2⅞ percent by  early 2006  Compared with the interest rate sentiment prevailing in the markets at the  time of the August meeting (the dotted line), this path is a little firmer in the near  term and shallower later on  Apparently, investors read recent statements by  policymakers as confirming a desire on your part to continue to remove  accommodation and interpreted data releases—especially subdued readings on  inflation—as indicating that a lessened cumulative amount of firming will be required  to deliver satisfactory economic performance  The shift over the intermeeting period  was small relative to that in the run-up to the August meeting, when the weak  employment report for July was released between the publication of the August  Greenbook and your last meeting Current market expectations relative to those at the  time of that Greenbook (the dashed line) are about ½ percentage point lower one and  one-half years from now—similar to the revision to the staff’s policy assumption  from Greenbook to Greenbook     The top right panel focuses on near-term expectations by plotting the policy path   that is consistent with the futures curve and assumes that the Committee will move  only at regularly scheduled meetings  Those expectations indicate a near certainty of  a ¼ point hike today—which is also what dealers told the Domestic Desk in its  regular survey—and put the funds rate near 2 percent at year-end  Thus, market  participants expect you to pause sometime soon in the process of removing policy  accommodation—probably in December  These expectations seem to be held  relatively firmly, in that implied volatility on near-term Eurodollar futures rates  (given in the middle left panel) has trended lower, a phenomenon not unique to this  market  Despite subdued readings on interest rate volatility, market prices have  responded forcefully to key data releases  The middle right panel compares the  change in the ten-year Treasury yield (plotted on the vertical axis) in the half-hour  surrounding the release of the employment report with the surprise in the nonfarm  payrolls (or the actual value less a survey measure), which is given along the  horizontal axis  As shown by the red regression line, the average response to  employment surprises in the last year has been considerably more marked than in the  prior ten years  As President Geithner noted, one possibility linking the two middle   September 21, 2004 77 of 100          panels is that the explicitly conditional nature of your statements has lowered  uncertainty about your actions and focused attention on a few indicators  The arrow  in the figure points to the observation corresponding to the release of the August  employment report on September 3, which is a bit of a puzzle  The monthly gain in  payrolls was a touch weaker than market participants expected, yet rates rose  considerably  You might rationalize this as owing to backward revisions to the  employment data, but I think it also shows the market’s judgment that the data were  not soft enough to halt your process of removing policy accommodation       The net effect of other data over the intermeeting period, however, more than   offset this one-day rise in rates  The downward revision to policy expectations was  associated with a considerable relaxation in financial conditions, in that, as shown in  the bottom panel, corporate yields are lower, equity prices posted sizable gains, while  the exchange value of the dollar moved sideways  How you interpret this easing no  doubt influences your decisions today both on the funds rate target and on the words  of the statement     Members might view the decline in yields and the concomitant rise in share prices   as the dawning recognition among investors that a lower track for the real risk-free  rate of interest will be necessary to support economic growth  As discussed at the top  of exhibit 2, a decision to hold the funds rate at 1½ percent would no doubt encourage  an even more substantial revision to the outlook for policy  While the Committee  may be convinced that a sustainable economic expansion is in place, it may be  concerned that the pace of output growth will not be sufficiently vigorous to ensure  satisfactory progress in reducing economic slack     As shown in the middle left panel, the advance in payrolls has been fitful in recent   months and perhaps indicates a lingering hesitancy on the part of businesses to make  commitments, which several of you have already mentioned If that hesitancy  continues for too long, then it may also be reflected again in capital spending and  begin to dent consumer confidence  Persisting slack has also rolled back a portion of  the turn-up in inflation of the first half of the year  As can be seen in the middle right  panel and as noted by President McTeer, the three-month change in the CPI has  dropped back to the levels of last year, when worries of the possibility of deflation  surfaced  And market participants apparently have lowered their expectations for  inflation going forward  For instance, as plotted in the bottom left panel, the nominal  one-year forward rate ten years ahead, which has been quite sensitive to longer-run  inflation sentiment, has edged down to just below 6 percent  If resource slack  persists, inflation could fall to levels that the Committee might find uncomfortably  low, given the limits to conventional policy maneuvering posed by the zero bound to  nominal interest rates     I’d add that the “measured pace” language would not seem to pose an obstacle to   pausing in the process of firming, in that futures rates indicate that financial market  participants already anticipate inaction at one of the next three meetings—although   September 21, 2004 78 of 100          evidently not at this one  Indeed, a pause at this time might be seen as having the  benefit of ensuring that market participants do not come inappropriately to view the  “measured pace” language as a promise to firm policy 25 basis points at every  meeting  There is, however, an important obstacle to putting the process of  tightening on hold at this meeting  The universal conviction in markets that you will  not do so implies that the reaction to inaction could be sizable  A pickup in mortgage  hedging flows could magnify any initial downdraft in yields  The rally in fixed- income markets in recent weeks has pulled down the thirty-year mortgage rate to 5¾  percent, which is shown as the vertical line in the bottom right panel  According to  an estimate of the cumulative distribution of rates on outstanding mortgages, about  35 percent of them could be refinanced economically given current pricing  Because  of the wave of refinancings last year, outstanding mortgages are tightly clustered at  rates not much lower than the prevailing level  As a result, further reductions in  longer-term yields would likely lead to substantial prepayments of mortgages  The  experience of last year suggests that the resultant shortening of the duration of  mortgage-backed securities would prompt purchases of other longer-term securities,  amplifying the decline in rates and elevating volatility  Deviating from the currently  expected path of measured firming would seem to risk a considerable easing of  financial conditions, which may not be judged as appropriate at this time     But the most compelling reason not to opt for alternative A is that you see merit   in tightening, the subject of exhibit 3  The Committee may believe that the economic  expansion will remain on a desirable track under current financial conditions, which  incorporate market expectations of gradual policy firming  In such circumstances, it  would seem appropriate to validate those expectations by tightening 25 basis points at  this meeting, as in the B and C alternatives presented in the Bluebook  As can be  seen in the middle left panel, even with the two tightening steps that the Committee  has taken to date, the real federal funds rate is still close to zero and near the bottom  of the range of equilibrium values estimated by the staff  A modest boost to the  nominal funds rate would also be consistent with a number of monetary policy rules  shown in the middle right panel  And given the forces likely to impinge on aggregate  demand in coming quarters—including the efforts by households to rebuild savings,  the swing from fiscal impetus to restraint, and the intensifying drag of net exports— the Committee may find a quarter point move to be a sufficient step in removing  policy accommodation at this time      As to the wording of the statement—which is the only distinction between   alternatives B and C—if the Committee put much weight on the possibility that  growth will rebound sharply, it may believe that the scope of its future action is  unduly constrained on the upside by the “measured pace” language and may prefer to  drop the last two sentences from the statement  That may be especially so if you  interpret the decline in risk spreads and increases in the price–earnings ratio shown in  the table at the bottom left as evidence of an increased appetite for risk-taking  In  that case, you may be concerned that the spur to spending of a lower cost of funds  and higher wealth poses the risk that the growth of aggregate demand would quickly   September 21, 2004 79 of 100          outstrip that of potential output  While such an outcome may be welcomed if the  output gap were as large as in the staff forecast, you might share President Guynn’s  fear that the prospects for aggregate supply were described not by the Greenbook  baseline but by the “less room to grow” alternative simulation  In that alternative, the  NAIRU is higher, and the labor force participation rate does not rise any further to  augment labor inputs going forward, putting inflation on an upward march toward  2 percent, as shown in the bottom right panel     Removing the last two sentences would certainly surprise market participants,   who would presumably build in expectations of more-substantial action to come   Therefore, you probably would not want to consider acquiring the flexibility  associated with alternative C unless you also desire an immediate tightening of  financial conditions  Alternative B would provide the comfort of aligning your  decision with prevailing expectations while giving only limited and highly  conditioned guidance on your future actions  Retaining the risk assessment of August  would seem appropriate if you believe that you will have to be cautious about the  extent and speed with which policy accommodation should be removed  After all, it  is not yet firmly established that the economy has exited its soft patch, and you may  prefer to await more information on that score      Your last exhibit updates table 1 from the Bluebook in light of comments received   since its distribution on Thursday  In particular, as shown in bold, it seemed clearer  to link the description of the performance of output and the labor market in the  rationale paragraph by writing, “After moderating earlier this year partly in response  to the substantial rise in energy prices, output growth appears to have regained some  traction and labor market conditions have improved modestly”  That concludes my  prepared remarks       That was at the suggestion of the house grammarian, who complained   about the wording in the August and previous meeting statements     I don’t think my maneuverings are that subtle!  [Laughter]   September 21, 2004 80 of 100            I would note that some market analysts have pointed to such a   possible inclusion as an explicit signal that policy will pause     Yes  So that would have more import than just aligning the statement   to the goals in the Federal Reserve Act  It would be taken as a market signal  "
5454,2004-11-10,"  It’s something that we regularly do, Mr Chairman     We take the structure of WTI futures rates, use the 6 percent weight in   the overall CPI and apply it to the non-seasonally-adjusted figure, and then subtract off to get a   measure of the core     Yes     Well, one thing I would note is that because of the backwardation of the   futures curve, it’s in fact—     Yes  So you have the two effects  You have the spot effect of the   whole futures curve shifting up, which gives you the immediate increase in inflation compensation,   but you also have the forecasted subsequent decline, which actually subtracts from it     Right     I would make two observations  One is that I haven’t actually seen the   time series  My recollection is that it’s only a couple of points in the intermeeting period  It’s not a   large number—on the order of 10 to 15 basis points  The second point is that five-to-ten-year   forward inflation compensation is actually lower  So this is something that happened in the first   five years of the term structure of inflation compensation  But we can do this adjustment for you in   the time series perspective   November 10, 2004 8 of 107      When we look at these special factors, which included the smaller-than-   expected auction and the change in oil futures prices, it really is hard to get those special factors as a   large component in the parsing  It’s on the order of 10 basis points out of the 40 basis point rise     We took some consolation from the fact that the five-to-ten-year   forward inflation compensation really just moved sideways  And the ten-year forward rate, given   the flattening in the term structure that Dino noted, basically also moved sideways  "
5455,2004-11-10,"3       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Carol Low is handing out some  materials I’ll be referring to  This was one of those intermeeting periods that served to  remind me of the ephemeral nature of my work here  Not long after the Bluebook was  distributed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that it found 450,000 new payroll  jobs—337,000 in October and back revisions worth 113,000—and the document we  struggled over would be read, or at least skimmed, in a different light  In particular, the  shifting up of policy expectations following the employment report brought the net  intermeeting rise in federal funds futures rates, shown in the chart at the top left of  exhibit 1, to 10 to 40 basis points  The 3 percent funds rate expected for the end of  2005 is consistent with the belief that you plan to tighten policy in ¼ point increments at  about half of the FOMC meetings between now and then as Governor Kohn noted  I  take that to mean that market participants have apparently come to define “measured” as  “carefully calibrated” rather than “regular and rhythmic”   As for today, as shown in the middle left panel, respondents to the Desk’s survey of  primary dealers universally predict that the Committee will firm policy ¼ point, will  assess the risks to its goals as balanced, and will retain the “measured” language in the  statement  A minority of dealers still expect a marker in the statement indicating that  you’re likely to pause in December in the process of removing policy accommodation,  although the number that actually expect such a pause dwindled after Friday morning   3The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   November 10, 2004 71 of 107      With this revision to policy expectations, the nominal Treasury yields shown at the   top right gained 14 to 38 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the largest  increases posted at shorter maturities  But this should not be read as a tightening in  financial market conditions, as indexed debt yields fell; more broadly, equity prices  gained 4¼ percent, and the dollar depreciated 6 percent against a basket of major  currencies       Fluctuations in oil prices dominated the chatter among participants in global   financial markets during much of the period  Although the price of West Texas  intermediate crude ended yesterday about $1 above its level at the time of the September  meeting, it varied in a $10 range  There are three main channels of influence of energy  prices on the economy  First, a rise in oil prices makes a direct arithmetic contribution  to consumer prices, which should be of concern primarily to the extent that it prompts  an increase in underlying inflation expectations  Second, as the United States is an oil  importer, a rise in prices amounts to an increase in an excise tax, which tends to restrain  aggregate demand Third, since energy is a factor of production, an increase in its price  tilts the production mix toward other inputs, lowering their marginal products; down the  road, this leads to a lower level of labor compensation  But given adjustment costs, this  latter effect emerges only slowly over time  In consequence, as long as inflation  expectations are well contained, market participants might expect policymakers to focus  mainly on the effects of energy prices on aggregate demand—that an increase in oil  prices is associated with lower aggregate demand and hence with lower interest rates   As shown by the three bar charts in the bottom right of the exhibit, that seems to be  what happened over the intermeeting period, as Governor Bernanke noted  Day-to-day  changes in oil prices were inversely correlated with share prices and ten-year Treasury  yields—and statistically significantly so  Moreover, inflation compensation over the  next five years (as derived from the Treasury market) was not correlated with oil price  movements, at least at a daily frequency     As discussed in the top left panel of your next exhibit, the case for firming policy   today may rest on the view that economic data, including solid gains in employment  (the red bars), on balance indicate that financial conditions are supporting a durable  economic expansion  As those financial conditions are predicated on firming policy  today, you may feel it appropriate to validate those expectations You may also be  concerned that pressures on inflation may soon emerge  While longer-term inflation  compensation (plotted as the black line at the right) has been well contained, there has  been a notable updrift in the shorter-term measure (the red line)  As shown in the  middle panel, raising the nominal funds rate to 2 percent today would put it at about the  midpoint of the range of standard policy prescriptions  As shown in the bottom panel, a  ¼ point hike would also turn the real federal funds rate more decidedly positive and  raise it further above the lower limit of estimates of its equilibrium value     The more difficult part of your decision would seem to be how to describe your   future action, which is the subject of the third exhibit  In the staff forecast, a variety of  factors combine to make it possible to hold the funds rate at 2 percent for about one year  without exhausting resource slack and putting upward pressure on inflation  Even if  you don’t anticipate waiting that long before firming policy, you might see merit in   November 10, 2004 72 of 107    contemplating the possibility of sitting on the sidelines in December and letting the  world know of that likelihood now  A pause would give you the opportunity to assess  the durability of the expansion—an opportunity that might seem to be particularly  attractive if some of the recent strength in spending has been borrowed from next year  in anticipation of the end of partial expensing  Signaling that intent would limit the risk  that market participants, extrapolating from four consecutive tightenings, mark up their  rate expectations inappropriately     Let me say a bit more about this point  The chart at the top right plots FOMC rate   decisions over the past five years as hollow bars and shades the relative surprise (as  judged from futures quotes) from that action  Being more explicit in your statements  over the past year or so has allowed market participants to peg precisely the past three  tightenings  But it may also have led them to expect such guidance going forward  In  that case, silence about a pause might very well be taken as a signal that no such pause  was being contemplated  That said, you might, as discussed in the middle panel, view  the “measured pace” language as already encompassing enough scope to allow you to  keep the funds rate at 2 percent in December if you see fit  The extent to which the  outlook for policy has changed in the past few days may underscore the need to remain  flexible  Indeed, as shown by the probability density function implied by options prices  at the right, market participants already place a wide band of uncertainty around where  the funds rate will be just six months from now, suggesting that you already have  latitude in the pace with which you remove policy accommodation without surprising  markets     Alternatively, you might view yourselves as unlikely to pause in December  As   noted at the bottom left, with oil prices higher and the dollar weaker, inflation pressures  may emerge relatively quickly  They could do so especially if we are in the midst of a  slowing in the rate of growth of structural productivity that will put upward pressure on  unit labor costs  As plotted at the bottom right, the four-quarter growth rate of output  per hour in the nonfarm business sector (the black line) has turned down, whereas at the  same time, unit labor costs have picked up (the red line)  As an alternative scenario  presented in the Greenbook attests, monetary policy choices will be much less attractive  should structural productivity growth ratchet down permanently     For your reference, the last exhibit repeats the table of alternative statements that   staff circulated on Friday with one change noted in bold  Consistent with the view that  the aggregate demand effects of the oil shock seemed to have been relatively more  important, the phrase “despite the rise in energy prices” has been moved to refer to  output growth  That concludes my prepared remarks       That’s the reverse of what we used to talk about as “looking in the   mirror” That was the issue of whether we were being guided by market signals because, if the   market was guided by our signals, then again there was this positive feedback question  Also one   worries that market participants are not investing independently in the effort to forecast the   economy and to decide what is the appropriate monetary policy  In that regard, I think a good   example is not this intermeeting period but the prior two where data came out that seemed to   suggest that aggregate demand would be weaker than previously thought  Market participants   didn’t change their view of the monetary policy actions over the next five months because the   Committee’s statements seemed to suggest that you would be removing policy accommodation    Everything that moved was at a further-ahead time horizon  So the whole structure of the term   structure of fed funds futures rates shifted down past four or five months out, whereas the near-term   track of tightening seemed to be baked in the cake   That said, volatilities are low, but market participants seem to understand the conditioning   nature of the Committee’s decisions  In support of that notion, as we’ve noted in past briefings,   implied volatilities are low but the reaction to surprises in the data have been much larger than in   the prior decade  So if you look at the reaction to surprises in the employment report or consumer   prices, you see that markets are repricing their expectations for policy action  There just seems to   be less idiosyncratic noise about where policy will be  "
5515,2004-12-14,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the not inconsiderable number  of discussions of communications policies over the past few years, members have  often brought the meeting minutes into the mix  For those in favor of expediting the  release of the minutes, the benefits of such a change, as listed in the top left box of  your first exhibit, include providing more timely and nuanced information about the  economic outlook and monetary policy choice  In particular, releasing the minutes  well before the following meeting would help prevent situations in which market  participants incorrectly interpret the lagged minutes as reflecting current Committee  thinking     The minutes convey the range of views within the Committee, and expediting   their release could be seen as an advantage for a few reasons  After their release,  market participants will be able to put individual statements by policymakers into  perspective according to the description in the minutes of the spectrum of members’  preferences  In addition, policymakers might be more willing to speak publicly about  a wider range of policy possibilities if they can point to a mention of those  possibilities in the minutes, thereby improving public communications  In addition, if  members thought the expedited minutes provided a sufficiently complete and timely  explication of the policy decision, the policy statement released after the meeting  could potentially be shortened     Some members might not be convinced by such arguments, perhaps for the   reasons given in the box at the top right  Expedited release could lead to undue  market attention to the minutes, particularly so if early release were taken as a sign  that policymakers attached enhanced importance to them  Moreover, members might  be concerned that any resulting increased attention could complicate the Committee’s  deliberations  In particular, members might conceivably alter their discussion at the  meeting in order to be sure certain views were represented in the minutes  It is also  conceivable that a member would offer support for a given policy decision only in  return for agreement on a particular reference in the minutes  If an adverse dynamic  of increased market attention and increased contention within the Committee set in,  the result might be that the minutes would become sanitized and increasingly  unhelpful over time     A last objection has been that it may be operationally difficult to manage   expediting the minutes  (In that regard, though, I note that, as described in the memo  by Brian Doyle circulated last week, two central banks—the Bank of England and the  Swedish Riksbank—have succeeded in releasing minutes about two weeks after their  policy meetings  To be sure, though, the policy committees of those institutions are  smaller than the FOMC, and their memberships are not so geographically dispersed)   To address concerns about operational difficulty, this January the Committee directed   December 14, 2004 70 of 118           its Secretariat to conduct an experiment in expediting the minutes  As shown in the  middle panel, for the typical FOMC cycle, we posted a first draft for your  consideration seven working days after the meeting  Based on your feedback, we  produced two more drafts over the next week, with the goal of gathering indications  of your intention to approve the final draft in time to meet a hypothetical publication  deadline of two o’clock on Friday afternoon     In order to meet this schedule and to assess the experiment, as noted in the bottom   panel, staff changed the process of producing the minutes in several ways  We  contracted with a private firm to produce transcripts quickly  (This change also  provides an important redundancy in our operations that was previously lacking)  We  distributed drafting responsibilities among more staff so that work could be done  along parallel streams  And we’ve provided more systematic feedback on your  comments in the final week to make it more likely that the revision process comes to  closure by the deadline  To make it easier for a geographically dispersed membership  to approve the minutes in a relatively short time frame, staff developed a procedure  for secure, chad-free, voting  Lastly, we collaborated with staff members in Public  Affairs at the Board and the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York to assess the likely market reaction had the minutes been released early  This  involved internally generating representative headlines and wire-service stories about  the minutes consistent with the current environment and asking staff familiar with  financial markets to hazard a guess as to the likely market response     I take away four lessons, listed in exhibit 2, from this experience  First, using   more resources to produce and distribute the minutes soon after the meeting is helpful  in ensuring that they are a true and accurate record of your discussion  In particular,  memories are still fresh, and information arriving after the meeting is less likely to  shade the summary of the discussion  Second, not all FOMC participants were  familiar with all the rules governing the drafting of the minutes  There’s been an oral  tradition enforcing a hierarchy of “a few,” “several,” “many,” and “most” Committee  members and defining whether speakers are described as “members” or not  To make  this process a bit more transparent, last week I circulated a guide to the preparation of  the minutes drafted by your Deputy Secretary, Debbie Danker  Third, the expedited  schedule poses the risk that not all members will be able to vote by the deadline   Given complicated travel schedules and holidays, on two of six occasions this year I  was able to reach only eleven members by the time the minutes would have been  released to the public  That, however, does not strike me as a particularly serious  problem given that the results of the notation vote would not be reported until the  subsequent set of minutes  As long as we have the approval of a majority of  members, the minutes can be released on time, and we can note the subsequent  concurrence or dissent with that decision by those who could not be reached in the  following set of minutes  A more serious risk is that the schedule may be too tight to  achieve a consensus by the publication deadline, a risk that is elevated if some  members have significant and contradictory comments on the first and second drafts   My last observation is that Friday afternoon is a terrible time to release the minutes   On two occasions, the minutes would have been released on the same day as a   December 14, 2004 71 of 118           surprising employment report and probably would have added to the already  significant market volatility  In addition, financial markets tend to be thin on Friday  afternoon, elevating the possibility of an outsized reaction     This was a limited experiment, and in the bottom panel I’ve listed several aspects   of a new regime that went untested  In particular, the experiment was conducted over  a period in which there were no significant disagreements among members about the  direction of policy, perhaps leading to a false sense of security about the ease with  which a drafting consensus could be achieved  Nor has there been an intermeeting  conference call this year, so we did not have to work through procedures to handle  that contingency  Such a possibility does not seem to pose an insurmountable  obstacle, though  I would suggest that, as a rule, the minutes relate information  available from the close of the prior meeting to the close of the current meeting   Thus, the description of an intermeeting conference call would be included in the  minutes of the next regularly scheduled meeting  If the Committee wanted to ensure  the continued timely release of information, it could acknowledge a meeting held  outside its regular schedule in the subsequent policy announcement     Because the experiment stopped short of actually releasing the statement early, it   remains unclear how much increased scrutiny more-timely minutes will receive or  how members will adjust their editing behavior  It is also unclear how the public will  react to the inclusion in the minutes of conditional statements, such as heightened  interest in certain key data releases or the possibility of an intermeeting conference  call  That said, the minutes do not often include such conditional statements   Moreover, when they do, they tend to expand on statements already made public in  the Committee policy announcement, implying that the information content of such  conditional statements in the minutes would seem to be limited     On the last exhibit, I’ve listed three possibilities for today’s meeting  As one   possibility, the Committee could vote today to expedite the release of the minutes  If  so, I recommend beginning expedited release with the minutes of the February 2005  meeting and adopting a schedule of releasing the minutes of regular meetings three  weeks after the day of the policy decision  By beginning with the February meeting,  the decision would be noted in the minutes of today’s meeting, which would be  released soon after the February meeting and thus give the public advance notice of  the new policy  Adding a few days to the schedule by releasing the minutes after  three weeks would give staff more time to draft and participants more time to  comment  Such a schedule would also position the release in the middle of the week,  which would be less likely to cause difficulties  You might alternatively decide that  the experiment has not been conclusive enough and decide to extend it  If so, I  recommend shifting to a three-week schedule because it seems more sustainable   Lastly, you might not have liked what you saw in the experiment or feel that the risks  are too great to establish the precedent of early release  If you do stop the  experiment, I recommend continuing approximately the same production and internal  distribution schedule so that the minutes are prepared while the memory of the  meeting is still fresh    December 14, 2004 72 of 118           About one thing I am sure  If you decide to expedite the minutes, you will be  setting a precedent that will make it hard to go back to lagged release if the results  prove disappointing  In such procedural matters, you have tended to go forward only  if a preponderance of participants supports the change  To facilitate your discussion,  I have asked President Poole and Governor Kohn to make the case, respectively, for  maintaining the status quo and for expediting the minutes  So I first turn to President  Poole       In the last several paragraphs, which bear only on the policy decision, a   statement refers only to comments made by members  Before that, in the discussion of the outlook,   the minutes reflect the entire go-around, so it includes all participants at the table   December 14, 2004 89 of 118             In the material Debbie circulated last week, the proposal was to make   the distinction sharper by talking about members and other participants in the earlier section  But,   again, when it comes to who voted on the policy decision, it’s only members     It is nineteen     In trying to actually write down what was the oral tradition, we did find   that not everybody agreed on what it was  One thing was clear  As the Chairman said, the last two   paragraphs essentially are viewed as explaining the vote of the Committee  Hence, in those   paragraphs, the “members” we talk about are the members of the Committee     The problem is if you want to represent everyone’s views in the   discussion of the economy several paragraphs earlier and you refer to them as “members”  Then   you’ve used the same word to describe two different sets of people     Yes  Unfortunately, it turned out that the rule was that anyone in the   discussion was called a member up to the last couple of paragraphs, and then only members were   called members in the last couple of paragraphs  That seemed to be an unsupportable inconsistency    We didn’t want to exclude nonmembers’ characterizations of the economy and the risks to the   outlook, and one way to do that would be to call them “participants”   SPEAKER(?)  Can’t you call the group in the last few paragraphs voting members?     I was rapped on the knuckles by Joe Coyne fifteen years ago on exactly   that point  The membership of the Committee is twelve people, and there is no such thing as a   nonvoting member     We’re quite happy to do that, yes   SPEAKER(?)  That’s what he’s proposing     That’s the proposal     So up to paragraph 21, or whatever paragraph number it is, if you   express a view you’re a participant in the meeting  If you express a view that is included in the last   couple of paragraphs of the minutes, it’s there because you are a member     One possibility, Mr Chairman, is basically to pick up the language that   you, in fact, voted on  “The Committee voted unanimously to begin expedited release of the   minutes with the minutes of the February 2005 meeting and to maintain a schedule of releasing the   minutes of regular meetings three weeks after the date of the policy decision”  I would also suggest   that we put more detail, in terms of a paragraph or two, in the minutes of this meeting, so that   market participants will know what is coming  You will have precluded the possibility of a leak,   and market participants will get more explanation at a later date     We could release these minutes in three weeks, if you so direct  I   thought there were certain advantages to having a paragraph or two explaining why the Committee   made this decision and giving details of how the Committee would do this going forward before   those in the market actually got the first release     Not if you say it isn’t  [Laughter]     I did want to make clear the distinction between “participants” and   “members”      We thought of making a little index card that we could hand out to Fed   watchers  [Laughter]  "
5566,2005-03-22,"2  Carol Low will be handing out copies of my presentation   As can be seen in the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the expected trajectory   of Federal Reserve tightening now steps up considerably more steeply than was the   case at the time of your February meeting  In part, this movement is an example of   how words can matter  Chairman Greenspan’s testimony, along with other remarks   by Federal Reserve officials, apparently led market participants to ratchet up their   policy expectations and made them more suspicious of the current pricing of long-  term assets  With this fresh look on asset returns, along with higher prices of oil and   other commodities and a couple of faster readings on overall inflation, the 10-year   nominal Treasury yield moved up to 4½ percent and now looks less like a conundrum   than it did in mid-February    The information gleaned from options prices, plotted at the right, indicates that   market participants think the funds rate will most likely be 3¼ percent going into   your August meeting, but they see outcomes as decidedly skewed to the upside  The   implied volatility of money market rates, plotted in the middle left panel, moved off   its unusually low level of early February, suggesting a bit more uncertainty about   your future actions    Some more detail about the actual day-to-day volatility of the staff’s measure of   fed funds rate expectations might be helpful in thinking about your communications   strategy The blue bars in the middle right panel plot the average absolute daily    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                      March 22, 2005 72 of 116  change in the expected funds rate at horizons from three months to eighteen months  ahead, observed from the fall of 1998 to the fall of 2003  The red bars do the same  calculations for the past year and a half The point I take away is that the relatively  explicit nature of the Committee’s guidance about its policy outlook has anchored  near-term market expectations but has had no material effect at horizons of one year  or beyond That is, the market still adjusts to news bearing on monetary policy but  does so through changes in further-ahead expectations   How you feel about that observation will most likely color your views on how the  Committee’s statement should evolve over coming meetings  For some of you, the  reduced volatility of near-term expectations evidences an improved alignment of your  own and market participants’ expectations that reduces the uncertainty confronting  investors and allows them to better plan for the future  Others may hold the view that  the elimination of near-term uncertainty has encouraged excessive risk-taking and  leveraging—perhaps best embodied by the “carry trade” that so preoccupies the  popular press—and may be seen as limiting the range of possibilities of your future  action   As can be seen in the bottom panels, financial conditions showed mixed changes  over the intermeeting period, as the ratcheting higher of corporate yields in line with  those on Treasuries was accompanied by about unchanged equity values and modest  depreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar If you believe that these  financial conditions are likely to be consistent with relatively favorable  macroeconomic outcomes in coming quarters—perhaps (as in the top panel of exhibit  2) along the contours of the Greenbook forecast for resource slack and inflation—you  would presumably want to deliver the policy path currently built into market  expectations What you’re expected to do is firm ¼ point today and signal that you  believe you will continue marching the funds rate higher for some time thereafter,  which is what we tried to convey with alternative B in the Bluebook   As can be seen in the middle panel, a nominal funds rate of 2¾ percent would fit  within the range of recommendations for the second quarter from the policy rules that  we routinely track And the resultant real federal funds rate, the solid black line in  the lower panel, would move closer to model-based estimates of its equilibrium  value   Of course, a 50 basis point hike in the funds rate today would make up twice the  distance to the red band of estimates of the equilibrium rate, but you might not favor  such a move for two sets of reasons  For one, market participants would be caught  unawares, and you might be concerned that they would conclude that the Committee  had discovered itself behind the curve and build in expectations of additional 50 basis  point hikes that could significantly constrict financial conditions or roil markets  For  another, you might not see the need for a brisker pace of policy tightening at this  time Resource slack probably still remains, and pressures on inflation—although a  bit more intense of late—have mostly been held in check                                   March 22, 2005 73 of 116  Thus, issues for today’s meeting would seem to be what you anticipate doing at  the next few meetings, and, working backwards, what that implies for the language of  the Committee’s announcement today  Your answers to those questions, in turn,  depend on how far you think the funds rate is from neutral  The top left panel of  exhibit 3 provides a longer perspective on the path for the federal funds rate currently  embodied in financial market prices  Judging from futures quotes, you’re expected  ultimately to bring the funds rate to 4¼ percent  That is about the same answer we  get from a multifactor model attempting to explain the term structure of Treasury  yields, as plotted at the right   The solid line in the middle left panel plots the average response from the Blue  Chip Survey, which asked economists where they expect the three-month Treasury  bill rate to be six to ten years from now  Their answer—4½ percent—is only a bit  higher than that inferred from financial prices  The survey also reports the averages  of the 10 highest and the 10 lowest responses—plotted as the dashed lines—out of the  50 or so economist participants  The wide span covered by the survey responses  underscores the range of views about the destination of your current tightening cycle   Those of you who identify relatively more with the respondents in the bottom  quintile likely foresee pausing in the process of firming sometime soon  Working to  reinforce that opinion would be the belief that recent higher inflation readings are  largely transitory In that regard, it is true that businesspeople have talked more of  late about passing higher costs through to their customers and hinted about renewed  “pricing power” However, as shown in the middle right panel, fairly consistently  over time (and for longer than the sample plotted here), the share of the small  business respondents to the NFIB survey reporting plans to increase prices has moved  closely with real oil prices You might interpret that correlation as suggesting that  anecdotes are heavily influenced by pressures posed by higher energy costs and may,  as Governor Bernanke noted, be a feature of intermediate goods and services rather  than an independent source of inflationary impetus  In that regard, you might take  comfort from the fact that five-to-ten-year-ahead inflation compensation inferred  from Treasury yields (and plotted as the red line in the lower left panel) is up only  modestly and remains well off its 2004 peak  With longer-term inflation expectations  well contained and resource slack apparently being worked down slowly, the  Committee may see relatively little cost in continuing along a path of gradual removal  of policy accommodation  That may incline you to choose the words of your  statement so as, at the least, to keep market participants from marking up their  expected path of tightening or, perhaps, even rotate that path down, which is what we  tried to do with alternative A in the Bluebook   Some others on the Committee, however, might look at this same chart with  trepidation Since early February, near-term inflation compensation has risen about  ⅜ percentage point and longer-term compensation is up about 10 basis points  This  could be taken as a palpable sign of inflation jitters that should be dealt with promptly                             March 22, 2005 74 of 116  and forcefully, perhaps leading you to tighten 50 basis points today or to toughen the  words of your statement so as to warn investors of such a possibility in May  (In that  regard, such a decision might reflect a view of long-run outcomes for the short rate as  being more likely than not at or above the Blue Chip average)   Even if you had a benign point forecast for inflation over the next two years, such  as the Greenbook outlook for core PCE inflation shown as the solid line at the lower  right, you might not view the outcomes on both sides of that central tendency with  equanimity  And the width of the fan chart surrounding that forecast suggests that the  odds of a different outcome are sizable  If inflation runs on the high side of the staff  forecast, you may well have to pick up the pace of firming and work hard to contain  inflation expectations, even as financial disruptions become more possible  In  contrast, with the momentum of aggregate demand well entrenched, inflation falling  short of what is currently expected could be dealt with more readily  At first market  participants would unwind some of the anticipated restraint already embodied in  financial prices, giving the Committee some time to calibrate its setting of policy  through its communications  Some members may believe that projecting a more  forceful sense of resolve now might lessen the risk of an adverse outcome by helping  to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored  We tried to accomplish this with  alternative C in the Bluebook, which introduced resource slack as a concern and  asserts that inflation pressures have intensified   A common slur about economists is that they are drab and colorless  Not so  This Bluebook set new records for the varieties of hues used for fonts The best  example of this is repeated as your next exhibit, which was in a box in the policy  alternatives section Over upcoming meetings, the Committee likely faces five key  issues concerning its statement language  First, as noted in the markup of the  February FOMC statement, you will need to determine whether the characterization  of the stance of policy—marked in red—should be modified in some way  Second, as  noted in blue, the FOMC may need to revise its assessment of the pace of underlying  productivity growth in light of the realized and anticipated slowing in actual  productivity growth Third, the assessment of inflation and inflation expectations—  noted in green—may need to be revisited  Fourth, as marked in purple, the  Committee may wish to remove the “measured pace” language at some time  This  might be the case if the Committee judged that a pause in the process of removing  policy accommodation might be called for or, alternatively, if it determined that  economic circumstances could require a more rapid policy adjustment some time  soon However, eliminating the “measured pace” language without a replacement  would leave the risk-assessment paragraph without a signal about the future direction  of policy That omission raises the fifth issue—noted in orange—regarding the  balance of risks assessment   For reference, the last exhibit repeats the table of alternative statements that staff  circulated in the Bluebook with a few changes reflecting comments received since  publication Two design principles served as the basis for alternative B First, it                                   March 22, 2005 75 of 116  seemed important to highlight the Committee’s watchfulness about inflation   developments  Hence, the rationale paragraph points out that inflation pressures have   picked up, with this latest draft a bit tougher on that score than the earlier version   Second, it seemed important to remind people that keeping the risks balanced may   take some effort  Hence, the assessment of risks is explicitly conditioned on an   appropriate path for policy The Committee has accompanied its six prior tightenings   with an assessment of balanced risks, so observers must by now have inferred that it   was based on an appropriate policy However, I must admit that explicitly stating   that conditionality will limit the usefulness of this form of the risk assessment in   signaling the direction of future policy moves    But you may believe that the useful shelf life of this language has already passed   In the Bluebook, alternatives A and C offer an alternative formulation of the risk  assessment that could work now or in the future  Both drop the “measured pace”  language—in alternative A because it seems to rule out a pause any time soon and in  alternative C so as to signal a faster pace of firming—and adopt a risk assessment  based on an unchanged policy for the next few quarters It may be premature to adopt  such language now, but having a discussion about such a possibility might be the first  step in the process    You can’t use it to signal the direction of rates So if it stands in   isolation—that is, if there are no other statements providing guidance in that portion of the   announcement—you won’t be telling market participants anything particularly useful  A risk   assessment based on appropriate policy would only be unbalanced if you thought, first, you were   behind the curve; second, if a shock came that was so large and sudden that the lags in monetary   policy did not allow you to offset it; or third, if there were a particularly large skew one way or the                             March 22, 2005 76 of 116  other So, the question is Is it news to put this clause in the paragraph?  I guess I’d have to argue   that it really isn’t, because how could you have been tightening six times off a risk assessment that   was balanced, unless it was implicitly conditioned on appropriate policy  The suggestion in the   Bluebook was to make that conditioning explicit because, at this particular point, it would emphasize   that it takes some work to keep the risks balanced  But I did want to flag to you that if you go in that   direction, at some point along that road you are not going to be happy with the statement    I think we put that in there because later in the statement you do say that   underlying inflation is expected to be contained, and it seemed necessary then to provide at least   some offset to the concern expressed earlier about pressure on inflation having picked up                                               March 22, 2005 77 of 116   Yes    Mr Chairman, not that I’d like to reopen alternative B, but I was   wondering in paragraph 5 whether or not it would be appropriate to refer to “appropriate monetary   policy” rather than just “appropriate policy” because it’s obvious that not many of you believe that   either fiscal or trade policy is likely be appropriate anytime soon  "
5615,2005-05-03,"It’s a question we can answer, Mr  Chairman  The thing I would note is   that GM is a smaller component of the BBB index than it would be of the high-yield index    However, you would be taking something that already looks like a high-yield out of the BBB   universe In any event, we can look into that for you  "
5616,2005-05-03,"2   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials  that were distributed during the coffee break    Market participants see today as another step in your journey of removing policy   accommodation  As shown in the upper left panel, futures prices and survey   responses indicate that a ¼ point firming today is a lock, as is the retention in the    2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                                          May 3, 2005 73 of 116  statement of the judgment that the risks to both of your objectives are balanced   Some doubts, however, have surfaced about whether the “measured pace” language  will survive the day One in four of the respondents to surveys by the Desk and by  Blue Chip think not   Market views about your action today were essentially settled by your March  statement  As the solid line in the top right panel shows, the May federal funds  futures contract has traded at about 3 percent over the entire intermeeting period   But investors also apparently understood that your actions in coming quarters  depend on economic prospects, as they revised down the funds rate expected at year­ end (the dotted line) about ¼ point—or about as much as the staff has assumed in its  baseline   Some of the twists and turns of that path owed to Committee statements  As can  be seen in the middle left panel, the announcement released after your March  meeting was viewed as hawkish about inflation and prompted the largest swing in  the two-year Treasury note yield in the window surrounding 215 pm in the past  year (the red bar) Some of that was taken back by the more nuanced description of  your deliberations provided in the minutes of that meeting released three weeks later  (Note that only the last three pairs of bars cover the new regime of expedited  publication of the minutes)   As can be seen by the bars in the upper of the two panels at the middle right, the  two-year yield rose in the windows bracketing major economic data releases, as  increases following data on faster-than-expected consumer price inflation more than  offset the changes sparked by spending, production, and employment releases with a  surprisingly soft cast That latter information, along with well-publicized problems  at a few prominent corporations and declines in equity prices, soured market  sentiment about the vigor of the economic expansion  And as can be seen in the  panel just below, intraday movements in the two-year note yield were highly  correlated with those of the S&P 500   As shown in the lower left panel, equity prices shed 2½ percent on net over the  intermeeting period, and risk spreads on debt instruments widened  Triple-B yields  (the solid line in the middle panel) edged lower, but speculative-grade yields (the  dotted line) actually rose With the value of the dollar appreciating slightly on  foreign exchange markets (the lower right panel), financial conditions likely  tightened on net   If you believe that these financial conditions—which are predicated on market  expectations of policy action today and more to follow—will preserve satisfactory  economic expansion while containing inflation, you probably would be comfortable  with moving the federal funds rate to 3 percent this afternoon  No doubt, the staff’s  assessment of the economic outlook, as summarized in the upper panels of exhibit 2,  has moved in an unsatisfactory direction, with the output gap, at the left, narrowing                                                           May 3, 2005 74 of 116  more gradually than in the previous forecast, and core PCE inflation, at the right,  running along a slightly higher path This fits the bill of an adverse supply shock,  likely at least in part the product of sustained higher oil prices In effect, higher  inflation—and probably upside risks to inflation—act as a constraint limiting how  fast slack can be worked down As a result and as many of you have noted, the  policy menu available to you looks dourer than it did six weeks ago   In that brave new world of diminished possibilities, a ¼ point increase in the  nominal funds rate would help prevent an erosion in the real funds rate (as the result  of the upcreep in inflation and perhaps short-term inflation expectations) and might  even close a little of the distance of the actual real rate (the solid line in the middle  panel) with estimates of its equilibrium (the swath of red)   Taking as given the wisdom of the crowd about policy expectations, the issue  isn’t whether you will tighten by ¼ point, but whether you will signal a slower,  unchanged, or quicker pace of firming going forward in the words that accompany  that action The staircase plotted in blue in the bottom left panel considers a future  in which you tighten 25 basis points at upcoming meetings for as far as the eye can  see That path is not built into markets  The expected federal funds rate (the dark  solid line) veers to the south of the staircase and flattens out, implying the  expectation of an end to this cycle of firming  Looking at the readings along the  vertical line denoting year-end, an expected federal funds rate of 3½ percent adds up  to two more ¼ point increases in the final five meetings of 2005    The same structure of expected funds rate can be described as averaging over  different branches of the probability tree in which the Committee tightens ¼ point at  each meeting until it stops for good  The distribution of stopping times, given at the  lower right, shows that current futures quotes are consistent with ¼ weight given to  the funds rate being on hold starting in June and a six-in-ten chance prevailing that  you will be done at some point before the end of this year   The arguments for pausing sometime soon are laid out in exhibit 3  In particular,  as seen by the position of a nominal federal funds rate of 3 percent plotted as the  solid line in the upper left panel, standard policy rules mostly call for something  south of that target As shown in the two panels at the upper right, policy rules agree  that the nominal funds rate this quarter should be higher than the average of the first  quarter You’d be more comfortable with a funds rate at the level of 3 percent if  your inflation goal is a 1½ percent annual increase in the core PCE (the upper right  panel) than if your inflation goal is 2 percent, as noted directly below   Holding the funds rate at 3 percent for some time would have added appeal if  you viewed spending as potentially prone to a negative confidence shock that could  spill over to financial markets, perhaps as spelled out in one of the alternative  simulations in the Greenbook that turns out to be a favorite of Governor Gramlich   As shown in the middle panels, in that simulation the unemployment rate ends the                                                   May 3, 2005 75 of 116  forecast period 1 percentage point higher than the baseline, and core PCE inflation  moves back into the territory where “unwelcome disinflation” was once a serious  concern Moreover, a signal that policy would be on hold might not provoke  particular concern on the part of market participants given that employment  compensation (the lower left panel) remains subdued and inflation expectations (the  lower right panel) generally seem well anchored   For some of you, such reasoning may sound uncomfortably like an echo of  arguments made 30 years ago, just at the point where people around this table made  serious mistakes  Core PCE inflation, the solid line in the upper panel of exhibit 4,  is running well above the central tendency of your forecast for this year made just  three months ago  And at 5¼ percent, as in the middle left panel, the unemployment  rate is within spitting distance of most estimates of its natural rate  In addition, as at  the middle right, productivity growth has slowed, perhaps suggesting that less  restraint on unit labor costs will be provided in coming quarters  With such an  outlook, you might be justified in wanting to pick up the pace of firming sometime  soon   Indeed, as shown in the bottom panel, both the spot price of West Texas  intermediate crude (the solid line) and far-ahead futures prices for that resource (the  dotted line) have moved up decidedly, implying that more of the “excise tax” an  import-dependent country such as ours must pay is permanent, presumably to the  detriment of spending and the economy’s potential to produce and posing the risk  that inflation expectations will pick up Putting greater weight on the reduction in  supply associated with this run-up in energy prices—which includes both a possible  deterioration in inflation sentiment as well as longer-run effects on potential  output—presumably would incline members to want to project a firmer stance of  policy   A useful starting point for your discussion of the policy statement might be the  one you issued in March, which I have included as exhibit 5 In previous meetings  and in comments on the early drafts of potential statements I distributed last week,  some of you expressed a clear preference for eliminating forward-looking language  from the announcement  It is important to recognize, however, that the forward- looking content comes in two flavors, one explicit and one implicit  The Committee  characterizes its future policy action in the next to last sentence, which is typed in  red This is a relatively explicit message, in that the Committee forecasts both the  direction and the likely pace of its future action The implicit forecast is typed in  blue As long as you assert that policy is accommodative against the backdrop of a  generally positive depiction of the economy, readers will infer that you intend to  raise rates over time   This opens up the two possibilities for altering the statement to enhance your  flexibility that were discussed under alternative C in the Bluebook You could be  asymmetric and trim the explicit description of your future action—the red-typed                                                May 3, 2005 76 of 116  language about “a pace that is likely to be measured”—but leave the part where you   describe policy as accommodative  Readers will likely view that change as giving   the Committee the scope to tighten more quickly than previously expected    Alternatively, you could excise all guidance, both the red and the blue, on the notion   that the changes would indicate symmetry about the possible paths for policy    Whatever may be the merits of a statement that does not restrict your range of   future action, the current situation may make you willing to tolerate the status quo   for a bit longer The expansion probably seems less vigorous and more uncertain to   you now than it did six weeks ago, and you might be concerned that an adverse   market reaction to an asymmetric statement without the “measured pace” language   could further dent the economy’s momentum  But despite the recent hesitancy in   spending and production, you’re likely to view a 3 percent nominal funds rate as still   accommodative  Thus, it risks misleading the public to remove that sense under a   symmetric approach to eliminating forward-looking language If you share that   appraisal, you probably would favor, even if reluctantly, alternative B of Table 1,   which is repeated for convenience as the last exhibit     It’s material that was in the last Bluebook, and it is repeated again in this   one, where we talk about the changes in forward-looking inflation compensation  In fact, the   inflation swap market developed mostly in Europe  That’s where the market is deeper, in part   because in Europe apparently there are participants on both sides of that trade—mainly utilities that   have legislated rates and, therefore, are willing to pay for getting that protection   In the United States, the volume of trading has increased over the last year or so, and we do   think that it is a useful market  One mystery in that market, which still prevails, is that at least at the   front part of the TIPS yield curve and the inflation swap yield curve, there’s a bit of an arbitrage   opportunity Dealers we talk to say that, yes, they know it exists, but to exploit it would involve                                    May 3, 2005 77 of 116  basically exploiting their customers, and they are reluctant to do that while the market is still limited;   it hasn’t deepened enough    I would note with some irony, Mr Chairman, that in the December 1999   memo that introduced the balance-of-risk language, it was taken for granted—I think this was on the   first page—that draft language for the statement would not be circulated before the meeting because   it had the potential to stifle the discussion at the meeting  So, the views of the Committee have   changed in this regard I would say it’s an open issue of where the pendulum is now relative to   perpendicular I welcome everybody’s comments  I look forward to those e-mails  And one   possibility, if there’s enough interest, is that we can figure out when to have a Committee discussion  "
5703,2005-09-20," Another point I would make, Mr Chairman, is that the contract   allows you to make delivery of any securities maturing between 6½ and 10 years  The Chicago   Board of Trade has a set of adjustment factors that are appropriate when the yields are at 6   percent  And if the yield curve were flat at 6 percent, any of those securities maturing between   6½ and 10 years would be perfect substitutes  So any small movement in the cash market would   immediately mean that you could bring in another security to make delivery  But yields in that   sector are well different than 6 percent now, so the cheapest-to-deliver security is more distinct    And you can get more movement in the cash market without it spilling over to the next security   or the security after that  So in that sense, the natural arbitrage that the basket of deliverable   securities is supposed to provide is not working as well, because the adjustment factors by which   the settlement price is multiplied are out of kilter with the prevailing level of yields    Right And they used to trade May Maine potato futures when there   were no potatoes in Maine in May [Laughter]  "
5704,2005-09-20," There are two aspects of the TIPS market that make it hard to do such   comparisons using those securities  The first is that we think there were significant liquidity   effects, as in the United Kingdom, early on  Our estimates of the liquidity premium have come   down a lot That is, TIPS were a real bargain in the first two or three years of trading, and it is   only now that they probably more closely reflect the macro environment   The second thing is that what we measure is inflation compensation, and inflation   compensation is inflation expectations plus an inflation risk premium And the inflation risk                   September 20, 2005 22 of 117  premium could vary over time  Indeed, our models would think that part of the reduction in   long-term rates has been a reduction in the inflation risk premium  So that’s another reason why   it would be hard to read those as predictors of future inflation    I think you actually alternated your requests—asking each one of us   in turn—and we haven’t updated that in a long time  "
5705,2005-09-20,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the material  that Carol Low is now passing around  And out of deference to Governor Bernanke,  I’m going to start reading before everybody has a copy of the material   As Dave explained, there is a lot going on underneath the newly revised green  sheets, as the effects of higher energy prices and the disruption of Hurricane Katrina  shift the timing and composition of GDP growth over the next few quarters  As is  unfortunately familiar, such a supply shock confronts central bankers with unpleasant  choices, as you have to weigh the benefit of a potential policy offset to near-term   softness in spending against the cost of adding impetus to inflation  By my reading,  however, investors do not share your pain As can be seen in the top left panel of  your first exhibit, market participants apparently interpreted the confluence of events  over the past six weeks as reason to mark down the anticipated path of the funds rate  as much as 30 basis points  While you are expected to tighten today, the market is  betting, on net, that only one more action will mark the conclusion of the measured  removal of policy accommodation   This reduction in expected policy restraint was associated with inflation  compensation moving higher (as shown in the top right panel) and longer-term   nominal yields dropping more considerably (as shown by the 10-year yield plotted at  the lower left) The fact that equity prices posted an increase on balance and  corporate risk spreads remained thin would seem to suggest that investors believe that  the anticipated path of monetary policy, together with fiscal policy stimulus, will be  sufficient to cushion the adverse effects of Hurricane Katrina on aggregate income   and production, albeit with you accepting a little more inflation   The staff’s assessment, summarized in exhibit 2, differs somewhat  In light of the  effects of the hurricane and other news over the intermeeting period, the staff  trimmed its forecast of real GDP growth in the second half of this year (plotted in the  upper left panel) but boosted it in the first half of 2006 as destruction gives way to  reconstruction The outlook for core PCE inflation, given in the second column of the  table in the upper right panel, is a touch lower this year than was anticipated in  August in light of another favorable CPI report but noticeably higher in 2006 as  higher energy costs are passed through into core prices   The bottom four panels offer one perspective on the policy choice confronting  you today—an optimal control exercise, using the version of FRB/US with investors  who are assumed to foresee policy outcomes correctly  The blue solid lines in the  four panels plot the paths of key macro variables under the Greenbook outlook, given  a policy trajectory chosen to minimize a loss function that weights equally   2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                 September 20, 2005 87 of 117  unemployment and inflation gaps and that also puts a small penalty on interest rate  volatility The red dotted lines report the same exercise, excluding the estimated  effects of Katrina on confidence, energy prices, and overall inflation that are  embedded in the baseline forecast  As can be seen, the simulations produce nearly  identical paths for the nominal federal funds rate (the middle left panel)  Essentially,  the Katrina effects temporarily boosting inflation (the bottom right) lower the real  federal funds rate (the middle right) enough to damp the swing in the output gap (the  bottom left)  Thus, the advice coming from the model is to proceed on the path for  policy that you had envisioned before the hurricane’s landfall   Exhibit 3 addresses that policy choice a little more colorfully  The official title of  the Bluebook is “Monetary Policy Alternatives,” and we certainly delivered on that  this time  [Laughter] We included only two explicit policy alternatives A, in which  there is no change in the funds rate; and B, in which it is increased 25 basis points (as  noted in the column headings of the table)  In the associated draft statements, we  assumed that you would not want to send a strong signal about future action  But we  also considered descriptions of how you could signal more conviction about the  future path—either that it would involve a prolonged pause, A-, or a more substantial  ultimate extent of tightening, B+, which is the difference between the “sure” and  “unsure” subheadings   In the Bluebook write-up, we assumed you would continue with the “measured  pace” language, as in the heading of the first row  But recognizing the greater  uncertainty about the economic outlook, we also included a box describing a new risk  formula (the middle row) and the dropping of all guidance (the bottom row)  Three  rows by four columns produce 12 alternatives for the statement—a new Bluebook  record [Laughter]   We paid more attention to the familiar formulation of alternatives A and B for a  reason that would not surprise any viewer of C-SPAN over the past week—stare   decisis As was explained during Judge Roberts’ confirmation hearing and is  summarized in the middle panel, stare decisis translates to “let the decision stand”  and holds that it is proper to adhere to precedent and not unsettle things that are  established Justice Frankfurter noted that it “embodies an important social policy  that represents an element of continuity and is rooted in the psychological need to  satisfy reasonable expectations”   That sentiment favoring delivering the expected has been repeated often in this  room—not in Latin and not always in English either  [Laughter] As shown in the  bottom left panel, market expectations have settled on roughly a 90 percent weight on  a ¼ point firming today  As the right panel relates, primary dealers predominantly  believe that today’s statement will retain the key features of the prior ones, including  describing the Committee’s intention to continue removing monetary policy  accommodation at a measured pace                                September 20, 2005 88 of 117  Some arguments for alternatives A and B are presented in exhibit 4, which begins  with those two Rorschach tests for policymakers—the behavior of the real federal  funds rate relative to the range of estimates of its equilibrium (at the left) and of the  nominal federal funds rate relative to the range of predictions from policy rules (at the  right)   You might favor holding the nominal funds rate at 3½ percent today if you  viewed the real federal funds rate (the solid line at the left) as close enough to its  neutral value to afford you some time to assess the effects of cumulative policy  firming and the near-term dislocations associated with Hurricane Katrina  The fact  that the current nominal funds rate at the right is within the range of recommendations  from standard rules might provide you some confidence in the decision to pause  today In particular, the information that accumulates over the next few weeks might  be seen as particularly revealing about the serious downside risk that the disruptions  in the Gulf region will sap household and business confidence  In that regard, the  preliminary reading on consumer confidence from the Michigan survey plotted in the  middle left panel might be taken as a warning flare  Although that drop was not far  from staff expectations, a deeper and more pronounced slide would be troubling  One  example of the adverse possibilities is the “sentiment slump” scenario in the  Greenbook, which shows the unemployment rate (graphed as the dotted line in the  lower left panel) moving up about ½ percentage point above the baseline (absent a  monetary policy response)   Those favoring alternative B probably see less chance that the outlook will clarify  materially in the next six weeks, in part because economic data are likely to be  contaminated by hurricane effects for months to come  And as for those two upper  panels, the real rate may have risen considerably, but our models suggest that it is still  likely below its equilibrium level  A constant 3½ percent nominal funds rate may  now be consistent with most policy rules but it will not be for long, as the green  envelope of rate recommendations moves upward over the next year   The case for alternative B might have been strengthened by another element of  the Michigan survey released on Friday As plotted in the middle right panel, one- year-ahead inflation expectations (the solid line) spiked higher and even the much  less volatile longer-term expectations moved north of 3 percent  In particular, this  might have served as an unpleasant reminder of the “deteriorating inflation  expectations” scenario in the Greenbook, in which, as at the bottom right, core  inflation remains above 2½ percent through the end of next year   Whatever your choice of policy rate, market participants believe, as I already  mentioned, that the rest of the statement will follow the path laid out in the 11 prior  ones In exhibit 5, I provide draft statements should you want to deviate from that  route, presumably because you view the uncertain economic outlook as rendering                                      September 20, 2005 89 of 117  forward-looking portions of the current statement no longer appropriate  The upper  panel accompanies the policy choice of alternative B with a risk assessment explicitly  conditioned on maintaining the current stance of policy for the next several quarters   Should the macro fundamentals play out as in the Greenbook, output growth is more  likely to exceed that of its potential than fall short of it and inflation more likely to  increase than decrease at an unchanged funds rate  Given that the output gap is  already quite thin, neither outcome would seem to be acceptable to the Committee,  thereby sending the signal that the funds rate is more likely to rise above 3¾ percent  than fall bellow it   This formula follows the convention since May 2003 of describing the uncertainty  about both of the Committee’s goals  Such a formula lacks the nuance possible from  writing the statement afresh each time  But experience suggests that the freshness  date of the statement passes by very quickly given the Committee’s reluctance to  change wording that market participants seem to obsess over  This simple, albeit  coarse, formula also might solve the governance issue of how 19 people can agree on  the key attributes of a statement in a limited time   The bottom panel is silent about the possible path of the funds rate by dropping  the risk assessment and the description of policy as being accommodative  This  version satisfies the test of simplicity, but something may be lost in its economy   These probably are considerations for another day  I bring them up now, however, to  remind you that as the real federal funds rate moves higher into the region where  reasonable people can disagree about whether policy remains accommodative, the  time when you will have to deal with the statement’s structure comes closer   The last exhibit provides the latest draft of Table 1 from the Bluebook  This  version of the table incorporates a few changes from what you saw in the Bluebook   The first is stylistic in that, on re-reading, the last sentence in the paragraph  addressing the effects of Hurricane Katrina on energy prices seemed repetitive  And I  think that has been fixed The other two changes are more substantial, at least from  the perspective of the geological time over which the statement evolves  For one, the  characterization of policy accommodation as “remaining” in the last sentence, as  proposed in the Bluebook, was not in the August statement and has been struck  For  another, longer-term expectations are “contained,” not “well contained” as described  in the August statement  Both changes were made in light of the run-up in inflation  compensation and higher readings on inflation expectations  That concludes my  prepared remarks  "
5749,2005-11-01," We have a cottage industry, Mr Chairman       What we do is take the energy futures curve, take the weight in the CPI—    Actually, Governor Ferguson saw something very similar just this week    I guess the answer is that you do have a need to know, and you will!    [Laughter]    In previous episodes, increases in spot oil prices had brought the spot rate   well above the longer-ahead futures rate, which implied that market participants were expecting   inflation compensation to be going down because of the anticipated decline in energy prices    Relative to those episodes, this time around the curve is relatively flat, so you don’t have that  And   it’s a more permanent effect  It affects the very near-term part of the curve, but it’s a relatively   small weight in the total                                                  November 1, 2005 7 of 114   Mr Chairman, there is also conversion risk  That is, a sovereign   government at a later date could limit what its currency could be used for  Witness all the capital   controls in the ’50s and ’60s    So, in principle, if you’re guaranteed the payments in dollars, you know   you’ll get dollars rather than reals that perhaps couldn’t be used for as many things later on    Mr Vice Chairman, the expected funds rate in April, which is a fairly   clean reading on the March meeting—is about 5 or 6 basis points above 4½ percent  So that puts a   25 percent probability of action there  "
5750,2005-11-01,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the materials that  Carol Low is distributing   Over the intermeeting period, market participants marked up their expectations of  your coming actions, as seen in the drift upward of Eurodollar futures rates in the top  panel of the first exhibit  The rate for contracts ending this year, the black line, and  next year, the red line, rose 40 and 50 basis points, respectively  Three factors  apparently came into play  First, the economic effects of the spate of hurricanes this  fall seem less momentous now, at least to market participants, than they did on  September 20, the date of your last meeting  Essentially, a portion of the worries  about the economy that lowered rates in advance of the September meeting was rolled  back  Second, data releases, on net, were read as evidence that the economy had  considerable momentum in advance of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina  And third,  many of you expressed concerns in public about inflation risks, and those statements  were taken as a warning of more tightening than previously anticipated   The net result was to shift up the path expected for the federal funds rate, plotted  as the solid black line in the middle left panel, by ⅜ to ½ percentage point relative to  that prevailing before the September meeting, but by only ⅛ to ¼ percentage point  relative to the August meeting  The funds rate is now anticipated to peak at about 4½  percent in futures markets, which is a touch below long-run expectations of the funds  rate suggested by the Blue Chip survey  As shown in the middle right panel, the  surveyed economists see the terminal funds rate at around 4¾ percent  That same  survey, however, suggests that economists pitch a pretty big tent, in that about 50  percent of their responses span a range from 4¼ to 5¼ percent   This ratcheting higher of policy expectations was associated with a tightening of  financial conditions more generally, seen in the bottom panels as the rise in longer­  2 The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                                                                     November 1, 2005 80 of 114  term Treasury yields, decline in stock prices, and appreciation of the foreign exchange  value of the dollar   If you are worried that this financial market reaction was overdone, thereby  imparting too much financial restraint, you might favor holding the intended funds rate  at 3¾ percent today—the subject of the left-hand panels of exhibit 2  As noted in the  first bullet at the top and in the middle panel, the staff forecast of the growth of real  GDP for 2006 has been marked down over the course of the year  You may see  reasons why this might happen again—say, because the economic dislocation from the  hurricanes could be larger than expected or because household spending could sag as  real estate values stop escalating, or even decline, and as consumer confidence, plotted  in the bottom left panel, sinks further  If so, the shock in financial markets in reaction  to alternative A would certainly realign market expectations lower  Indeed, even if  you viewed inaction today as likely to be merely a pause in the process of firming, it  might be difficult to convey that to the public, making it likely that the rotation  downward in rate expectations could be considerable   More probably, you’ll find the arguments for tightening ¼ point—in the right hand  side of the exhibit—to be more compelling  In particular, as the top bullet point and  the middle panel relate, you might view the upward drift in the staff’s inflation  forecast for 2006 over the course of the year as signaling that the risks to the price  outlook are on the upside  A number of you have noted at previous meetings that  inflation was running on the high side of your comfort zone, suggesting that the  prospect of any further rise would be especially unwelcome  In that regard, you might  consider the pickup in the Michigan Survey responses of near- and longer-term  inflation expectations, plotted at the lower right, as evidence of such an unfolding  dynamic   A ¼ point firming might be seen as sufficient at this time to keep inflation  contained, as long as it was expected to be followed by at least a few more moves  going forward  The difference between alternatives B and C in the Bluebook hinges  on how many more tightening moves you see in your future—which could be  conveyed by the language of the statement  With the aid of exhibit 3, I’d like to cover  some of the same ground as President Yellen, but more colorfully, if I say so myself  [Laughter]   This exhibit takes as a starting point the statement issued in September  Among  the pertinent questions are   1 Is productivity growth still robust (the red text)?  2 If the nominal funds rate moves up to 4 percent, will policy still be   accommodative (the green text)?   3 If policy remains accommodative, are you likely to remove that accommodation   at a measured pace (the blue text)?  4 Is there an appropriate path of monetary policy that will balance the risks to   your dual objectives in the face of a supply shock?  (By now, I’ve used up much of my  color palette—but I think it’s the purple text)                                                                November 1, 2005 81 of 114  I would remind you that, even if you do not want to address some of these  questions this afternoon, the passage of time could ultimately force you to do so  An  earlier, rather than later, dialogue about these issues would provide the opportunity to  use the minutes to forewarn the world of changes in language that has been unchanged  for so long that the public might be forgiven for thinking it was carved in stone   Exhibit 4 provides some perspective on these questions, starting with the table at  the upper left listing the four-quarter growth of output per hour over the past few  years The 4 percent growth rate of productivity in the third quarter pulled the four- quarter change to 3 percent  While the FOMC statement refers to underlying, not  actual, productivity growth, this performance may well make you comfortable  retaining the “robust” characterization  In that regard, as can be seen in the chart at the  upper right, the private-sector economists in the Blue Chip panel continue to see  output growing at better than a 3 percent pace in the long run, an assessment that has  been essentially unchanged over the period the Committee has asserted that underlying  productivity growth has been robust   As for assessing the degree of policy accommodation, the middle panel shows that  bringing the nominal funds rate to 4 percent would place the real funds rate at the  midpoint of the range of the staff’s estimates of its equilibrium level  There are three  reasons, listed in the bottom left panel, why you might think that describing policy as  accommodative is nonetheless appropriate, beyond Governor Kohn’s gutting the word  of any meaning  [Laughter]   First, you might believe that the staff is underestimating the vigor of aggregate  demand, perhaps because we’ve penciled in too big a drag on consumption from  higher energy prices and an as-yet-unobserved slowing in home-price appreciation  If  so, your personal estimate of the equilibrium real rate of interest would be to the north  of that plotted in the chart  Second, you might believe that the real rate should be  calculated based on a forward-looking proxy for inflation expectations, not the  backward-looking four-quarter actual core inflation rate used in the chart  If you also  believe that an inflation scare has pulled expected inflation above its recent pace, then  the real rate lies to the south of that plotted here  Third, the gap between estimates of  the equilibrium real rate and its actual level may not be an appropriate measure of  policy accommodation at all  Mechanically, the staff calculates the equilibrium real  rate by determining, within a given model, the level of the real rate that would close  the output gap in about three years  You might view the path of the output gap in the  transition to its ultimate closure as unlikely to unwind current pressures on inflation or  maybe even as consistent with pressures building for a while  That is, if you waited  three years’ time to close the output gap, you might not like the inflation rate likely to  prevail then    The chart in the lower right panel showing the recent jump in energy prices is a  reminder that you might label the current set of forces impinging on the economy as a  supply shock  As the textbooks tell us, a supply shock confronts monetary                                                       November 1, 2005 82 of 114  policymakers with unpleasant alternatives, as it tends to weaken aggregate demand  and put upward pressure on inflation  In such circumstances, there might not be an  appropriate path of policy that balances the risks to your dual objectives  That is, you  might have to accept—and relate to the public in your statement—unbalanced risks   Exhibit 5 presents four alternatives for the language in the relevant part of the  Committee’s statement  As in the top panel, you can limp along at this meeting with  the current wording, reassured by the fact that this would likely preserve something  close to the current path of expected future tightening, because few market participants  anticipate any change   As in the second panel, you can get out of the business of characterizing the degree  of policy accommodation by describing the change, not the level, of the funds rate   Thus, you could say that “   policy firming can continue at a pace that is likely to be  measured,” which implicitly admits the possibility that you may have to impose policy  restraint, on net, to check inflation  This could establish the precedent of providing  guidance by writing a fresh characterization of the odds of your likely future action at  each meeting, appropriately conditioned on the economic outlook  I know that I  discourage easily, but I’d like to point out that this was exactly what you were doing  with the addition of the “measured pace” language in May 2004  But if the policy  outlook does not change materially from meeting to meeting, fresh language can get  hardened pretty quickly   As in the third panel, you can replace the current risk assessment with a formula  based on an unchanged stance of policy, thus providing a coarse signal of your likely  future action My argument for tilting at this windmill one more time is that such a  formula both provides some transparency about your intentions and should simplify  the process of the Committee coming to closure on the language of the statement at  each meeting  In my view, prior efforts to find a satisfactory formula to provide  guidance about your future policy intentions ran aground because most proposals were  too ambitious by incorporating assessments of levels and changes of the Committee’s  dual objectives  A simpler formula—perhaps even couched in terms of interest rates  rather than the Committee’s goals—is more likely to last  If it is not specific enough  on some occasions, you’ve got the rationale part of the statement and the minutes to  provide a more nuanced view   The fourth panel would be appropriate if you wanted to scrap the risk assessment  entirely However, reflecting on the discussion of the Committee and its succession of  subcommittees on this subject over the years, I think those of you who prefer the  simplicity of this alternative may be tilting at your own windmill  By my count,  enough members seem to believe that there is some role for words in narrowing  market uncertainty about your future action to make such guidance a durable feature  of the statement for some time to come   It has been a feature of my briefings for what seems to be a long time to remind  the Committee that a discussion of your communications policy is warranted  I now                                                 November 1, 2005 83 of 114  know the wisdom of the maxim from the “Monkey’s Paw,” “Be careful what you ask  for, you might get it”  Because you have spent some time discussing the issue, the  minutes will have to address the topic   It is also pretty clear that this conversation will continue in December  To inform  that discussion I propose circulating a survey fairly shortly to probe your views on key  principles governing the statement of the sort Governor Ferguson discussed  My goal  is to get back to the Committee before the December meeting with a summary of the  results to make it easier to find the middle ground among the various views that have  been expressed   For your convenience, the last exhibit updates Table 1 from the Bluebook    Relative to what you saw there, we’ve taken comments from some members that I   think simplify the discussion of the outlook in rows 2 and 3     I think it’s a governance issue for the Committee to decide  I was   presuming that you would continue to vote on at least a portion of the statement, the part that   contains the forward-looking language  But it is an open issue why you vote only on a part of the   statement and not the entire document     What the Committee voted on has changed over time Initially, starting   February 4, 1994, the statement issued was explicitly the Chairman’s statement describing what the   Committee did Somewhere about a year and a half later that characterization was dropped, and it   became less clear whether it was the Committee’s statement or the Chairman’s statement  By 1997   or 1998, market participants generally viewed it as the Committee’s statement  Most of the people   sitting around this table, I think, viewed it as the Committee’s statement   When we last rethought what the Committee voted on, it seemed important to bring into the   statement the forward-looking guidance, the risk assessment portion, and that’s why we did that    So, it has evolved  I assume that it will evolve again if you change the basic structure of the   statement    The main one, which has been reflected somewhat in the conversation   already, is that it’s hard to know what inflation expectations are  We don’t have a consistent proxy   over the entire period And it’s not obvious that if you took the entire sample and estimated your   model using measures of inflation expectations that you necessarily would have a different gap right   now because you would not only change the actual expected real funds rate, but you’d also change   your estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate                               November 1, 2005 85 of 114   Among other things, the staff inflation forecast is judgmental and need not   be accepted by the Committee  I think computationally you’re talking about something, if you   wanted to go to the FRB/US model, that would be difficult to do and—    Let me also say, President Moskow, that the passage of time is helping in   terms of providing other measures of the equilibrium real funds rate  We now have indexed debt   quotes We use them to back out an estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate  We don’t have a   long enough time series to know its properties as, say, a predictor of aggregate demand or inflation    Over time, I would think that would become a more standard feature of our analysis, although this   analysis is done in Dave Stockton’s area, and I wouldn’t want to commit his resources  [Laughter]    In talking about market reaction to potential statement wording, you’re   getting as far from economic science as what we do here, and that’s pretty far  It is hard to say, and   maybe I’ll ask Dino to help here, too  But our presumption was that using the “firming” word   would send a signal that you envision not stopping at what you think is the neutral rate but going   above that, and so market participants would raise their sights for how much you would tighten    But that’s only a guess, and that’s the guess we put in the Bluebook    I guess I would like to make a couple points about that  When you think   about the language, the characterization of “accommodation” and the “measured pace” are linked    So if you were, for instance, to take out “accommodation” while leaving in something about   “measured pace,” that would signal that you’re going past the firming now anticipated  On the   other hand, if you left in “accommodation” but took out “measured pace,” market participants   would probably view that as an indication that you want to pick up the pace of tightening—that is,   start doing 50 basis points   The other thing I would like to mention is that this proposal really is, in a sense, “back to the   future” The Committee at one point did signal its intentions about the possible future direction of   its next action in the form of the directive  And the experience back in 1998, when the directive   became part of the Committee’s statement, was that market participants didn’t deal with the                          November 1, 2005 87 of 114  conditional nature of that directive very well  If you were leaning in one direction, they tended to   just slam into that corner  So the purpose of the old balance of risk language was to step back from   there by talking about the Committee’s goals  So, those are all among the things that the Committee   would have to consider in framing new statement language    I really didn’t want to promise too much in my prepared remarks    The sequence I envision is first surveying you on general principles  Are   you comfortable with putting in forward-looking language?  If there’s forward-looking language,                         November 1, 2005 88 of 114  would you prefer it to be about interest rates or the risks to your objectives?  There are differences   of opinion on a number of those basic questions  Then once those survey results are collated—to   see if there really is a middle ground or if there are a couple of distinct alternatives that lend   themselves to these questions—I’d send a document around    No The one in my briefing material is—    This has the semicolon  [Laughter]  The latest version is the one in the last   exhibit of the handout that was distributed just prior to my briefing  "
5840,2006-01-31,"  Mr Chairman, may I make three points?  The first is that I would   underscore what Dino said  A great event study occurred when the prudent-man law in the United   Kingdom changed, and you saw longer-term yields fall as a result because pension managers had to   go out further on the curve     Around 1998  Second, as you know, in the discussion with the   Treasury, we actually tried very hard to convince them to go to thirty and then to go beyond  But   that’s a very slow-moving boat  Third, real long-term securities are very convex in return  So just   because of the arithmetic of the yield curve, you would think that the fifty-year yield should be   below the thirty-year, as the thirty-year is below the twenty-year  So in an environment of   uncertainty about future yields, it isn’t that surprising     In fact, the yield curve is a competition between two factors in   uncertainty  Because of uncertainty, the term premium itself should march up at approximately   linearly in maturity     But convexity is a quadratic and starts about at the twenty-year maturity   pulling down yields  That’s why typically the thirty-year yield is below the twenty-year yield    When you get out to the fifty-year, then the effect of convexity is even more pronounced     Sure  For instance, when the United Kingdom first issued a fifty-year   security, we priced what a fifty-year maturity would be in the United States  And it was well below   the thirty-year and not that dissimilar to what actually happened  So partly it is just that, because   bonds are in price and that’s what people care about but we quote yields, the effect of convexity is   going to pull down longer-term yields     As soon as we have a new Chairman, which is subject to action by the   Senate, signature of the President, and a notation vote by this Committee, I will send a memo   around providing the time of the next meeting  As the agenda is not yet set, I am not quite sure   what time it will start  "
5841,2006-01-31,"3  3The materials used by Mr Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the material that  Carol Low handed out during the coffee break  Judging by the information derived  from money market futures plotted in the top panels of your first exhibit, this seems  likely to be another of those meetings in which the important part of the discussion is  about words, not the upcoming deed  As can be seen from the bars in the top left  panel, market participants put near a 100 percent probability on a ¼ point firming  today and high odds on a like-sized move at the March meeting  Both those  probabilities were marked up over the past seven weeks, partly on apparent increased  pressures on costs, what with oil and other commodity prices surging and the foreign  exchange value of the dollar weakening, and—unfortunately—on market  commentary that was taken as having an inside track on your policy choices  The   January 31, 2006 66 of 106    expected federal funds rate, plotted in black in the top right side, now moves  modestly above 4½ percent this spring before turning down late this year     Market participants apparently have bought into the notion that, with inflation   impetus a bit more intense, the Committee will want the real federal funds rate, the  solid black line in the middle panel, more assuredly in a range that is not associated  with policy accommodation  What market participants do not seem to have bought  into is the idea that you’ll act like the hypothetical policymakers described in the  Bluebook  The paths for the nominal and real federal funds rates, derived from an  optimal control exercise using the version of the FRB/US model endowing  policymakers and financial market participants with perfect foresight, are shown in  the bottom panels  The solid and dotted lines are the policy prescriptions under  inflation goals of 1½ percent and 2 percent, respectively  With actual inflation and  the FRB/US measure of long-run expected inflation now running around 2 percent,  policymakers can hold the nominal funds rate steady and allow the real funds rate to  drift lower to achieve 2 percent core PCE inflation in the long run To induce enough  resource slack to work toward a 1½ percent inflation goal, however, policymakers  would have to raise the nominal funds rate to about 5 percent     Market participants see you steering between those two paths for a while—  probably for some combination of three reasons  The first two explain why—even if  your goal for inflation is 1½ percent—you might be less aggressive than in the  corresponding simulation  For one, market participants may see less near-term  pressures on inflation than in the Greenbook and its extension  For another, they may  believe you’d tolerate inflation toward the high end of that range, in part because of  the perception that you would be unwilling to create economic slack deliberately to  achieve a different outcome  Instead, they may think you are willing to wait for some  opportunity in the future, when a negative shock pulls inflation down  And the third  is a reason that—even if you were aiming for inflation of 2 percent—you might be  tighter than the corresponding simulation  In particular, market participants may  believe that your policy choice will be shaped by considerations about risks that  deterministic simulations cannot capture  For example, you might be satisfied with  inflation around current levels, if it were ensured, but be asymmetrically concerned  with regard to its being higher rather than lower  Thus, you might tighten more than  the 2 percent goal simulation as insurance that inflation does not move higher     If, like market participants, you see yourselves operating in the range between the   two paths called for by the optimal control exercises, you most likely would be  willing to tighten ¼ point today and place high odds of doing so again in March  The  two chief wording issues that follow from that decision are listed at the top of  exhibit 2  First, how high are the odds you place on tightening at the March meeting?   In writing the Bluebook, we thought you’d want to preserve the current configuration  of financial market prices, which appears to be based on a 70–30 split on tightening  versus no action in six weeks  Thus, in the portion of the statement language of  alternative B listed in the bottom left, we offered the sentence, “The Committee  judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the   January 31, 2006 67 of 106    attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in  balance”  We thought that this wording gives a strong presumption that policy will  tighten once more but not the certainty that makes many of you uncomfortable  From  what I’ve heard today, I would suggest tweaking that verb phrase to dial down the  market’s perception of future action by removing the word “well”      The second question is, How strongly do you want to underscore that coming   decisions depend on incoming economic data?  We thought that the last sentence of  the December statement, also repeated in the bottom left panel, provided sufficient  assurance on that score  Indeed, this layout seemed to have the attraction of  expressing a back-up strategy in which you would deviate from the anticipated policy  path if events dictate  We also thought that you’d want to make as few changes to the  language as possible today  An alternative is to reverse the order of the last two  sentences, as is done at the bottom right  “The Committee will respond to changes in  economic prospects as needed to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic  growth and price stability  In these circumstances, the Committee judges that some  further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to those objectives  roughly in balance”  Note that the first sentence now describes the baseline  assumption, not a contingency plan  This wording is similar, but not identical, to  language circulated by President Poole  It shares his reordering of the sentences but  does not repeat the “measured policy firming” phrase on the logic that the Committee  may want to free up expectations about action in March  During the policy  discussion, it would be helpful if you would focus some of your remarks on the two  questions I have raised      With the help of exhibit 3, I now turn to my standard procedure in closing to   hector the Committee on some point of governance  The issue, as I explained in my  memo of January 25, is that the statement released this afternoon will likely be only  partly covered by the Committee’s vote  The responses to the survey I sent around  earlier indicated significant support for voting on the entire statement but that a  minority was decidedly opposed  Those opposed are primarily concerned that  requiring members to agree on all the words in the statement may make it more  difficult to reach a consensus  In addition, the public may be confused if a member  dissents, not because of disapproval of the policy action but because of distaste for  the words characterizing the action  Moreover, FOMC participants arguably have  more leeway now to offer views to the public differing from those in the statement  than would be the case if the entire document had the Committee’s seal of approval       Those favoring a formal vote on the entire statement hold that all its aspects,   including the description of the economy, are important in shaping market  expectations about the future path of policy  In that view, it may be a good thing that  the formal vote constrains how members subsequently describe the rationale for  policy action to the public, as it would send a more consistent message about the  prospects for policy       January 31, 2006 68 of 106    These arguments suggest that FOMC participants may want to consider three  alternatives listed in the exhibit  (1) Vote on the entire statement and the directive   (2) Vote on the directive and assessment of risks, as now  But to clarify ownership of  the remaining portions of the statement, the Committee could also vote to authorize  the Chairman to provide a rationale for that action  (3) Retain the status quo, perhaps  with the issue to be raised again at a later date under the next Chairman     The two bottom panels present the formal vote for alternative B should you   prefer, respectively, option 1 or option 2  (The language for option 3, as always, is in  the Bluebook)  Students of this institution probably believe that the statement is  partly owned by the Committee and partly by the Chairman  For the rest, what is  issued at 215 pm on the day of decision is a Committee document  Thus, some  people would view option 1 as delimiting the Chairman’s authority, while others  would view option 2 as rolling back the Committee’s authority  It would seem best  that such suspicions not be harbored about the new Chairman by resolving this  governance issue today if option 2 appeals to you—that is, voting only on the interest  rate, not the rationale, portion of the statement and granting the Chairman an explicit  authority to craft the rest  If, instead, you prefer to vote on the entire statement, then I  would suggest putting off option 1 to another day—so as not to risk creating a  misimpression about your intent     One such opportunity might be the March meeting  Ben Bernanke has asked me   to relay that he prefers that the next meeting run for two days—Monday and Tuesday,  March 27 and 28—so that you can discuss the best way to organize future Committee  discussions  The Secretariat will send around formal notice about the logistics of this  meeting as soon as possible, subject to a notation vote by this Committee naming a  new Chairman  Some supporting documents for the two-day meeting will then  circulate during the intermeeting period     Your last exhibit repeats table 1  I should note that we changed the “smoothing”   language that few of you favored  Instead, the rationale portion opens, “Although  recent economic data have been uneven”       In these simulations, long-run inflation expectations evolve very   gradually based on the path of actual inflation  So what happens is in the 1½ percent simulation you   January 31, 2006 69 of 106    start off with inflation expectations of 2 percent, and you have to experience inflation below that to   work it down     The reason for Monday–Tuesday was that you probably already had   travel plans that got you into DC on Monday, whereas having to extend to Wednesday might pose   more of a hardship  But it was viewed as just for this meeting  "
