  Mr Chairman, I think two other points might be added  One is that it is  true that predictive [error] values are very large on almost any result you choose in a very short  run  We only went as far as two months here, which lowers the predictive errors in most cases   If you went a length of three, four, five months, your predictive errors would smooth out even  more  I mean they would get smaller, that’s one point     No, it would mean, for example, to use an extreme case--if next month  you increase nonborrowed reserves $100 million in the expectation that money will grow 5  percent, and [instead] it grew 10 percent, then the following month you increase it $100 million  because you still think it will grow 5 percent and it grew 2 percent, then I think it would average  out over a long period If you were persistent in this nonborrowed reserve relationship, that’s  what it would mean        3/29/76 - 14 -    The second point I wish to make is that these are relationships based on an econometric fit,  as Mr Kalchbrenner mentioned, and do not make any allowance for any efforts the staff would  make judgmentally to allow for the special factors     That, I judge, is why Governor Holland was asking to do this  experimentally    I was avoiding that--     I believe, for example, that all through the year we underestimated the  decline in CDs, but we [didn’t underestimate] them as badly as these equations are  underestimating them  So, judgmentally, we would have been closer because we would have  had to take account of our experience     It simply relates the commercial paper rate and personal income to the  demand for money, and the federal funds rate determines the commercial paper rate  Those lags  affected--     This was a bad year     Probably wouldn’t hit the target if you had them as a target  And given  the margin of error, I wouldn’t know—     Also, Mr Chairman, before that period, you begin to get interference  from the change to lagged reserve requirements  There’s a noticeable institutional change in  1968     Yes, they are, Mr Chairman, and within a matter of three weeks or so,  well after the next FOMC [meeting], we are going to come before the Board [of Governors] with  a proposition  Because of that, we ran some of the same tests that President Eastburn is  mentioning, and because of the proximity of [this] meeting, accelerated them, and they did show  within the sample period the same results  That is, comparing running these results with  contemporaneous accounting as against a two-week lag; with a two-week lag your results got  worse on the order of 25-30 percent, [unintelligible] percentage annual rates of growth--errors in  percentage annual rates of growth     However--I must mention this and just to further confuse things in a way and I’m sorry to  do it--but if you then go outside the sample period but still before lag, and outside the sample  period but still within the contemporaneous period, and outside the sample but still lag, then the  results fall apart again and it’s not so clear  That is, outside the sample period, the  contemporaneous accounting did no better than the two-week-lag accounting, and I have not  been able to explain that result  Within the sample period--what you would expect, the  contemporaneous accounting did much better     That’s correct  The period outside the sample period was in each case  one year, and the sample in one case was run six years, and in the other case seven  But in each  case there’s one year outside the sample period  And that’s been our experience  These things  just break down outside the sample period     With very little consistent predictive value, that’s right     If I might answer Governor Partee  If you had the same federal funds  rate constraint, in my opinion, you’ll miss nonborrowed reserves in exactly the same way that  RPD has missed; there will be very little difference  That is, they’ll be outside the range with  exactly the same frequency     Well, you’re asking me over a two-month period  On the basis of these  results I would say no, but certainly, over a longer period, I don’t believe the Committee operates  this way  But if the Committee operated over a longer period on a nonborrowed target, I believe  it would [perform] better than a federal funds rate  I believe that I would be able to improve on  these results judgmentally, but I cannot tell you how much without making that effort  But I do  believe that, judgmentally, I could improve considerably on the results Mr Kalchbrenner has  presented     Well, I meant in my own mind something quite mechanical, Mr  Chairman I meant that, if the Committee said it wants to increase M1--just put it in an extreme  way, 6 percent over a six-month period--I believe that we could set a nonborrowed reserves path  which has a better chance of attaining that than if we said this federal--     3/29/76 - 19 -      Well, that’s why I said it’s not a practical point    It could reconvene and reassess and continue on     If you are asking me as a technician, “Tell me how to get 6 percent, six  months from now”--     M1 growth     I believe that I could do it better by telling you what nonborrowed  reserves to hit than what federal funds rates to hit  And the only reason I believe that is because I  would not have to predict GNP; GNP would not be as strong an element in that factor  However,  I might add, again, since I have great confidence in Mr Gramley’s predictions of GNP, it might  in practice mean that I could do it very well with the federal funds rate     Well, I think by extension you would     Well, I think that question, Governor Coldwell, is a question of, if I put  down a nonborrowed [reserves] number, and it may be right or wrong, whether that number is  obtainable That is a question you may want to address to Mr Holmes  I should think, within--     Yes, I thought that’s what Governor Coldwell was asking     3/29/76 - 20 -      Because I can put down a nonborrowed reserve number, and I’m  believing nonborrowed reserves is controllable  Whether it is in fact controllable within the  margin that the subcommittee addressed, I think is an empirical question  I myself would say  that, over a month, you’d need broader ranges than the plus or minus $50 million  But I do  believe it is controllable within some reasonable range, and over a six-month period there would  be offsets  I mean you’d miss this way and miss that way     That’s why I keep talking about the long run, Governor Coldwell     Mr Chairman, if I might take a try at one other way, and again putting it  in a slightly extreme phase  Suppose--     Yes     3/29/76 - 21 -      Suppose the Committee does have a long-run target of a 6 percent  increase in M1, and then it meets and says [that in the next] two-month period--a normal two- month period--it [still] wishes M1 to grow at 6 percent, and the staff provides a nonborrowed  reserve number which we believe will attain that  It turns out that M1 grows at 9 percent  The  Committee meets again and says “I still want M1 [to grow at 6 percent]”  If the staff tells the  Committee that, based on past experience, it thinks that [the previous change in M1 was] within  the range of error, then there is no reason [for the Committee] to change its attitude toward the  increase in nonborrowed reserves  You’re not going to get another 9 percent [increase in M1]   Indeed, you might get a 6, you might even get a 3  And therefore, the staff says, if you want to  stay on the 6 percent path, then increase nonborrowed reserves by the same amount that you  increased it at your previous meeting  Then it will probably turn out that you’ll get 3 percent in  M1 the next time  You begin averaging--it will average out     The evidence for that statement--it’s not here, and we’ll ask Mr  Kalchbrenner if I’m right or wrong--is that, if you averaged out over a period of more than the  one or two months we had here, if you averaged out over a period of four or six months, I believe  the error would be a lot less than the 09     Well, that I don’t know     In my mind, President Volcker, the only way I would be able to work it  down into my own mind is a matter of choice  But in the first models, what you have entering  strongly is that some proxy in relation--     The monthly and the Shadrack Skinner  What enters into those two  models are either personal income or business sales  So they depend essentially on the GNP  projection as per an important interval  And if the GNP projection is wrong, they will be wrong     So in the nonborrowed reserves equation, the unpredicted element--I  mean the element that we can’t control--that enters is interest rates generally  I mean, given  nonborrowed reserves  To use a technical term, the elasticity involved, the interest rate--in a  nonborrowed reserve [equation], the interest rate variable has less power, so to speak, in  influencing the result, than the GNP variable has in the other two equations  So if you believe  you’re going to make big errors in projecting GNP, you’re better off with your reserve equations,  and if you believe you’re not, then you can work very well on your money market conditions,  and I would not quarrel with that result     That is correct  They are based on actual GNP  We have not tested  them with the GNP as we thought we knew it then, which would be a reasonable test to run   SPEAKER(?)  It sure would     Well, I don’t think we have any problem in controlling the federal funds  rate  We have some problems in market reactions when we move it and none in controllability     In terms of controllability, I don’t think there’s any question that the  federal funds rate is controllable  The question of controllability entered in [as], of the reserve  measures, which is the most controllable?  And the most controllable in my mind is the  nonborrowed base  And the second most controllable is the nonborrowed reserves     That’s right  That means you don’t have to predict currency  But it  might be viewed [as producing] somewhat more money market distortion, and you have big  movements in currency relative to the politics   SPEAKER(?)  As you know, accounting costs     Well, there’s room for dispute in all this  I think you are going to get  projections differences between the Desk and the Board’s staff in all of this, as you do now  And  looking back at that period, it looked like we didn’t change the federal funds rate  Your average  nonborrowed reserves would have been $100 million higher over the five-week period than the  target level we constructed  On the subcommittee’s guideline, plus or minus $50 million, that  hadn’t been widened, [so] the Desk would have the choice of tightening up a little bit now or  waiting awhile in order to see if maybe, with a little luck, our required reserves would drop later   So, while, [on a] literal reading early in the period we might want to tighten up a tick, it would  also [be an] option to wait another week or so  And by [that] time [if] you were still $100  million off on your projections, then you might not have very much option left if the range were  still plus or minus $50 million     That’s the question of judgment, but the aggregates projection was  actually below the midpoints of the ranges     I think it would take at a minimum two months or more  I think it would  have to be very carefully worded  I believe you would have to face the problem, Mr Chairman,  of why we missed the RPD targets  And I think to a great extent it would be because the  evidence would show that the Committee chose to adhere to the federal funds rate constraint  rather than the RPD target     What the evidence will show--     Mr Chairman, do you also want us to include an appendix in the  Bluebook giving the nonborrowed reserve measures that might be consistent with the  alternative--     3/29/76 - 39 -      --plus their relations to other reserve measures--plan to include their  relation to total reserves and the base?     I had a tabulation prepared on certain noted measures  I was not able to  work this four-month to the average, as yet  I could expand that and make that available at a  later point     Before four weeks is up      President Black, we would suspect that the internal [cash] flows remain  very strong relative to business need  But we expect needs for funds to creep up relative to  internal flows, so that while we don’t have a large financing gap developing later this year and in  early ’77, we do have a financing gap developing  And we would expect it to be reflected more  in short-term borrowing than in any pickup in long-term borrowing, that is, we would expect  long-term borrowing to stay about where it is or perhaps come down some because a lot of  restructuring of debt has been done     We would expect the rising short-term borrowing to put some additional pressure on  banks, reducing the banks’ ability to buy government securities, shifting some of the need to buy  government securities over into the nonbank public and also increasing banks’ issuance of CDs   Those two factors are putting generalized upward pressure on short rates and also, by extension,  on commercial paper, so those would be the underlying credit shifts that we believe would  accompany the projection of rising short rates, given our assumption [unintelligible]     That’s correct, President Eastburn  And we made an analysis of the  weekly reporting banks vis à vis the others, and things have been much less weak at the  nonweekly reporters     Governor Partee, it’s not entirely beyond the projection period because  we did have more strength in M1 in the week of April 7, for example, which is affecting our  required reserves in the week of April 21  That’s one of the weeks that’s throwing Mr Sternlight  off his path     As a matter of fact, for most of the five-week period, Mr Sternlight and  I were carrying on a conversation of what you would really do if you had nonborrowed reserves,  and we were debating whether you would raise it early or wait  And that was the nature of the  debate, and if you are actually on a nonborrowed reserve target for an average period, that is  innate in that the Desk always has the option as to whether to operate early or late   SPEAKER(?)  Maybe your estimate of nonborrowed was just wrong   SPEAKER(?)  That’s possible     Mr Chairman, I believe we have done some work on the relationships  between the two-month zone of tolerance  [In] this  intermeeting [period, the] nonborrowed  [reserves] target ] and the plus or minus $50 million that the Subcommittee on the Directive  recommends appear to us to be consistent with a zone of indifference of about 2 percentage  points on a two-month period     Yes, that would be right  The transitory component, the random  variation so to speak, is considerably less as the time period lengthens     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Yes sir  The Treasury, Mr Chairman, is planning to announce its mid- May refunding on Wednesday, April 28  About $4 billion of publicly held debt is maturing, and  I believe the Treasury plans to raise about--well, their plans are obviously indeterminate--it will  probably raise about $1-1/2 billion to $2 billion in that financing, so that would be a financing on  the order of magnitude of $5 billion to $6 billion  The auctions, if they are auctions, will be held  in the first week in May  Perhaps Mr Holmes has something to add to that     No, mid-May refunding     Well, Mr Chairman, I would believe that if the Committee were to  move in that slightly tightening direction, it might be desirable to have a slight indication of that  in the market before the auction is set, that is, before May 3, 4, or 5, in order to be fair to the  bidders in the auction and also to be fair to the Treasury in setting the terms of the issues     4/20/76 - 37 -             Well, that would be April 28     But that’s fairly flexible     To drop it, I believe, Mr Chairman      I am going to be discussing that at some length     Sir, I’m not going to be putting a precise magnitude on that     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     I’m afraid, Governor Coldwell, that I can’t--     Is your question, if we had a total M1 plus US government deposits?     The April rate of growth of 15-1/2 percent--my initial thought three or  four weeks ago was that maybe 6 to 8 percentage points of that can be attributed to government  deposits  If that were true, I believe that May would have had close to a zero growth rate  So if  it’s temporary it should come out [unintelligible]  Because May seems to be growing at about 8  percent--which I am beginning to believe is something like the underlying  growth rate--I find it  very difficult to argue that any of the increase in the April M1 had anything to do, except  fortuitously, with government deposits     It puts me in a most uncomfortable position, because I then have to believe that people  who received a transfer of funds out of government deposits in April realized at that point, but     5/18/76 - 36 -         not sooner, that they had drawn down their cash more than they should have over the preceding  several months and are [now] just holding onto it  The analysis forces me into that direction, so I  almost think that the rate of increase over the past four months in M1, which I think is on the  order of something like 7 percent or more, is about the underlying rate of growth  And  movements in government deposits on average had very little effect on that  It had an effect on  month-to-month movements but not on average       No, I have no reason to believe that  The Treasury has not so indicated  when we have talked to them     I have not heard of any deliberate effort to be slow  Whether  inadvertently there is any slowing, the credit for that would be quite modest     They were slow in sending to Treasury or slow in sending out?   SPEAKER(?)  Slow in collecting taxes     Slow in collecting taxes--yes, that’s right  But we’ve come some way   We’re in about the middle of May, and we should have seen a sharper decline at some other  point right now     I don’t think the increase in the $2 bills could have affected the April  rate of growth in the money supply; it was quite high, on the order of 16 or 17 percent at an  annual rate  And that annual rate of growth could affect the money supply on the order of   [unintelligible]--that part which is above normal that affected the money supply by maybe 1-1/2  percentage points at an annual rate  But I don’t think that the above-normal part can be  attributed to the $2 bills in terms of money supply because I assume that most of the people who  took the $2 bills are probably holding $2 less in demand deposits; maybe they are not, but $2 less     5/18/76 - 37 -         of some other deposits--it doesn’t come, as it were, out of thin air  So I don’t believe there has  been a substantial or even a very significant M1 or M2 effect      That offsets about 5 percentage points on the currency growth rates,  1 percent on the money supply growth rate     I don’t think that would help  Even if it were relevant, that wouldn’t  help explain the behavior between ’74 and ’75 and ’76  But secondly, I personally don’t believe  the behavior of the volumes in the federal funds market has very much to do with the money  supply--the behavior in the sense that you are talking about  I think the demand for money  relates to other variables, and the behavior of the federal funds market is, as it were, a  distribution mechanism for credit flows within the banking system  They’re in two different  worlds     The RPs--I see what you mean  The federal funds, the bulk of the  federal funds transactions, yes, that is in that figure  But not all are interbank     5/18/76 - 38 -           No I think there, on the other point, if you want the analysis of  corporate RPs as an alternative to holding demand deposits for a short while--that’s the sort of  thing [unintelligible]   SPEAKER(?)  I thought you were referring to interbank transfers     We have been working and will continue to work on trying to refine the  demand-for-money functions by not only the aggregate but by sector, and one of the things we  consider in the corporate sector as an alternative to demand deposits is clearly the RPs--the  overnight funds     Purchased from thrift institutions?     By corporations?     Yes     Most of those groups are not important holders of money supply  Of the  groups, only the corporations are important holders of money supply, so for only the  corporations would it be extremely important that the availability of the federal funds type of  investment would be an alternative to cash  The others are very trivial in our money supply  figures     We will look into it     I believe we are going to get a report on that in our next survey on  noninterest-bearing time deposits  We will [not] have back-data, but we will have some sense of  how they trend     I believe it is because currency--     I would have to check it against our normal relationships between  currency and GNP, but currency is generally rather more sensitive to movements in GNP than  demand deposits are  We have a special factor in April that accounts for some of it--but the  underlying strength in currency on the average of the last two or three months is indicative of the  strength in retail sales and GNP I can’t answer specifically whether it’s out of kilter  I think it is  well within the range of a reasonable estimate       If I may comment on that, Mr Chairman  As you know, we’re running  at each interval, and the time before this [the simulation implied] somewhat higher [actual than  targeted growth] rates for all reserve measures, and in this case, [a] higher [actual growth rate]  for nonborrowed [reserves] but much lower [ones] for  total [reserves and] the base     The point I’d like to make in addition to those Mr Sternlight made is, if the Desk had  achieved the [lower] rates two months ago, we have no way of putting into the simulation what  actually could have been the case with regard to deposits in the current period; maybe rates  would have been somewhat  [higher], for all I know, or unchanged  It doesn’t necessarily mean  that they’re [lower] and again [lower], because we’re not able to get the feedback effect in      In addition, Mr Chairman, a mechanical failure recently did also affect  the fed funds rate because banks didn’t know their position or thought they had the wrong  position, [which] actually caused the fed funds rate to be higher probably than otherwise it would  have been       [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]       Well, Governor Coldwell, we do have increased business spending on  capital expenditures in the second half of ’76 compared with the first half of ’76, and we have a  larger increase in inventory accumulation in the second half of ’76 than in the first half  These  are somewhat larger than the increase in internal funds that’s occurring in that period, so on  balance, we have a somewhat greater need for net external financing on the part of nonfinancial  corporations  We believe that virtually all of this additional moderate external financing will  take the form of short-term business loans rather than a further increase in the relatively large  amount of long-term corporate borrowing that has now occurred     Of course, we could be wrong on several counts  We could be wrong on the added  inventory accumulation or the added spending; we could be wrong on the extent to which  businesses are going [to borrow short term]  We don’t believe they’re going to want to lock  themselves into relatively high long-term rates any more than they are now doing  We may be  wrong on that count, but the increase in business loans that were projected is really rather  moderate, well below the rates of increase of ’73 and ’74  But it does represent a turnaround  from the net declines that we were seeing in the first half of this year      Well, as I say, we have some increase in the net external need, so if you  keep the level of bond issues, you need something else to finance the increase in net external  need  We are assuming much of that comes in business loans  In addition, we are permitting  businesses as a group to add a little more to liquid assets, so some of it gets absorbed in the  liquid assets  As a matter of fact, we really are projecting a slight decrease in corporate bond  issues, so it stays pretty high but not a significant [unintelligible]      6/22/76 - 27 -             Well, President  Black, I would be the last person to claim that I feel 100  percent confident that rates will rise as much as we have in alternative B in the Bluebook, and if I  were going to put an error around it, I would put a plus 1/2 on the top and a minus 1 on the  bottom, something like that       Mr Chairman, the savings deposits, the other time deposits, did behave  in a sense a little differently than we had for these particular M1s--they remained relatively  stronger  But the savings deposit actually behaved about as we had thought, and there was an     6/22/76 - 39 -           outflow, and what didn’t behave as we had thought was the other time deposits that we’re  offsetting  And I would tend to agree that when you are in a period here of interest rates having  moved above Regulation Q ceilings, you get uncertainties on deposit flows, and that puts a little  more uncertainty on M2 and M1, but it’s a marginal matter   SPEAKER(?)  I think we may have accomplished my result whether we changed the  directive or not      Well, I’m going to have some comments on that at the time of my talk     Well, Mr Chairman, I guess I’ve never been a believer that you can go  from money supply growth to growth in GNP that mechanically  I would tend to analyze things  in terms of real effects that affect GNP, such as interest rates, markets, overall liquidity  And I  wouldn’t see anything in those developments that would be, per se, factors that would slow down     8/17/76 - 15 -    real GNP, and I don’t think we’re projecting this significant slowing  If it does occur, I think  that President Baughman is quite right  Monetarists will indicate that the cause was the slower  growth in money, that the lags have shortened considerably from the usual lags, and that this  further proves that the Federal Reserve is wrong in the way it runs policy  But I would not make  that connection at this point     Mr Chairman, if I may, in point of fact there was a very slow rate of  growth in the money supply from midyear-- from June as a base through the first month of 1976   That rate of growth was on the order of 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate, and since then we’ve  been growing at around a 6-1/2 percent annual rate  So if you pick these particular months as  kind of inflection points, you will notice a very definite change in trend     Yes, M1     [Statement--see Appendix]     We don’t have deposits in US branches abroad in our money supply  numbers, and I do not believe that transaction balances are to any significant extent kept there   Corporations may have some CDs in such branches, but then we don’t have CDs kept here in our  money supply numbers     It affects the time deposits from going into M2, we believe only in  August, and there will be something like a one-time diversion of funds  Maybe funds would  otherwise go into the [unintelligible] and maybe some little shifting out of actual deposits  And  then you’d expect to go back to a more normal rate of growth in other time deposits for  September, and that’s in effect what was done     We have a sharp rundown of about $3 billion projected in September   When a rundown of that magnitude last occurred, it was in April, and we had a very sharp bulge   We didn’t project it, and we’re not projecting such a sharp bulge this time  We’re projecting  growth only up to around 7 percent  So there is some risk involved, and maybe we’re  underestimating the impact  As I’ve said, we’ve run through various econometric models and  tests, and we’ve never been able to find a consistent significant relationship between the  Treasury balance and the money supply over a period of a month or two     In the first three recoveries of the postwar period--in the second [year],  [the] velocity increase for M1 was 41, 43, and 52 percent respectively  It was lower in  subsequent periods, and that’s roughly in line with what we’re expecting now  In the first two of  the postwar periods, rates rose, and in the third one they rose also, but by the eighth quarter we  were out of the recovery  The rises were modest, but the levels were much lower, so it gets into  the question of percentage versus absolute change     No, I think [unintelligible] so  But what was occurring in the early  periods, I believe, was an economization of surplus cash balances as you came out of the war   There was this trend economization of cash, raising the rates of growth of velocity in somewhat  the same sense that movements to other types of instruments for holding money-type balances  are affecting it now      On the Treasury bill futures, President Morris, we’ve been keeping track  of that market as its volume has grown  In the early days, it was a very limited market, and we  can report [on it] when it’s of interest  My impression most recently is that it’s not telling us  anything very different than reading [forward] rates out of the government securities market  proper  We have been keeping rather close track on it  And to the extent it can reveal  differences or trends, we will report back     I wouldn’t really expect any differences     Theoretically they should be identical  Sometimes there have been some  differences recently--     9/21/76 - 13 -       As the volume has grown and familiarity with the market has grown,  these differences [unintelligible] have tended to dissipate     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     We would expect that this 2 percent figure is lower than we are going to  have in the future  We would expect that, as economic activity picks up, interest rates will rise,  and people will economize more on money, and velocity will increase  And we’re projecting  [that] an increase in velocity through mid-1977 in V1 [velocity of M1] will be on the order of  4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent--which is somewhat more rapid than in the second year of expansion in  most of the previous cycles     Start out the month?     Well, I don’t, I’m not aware of successive lowerings of rates  My  memory of it is that we miss on one side and we miss on the other side but I’m not aware of a  steady--     Second half of the calendar, you mean?  Oh, well, that’s right  We have  examined our seasonals back and forth over several years, and that persists and so--     Well, I think President Winn is referring to the second half of the  calendar year having a slower growth rate, and we have not been able to find that our seasonal  factors are causing that result  We have examined it several times with the help of academic  experts and run many different seasonal adjustment programs--30 was the last count--of which  we made 10 available to the Committee, and virtually all come in with that result  So something  else is causing that, like policy changes coincidentally around that period     Well, I don’t know that I’d feel particularly better, President Baughman   I believe that if inflows persist at this rate into those institutions and if loan demand [remains  weak]--the thrift institutions have fairly high mortgage demand, but at banks, loan demands  remain weak--and inflows persist very strong, I believe they will have to be under considerable  pressure either to adjust their advertising or their rates because they are not going to get  sufficient yield  That would imply some downdrift in Treasury yields, and they will be rather  unprotected in terms of earnings  I believe that’s the economics of it  But in terms of other  factors, I have no comment     Essentially, Mr Chairman, we considered four problems with regard to  the instant reporting of Desk transactions through Telerate  Remembering, of course, that  Telerate is not the only mechanisms at work in the market--the Dow-Jones wire [gives] reports  [of] transactions--it’s simply that Telerate reports them more promptly and, of course, often  before they’re consummated  I mean, they report when the Desk enters the market  On analysis,  we determined that there was no way--     We did not believe that there was any effective way that the Desk  transactions could be kept secret, so to speak, for the reasons outlined in the memorandum  So  we believe that we have to live with the publicity under current circumstances     Secondly, we considered whether that publicity in any way made the FOMC’s  posture--that minutes, the policy record, should not be released except with a 35-day  lag--whether it made that posture untenable  We concluded that it did not because what the  Telerate system is telling the market is what our objective is now, or permitting the market to  infer what our objective is now, today, for the federal funds rate, whereas the policy record gives  rather more revealing information, [which is] what our objective might likely be two or three  weeks from now  And if you’re going to make money, that’s where the money is to be made, in  forecasting where the Fed’s going to be in the future  Of course, that’s where the most risk is  also, but that is the information that market sophisticates, people with financial resources, can  use to greatest advantage  That is also the type of information that would most complicate our  operations     So, from two points of view, it does not seem to us that there’s any argument that can be  made to release the policy record immediately after the Committee meeting, to release the specs  immediately after the Committee meeting  So we don’t believe the Telerate system invalidates  the current Committee’s argument to preserve the specs for 35 days     We also considered two other possibilities, given the fact that we didn’t believe that  secrecy could be preserved  And one was, could somewhat more fluctuation in the federal funds  rate be permitted within a day or within a week  We were not addressing ourselves to the width  of the range but simply the question of widening the intervention points so that the market would  have a more difficult time in gauging where the Desk is and thus would have a more difficult  time in gauging changes in the Desk’s own objectives  On balance, we felt there was little     9/21/76 - 32 -    advantage to that, that the market would simply look at wider intervention points and that the  federal funds rate itself might move more promptly to these wider intervention points once the  dealers in federal funds began to learn the method of the Desk operation  So we did not think, on  balance, that that would reduce market sensitivity to changes in our operations     Secondly, we considered whether it might not be desirable to publish information at the  end of the day on Desk transactions, that is, the amount the Desk did in a particular area, and no  other information  This way, everyone would be on the same footing  On balance, we believe  that there, too, the disadvantages would outweigh the advantages  It might give rise to a number  of questions that we did not want to publicize at that time with regard to the purpose and reason  and to a number of misunderstandings in the process     So, in sum, we believe that there are no changes that appear to be required in Desk  operations or in Committee procedures, given this system  I think, Mr Chairman, that Mr  Holmes might wish to add a comment or two on the specifics from the Desk point of view     Governor Wallich, the disadvantage that we saw--it would add one piece  of information to Telerate; it would give the amount, probably  “The System today bought  $200 million of Treasury coupon issues” period, that’s what we contemplated     They indicate that the System is buying, but they don’t know the  amount     For customer accounts of the Desk, yes     Mr Chairman, I was trying to respond to Governor Wallich’s question  of the disadvantages we saw to the proposal of announcing the amounts that we do  The  disadvantage we saw, Governor Wallich, was not that the announcement itself, per se, would be  harmful, but that questions would arise in people’s minds  It may be difficult to stop with the  announcement, but we would begin to be compelled just to explain why--     I believe, Mr Chairman, you could hold the line  There wouldn’t be a  problem on that, but then the other risk would be, you would get considerable misinterpretation  of your motives in the market afterwards     The Committee does understand, Mr Chairman, that we do publish  weekly     We do publish weekly through our [unintelligible]     Right, the net change during the week is discernable      [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]       Well, we had worked out various estimates of this or our best estimates  of it  We had over the past year been working it out in detail, from the basis of the year ending  in the third quarter of ’76  We thought that something less than half--will be about 40 percent or  so--of the rate of growth of Ml would represent the extent to which Ml growth had been  dampened  This makes the allowance I have mentioned for business savings deposits  We ran  this survey within the last week or so, asking the banks for the activity, the extent to which these  savings accounts are used in transactions--these are overlapping questions--and the extent to  which they are used as compensating balances     And our judgment, from the results of this, were that about a quarter of the net inflows  since February or March were a direct substitute for demand deposits  The allowance we had  made earlier had really reduced that to virtually negligible proportions, that is, we had earlier  assumed that the increase in business savings deposits was roughly at the same rate of increase as  the increase in Ml, so that we weren’t getting any real diversion out of Ml type deposits, you  weren’t getting a real bias in your estimate       Right  After the initial adjustment, which has gone on for several  months--we assumed that by now this was ending  So I can’t give you the exact numbers,  Governor Partee, because we haven’t worked it out in as much detail as we did very recently, but  we--     To be specific--      M1 grew at close to a 4-1/2 percent rate of growth from the third quarter  of ’75 to the third [quarter] of ’76  Our estimate of the substitutes would add--well, it varies on  how you like to do it--but I’d say between 1-1/2 and 2 percentage points to that  So now, so you  would be between 6 and 6-1/2 percent, something like that, and with the most important  [substitute] being business savings deposits in that period  But also there are a number of others   And I’m sure that’s more than we had allowed before, particularly in the business--       That’s right, but we allowed very little effect--direct effect--on the  demand deposits       To give you a rough idea, these are preliminary estimates, judgmental,  really, of the $26 billion increase in state and local savings accounts over the year ending the  third quarter of ’76  We assume that only $600 million represented substitutes for demand  deposits, basing that more on the experience of what happened earlier when there [unintelligible]  interest rates effect  So we assumed virtually most of it was in interest rate effect, and we used     10/19/76 - 33 -   this lower number  Whereas for NOW accounts, we assumed almost all of the increase, not quite  all but almost all, say 70 percent, was the substitute  That was the sort of judgment we had       We made an allowance of about $1 billion which, after much back-and- forth argument, really came out to be on the low side  And it’s somewhat consistent with the  evidence of what’s happening to business shares in the demand deposits survey       Well, President Morris, in the interest of time I cut out a last paragraph  which went into that, not in any detail, really, but [unintelligible] I think implicit in the last  paragraph that I did read  I would argue, I believe, that if growth rates in M2, for example, turn  out to be lower over the next few weeks than were projected, that this probably should be  discounted for two reasons first, they have been very high recently, and [second] particularly  [so] if it turns out this is occurring because of lagged adjustment by banks to the decline in  market rates, so that they are simply becoming less aggressive in seeking out depositors and  permitting those funds to move into market instruments rather than grabbing them for their own  deposits  That sort of realignment of rate levels, with the transaction drop in the rate of  inflows--if that were to occur, I would suggest you would not want to give half weight to M2  under those particular circumstances     On the other hand, if M1 were growing very slowly, and there was collateral evidence that  the economy was also growing much slower than expected, then it seems to me, because I  believe M1 is more reflective of transactions [than] M2 under those circumstances, you might  want to give somewhat more weight to M1     So I would say that the key thing is not a mechanical rule of half and half, although that  would certainly be a satisfactory starting point, but an analysis of the collateral developments in  the economy that are occurring in financial markets while you’re observing what is happening to  M1 and M2, and that [analysis] would guide me  So it’s an argument against strictly adhering to  a rule, although I would start off with a half-and-half rule and modify [in] the directions that I’ve  mentioned       M2 would not be affected, President Black, because we’re assuming  these are demand deposits that go into savings deposits, not other market instruments that go into  savings deposits       I don’t think I said that       A 1/2 point on M2 and 1 point off the top of M3 last time       It was 7-1/2 to 10 and 9 to 12       The time before last       Yeah, we tried to explain it, yeah they go in different directions, and  we’ve tried to explain the effects in the footnote on page 6 in the Bluebook  And that’s very  elliptical and possibly unclear, but the new alternative C in the long run gets you the same M2  and M3 as if you had continued the existing growth rates, and for Ml if you go to another  alternative, between alternatives A and B      In answer to the first question Governor Partee raised, at the time of the  previous Committee meeting, we were anticipating a relatively moderate growth rate in October  and a fourth-quarter growth rate in M1 of around 5 percent  It now looks as if the October  growth rate will be around a 14 or 14-1/2 percent annual rate  And assuming a return to  moderate growth rates for November and December--not much more than, for example, 5 or 6  percent in those months--we would anticipate a fourth-quarter growth rate in M1 of around 7  percent       11/8/76 - 8 -           So given what’s happened in October, we’re about 2 percentage points higher on a  quarterly average growth rate for M1  With regard to the relationships between M1 and M2, I  would point out in answer to those questions that the M2 [base] and also the M3 base is drifting  upward  It was pointed out that the M1 base is drifting downward, but in the third quarter, we  had growth rates in M2 and M3 that were, respectively, just below and just above the top of the  range  We expect less interest rate pressure in the future, and we would continue to expect that  M2 and M3 would grow strongly relative to M1 as compared with previous estimates of that  relationship, that is, we’re now expecting more strength in M2 and M3 relative to M1  Thus, if  the Committee retained the 4-1/2 to 7, we would expect M2 and M3 to go off track on the high  side     My judgment, Governor Jackson, would be that if interest rates stay  where they are, that the rate of growth in M2 and M3 would moderate somewhat from its recent  rate because I believe that, over time, the institutions would begin to have to at least be less  aggressive in offering time deposits and probably would begin to lower offering rates, at least on  the longer-maturing time deposits--perhaps not on the savings deposits, but certainly on time  certificates--because over time they would find pressure  The long-term rates would begin  dropping, the mortgage rates would begin dropping, and cost considerations, if nothing else,  would begin to force institutions to lower offering rates and become less aggressive in their  advertising  So I believe that as time goes on, the present very high rates of growth, even at  current interest rates, would moderate somewhat     Well, we are reevaluating, of course, all these projections as of this very  minute  And therefore, any number picked out of the air would be subject to revision  At the  time of the last Committee meeting, the easiest alternative, which had only very moderate  upward interest rate pressures, that is, alternative A, had M3 growth down around the 11 to 12  percent range in the early part of 1977, and going to around 11 by mid-1977; for M2, it had  growth around 10 percent by mid-1977 and 11 percent in early 1977  I believe that this could be  roughly what I would think the orders of magnitude are, but we are already reevaluating      [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]      We thought that, following the Committee’s decisions after the report of  the Subcommittee on the Directive, we ought to divide the experiment two ways  One would be  to run in the Bluebook a nonborrowed reserves target covering the intermediate period that we  believe was consistent with each of the alternatives presented to the FOMC; and then [second],  after the FOMC made its decision as to what aggregates it wanted, to adopt its range of tolerance  in the intermeeting [period] to adjust that nonborrowed reserve target to be consistent with those  aggregates     That adjustment, therefore, involved an estimate of the multiplier relationship between  nonborrowed reserves and the midpoint [of] the M1 and M2 growth ranges that the Committee  adopted  That was the part of the experiment that was undertaken by the Board’s staff and was  described in the memo by Messrs Paulus and Beck  This nonborrowed reserve target was then  taken by the Trading Desk as a shadow operating guide for itself in the intermeeting period  In  addition, it took as its shadow operating guides the other limitations or specifications in the  original report of the Subcommittee on the Directive--that is, the federal funds rate should move  no more than 25 basis points in a weekly period and that very little attention should be paid to  the possible shifts in the multiplier  Essentially, you are on a nonborrowed target with this kind  of federal funds rate constraint     The report by Ms Tschenkel and Mr Sternlight discusses their results  We’ve  summarized these in the paper  In essence it turned out that in four of the six intermeeting  periods, within the limitations imposed by the experiment, you could get within $50 million of  the target level, the shadow targeted level, four of the six times, and in practice it turned out you  were within $50 million of that targeted level one of the six times  So in that sense, even with a  limited federal funds rate movement, it seemed to turn out that you could hit the nonborrowed  reserves target, probably more than you could, for example, [hit] an RPD [reserves available to  support private nonbank deposits] target at that time     But then it turned out that, on the basis of the results of the Board’s experiment, you would  not have been very much better off in terms of short-run money supply targets even if you hit the  nonborrowed reserve targets  Except in the very critical, perhaps April-May period, hitting the  nonborrowed reserve targets would have gotten you closer to the M1 and M2 targets at  considerable interest rate costs  In most other periods, it would have made very little difference     Our multiplier relationship between nonborrowed reserves and the money supply is so  slippery and so difficult to forecast that it simply meant that we could not say with any  reasonable certainty what the relationship was in the very short run  Thus, it turned out that if  you had hit that nonborrowed reserve perfectly in all six of the periods examined, M1 would  have been closer to expectations only one-fifth of the time and further away three-fifths of the     12/20-21/76 - 25 -         time  Now, indeed, these are small differences, so “away” and “closer” are really within a range  of almost indifference [and] not exactly as you would have expected  M2 on the other hand,  would have been closer three-fifths of the time and away one-fifth [of the time], and again, small  differences but no significant improvement     The conclusion the staff drew was that the nonborrowed reserve experiment indicated that  you could not come any closer to hitting the M1 target in the short run with nonborrowed  reserves than you could with operating on a federal funds rate  This was no surprise  But  because this was completely consistent with the econometric results that we had beforehand,  what we seemed to demonstrate was that close and careful attention to the relationship on a day- by-day monthly basis couldn’t improve the econometric results, which built in an historical  multiplier which isn’t shifted about continuously     In closing, I would just like to add one caveat, which is noted in the report of the  subcommittee  The experiment is very limited, of course, because we couldn’t have a dynamic  situation, that is, you had a result and a one-month period  If you had hit the nonborrowed  reserve target, and [then] the funds rate, say, [went] up, the aggregates would have been slightly  different than you would otherwise have had  And then, in the next month’s period--if we were  playing this game--we’d have had a different Bluebook, and we’d have presented different  alternatives to the Committee, and then we’d have had to guess what the Committee was going  to conclude, and so on  And that is on the [unintelligible] of it, as you can see  Fairly impossible  to do   So, essentially this is an experiment which says that in each four-week period you can’t do  much better than you did with the federal funds rate but says very little about what would have  happened over a sustained six-month period if you stuck rigorously to a fixed rate of growth in a  nonborrowed reserve target  I think, Governor Partee, that concludes my summary of the staff  results  Other members of the staff are here for any detailed questions that people may wish to  ask      One interesting point that has come out of the flow of funds, we do have  interest rates going up about that time, Governor Partee     No, based in part on our assessment of money demands but in part on  the fact that the additional demands in credit would be coming after the tax reduction and the  greater deficits implied  But there is an offset in that, given the plant and equipment spending     12/20-21/76 - 45 -         and inventories that we have, we actually have been forecasting in 1977 a tax decrease  [generating] less net external demand for funds by business corporations in 1977 and 1976 by a  small amount  And that would provide some [offset], so that unless you really have a substantial  recovery in plant and equipment or substantially more inventory investment, or unless our profits  forecasts are way off, the interest rate pressures associated with this kind of tax decrease may be  somewhat more modest than you might think, in an off-hand way, because we still don’t have  large external demands by nonfinancial corporations     Yes     I don’t think, by any manner or means, that we are going to get through  next year without any interest rate pressures as we did this year  But what I wanted to point out  was, we still don’t have built-in the significant pressures from the corporate sector, in terms of  net external needs for funds, that we had in ’73 [and] particularly in ’74     That’s right, but in credit market terms we really are looking mainly at  the aggregates numbers, and these numbers may be an understatement, but they indicate to me  surprisingly little pressure from the corporate sector     I wasn’t doing that for this purpose     Well, in 1971 and ’72--I don’t know how you want to characterize that  period--but growth in M2 was 114 percent in both those years  In 1976, it’s 113  So it’s the  same as in those two years, which of course preceded the inflationary period of ’73-’74  In  1967, growth in M2 was 10 percent  In--     In M1 in 1967, growth was 66 percent  The numbers I happen to have  here are December to December  And in 1976, from December to December, it would be  about-- depending on [this] December--somewhere on the order of 5-1/2 percent, which, in  comparing it with 1967, I would adjust on a comparable basis to over 6-1/2--to 6-3/4 percent  because [of money] substitutes--     Yes     Well, President Morris, may I answer it this way  It would be my  feeling that if M2 and M3 fell short within the range suggested, for example, in alternative B, I  would think that the Committee might not wish to give that very strongly in terms of the money  market  That is, if it fell short, I wouldn’t think that would be a strong reason for easing the  money market  It would not be a strong reason under current conditions, as [it would be] if M1  fell significantly short     On the other hand, if M2 and M3 were very strong in their ranges,  [then]--because of the  experience with them and how rapid it is--I would tend to give that weight, if you wish to tighten  the money market  So I think they still have 50-50 weight, but I tend to interpret them  differently when they’re high than when they’re low     Well, I do not     I don’t know of any     I don’t know yet of any unique events, but you did mention an error in  bank reserve accounting  I do happen to know the there was an error in reserve accounting that,  if it’s not offset by other compensating adjustment--which may often happen--will tend to  increase the weekly numbers for the week just past  But that’s the only special factor that I  know of     No     No, I don’t know of any fundamental factors that are going to--for some  reason or other, December often is difficult for us to project  Maybe it has to do with year-end  window dressing  It’s hard to gauge to what extent banks are going to engage in [it] or not, but  I’m not absolutely certain it’s a lot more difficult than any other month  It’s a little hard     Well, I have [a] casual impression that we have troubles, but I have that  impression     I have a difficulty disassociating those troubles with the troubles I seem  to experience every month  And I would really like the Board to be able to go back [to] some  array of projections and results  But it is true that in past years, December and January have     12/20-21/76 - 60 -         shown exceptionally low growth rates, [with] surrounding months of high growth rates  And we  have not been quite clear as to which month is going to be low and which month is going to be  high  We have inverted November’s and December’s and January’s and February’s  So there is  something odd in the seasonals, apparently around that time, that makes it very difficult for us     Well, I think that if you look back over the past decade or even beyond,  M2 and M3 on average are running higher relative to M1, [by an amount greater] than you  would get by looking at the past relationships  And I believe you’re quite right, this is being  intensified by the fact that banks are lagging so much [in] lowering the rates on time and savings  deposits relative to market rates     But in addition, I think as Governor Partee was mentioning, we have instruments in M2  and M3 that are, to my mind, like bonds or notes--they’re four-year, six-year instruments  And I  don’t know to what the extent the public thinks of them in that way  I talk to bankers who say  they believe the public thinks of them in that way  I talk to [other] bankers who say they believe  the public thinks of them as rather liquid instruments, and I don’t know whether the public yet is  aware fully of what would happen to their yield--which would drop, as you know, below the  passbook rate--if they try to get that money out early; sharply below if [the withdrawal] is well  ahead of maturity [and] sharply below their expected rate     So I believe that we’d have to do an analysis, taking those things out, to begin to be very  certain that we’re dealing with the same kind of instruments that we were dealing with in the  past, because the composition has changed  And I’m not sure how the results would end up if  we did that      President Morris, we have not projected any greater net external need for  funds on the part of corporations in ’77 than in ’76; they’re virtually the same And thus we have  room for corporations to increase their [holdings of] government securities in somewhat the  same fashion as they purchased them in ’76  In fact, we’ve actually projected somewhat higher  acquisition of government securities by corporations in ’77 than ’76     We don’t have a lot of the traditional features that you see in the government securities  market from crowding out  That is, we don’t project at this moment any increase in consumer  purchases of government securities  We have the government securities that are added being  purchased by foreign and official institutions and by businesses and pension funds  We don’t see  any particular need for sizable consumer purchases over the year, which are the traditional  source of interest rate pressures when looked at from the flow of funds, but we do see that  picking up in the second half of the year  So if you were going to locate a problem area from  these figures--and it’s hard to locate--it would come about in the second half of the year through  the beginning of pressure of selling securities outside the banking system     Or diminishment in their profits  A reduced profit flow     President Mayo, I think it has been blown out of proportion  Whether it  isn’t at all significant--I think it has some minor significance  We did put our estimate of the  magnitude into the first part of the Greenbook, in the outlook, buried in the footnote--it’s put in a  complicated way there, but what it amounts to is you might get about $3 billion or $4 billion  more in payments coming in because of this development than you would otherwise have had   So these business corporations are going to have to find $3 billion or $4 billion more to pay over  to the Treasury  That could [generate] some very temporary money market pressures in the  short-term market  But I don’t think it would have any lasting significance at all, and to the  extent that Treasury receipts turned out to be a little higher than were expected in the longer-run,     1/17-18/77 - 33 -           it washes out  So I don’t see it as anything except a possible spot pressure around mid-March or  mid-April     Well, in March and June they make up their payments for 1976, so that  make-up of the payments in ’76 occurs in mid-March and mid-June; and in April, it’s the first of  their 1977 liability [payments]  So, if the experience of ’76 causes them to increase their ’77  estimates, you get an effect in the beginning of that statement period     Well, the refunds of the ’76 taxes to individuals--     Oh, we expect the rebates will be in May  So, in coming through this  whole period--     Well, we expect total payments will exceed their accruals by about $8  billion  That may be in that order of magnitude, but that figure is itself about $3 billion more  than in ’76     One thing I would do, President Balles--we were well aware of the high  velocity, of course--is reduce, to take a percentage point [off velocity] as reflecting the ongoing  shift from M1 to other deposits or other money market instruments as people seek to  economize--[a] trend that has been occurring over the past few years  We would have estimated  last year somewhere over 1-1/2 percentage points as a rough rule of thumb  I would take at the  beginning of this year something like 1 percent--it may prove to be more or may prove to be less   So that reduces the problem you’re discussing to some extent     Secondly, as you do point out, you had 34 percent in those particular periods  Trend since  ’61 has been on the order of 3 percentage points  The standard deviation around that trend has  been about 1-3/4 percentage points; the absolute deviation around 2 percentage points  So  you’ve got a certain random factor that’s at work  And, finally, we do realize that it’s a fairly  large increase in velocity that’s called for, and we would expect for that reason--as time goes on  in the next year--for interest rates to rise as people try to get cash by selling assets and  borrowing  So we wouldn’t really expect at this point a sort of free increase in velocity of that  magnitude but would expect the economization to reflect in part the interest rate pressures that  might occur as the year goes on     I don’t believe [so], Governor Partee  We didn’t project for the lower  limit     No, we did not project  Because [M3] includes time and savings  deposits at banks, which are going down, I don’t believe lowering it a quarter of a point would  be offset by additional lending by the Home Loan Banks  So I don’t think you’re going to get  any significant impacts on housing from that minor change     1/17-18/77 - 53 -             Of course, that’s basic to the projection of GNP that we’ve already  presented to you  And that working-down is built into that projection     Yes, that’s right     Higher rates?     It would indicate lesser growth in what over the future?     Oh, well, alternative A pertains to a longer-run growth path for M1 that  is higher than the one adopted by the Committee  Alternative C pertains to a longer-run growth  path that’s lower than the one adopted by the Committee  So alternative A simply permits a  more rapid money growth and thus a lower funds rate; and alternative C has a more restraining  money growth rate and thus a higher funds rate  I’m not sure I’m answering your question     B is the projection that would be consistent with what the Committee has  adopted today for the long run     I don’t believe we have anything more specific than we presented last  time, and it’s just scattered reports  You don’t have anything beyond that, President Volcker     In 1975, the first quarter rate of growth was very small, of course, 06  percent, and the second quarter, on average, was 74  And we have assumed this year, in our  tentative working out of a pattern in the second quarter, that the rebates will move out of demand  deposits perhaps faster than they did last time     As you recall, last time, May was very high, and June was even higher  We are assuming a  faster movement of the rebates out of demand deposits into other investment instruments or  spending this time than [we did] last time, on the assumption that people learn  Now whether  that will in fact develop, I can’t be sure  Also, we are not really certain as to the size of the  rebate--it could vary between $7 billion and $11 billion; we assumed 10, not too far different  from last time     Well, again, the refunds come, and it depends on the pattern, because  what goes in in March goes out in April, and it has a negative effect on the April growth rate  So  you might get a high March growth rate and a low April growth rate, [and] a high May growth  rate as the rebates come in; if they go out, move into deposits, you get a low June growth rate   And that’s roughly the kind of pattern we have assumed  God knows whether it’ll be fact or not     We hope to have new seasonals by the next Committee meeting  We  have held them up, waiting for the June benchmark; we do them both simultaneously  I am  absolutely certain, from following past experience, that the weekly seasonals are going to be  revised substantially  The large weekly variations that we have seen will be much dampened  I     1/17-18/77 - 57 -           have no feeling at this moment about the monthly seasonals  I have no reason [to think] that they  will be changed in any significant way at this point     Yes  If you choose the interest rate pattern implicit in alternative C, that  is, a higher federal funds rate over the next few weeks, which is about 1/2 point, then our ending  point on the funds rate would not be 6-1/2 percent, as it is under alternative B; it would be  somewhat lower, on the thought that the Committee has put the restraint in earlier, and thus you  wouldn’t need it as much as time goes on     Yes, but I might add that it seems as certain as death and taxes in May  and June  The refunds that we are projecting--and we could be off again on that projection of the  amount of refund--but if it does turn out to be $3 billion higher, it’s likely it will bulge in March     I think you may also want to get Mr Sternlight’s judgment, but mine  250 miles further south would be that--     --would be that there would be a further reaction  I would be hard- pressed to quantify it, but if I had to guess, I would put 10 to 15 basis points on the bill rate,  maybe 10 to 20 basis points more on intermediate Treasury issues, and further rises from the  corporate bond rate  I might add that I think the intensity of the reaction will partly depend on     1/17-18/77 - 65 -           whether such a rise or such an indication of a rise occurs well before the Treasury financing is  announced--which will be January 26--or occurs in the midst of the Treasury refunding without  any, in a sense, prior indication or prior suspicion on the part of the market that it is likely to  occur     The latter      Mr Chairman, I was going to add, if I might, supplementing Mr  Sternlight’s comment--I think that if it also had to do, not simply with expectations--expectations  change--but that was the area where there was a very large supply of securities  The Treasury  had been hitting that area rather consistently, and you saw a sharp reaction in that rate area in  part because people who were just trading in the securities tended to unload them--and so it was  something [more] than just a change in attitude in that area more particularly than in other areas  because of the very large supply that was floating     Well, with thrift institutions, I would say that you really have to go  through the whole maturity spectrum up to around four years  That is, the savings accounts are  sensitive to the bills, and that may be more particularly true for commercial banks now with  business and state and local governments     Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you were asking about the liability side     2/15/77 - 23 -             I would say on that, that it’s up to the four-year Treasuries and maybe a  little bit longer, that is when those issues have very attractive coupons  And, of course, those  yields are low now, or relatively low  Then you tend to get funds that would otherwise be going  perhaps into four-year certificates going into Treasury issues  And also, [with] very high bill  rates, funds that would otherwise go into savings shares [going] into the bills, and sometimes  from very short-term certificates into bills     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     No, I have not  But I have not investigated that     I’d have to investigate that more carefully to give you an answer, but I  have not--none has come to my attention     Not from the point of view of our domestic finance  It might be material  from the point of view of the balance of payments and pressures on exchange rates     That’s right  We are expecting a very rapid growth rate in money in the  second quarter  And I think the--actually that 53 percent velocity for that quarter is in some  sense artificially low--it’s around 6--you have to average through the second and third quarter,  which still leaves you a high M1 around 6  And we’re expecting a drop-off in the third quarter,  so that, [unintelligible] because of the rebate money in effect being used over a longer period   But in addition, Governor Wallich, we are expecting interest rates to rise, and that accounts for a  good part of the rise in velocity in addition--     Well, Governor Wallich, in the course of working out the material for  this Bluebook, we did not work out an alternative which had no interest rate increase involved   So I really cannot give you an answer which would be anything other than my hunch  And I  don’t know whether you want that at this point     I was going to put my hunch at around 7, and that would be a lower  number, I believe, than would be literally read out of some of the models     The increase in money supply without an increase in interest rates over  this Committee’s one-year horizon     That’s correct, and that would mean that we’re allowing for some further  shift from demand deposits to other transaction balances and for the fact that some of this  liquidity might be given up willingly rather than require high interest rates in the atmosphere  ahead     I believe this is a high velocity rate, but again, as I point out, we’re  expecting higher interest rates  I don’t believe there would be a precedent at this stage of the  cycle without rising interest rates  I don’t know whether you would even have found that  I  don’t have those figures at hand     President Eastburn, it was in an effort to help explain this new table that  I did want to point out that the movement in liquidity has been very unusual in this cycle as  compared with previous cycles  And that is, people have improved their positions during a  period when they ordinarily deteriorate  That doesn’t mean that you are surely going to get more  velocity without much interest rate pressure, but it is at least an indicator in that direction     If we’re wrong, President Volcker, about the extent of interest rate  pressures, then V2 would look more reasonable  If interest rate pressures are less, the V2  number is going to be considerably less, while the M1 velocity would be about the same     That was the beginning [of] disintermediation     Well, that’s very sensitive to disintermediation     V2 does to a great extent     I don’t have that data here     We think that the refunds will be a little bit higher than they were last  year ,when they came in strong toward the end of February and March and had a definite effect  on M1  But the stronger [rebates] were evident also in ’74; we think our seasonals are beginning  to pick it up  But we don’t expect the refunds to be enough stronger in this year to have any  significant effect on M1  It could provide some uptick in March, but we haven’t built in  anything very special for it     Well, we did put the March growth rate somewhat higher than the  February growth rate partly on this thought of the refunds, but it’s not a significant enough  difference for me to put any real weight on it  On the rebates, we have in process, and we’ll have  completed within two or three weeks, a very detailed study of the experience in 1975  Pending  that, we have made some tentative estimates, which in my view are somewhat arbitrary at this  moment, of the effects on demand deposits and time and savings deposits  And we have added  some 9 percentage points or so to May growth rates and something like 5 percentage points or so  to June growth rates and then taken these out later in the summer, in July     I believe that it’s 8 to 9  It’s in that order of magnitude  Again I would  like to stress that these may not be the numbers that we will be using when the rebates come  upon us or when we get a better fix on them, because we have not completed this very detailed  study we have under way of the 1975 experience     These numbers are very sensitive to assumptions you make about whether people have  learned from the 1975 experience; whether they’re going to spend [the rebate funds] faster than  they did at that time; whether they are going to move them out of demand deposits faster or  slower  And you can get radically different numbers for various months depending on whether  you assume they come out two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, or five weeks [later]  The  monthly numbers are enormously sensitive  And our pattern at the moment has something like a     2/15/77 - 28 -           14-1/2 percent rate of growth in M1 in May, a 10 percent in June, a minus 5 in July, and if you  just change an assumption about a week or two, we can get a much lower number for June and a  higher number for May  But at the moment these are the numbers we’re working with for M1     Well, that’s how it works out with this 5 percent for April, 14-1/2 for  May, and a 10 percent for June  The average rate of increase for the first quarter is somewhere  around 5-1/2 percent     Well, I had hoped, President Volcker, that the subject would not come  up because I did not feel that the work that we had done was adequate for a very confident  estimate  And that’s why I’m stressing that these are very first approximations and that we are  working on a very detailed paper to try to get whatever you can out of the ’75 experience  But as  I say, these estimates will be very sensitive whether you decide that a person is going to hold  [the rebate] for a week and then spend it or hold it for two weeks and spend half  It’s just highly  sensitive     We also don’t know, Mr Chairman--and this may cause differences in  the assumptions--the exact timing of the payout  We have, I think, here assumed that it begins in  late April or early May  Again, you get a different [result depending on whether] payouts [are]  being [held or] drawn down in May  It’s a highly difficult area  And we will Mr Chairman,  when we get into the months--     No, that’s what I was going to say     When we’re presenting the months where they will be highly relevant to  policy, we will provide a range of estimates for the Committee     2/15/77 - 29 -              Yes, we would have to have a rather substantial growth in velocity over  the next year  As you know, in this recovery, we have had periods of very substantial rates of  growth of velocity of M1, particularly because of the change in financial technology  We expect  some of these changes in financial technology to be continuing, but also in addition, as in the  Bluebook, we do expect interest rates to rise  In the past we’ve had these increases in velocity in  this recovery without rises in interest rates  Now this time we believe that there will be actually  some rise in interest rates accompanying a rise in velocity     We’ve checked it out against econometric models we have at hand  And our interest rate  forecast and our velocity forecast are consistent with the models, after you allow for the mis- estimates that the models have been consistently making for the past two years  And allowing  for those mis-estimates--that is, correcting the model by hand for the same mistake it made last  year--you would end up roughly with the velocity and interest rate forecasts that are implicit in  our projections  Now that may be cold comfort, as I have as little faith in the pure accuracy of  models as maybe you do, but at least it double checks it     President Morris we continue to have no greater external demand for  funds by corporations projected for 1977 than we have for 1976  In 1976, corporations were net  borrowers, that is, in net assets less liabilities, they were net borrowers of around $25 billion in  financial markets  This compared, say, with $70 billion in ’74, and we were projecting for ’77 a  very similar number--in fact, almost exactly the same--and with very little uptrend in the course  of the year  And, of course, we have large profit flow and an increase in plant and equipment  spending, but not of boom proportions     So from that point of view, you don’t have a factor which is adding to credit market  pressures as compared with the previous year  That has been one of the factors that has kept-- me, at least--thinking that interest rate pressures, viewed from credit demand and supplies--not  just from velocity but from the markets themselves--are not extremely intense       3/15/77 - 15 -           Now, we have projected a rather substantial rise in interest rates, I might add, a bill rate  going around 4-1/2 to 7 by early ’78--in a period when price pressures aren’t intensifying   That’s a rather substantial rise in interest rates for such a period     Well, we hope they’re fully integrated--they’re integrated with the  Bluebook, and they’re integrated with the housing starts and plant and equipment numbers that  come from the economic projection     Yes, they are     No, you don’t, but I’d be glad to have them forwarded to you     No, we get a printout monthly     Well, we could--I think a summary table     I’ve been getting them monthly for some time  You know the exact--     The manufacture of them--     An evaluation of the flow of funds doesn’t find the normal kind of  pressure points in credit markets that you often associate with it  That’s one of the problems     Yes  I might add that we will be glad to work on a summary table and  use them  I’m not sure--we won’t have it in time for the Greenbook because of our schedule; we  will either have to have it appended to the Bluebook or [provide] it separately on Monday, but  we can forward it     I would add, Mr Chairman, that we do have an indicator in the second  half of 1977 that is often associated with credit market pressures, and by that time we do expect  the banking system to be financing more of business than it did last year  That is, the trend, the  last two months of ’76 and early ’77 of increased business loan demand, we expect [it] to remain  fairly substantial throughout the year, with mortgage needs, consumer needs     We would expect the banking system would not be as substantial a financer of the  government--as we get into the latter part of this year--as it had been, and we would project that  the household sector would have to buy a very substantial amount of government securities by  the second half of this year  And more, for example, than they were buying on average in ’74;  considerably more than in ’75 and ’76     So from that aspect, in the last half of this coming year, we do get a traditional source of  upward rate pressures, that is, the necessity to price Treasuries so you could sell them to the  household [sector] favorably priced relative to [Regulation] Q ceilings, things like that     I think, Governor Wallich, [what] is being left out is that we are--we  may be wrong, we have been wrong for two straight years--but we are projecting a rather  substantial rise in interest rates  Now, it may turn out to be higher, but we are projecting a rise  from about 4-1/2 percent for the bill rate to 7 percent  That gets you up into the area of  disintermediation, and that disintermediation is what causes the income velocity of M2 to rise   So in some sense we have a rather consistent set of projections, not inconsistent with past  historical experience, once you feed-in the rise in interest rates and make allowance for some  continuing shifts in financial technology  It may be more intense, or it may be that we are wrong  again and it will be less intense; we really don’t know  But I think this is a fairly good sort of  mean projection of the future     Governor Partee, the increase in velocity that we have is high relative to  past experience  In the third year of the 1970 expansion, M2 velocity rose at about a 2 percent  annual rate, and in the third year of the ’54 expansion at about a 3 percent annual rate, and what  we have is about a 3 percent annual rate of rise     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Yes     Well, we get reports on, the daily report of deposits of federal funds and  other borrowings  RPs--there are varying definitions, District by District, so it’s not exactly  comparable  And what I was reporting on--our aggregation of that for all member banks, with  some added allowance for the nonmember banks--and this figure, for example, such borrowing  net of lending [unintelligible] showed an increase, on this fragmentary basis, of $36 billion in  February, whereas in February of the three previous years, it had declined, on average, $400  million  So that’s the factual basis for it, but, I would hasten to add, it is fragmentary, and I was  offering an explanation which should be taken in the nature of a hypothesis     No, we don’t, but I don’t think that Governor Partee--     No, no  I was giving you net  I was netting out, and this would be the  loans to the nonbanks  This would be from all nonbanks  An S&L, for example would be a  lender here  A corporation would be a lender under an RP  An S&L could be under federal  funds     Well, if they were going to do anything in anticipation of sales, I would  assume they would build up inventory somewhat and possibly borrow from banks in order to do  so, which would be, in a sense, reducing their liquidity somewhat  I have no evidence of an  unusually substantial inventory buildup in anticipation of such sales  But maybe Mr Zeisel--     No, what I said was that we expect a substantial effect in the second  quarter but that the March-April figures currently before the Committee do not include any effect  of the rebates directly because we don’t expect the payments to begin until May       Yes, at the moment, on the order of 2 percentage points on average, but  that’s quarter-over-quarter, roughly  I would expect substantial effects in May and June--very  large, in fact     On that mailing period you would get less effect in the second quarter,  assuming our rough assumption at the moment, [which] is that the first mailing will be around  the end of the first week in May  Now, again, that will depend on when the legislation is passed,  whether the Treasury can gear up to mailing out the checks, which we will know more definitely,  of course, in the next four weeks     Yes, that quarter, the second quarter, does include about roughly plus 2  for the rebates, and the third quarter roughly a minus 2     Lord no     Right, right  Now, we would expect a rather substantial second quarter  based on the strength of the economy, which, of course, in itself also reflects partly the rebates   But, in addition, it’s the particular effect on the rebates and people just holding cash for, on  average, a little bit longer than they normally hold it     6-1/2      Governor Coldwell, I might add one other  In the second quarter, if our  projections are correct, you’ll have M1 growth on the order of 7 percent, or something like that   Assuming a 5-1/2 percent midpoint of the Committee’s target, which is now in place, that would  imply increasing rates of growth over the next three quarters  With GNP very strong, that  implies an increase in the rate of increase in velocity     Velocity was very high in the first quarter  It will be very high in the second quarter  By  the fourth quarter of next year, on these projections, it will be even higher, increasing around a 7  percent rate  And it’s this--this could be one influence on our expectation that interest rates may  rise  Of course, in 1975, we had such increases in velocity without increases in interest rates   But that is the principle effect, along with the associated credit market demands, that we would  expect, and with the economy so strong     There is a large stock of liquidity available to absorb it, but if people  don’t want to hold that liquidity, and they want to use it up, the way they use it up is to sell the  securities, or increase their borrowings, and those are the factors that tend to put upward pressure  on interest rates     Mr Chairman, there are other provisions, of course--Regulation A,  which could be readily applied  In any case of emergency, there are provisions for loans at the  regular discount rate independent of seasonal needs     What I was trying to say is that I don’t believe there’s anything in the  regulation that will impede this kind of lending, seasonal borrowing or otherwise  It may be a  question of rate, but there’s nothing in the regulation   SPEAKER(?)  That’s right     That is possible, Mr Chairman     It very well may be you need [an allowance for] more judgment in the  seasonals; it’s quite possible     You go back as far as 1967, the differential between M1 and M2 is  reading roughly 3-1/2, 2-1/2, 0, 23 but then it gets up to around 5 then 2-1/2, so I would say it’s  in the order of 2-1/2 plus or minus something--previous to the past three years or so     They have been for some months--some reduction in offering rates  And  very recently we’ve had a slowdown in net inflows in time and savings deposits relative to what     4/19/77 - 31 -           it had been in the fourth quarter  We are projecting, Mr Guffey, further slowdowns in the  summer and fall, when we believe interest rates would start rising  But as of the moment, there  is a slowing also     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     4/19/77 - 39 -             Those three that I listed  Some of which were unanticipated     Yes  I didn’t hear it  [Statement continues]     Yes, it’s the growth rate in velocity from the first quarter on average to  the second quarter on average at annual rates     And similarly for other quarters     Yes, we made an effort to allow for that  Of the three special factors I  mentioned, that one we allowed for possibly not enough     When a Saturday or Sunday is the third day of the month, they put out  the Social Security payment on the preceding Friday  Ordinarily, they pay it out on the third day  of the month  And that puts it in M1 for a couple of extra days for the monthly average  So you  get about a 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points impact on a month from that  That, we made an effort to  allow for  I don’t really think quite enough  And the other two factors, we did not allow for at  all as I look at our weekly projections as they evolve  In any event, we would have been too  low, but not--in any event we wouldn’t have had as high a month, but we wouldn’t have been as  badly off     Well, they may be  I can’t explain why, in the week preceding the tax  period, M1 ought to be relatively strong  It doesn’t make sense to me that people have  accumulated deposits in order to pay their taxes in advance  That seems to be something of  what’s happening     Because it hasn’t happened in earlier years  In the abstract it makes  sense, but then I would not have expected the phenomenon just this year and last year  That’s  the problem I have with it, and I don’t have enough information to say that the tax payments are  becoming larger, or how people might be varying their payment patterns  But aside from that,  that’s the thing that’s giving me trouble at the moment     Well, the refunds are coming in  We may not be allowing for them  properly, but the refunds are coming in pretty much exactly as we have projected     Yes, and there is no extra  Refunds in this early week in April were  almost exactly as we projected and are not substantially more than they were last year  [They  are] about the same as last year  So the refund pattern is not in itself causing us to go off in the  sense that we--what is occurring is what we had expected  We may not have allowed for it  properly, but at least what is occurring is what we had expected  And the special factors--I  pointed to two of them--we really hadn’t expected     Refunds?     That’s right  We are projecting a drop in the money stock of some  magnitude after the week ending April 20  We did not project a drop in the week of April 20  because of the averaging effect, presuming these aren’t paid until the end of the week and a little  more mobilization occurs  But we are projecting a drop, and that’s what gets us the low May  growth rate  I mean that they are coming down     Yes     That’s the same wording as in the money market directive, essentially      [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     It’s the latter, principally, Governor Coldwell  There’s enough in the  hands of the consumer now, or in the public, generally financed in the second quarter  transactions  Our second quarter growth rate, as I mentioned, is still a relatively high 9-1/4  percent  So we have not assumed that, say, a half or even two-thirds of that April growth was  money that was going to be offset by negative numbers  We believe, or I believe in any event, a  large part of that reflected the strengthening of the economy and will be reflected in the higher  growth rate in the second quarter, and increased velocity      5/17/77 - 19 -             We’re not expecting--I was trying to explain the behavior of time and  savings deposits recently  In April, there were both special factors as well as, I believe, shifts to  demand deposits for spending purposes as well as direct use [of the original demand deposits] for  spending purposes  We’re actually projecting some pickup in the rate of growth of time and  savings deposits, but not at a rate as fast as occurred in the first quarter  A slower rate of growth,  but a pickup from the pace of April-May     That’s right     Well, we’re getting a very low growth rate in May because of the  pattern  We had a jump up in the beginning of April, it’s been very stable through the first week  in May, and then we’re beginning to pick up the rate of growth in May  But that gives us a very  low growth rate in May as compared with April, and then you get a rather more normal growth  rate appearing in June  And so when you average the two months together, you do come out  with a low growth rate for June, as a rather more normal growth rate for the time and savings  deposits on the order of around 10 percent, whereas May is an abnormally low growth rate, on  the order of around 5  We are projecting a pickup       Well, you see, that goes with a 1 percent M1, and so your time deposits  would be on the order of 10 percent for another month     Well, that’s essentially why, under alternative C, which assumes another  50 basis point increase in the funds rate and approximately that in the bill rate, that we have a  somewhat more substantial slowing in M2 than we would ordinarily have in comparing two  alternatives  And our thought was that you would force out a considerable amount of the hot  money, in effect, that had been put in savings deposits as the rate gets significantly above the  ceiling rates of 5 and 5-1/4 percent  And a large part of that money would flow into Treasury  securities  Some of it might flow into large nonnegotiable CDs that would have no effect on M2,  but some of it would also fall into Treasury securities, so we would expect a more substantial  one-time reaction in time deposits      I might add, Governor Partee, if we are right and you don’t get an offset  in some other components of time deposits, this effect I think would be temporary, and you  would return later to a higher growth rate even at the higher level of interest rates because you  would have just removed--     --you would have removed a stock of hot money; that’s what we are  assuming  So therefore, that’s why we suggested a 3/4 point drop in the alternative C range for  M2 relative to alternative B, to accommodate that stock adjustment without having to make a  policy move     In effect, to moving the Treasury bill rates, obviously, well above the  passbook ceiling rate  On an investment yield basis, it’s above the commercial bank ceiling rate  right now, of course     Or the market may have a weaker economic forecast, more obviously   We do check our forecasts against what’s in the futures market, and what’s implicit in the yield  structure--both  And at the time we were making the forecast, the three-month bill rate in the  futures market, by the first quarter of ’78, was being forecast at 6-3/4 percent; by the second  quarter, around 7  And implicit in the yield structure, it was being forecast around 6-1/4 percent   So you are about 1/2 to 1 point, roughly, below what we would expect a three-month bill rate to  be at that time  But I have no way of knowing whether it’s a weaker economic forecast, or a  higher money growth forecast, or just sheer hunch  I just literally couldn’t quantify that     No, I haven’t, but I’d say it was a good thing to do  I think we will     I believe that if short rates go up over the next several months, roughly  the order of magnitude that we projected or a little less or a little more, that you’ll have not very  large effects on long-term rates on average  Any time that the short rate begins to move up, we’ll  have an expectational effect, or just an adjustment effect, then it might ease off a little  So I  think the yield curve will follow something like the normal cyclical pattern, that it will tend to  flatten  And of course, in saying that, I’m making an assumption that any tightening that  develops will be of a kind that restrains inflation and not merely an increase in rates that is  reflecting an inflation that is, as it were, pulling the rates up  If you’re in that situation, then I  think that long-term rates would move up rather sharply      I would like to point out, Governor Jackson, because I think it’s a very  critical point, that if you think back to ’74, while the yield curve flattened, there was a sharp  tightening in the money market partly because of how sharp the rate of inflation became, and so  you did get a very sharp rise in long-term rates at the same time  And I’m assuming that the  restraint on the aggregates, if that develops, would be sufficient to keep the rate of inflation from  accelerating significantly     No, I don’t have any good feeling of the last year  And I think that we  will go back and assess both our interest rate forecast in line with President Eastburn’s  suggestion and our M1 and M2 forecast  As you know, we reassess these things periodically and  have normally found that there is somewhat less error in the M2 forecast because you do have  some offsetting shifts between demand and time deposits that help you, and it’s a larger number,  in a sense  If our error is, as you have noted, 1/4 percent on M1, it’s got to be the lowest in  history     That’s why we would have--     Yes, if May were coming in weaker, we would of course, begin writing  down June right around that time, so that both months could in effect be quite weak  Something     5/17/77 - 26 -           like that  There could be a large negative in May, even a small plus for June; you can’t tell quite  how the pattern would come      President Eastburn, on the face of it, unless you ignore the money  demand, it depends on how you ask your question  The money demand function in the model  cumulatively has been off $40 billion, so it’s going to, I am sure, give very different GNP results  for the Committee’s money supply than our judgment  But of course that could be tested  The  other way to run the model is to ignore the money demand function and just put in the interest  rates  And so it really depends in part how you ask your question as to what kind of answer you  are going to get from this exercise     Approximately 3-1/2 minutes, Mr Chairman     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     This is the velocity of M1, and I think you’d have to allow for more than  the technological changes, and we’re working on that  The next thing I’m going to say, I think  you might have to allow for a large increase in corporate and state and local government  holdings of very short term assets, like the federal funds and RPs [repurchase agreements]  And  if you began including that in M2, then this relationship may become a little strong again  But  we’re still working on that, Governor Wallich     We did not make any specific allowance for that, Governor Jackson     I think there would be some possibility  But I would believe that most  of the holders, knowing the time of maturity, would probably arrange their transaction to  minimize the amount going through demand deposits  I think there could be some effect if you  go out of the wild card into a market security in the transaction process, but I think that would be  a rather passing phase  We have assumed, in fact, that there is, under current conditions, enough  scope between the ceiling rate on longer-term time certificates and current market rates for  institutions to hold these deposits     Well, I think alternative C might put banks a little bit closer to the  margin than [it] would thrifts, so, a little more room  I don’t think alternative B would pose any  problem; alternative C would begin to, a little bit, for banks, but not significantly over the next  four weeks     7/19/77 - 49 -       No, we did not make any specific allowance for that, Governor Partee,  but as rates got higher, it would become more of a possibility     If you got up to the ceiling rate at banks, then there would be much more  of a possibility of shifting     I believe it’s $18 billion in thrifts and $8 billion in banks between about  now and October     Well, President Balles, I would really--we have not investigated that in  any detail  And I would propose that we do that and report back through a memo     Do I interpret you right, President Balles--you are asking for our  estimates of shifts to NOWs, to savings, as well as [to] these other instruments--telephone  transfers--     That’s correct, Mr Chairman, but I ought to add that there is some  thought that, because of the blackout in New York, the additional data that we get for the week  ending the 20th may be subject to some more doubt than they usually are--the preliminary data   There may be some technical problems in interpreting and getting that data  So that what I’m  saying is, the additional information we’ll have Wednesday and Thursday will be subject to more  doubt than it usually is     7/19/77 - 53 -       I would assume they would be resolved within a week afterward, when  we get the final data for that period     Yes  I’m referring to the data for the week ending July 20, which we  would normally get on a Thursday     That’s right; I’m told they’ll be cloudier     That’s right, because it covers the period in which we had this power  failure in New York     We’ve haven’t had that reference for a long, long time, Mr Chairman,  and we have taken account of financial market developments, which I believe might be  satisfactory  I don’t know that we need to make special mention     No, we could develop on a weekly average basis the same breakdown  we had on the end-of-month series  We have the same lack of information in both cases     We are working toward that end, but it will be at least some while, and  of course it will be some while further to seasonally adjust them      Yes     If you go out for this three-month bill on the second quarter, it’s on  average about 68 percent; I was averaging  And in the third quarter ’78, its 71 percent, which is  about the 7 Mr Balles has mentioned     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Yes, in the third quarter  That’s on the assumption that the rate of  growth in M1 in the third quarter is about 8-1/2 percent     Well, in the second quarter it’s very small  It sort of phases down  In  fact, I had written out during the second and third quarters because it was very small in the     8/16/77 - 25 -           second quarter, but I wanted to be absolutely precise and write in the third quarter  But it’s sort  of phasing down [unintelligible]     Given the GNP and the actual interest rates     Oh yes, there has been a consistent shortfall  The percentage error--by  the fourth quarter of ’76, it was almost 12 percent off, that is, it had overpredicted--its predicted  M1 is 12 percent higher than we actually attained  And by the first quarter, it was up to 133,  and then by the second quarter it phased down to 136, and by the third quarter, it seems roughly  to be the same, 136     Oh, no, no, nowhere near, and we’re assuming--actually, in all  projections we present to the Committee--we are assuming further shortfalls  We are nowhere  near staying with this model  We assume further shortfalls     Well, this quarter--     Well, this shortfall I’m measuring is from around the third quarter of  ’74, where we started--     --going off  It’s been rather consistently going off since then     Well, I think, President Roos, that the Committee could, if it wished,  control within plus or minus 1 percentage point, or 1-1/2, something like that, over a year or so,  the rate of growth in M1 if it were willing to see whatever interest rate behavior developed, to     8/16/77 - 26 -           see whatever M2 and M3 behavior developed as a result, and to take whatever economic  consequences were in process  In that sense, it’s controllable     In this period, oh sure  Yes, you would have to work backward, but it’s  essentially the bill rate that’s in the equation  But the model is still saying that, for the money  supply growth, it’s the Committee’s target  You would have a substantially higher Treasury bill  rate than you see in the Bluebook  That is the data that we are presenting to the Committee,  assuming shortfalls in terms of the model     6 to 8     That assumes that if the Committee would obtain a 4 percent rate of  growth in M1 in the fourth, first and second quarters, which would be consistent with obtaining  the midpoint of that 4 to 6-1/2 percent, then on average the velocity would be about 7 percent,  given the staff’s GNP forecast for that period     Yes indeed  And if that, of course, is lower, then you would have much  less demand for money and much less pressure on interest rates     Yes, that’s right  When interest rates were up     Well, we’ve been surprised two ways by the behavior of thrift flows   We were surprised that they were relatively low in April and May  We were surprised that they  were relatively high in June and July  Now our data for August is suggesting, at least for banks,  another slowdown in flows  You may want to keep that background in mind when I give you  our appraisal  We would expect a slowdown to around a 7 percent rate of growth in flows of  thrift institutions in the first half of 1978, and to about a percentage point or so more than that at     8/16/77 - 27 -           commercial banks in time deposits other than large CDs, without any action on Regulation Q  ceilings and with a bill rate, say, on the order of 7 percent or perhaps a little higher  This would  rather clearly, I think, begin to exert pressure on the mortgage market and on loan terms and  conditions at banks     As I mentioned, this doesn’t assume any change in Regulation Q  As of now, there is no  leeway left for banks to adjust the ceiling rates and maintain a spread over market rates in  savings deposits or in shorter-term time deposits  There is a little leeway left for thrifts, and in  the four-year-and-over maturity area, there’s leeway for both banks and thrift institutions  So I  think it’s within a percentage point or so, in terms of bill rates, of real pressure on institutions     In the second quarter, it was running around 11, and recently it picked  up, and so we are projecting a third quarter--with some little slowdown from the recent  pickup--on the order of 13 percent  This would be a sharp drop  It would be a material  reduction from where you are now because of this bill rate moving up  That’s our assumption     It was very high     Well, we’ve taken account of them  We don’t have any information that  there are substantial difficulties, and of course they are in the over-four-year area, where we still  have rather considerable room, and we don’t expect those [to make] for much of a problem     That’s correct     Well, there was an increase in two weeks in July, and we believe that  will be coming out  That was a temporary increase and not one we expect to continue  In fact,  we expect it to be coming out, and the fragmentary data we have, I am told, suggest that it is  coming out, and I am not exactly sure of my number, but I think that increase, if you have taken  that out of M1 for July, would have reduced that growth rate on the order of 2 to 3 percentage  points  We had for years kept track, [in] the series that we put in the Bluebook for M1, “less  foreign deposits” in our money stock, and it showed every once in a while [that] it would affect  the monthly growth rate a little bit, but it didn’t prove significantly different to keep track of it  continuously     We were not able to come up with any explanation that was satisfactory  of why those foreign deposits went up in that middle week of July and stayed up in the next  week     President Mayo, I think there might be a misunderstanding of how we  make the projections  The projections for the period between Committee meetings--well, we  have a variety of projections, and models, and what have you  But the basic judgmental  projection--sometimes that’s adjusted on the basis of the model results--but the basic judgmental  projection is made from unadjusted weekly data     And, in judging whether the data coming in are above or below paths  that seem consistent with what the Committee finally adopts for an intermeeting period, that  judgment is based on the unadjusted data that’s coming in  And the seasonal factor is a constant,     8/16/77 - 30 -           and that’s just the transformation that transforms it into a level that is more consistent with past  behavior and is more familiar to the Committee and to the public  But, essentially, tracking of  the path and our development of what we propose to the Committee are based on an evaluation  of expectations with regard to unadjusted data in the period     Yes, its quarterly average, I believe     I don’t have that     It either went up more than expected or went down less     Well, President Winn, we made the effort, as you noted, to present what  we think are consistent--     Whether they turned out to be consistent in the real world--     And the reason there are only half-point [funds rate] differentials is  because of the short run  Whatever M1 is going to be, we don’t think there’s hardly anything we  can do to prevent it from being that in the short run, and all you can do is affect it a little bit with  the variation in the funds rate      I happen to have some figures on that, Governor Coldwell, for the  briefing I thought I was going to write, but it didn’t work out too well  I discarded it  We have a  much steeper yield curve now than we did in comparable stages of past recoveries  For example,  the 20-year Treasury constant maturity is just about 2 percentage points above the three-month  bill rate  In previous expansions that lasted this long, it was between 40 and 70 basis points  above the three-month Treasury bill rate at this stage  And there are similar relationships when  you compare the triple-A corporate bond rate to the four- to six-month commercial paper rates   So the yield curve is still much steeper, reflecting, I believe, the strong liquidity demands we’ve  had in the course of this recovery     That also, but this is--I was comparing a 20-year issue to the three- month issue  Of course, if credit had been much tighter, well, short-rates would naturally rise  more than longer rates just because of the economics and arithmetic of that  But I think that  we’ve been affected by the demands for short securities by banks, thrift institutions, for a time,  and corporations and by the desire to lengthen on the part of corporations, state and local  governments, and others, and this has contributed to keeping the yield curve as it is  Of course,  your other point is also true  If we had much tighter credit, the yield curve would have been  shifting     9/20/77 - 30 -     I think that you would have, in effect--if you tighten considerably, if  short rates went up a percentage point--I believe that in that process, long rates would go up     That’s what I was going on to say, Mr Chairman  In the process of  tightening, long rates may go up, but after that tightening is accomplished and those who have  been caught with positions in the process of tightening have adjusted [to] it, then I think that the  long rates would tend to drop back and be only slightly higher than current levels  That’s how I  think it would tend to work     No  I think mortgage rates would tend more than the corporate bond  yields to rise permanently because you begin somewhere to have some effects on--     --intermediation  But then Regulation Q adjustments might be a factor  there     That’s how I started off     That’s one possibility, President Roos  It hasn’t happened thus far     I think that’s right  And if the recent rates of growth in M1, for example,  continued for some months, it’s quite possible you would have feedback effects on long rates   However, I ought to amend that because, if it continues at that rate, and it becomes evident to the  market that this is not being associated with an acceleration of inflation or due to demand factors  but the economic indicators that we get, it might be interpreted as simply a reversal of the  process that has occurred over the past two or three years where people have been desiring to     9/20/77 - 31 -   hold less money, that they’re simply readjusting  And if that interpretation becomes prevalent,  then people would not expect inflation to accelerate, [and] you would not have a reason for long  rates to rise  I’m not sure exactly which interpretation would become prevalent, but the risk you  point to is certainly there     I think another way of putting that, Governor Coldwell, is that that’s  been a factor in the course of this recovery and has kept the three-month bill rate below the  federal funds rate     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     I wouldn’t dispute it over a three- to six-month period  I would [dispute  it], Mr Chairman, over a one-month or two-month period     Governor Wallich, one point I would like to make is that I think the size  of the monthly disturbances we’ve had is a strong random element in an 18 percent and a 13  percent [move]  It may seem supernatural that many of them are occurring on the first month of  the quarter, but we have not been able to think of a reason why that should occur or at least why  it should account for such a large number  So I think there’s a large random element in the  behavior of the monthly numbers  And it’s clearly in the weekly numbers  I don’t think the  random element--if I may use that word, it’s shorthand for a number of things--is that clear if     9/20/77 - 35 -   you go back to successive quarterly numbers or the development thus far in ’77  To me, that  indicates that the shortfall in money, so to speak, relative to the ordinary demand curve, the one  that economists have been estimating year after year, that that shortfall--it’s been getting less,  coming close to an end     For example, and this is, again, sort of fragmentary evidence, and that’s the only kind of  evidence we can have, at least in the background, but our quarterly econometric model had been  underpredicting M1 given GNP, given the actual short rate  The [M1 prediction of the] money  demand equation of that model was always a lot higher than the actual M1  We never used it  literally, but it was always a lot higher  By the second and third quarters of this year, it’s no  longer doing that  It’s no longer underpredicting  The increment in money is about what it’s  been predicting  That is some fragmentary evidence that people have become willing now to  hold more money relative to GNP than before  Now what I can’t answer, and I don’t believe  anyone can, is whether this trend is simply accommodative to the growth in GNP and therefore  does not imply a stronger rate of inflation ahead, or whether it, too, will prove to be somewhat  transitory, and in the period ahead the public will say, well, I do have more money than I need,  therefore I’m going to spend  Therefore velocity will go up, therefore GNP or prices will be  higher than are otherwise being projected  That could occur  I don’t know of any precise way to  answer that  Monetarists have models which in effect say that  I mean, you have a long-run rate  of growth, and if you go above that, you’re going to get a price effect     I’m going at too much length, but the other implication is, of course, if it’s purely  accommodative to current GNP, it doesn’t have implications for the future  Then, if the  Committee doesn’t permit that accommodation, interest rates will rise much more rapidly and  you’ll cut short the recovery  In our staff analysis, we have taken a middle course  We have  assumed that interest rates will not rise quite as much as a literal reading of an econometric  demand curve would suggest; and therefore, the Committee could come within its target range,  maybe not the midpoint, but come within its target range and not seriously affect the economic  projections that Mr Kichline has presented     No  We have noticed that, of course  Currency is a small number     If I could relate it all to transactions in that month, it would be an  obvious correlation because currency tends to reflect transactions  You can’t quite do that, so we  don’t really have an explanation that I know of for that, Governor Coldwell  We could try to  think about it, but we simply do not  It could be just simply a reflection of a bad seasonal in the  month, equally for one or the other  Again that’s just--there’s nothing I can defend rigorously     9/20/77 - 36 -     Yes     Governor Wallich, so I wasn’t misunderstood, let’s say the shortfall  ended up totaling around $40 billion  There’s no evidence that I can see that the public is trying  to recapture that  The evidence that I see is that the shortfall may not get bigger  That is, there’s  no--     Very short lived     Two quarters, that’s correct  Very transitory  It’s not very  [unintelligible]     Yes, oh, it can be impossible  You’d have a 15-20 percent     The demand for money in relation to income in your case     We had not assumed that we’re back on that, Governor Wallich  We  have not assumed that the demand curve--     Now we’re getting into technical things of slopes and demand curves   One way of putting it is, I don’t know whether the slope has ever changed, but you relate money  to GNP as a curve, given interest rates  I assume that curve isn’t shifting down  I’m assuming  that the shift from money to other liquid assets is not occurring to the same extent as it occurred  in the previous two or three years  Therefore, somewhat more of a money increase in relation to  GNP will be revealed because whatever the increase in money in relation to GNP was before, it  had been reduced by just this shifting of levels of money away     I think the clearest answer I could give is that you’re right     Well, we are projecting somewhat higher growth rates in the time and  saving deposit components of M2 and M3, beyond the next month or two, than we would have  had at current interest rate levels  We’re projecting a somewhat higher interest rate than now,  and one of the reasons is that because of the inflation that we currently have relative to other  periods, nominal income is rising faster, and there is some elasticity of these deposits  These  deposits relate to income flows as well as to interest rate levels, and so the higher income flow,  which we believe has sustained growth rates of these time and saving deposits at rates like 7, 8, 9  percent--rates that in the past, at least the low end of those ranges--would have been associated  with crunch periods and the need to raise Regulation Q     So in a sense the flows may give a somewhat artificial feeling that all is well and good  when read literally, but the other part of it to remember, I believe, is that inflation is also  increasing the nominal amount of financing that will be needed with these flows  So there may  become a Regulation Q kind of problem even with flows in the 7, 8, or 9 percent area  Thus far,  the interest rate relationship between time deposit ceiling rates and market rates are not at the  point where, in the past, the [Federal Reserve] Board has raised Regulation Q ceiling rates  We  seem to be some distance from there  And we have not assumed the need to raise ceiling rates  under our alternative B set of assumptions, even into the first half of ’78  But I’m trying to raise  the very cautionary note on that     All of the aggregates have problems as targets  And when you adjust the  ceiling rate, or even when market rates get near the ceiling rate whether you adjust it not--both  [circumstances] create the need, I believe, for special and careful interpretations of M2 and M3   That is, if you raise the ceiling rate, you have to accommodate temporarily to a large rise in M2   If we fail to raise the ceiling rate, I think you’re implicitly saying that you’re willing to see a  much lower growth in M2 in this period when the deposits are shifting out and going into market  instruments  I think that’s just a judgment that the Committee makes at those times  So there  can’t be a mechanical, in any event, M2 or M3  There would have to be adjustments as you get  around ceiling rates     It makes them more uncertain around those times because we can’t be  very certain as to what extent the public is or isn’t going to shift deposits  We’d have to rely on  historical relationships, and they’re very imperfect, as you know      Well, we did     On a seasonally adjusted basis, there appears to be a very small net  decline in deposits, that is, a net outflow, at S&Ls in January and February of 1970, and there  was a similar--very small, 1 percent annual rate--decline in August 1966     I don’t have those figures here, but I’m sure there are some more     I take that back, sir     10/17-18/77 - 19 -           I have no special--there has been, as you pointed out, this phenomenon,  and it may very well be that our weekly seasonals are bad  To a lesser degree, our monthly  seasonals might be bad because they’ll revise somewhat  We don’t have any special reason, but  I would point out that these surges have tended to disappear  So it’s not misleading in the sense  you’re getting an increase which is right away disappearing the next week  But I don’t have any  reason to explain why we had $46 billion rather than 25, which is what we were originally  projecting     That’s correct     [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     President Morris, I’d like to respond to that, and make two comments   In the first place, following each of the bulges, there has been a marked slowing in money  growth  In April, M1--the latest numbers--grew 194 percent, in May it grew 07, and in June  4-1/2  In July, M1 grew 183 percent, in August 5-1/2, and in September 77  For October, at  the last Committee meeting, we of course were projecting around a 7 percent rate of growth  In  the policy period just ending, the Committee adopted a range with a midpoint that was  considerably lower--around 5-1/2 percent  And the growth that has developed has been about a  1-1/2 above our midpoint, I think well within--better than the normal range of error, as Governor  Partee’s subcommittee’s figures point out  So I don’t believe that the staff has mislead the  Committee in any way in this past year [on] what’s likely to happen following these bulges  The  underlying growth rate of M1 over the past six months, I believe, has been somewhat stronger  than we had anticipated     That’s right  It had been stronger than we had anticipated, and I have  not gone back six Bluebooks ago to see what interest rate that we were projecting you would     10/17-18/77 - 57 -         have to have had in the third and fourth quarters to hit your target  I suspect we’re not very far  off those interest rates right now, but I simply don’t have those facts at hand     On the other question, to assess the probability, I would be very cautious myself because  this range here assumes that November is very low and that it is around 1-1/2 percent, and I  think that that is our best estimate  If I were being uneasy, I would be uneasy, of course, that it  would come in a little higher because of the strength in the aggregates that we’ve had very  recently     That’s the basis for our analysis, that growth will slow down in  November and December; indeed, even in January we have slower growth  On our money  market models, you’re beginning to get an effect of 50 or 60 percent in the third and fourth  month and you begin to wear out your effect entirely by the sixth or seventh month  That’s the  analytic basis for this expectation  Also, I do happen to believe that there has been a lot of cash  going out for one reason or another that is not permanent; but that’s not going to be held there,  and I think some of that will be unwound over the succeeding weeks  But if we were going to  err, given very recent experience, it’s possible that we would be erring by underestimating  Our  average error in 1977 is an underestimating error--the average error in 1977 is an underestimate,  just like the average error in ’75 was an overestimate      Mr Chairman,  in the interest of time, I would just like to summarize the  first part of my report, which was to the end of indicating that strong credit demands were a  major force in picking up interest rates in the second and third quarters of this year  According  to the flow of funds accounts, funds raised by nonfinancial sectors had moved up to 18 percent  of GNP, in contrast to 15 to 15-1/2 percent of GNP, in early ’77 and ’76  Part of this represents   intense financial [unintelligible] because of such things as advance funding by state and local  governments on their debt, but it still is a figure which indicates the strengthening of basic credit  demands     We expect credit demands to remain at their recent relatively high levels over the next few  months but not to strengthen further  This itself suggests no additional pressure on interest rates   However, efforts to curb growth in deposits from their recent rate of expansion would tend to be  a countervailing force exerting upward pressure on rates  This potential upward pressure may be  limited in the period immediately ahead, if it appears at all, that investment by the public in  market instruments--in what may have been a temporary and, over the longer run, unwanted     11/15/77 - 32 -         surge of demand deposit holdings--naturally tends to hold down monetary growth at current  rates     The deposit data for early November in any event suggest that growth in M1 will be very  low for the month  However, a considerably more rapid growth rate has been projected for  December in the expectation that underlying demand forces for money will be reasserting  themselves  Thus, it seems likely that any pause in upward rate pressures may be short lived,  assuming that credit demands at least remain near recent levels and do no not drop off  significantly further, and deposit growth is restrained to within the FOMC’s longer-run range     President Balles, I think I’ve said in the past that it’s difficult to explain  the exact timing--that is, why [did we have] a strong growth in April, a strong growth in July,  and a strong [growth] in October  I think it is less difficult to explain why you had something  like a 9 percent rate of growth over the past six or seven months  I think there, it seems to me  that part of the explanation--for the second quarter, at least--was that you did have a strong rate  of growth in nominal GNP  In the third quarter, you don’t have that explanation, and I think  both the second and the third quarters have been affected also by what might be called sort of a  structural readjustment  That is, you [have] had a sharp downward shift in the willingness to  hold demand deposits, for many of the reasons that the Committee knows about, since late ’74   People did not expect that to go on forever, and we seem to have had, for the past six or seven  months, an ending of that downward shift--a readjustment of the public, which may have gone  too far in the past, to adjusting their demand deposit holdings to what they need at current  income levels     Whether this is going to be a temporary phenomenon or one that’s going to be followed by  further downward shifts, or even going in the opposite direction, is something that I don’t have a  very firm opinion on  We have assumed that this is in part a temporary phenomenon, you see, a  temporary re-adaptation; that there will begin to be further downward shifts as the economy  again begins to develop substitutions for money and as uncertainties that have developed in the  last two or three months are being resolved     That’s right, it is in the financial business area that there have been  swings  We have not found anything in that survey to pinpoint any particular sector, and it’s  very difficult to find a strong, compelling reason why that particular sector did swing, is volatile   That survey has, of course, statistical problems, float isn’t netted out  But we found nothing in  there to pinpoint corporations or consumers   SPEAKER(?)  That’s quite right     It has two additional assumptions to those you made  One, that there is  some further downward shift in the demand curve  And, in a sense, almost saying the same  thing, at least my belief, that this 9 to 10 percent expansion over the past four months in M1 is in  some sense going to prove unwanted  That is, it is simply going to be, for whatever reason that  we got it out there, it is going to be reinvested, and that will cause an increase in velocity also   So I would just add that to this other assumption of a downward shift in the demand curve     Midpoint of the range     That is correct     I was assuming, President Roos, that that money would be in large part  unwanted over the long run  It may have had a temporary effect, moderating interest rate  pressures  To the degree that it is unwanted over the longer run, it could be either invested in  money market instruments or other assets, which would put downward pressure on interest rates;  or of course it could be spent [and] put upward pressure on GNP  I’ve been assuming in large  part it will be invested, but I think to a certain degree it will support GNP expansion more  directly      Well, I think that’s essentially the way the staff came out, Governor  Partee  As you know, we did consider even narrower ranges than 1/2 point, which we felt was  unfavorable because it would mean the frequent Committee announcements, frequent, very  frequent Committee decisions on the funds rate, and probably kind of make the decisionmaking  process more complex than it need be     And we also considered wider ranges, in part what you’re thinking of  And we felt, again,  that it would either have adverse market effects, or, if the ranges were so wide that the  Committee really didn’t intend to use them, it was almost a subterfuge relative to what the court  was considering as proper release of information--I think a 1 point range, 3/4 point range, clearly  falls within the shadow area here where you couldn’t claim that it was a subterfuge  And there,  the staff felt that the Committee has been working with a 1/2 point range in this learning period   So it really came down to a judgment, at least in our view, about two ranges, one of which is  only somewhat wider than the other      I might add, in consideration of that, presumably the Committee at that  point is willing to see the rate effect  We were most concerned with the undesired rate  movement  That is, you had a rapid rate increase and there, in order to moderate that, you would  be putting out excess reserves  But if, in a consideration between meetings, presumably that the  Committee is wanting to see the rate effect and you would not--     Oh, I assume so  If you raise the funds rate 1/4 point, you get about a  1/4 point reaction, but that’s not outside of the normal mode       Yes We’ll provide that       [Secretary's note This statement was not found in Committee records]     Mr Chairman, I would also like to inform the Committee of one statistical problem, if I  may  As the Committee knows, we have for some years now been making quarterly revisions of  the money supply related to the nonmember-bank benchmark  Since early 1976, our benchmark  has been based on especially collected daily averages of seven days around the Call Report date- - collected at the time of the Call but not on the Call  We have not adjusted to the March  benchmark, nor have we adjusted to the June benchmark for 1977  The last benchmark  adjustment we made was in December     The reason we haven’t is that we have found enormous and rather startling statistical  problems in the data  In fact, the problems begin not with the March benchmark but with the  December ’76 benchmark, which we have already made  Without going into details before the  Committee, it turns out that the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation], the agency  responsible for this, has simply stopped editing the data starting with December 1976  The data  prior to December ’76, so far as we can tell, and according to them, are all right     This material is now all in their hands, and they are re-running and re-estimating, which  requires them going back to nonmember banks  They tell us that normally they have to go back  to around 2,000 nonmember banks each time; they’re going back for the data for December ’76,  March ’77, June ’77, and they promised us that they will properly edit the September ’77 data   All this should be available early next year  But that is the reason that we have not come  forward with any benchmark adjustments     We have been asked by the public, and our information officer has told them that we’re  having statistical problems with the data       Well, President Black, I properly would not have a clue because this  data is simply inadequate  It’s not a basis on which you can make a judgment  If I gave you my  sense of the clue, there are some nontrivial odds that I would just be misleading you, and I really  rather hesitate to do that       Well, we have checked which of the months and which of the two-month  periods are our estimating periods  The worst month, it turns out--and they’re all relatively bad--    12/19-20/77 - 67 -         the worst month is January and the worst two-month period is December-January  It’s a winner,  if I may use that term, by a small margin  So I think if the Committee were going to widen the  range in reflection of estimating errors, December-January would be a quite appropriate area       It’s not clear whether we’d miss on one side or another     Well, as you recall, January of last year was the first month of a quarter  where we did not get a large increase  So we projected about a 7 percent increase  And our  experience with January really is that we’ve been consistently overprojecting that month,  projecting a too-high rate of growth  That’s been the experience of the last five years  What will  happen this year, I’m really quite uncertain     January ’77?  Well, your memory, Governor Coldwell, is somewhat  better than mine  I don’t remember that particularly     I’m not aware of that     In the money market formulation, it would have been      Another way of putting that, Mr Chairman, is that it takes away the   downward pressure on rates that comes with the expansion in their credit from the support  operations       May I first explain, Mr Chairman, why we felt it necessary to make that   assumption?  If we had not made that assumption, we believe the growth in time deposits at banks  and thrift institutions would have been so low as to carry M2 and M3 to or below the ranges  currently in place  Therefore, we felt in order to have a set of monetary aggregates that was  consistent with the Committee’s desires and to provide a basis consistent with the Committee’s  desires we had to make that assumption for the projections  Our alternative would have been to  assume a higher M1 growth in order to get that M2 and M3 which, of course, would have eased  interest rates and been a fundamentally different monetary policy       Our staff is undertaking contingency plans internally, but I’m not aware of   any staff discussions among the agencies at this point       Well, on average we expect roughly the same magnitudes as last year, or   somewhat larger actually, with the bulk of the increase occurring in March  But this is a projected  pattern at this point and we really prefer to have some experience as January and February develop  We are expecting [refunds to be] a little bit greater in February before incorporating any very  specific assumptions  If this pattern that I have here is accurate, it would indicate to me perhaps a  little more money supply increase in March than we are projecting  We have not made any specific  allowance yet because I think it’s somewhat premature at this time       [Statement--see Appendix]      Yes      You mean the way we calculate the money supply?      No, there’s been no change      We have not received any benchmark numbers, if that’s what you’re   asking       It=s not a Q ceiling problem; it=s a different kind of problem      Thank you, Mr Chairman  We are almost finished with our revision of the   money supply series, which this year includes not only the benchmark and seasonal [revisions], but  we=re also considering some of the changes the Bach Committee has recommended with regard to  certain techniques of measurement  [Those involve] relatively minor conceptual problems  I can  report to the Committee the results of the benchmark; we have now the revised data from the FDIC  and have worked it into the series  [The benchmark revision] would imply for the year 1977 an  increase in the rate of growth for M1 of 04 of a percentage point over what it would be  unbenchmarked  The increase is all in the first half where [the benchmark] increases M1 growth  on the order of 1 percentage point and  there is virtually no change in M1 growth relative to what it  would  be unbenchmarked in the second half  The effect of the benchmark on M2 is to increase its  growth rate for the year 1977 by 02 of a percentage point  I just wanted to report that to the  Committee, Mr Chairman, before its discussion of the long-run ranges       Well, of course, the reason that we have not lowered [the range for] M2,   whereas we lowered [that for] M3, is because the CDs have relatively more weight in M2; they=re  in both M2 and M3, but they have relatively more weight in M2  The CDs are quite volatile, but I  would hesitate to say that the estimate of that particular component is subject to more error than our  estimate of deposits that are subject to ceilings  I don=t have a basis for saying that that=s subject to  more error than the others       I should add that we have not assumed that the thrifts become active in that   market      Yes, of 50 basis points on time deposits      Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Statement--see Appendix]       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our latest projections of the aggregates   indicate that in the February-March period M1 is expected to grow at an annual rate of 1/2 percent   That would be just below the range of 1 to 6 percent adopted by the Committee for that period   The final data--or reasonably final data--we have for February indicate a drop in M1 of about 4     3/10/78              13  percent at an annual rate  We have preliminary data for the first week of March, and assuming a  further growth from that point, we would expect March to grow at about a 5 percent annual rate,  thus giving us the 1/2 percent for the two-month period     M2 is not quite as weak relative to the Committee’s ranges as M1, but it is close to the   bottom  For M2 we have a February growth rate of about 3-1/2 percent  We are expecting March,  on the basis on the preliminary data for the first week, to grow around 7 percent Thus, for the  February-March period, we have a growth rate for M2 of around 52 percent as compared with the  range adopted by the FOMC of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent      I might add one other point, Mr Chairman, which is that to a considerable extent I believe   this weakness may reflect the prolongation of the coal strike, relative to what we had expected, as  well as the severe weather throughout the country  Thus, to a great extent, it may represent  temporary factors  So it seems quite plausible that later this spring we may get a resurgence of  growth in the money supply, assuming a fundamental strength in the economy        Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Statement--see Appendix]       3/21/78              41    September will be the first benchmark date we can compare with the   sample, so we want to make that comparison  We really prefer to make two comparisons before  we incorporate the continuing sample into our regularly reported data  We have not done so  Also,  one strata of the sample--and I don’t remember exactly which one--is wrong  The reporting is  wrong and we’re working on correcting that  We had hoped that by around midyear we would  have everything straightened out and if our tests showed that the sample was giving reasonable  results--and the only test we can have is to compare with the benchmark--to incorporate it at about  that time  But we are not [yet] in a position to incorporate them       No, no  We have it and we’ve been trying to get it straightened out but   we have not been incorporating it      For internal reasons they did not edit the benchmarks  They stopped   editing in December of last year  The edit they performed was not an edit in any sense of the word      Well, I have never been able to see any significance of past behavior of   the base in relation to future money growth  We have a lagged reserve requirements system; that  is, reserves today relate to deposits yesterday so that in itself says the reserves are quite passive   Secondly, we control the federal funds rate; we do not make an effort to control reserves and,  therefore, future money growth will depend on what we, in fact, will permit to happen to the  federal funds rate in the future as well as on what we have permitted to happen in the past  So I  don’t think in that context that the reserve base past has very much significance to the reserve base  future  It’s [relevant] only to the extent that it may reflect rapid money growth or something like  that in the past, which feeds through and affects GNP, which feeds demands for money in future  It  would be that sort of indirect effect but certainly not any direct correlation       Yes      Yes, we have reduced the seasonal factor  April’s rate rose around 6-1/2   percentage points so the 2-month growth rate would be about 3 percentage points higher if we were  on the old seasonal  On the other hand, we have raised January’s and February’s       Governor Partee may wish to speak to the question of whether there are   discussions with the other agencies      I should add, President Guffey, that the staff has been developing its own   contingency plans so that discussions, when they are ready to go, can be undertaken very promptly      Our staff projections are on a preliminary basis      We have been assuming that people do not withdraw--that is, that the   penalty is so great  In fact, it was that assumption that really got us to assuming a somewhat  stronger inflow into thrifts in the first quarter than actually developed, given the interest rates       I think that there has been more sensitivity on the part of investors to the   interest rates  Greater sensitivity has developed as the years have progressed, and I think there has  been a very prompt move into other securities and money market funds, at least with new money-- money that would otherwise be invested  I don’t have any evidence myself as to whether there  have been withdrawals or whether our assumption is correct that there really haven’t been many  withdrawals       That’s what makes me a little leery in a sense about the next notch up   because thus far there has been a reasonably competitive relationship between long-term  certificates at thrifts and Treasury securities  If you got, say, 25 or 30 basis points more in the  4- to  7-year area, then it might trigger a very large movement of these maturing certificates that were  originally in the 4-year area--perhaps into Treasuries        President Volcker, the staff at the moment has been giving this   considerable thought and we are planning around midyear or before--I hope in late May or early  June--to have a memo for discussion purposes which would propose changes in M1, M2, M3, and  M4  We’d like to have discussion, of course, within the System and perhaps have it available for  discussion outside the System  That’s the state of our plans at the moment       Around there      No, I have no comment, Mr Chairman      I didn’t know whether you were asking for an opinion on the policy      Well, Mr Chairman, my view would be that it would be desirable to   lower the top end of the M1 range just to guard against excessive growth beginning without any  response on the part of the Committee  I would not in any way really want to lower the bottom of  the range because I would be somewhat fearful that if we had three straight months of low growth,  as I believe Governor Jackson mentioned, that would indicate either that the economy was not as  strong as we expected or that Federal Reserve policy was going to restrain growth below what is  desirable       I had in mind 4-1/2 but the difference is very small, so it’s not a matter of   much importance      Yes, at the last meeting there was a discussion of operations in Federal   agency issues, particularly with regard to their relationship to their required coverage behind  currency and the possibility of developing a two-way market including sales of agency issues  Mr  Sternlight and I are planning to have a joint memo to the Committee by the next meeting, God  willing  If we fail that, certainly by May [it will be done] but we’re trying for the next meeting        Yes, that is correct       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I might first make three small statistical points  of background and then present some of the various arguments that the Committee might wish to  consider on whether they wish to lower, raise, or maintain the existing long-run ranges for the  aggregates  As background I might first mention that actual growth in the first quarter of l978 for  M1 was at a 51 percent annual rate, around the middle of the range currently in place  Growth in  that quarter in both M2 and M3 was near the lower limits of their ranges, however  For the year  ending with the first quarter of l978, the year just past, growth of M2 and M3--because of this drop- off in the first quarter--was within the ranges applicable to that period, which had been established  in April l977  M2 over this past year expanded 86 percent and M3 104 percent  The ranges had  been 7 to 9-1/2 for M2 and 8-1/2 to 11 for M3  Growth in M1 in the year just past was at a 7  percent rate, which was somewhat above the 6-1/2 percent upper limit for that range that had been  adopted earlier  Thus the slowing of growth in the first quarter is starting to bring growth of the  aggregates back into their ranges  And M2 and M3 growth over the quarters ahead could even fall  short of the present ranges if short-term market rates stay at or rise from the current levels  In light  of that risk, the staff has built in upward adjustment in the Regulation Q ceiling rates sometime in  the summer in the projections that are presented in the Bluebook        4/18/78             27   I would like now to suggest some of the arguments for and against lowering or raising the  existing M1 range  There are about three arguments for lowering the M1 range--three important  ones  One is that it would add credibility to the Administration’s determination to curb inflation   Second, of course, it would be in line with the Federal Reserve’s effort to reduce monetary growth  rates gradually to those consistent with reasonable price stability  And third, I believe a lowering  of the range would enhance the international value of the dollar and to that degree would be  anti-inflationary     There are, however, also compelling arguments for raising the existing M1 range or its upper  limit  Given upward cost pressures that are presently built into the economy, economic growth  sufficient to reduce unemployment further may require expansion in M1 at or above the 6-1/2  percent upper limit  Secondly, if M1 growth is to be 6-1/2 percent or less over the next year and  GNP expands by around 12-1/2 percent, as the staff projects, income velocity of M1 will have to  rise by about 6 percent or more  However, the income velocity of M1 in the most recent two years  of this expansion--that is, in the last two of the 3-year expansion--has increased only by 2-3/4 to 3  percent in each year  That was at the low end of the range of experience in similar stages of  previous expansions  Thus, the recent shift toward less velocity growth suggests the need for  additional money growth     There are also arguments for maintaining the present M1 range, of course  An increase in the  range, under current conditions, would erode the credibility of the Federal Reserve’s determination  to curb inflation and would not appear supportive of the President’s anti-inflation program and it  might increase inflationary expectations  On the other hand, a reduction in the range would not  provide for adequate money growth to finance the desired expansion in real economic activity  given built-in price pressures  Finally, on this point, I might mention that the present range does  contemplate a slowing in actual M1 growth from the relatively rapid pace of l977  Such a slowing,  if accomplished, will work against accelerating inflationary forces and lay the basis for a lessening  of price pressures later  And of course, it is the actual behavior of M1 rather than the targeted  behavior which does affect the market view      Finally, I would like to make just three or four points, Mr Chairman, with regard to M2 and  M3  These ranges could be lowered slightly in adjustment to the continued relatively low growth  in the interest-bearing deposit components of M2 and M3  A second point, on the other hand, is  that a reduction in the ranges, especially for M3, would raise questions about the adequacy of credit  to finance borrowers who rely on institutional sources [of funds]--particularly home buyers  The  Committee may also wish to bear in mind that the midpoints of the current ranges, at 7-3/4 percent  for M2 and 8-3/4 percent for M3, are well below average annual growth rates in these aggregates  since l97l  In the case of M2, the growth rate is only about l/2 percentage point above its average  annual rate of increase from l965 through l970, a period in which growth was sharply curtailed in  the two credit crunch years of l966 and l969   Finally, the same point with regard to velocity of M1  also applies to the velocity of M2 and M3  Those are the considerations I had, Mr Chairman       Well, we have been actually using the month-end in developing these  The  monthly average is an average of Wednesday numbers at the moment and I don’t think it makes  any substantial difference over the 12-month period for those two measures  This is not the bank  credit proxy, of course       I think it is better to have the monthly average just to avoid the little blips       Our projection of what is consistent with the [unintelligible] at 6-1/2  percent M1  And the somewhat higher bank credit, at 7-1/2 to 10-1/2, is our projection of what  would be consistent with the existing ranges       I would see no problem with that       No, that isn’t what is in the testimony       President Willes, we were tentatively thinking of suggesting that you use  wording [such as]  “Given the ranges for M1, M2, and M3, the associated range for bank credit  would be…” to give it that slight dimension of not quite the same importance       The staff of the subcommittee has work under way on that       Mr Chairman, in view of the hour I think I would just note that the--       I was assuming that the Committee members might be  I would just note  that the Bluebook simply indicates that we now expect M1 growth to accelerate  That is our  projection  And the short-run range, particularly for M1, that you see is well above the long-run  range that the Committee adopted  This again reflects our view that nominal GNP is expanding  rapidly  I don’t think I really need to add much more to that at this point       Well, the aggregates do fluctuate quite substantially from month to month   In the Bluebook, of course, we are not setting targets; we are just trying to estimate what is likely to  happen given a particular interest rate pattern  That is why I tried to make a point that what we  think is going to happen, if we don’t change interest rates, is growth above the target       In general, the Committee might want to consider short-run targets  different from the long-run targets because there are often special factors one could point to that  this month are affecting the money supply especially, which might lead to offsets later  In this  particular case, they are not largely due to special factors       It’s April 26       If you were planning to tighten, it might be advisable to get it in motion  before the announcements so the markets have a chance to revise their expectations        Thank you, Mr Chairman  The data on M1 that came in for the week  ending April 26 were somewhat stronger than we had been anticipating--on the order of about $1  billion stronger--and the very preliminary data we have for the week of May 3 suggest added  strength  On the basis of those numbers, our estimate for the rate of growth in M1 in April, which  last week had been 14-1/2 percent, is now, in round numbers, about 17 percent  And our estimate  for the rate of growth in May, given the high starting point we now see around the May 3rd week,  is up to around 8-3/4 percent  Thus the 2-month growth for [April and] May is running at around a  13 percent annual rate, well above the 8-1/2 percent upper end of the range decided on by the  FOMC at the last meeting  M2, on the other hand, is not showing as much strength relative to its  range  It is not above the top of its range as is M1  Time and savings deposits have been running a  shade weaker than had been projected at the time of the FOMC meeting; thus the strength in M2 is  purely the result of the strength in M1, which is approximately 3/7ths of M2 in weight  We now  have an April estimate for M2 of 107 percent, a May estimate of 81 percent, and for the two  months an estimate of around 9-1/2 percent, which is the upper limit of the range decided on by the  FOMC      I’d like to add two or three points to that, Mr Chairman, if I may, to put it in a little  perspective  For M1, that April growth rate would bring the growth from the fourth quarter  average to April ’78 to 69 percent at an annual rate  If our May estimate is correct, the growth  from the fourth quarter average to May would be 72 percent, given the somewhat slower growth  that we had, of course, in the first two or three months of the year  For M2, [comparable] numbers  would be 7 and 73 percent  Thus, on that basis, M1 growth would be a shade above the upper end  of the longer-run range and M2 growth would be well within the longer-run range from the fourth  quarter to either the April or May dates  Secondly, we have made an effort to see what factors may  be causing this very rapid growth in April  Perhaps the fundamental one we’d mention is the  upward revision in nominal GNP growth for the second quarter, which now seems to be close to 17     5/5/78              2  percent at an annual rate, which Mr Kichline will report on shortly  [With] such an annual rate of  growth, of course, M1 is likely to grow quite rapidly     A second point is that there has been in April a marked increase in the amount of  [non-withheld] tax payments getting to the Treasury  In April of this year, [non-withheld] tax  payments are over $21 billion  The average of such payments in the preceding three years was  around $15-1/2 billion, so there is an overage on the order of $6 billion  To the extent people  mobilize demand deposits in order to make these payments, that mobilization tends to raise the  level of the money supply  Our seasonals wouldn’t have caught up to the $6 billion overage; they  would have allowed for the increasing amount last year and in the years before but not that big of  an increase  To the extent that this is affecting money growth, it might add anywhere from 4 to 8  percentage points, in round terms, to the April rate of growth, which we really had not allowed for  in setting up our estimates earlier      [If that] explanation is correct, we would expect the level for May 3rd to have been coming  back and it hasn’t, so that [puts] some doubt on the explanation  But more than that, if the  explanation is to be accurate and if the May 3rd level doesn’t come back, surely for May 10th it  would have to come back sharply--maybe with a drop on the order of $5 billion We’ve allowed  only about a $2 billion drop for that week in our projections, so there is some uncertainty in our  minds as to what exactly will happen  If it comes back to the earlier levels we’ve been projecting,  which would be a drop on the order of $4 or $5 billion, the May rate of growth would be  substantially lower than 8 percent; it ought to be approaching 1 or 2 percent rather than 8 percent  So there is some question as to whether we do or don’t have a temporary factor that’s going to  [reverse]  There is either going to be a sharp comeback or not     The third special factor is the stock market, where activity rose radically in mid-month and  has remained relatively high subsequently  We have not been able to find any relationship thus far  between M1 growth and stock market activity in a sense of causation  I believe there probably is  some effect from a special unexpected activity [but we’ve] not been able to quantify that or to find  any consistent relationship in the past thus far   That’s all I have, Mr Chairman       Well, I don’t have current figures on M3 and M4, Willis  But the savings  flows at thrifts have been running only a shade higher than they were in January and February, so I  think M3 would be well within its long-run range, just like M2  Banks have continued to issue  large amounts of negotiable CDs, so of all the Ms [have been strong]; M4 is the one that had been  showing the most strength relative to its 1977 performance up until this recent behavior of M1 and  I would think M4 would continue on that trend        Well, Mr Chairman, I would just like to make a few comments with regard  to the evaluation of M1 and M2 [and] its implications for current policy  We had some time past  looked at variability of M1 and M2 in the short run and in the long run  I think as background  some of that may be interesting to Committee members  I don’t think the results would be  unexpected  These are measures I had from 1960 through mid-1977, and I don’t think anything in  recent results would change this  That is, the ’77 data for M1 would be somewhat smoother  because the old seasonals were revised  But we found that on a week-to-week and month-to-month  basis, the variability of M1 is, of course, quite a bit higher--less so monthly than weekly--than the  variability of M2, using a number of  measures of variability  We had looked at 3 or 4 standard  deviations, average absolute deviation from the mean, average absolute change in the series itself   By any of these measures the variability of M1 was higher than the variability of M2  However, if  you lengthen the period to a quarter, the results change  That is, it is no longer the case that the  variability of M1 was noticeably higher than the variability of M2  In fact, over a long period in  the sense of the absolute amount of the variability, there was very little difference  M1 had become  somewhat more variable in the periods since ’73, but going back 17 or 18 years there was no  discernable difference at all  And if you lengthen the period even further to a year, M1 is less  variable than M2  It shows less variability by these various measures  So I think the general rule  is, that as the time period lengthens, M1 becomes a more “stable indicator” than M2  Thus, I think  the trend of M1--and the trend over a fairly modest period of a quarter or so--can be said to have no  less significance than the trend of M2, in this limited statistical sense that I’m talking about      Well, that brings up the question of what have been the trends recently in M1 and M2  And  of course, I think the April result for M1, which also caused M2 to be strong, clearly should be  discounted  But over the 12-month period ending in April, M1 grew at a 73 percent annual rate,  above the upper limit of the 4 to 6-1/2 percent range  For the 5-month period from the fourth-  quarter average [to] April, M1 also grew at a 73 percent annual rate  Of course, for the year 1977,  M1 had grown at a 78 percent annual rate  So I would say that the evidence is fairly clear--and it’s  buttressed by just looking at those charts we put in the Bluebook--that M1 is running above the  Committee’s 4 to 6-1/2 percent range  M2, if you look at the 12-month April-over-April period,  rose at an 82 percent rate  And if you look at the 5-month period from the fourth-quarter average  to April, it grew at a 72 percent rate  So the growth rate of M2 is well within the Committee’s  6-1/2 to 9 percent range over these periods, again as is clear from the charts that we introduced in  the Bluebook     I think the question that then comes up for the Committee in its decisionmaking--and it can  be put fairly starkly--is  If you had your choice of having M1 out of  its range but M2 in, or having  M2 out of its range and M1 in, what in the present circumstances would you choose?  That puts it  in somewhat of an extreme way but I don’t think it’s terribly unrealistic  And I think at the  moment I would take M2 in its range, so long as M1--again speaking in a trend way--is growing  less than last year  [Its] growth rate was 78 percent and [it is] growing less by, say, on the order of  magnitude of a percentage point or so       5/16/78              25   I have three reasons  First, a significantly slower rate of growth of M1 than last year would in  any event represent progress in curtailing inflation  The realistic growth rates in M1 were 78  percent last year and in 1976 considerably higher--the 57 percent after allowances were made for  shifts into money from other deposits [and] shifts out of money into other deposits such as business  saving deposits  Secondly, I believe that M1 may be mis-specified; that is, the velocity implied by  M1 growth in the 4 to 6-1/2 percent range is unrealistic under current circumstances  And a higher  rate of growth in M1 than the Committee’s range may be required for any desirable GNP outcome   And thirdly, if M2 and M3 have to be below their ranges, if M1 is within its range, I believe there  are serious implications for a credit crunch as it affects thrift institutions in any such very low  number      Clearly, I don’t mean by that that M1 can be or should be ignored  First, so far as all our  research goes, M1 has considerable information content; the behavior of M1 relative to its  projections does tell us something about GNP  When it’s running strong, it apparently tells us GNP  will be strengthening  And when it’s running weak, it seems to tell us the opposite  Work done by  Mr Kalchbrenner and his group seems to bear this out  Secondly, if M1 is running very high  relative to its current trend, I think that is clearly in an inflationary direction  And thirdly, we have  a problem with M2 because of the artificiality of Q ceiling rates; and that problem is going to be  important in the months to come because the new ceiling rates go into effect June 1  We have  made some allowance for that in our projection in the Bluebook, but as Mr Balles brought out in  the discussion, we can not be certain of the response to a new instrument such as this new  certificate      Finally, Mr Chairman, I would point out that the staff does expect that interest rates will rise  from here on, even if M1 is to be kept at a rate of growth of around 7-1/4 percent  And certainly  they will rise much as indicated in the Bluebook for lower rates of growth  I think that in terms of  current decisionmaking, if FOMC members are determined to lower M1 growth into a 4 to 6-1/2  percent range, there’s little reason to wait before permitting interest rates to rise, given the distance  we think it would have to go  On the other hand, if FOMC members wish to give more weight to  M2 relative to M1 and are willing to countenance this relatively high M1 relative to its range, then  there is certainly a stronger argument for waiting now and appraising the future before permitting  further interest rate increases  Those are my comments       Well, President Roos, the monetary base is certainly controllable and in my  view is probably more controllable than M1  You have member bank borrowing [in] it, which is  not exactly a controllable item  But [it’s] more controllable than M1 or M2  We simply can’t be  certain at what rate of growth you should control the monetary base because the demand for  monetary base depends on the public demand for demand deposits, time deposits, and currency     5/16/78              26  relative to other liquid assets  So the problem that I see with the monetary base is to know what  rate of growth to have, because in order to make that determination you have to make a prior  determination about what you want in currency and demand deposits and other time deposits   You  don’t eliminate any of the problems we now have       That would get me into a long essay  I don’t think that anyone could take  that much time       The one factor that we could see that is different this year was that the  amount of nonwithheld tax payments paid by individuals in April was $6 billion higher than it had  been in the previous three years on average  Now that $6 billion--if you make the assumption that  people sold other securities and transferred time deposits into cash to make that payment, then that  $6 billion, let us say, would go into demand deposits  And if it stayed in there for a week on  average, that little fact itself would add $18 billion on a monthly average [at an annual rate; a week  is 1/4 of a month so in terms of an annual rate of growth for the month the calculation would be]  1/4 of $6 billion times 12, which is around 5 or 6 percentage points on M1  [Those funds] would  be drawn down but just being in there for a week would add 5 or 6 percentage points to growth of  M1  Then we have further evidence that the Treasury was processing the money that came in  slowly, so [the $6 billion] might have stayed in [demand deposits for] more than a week  Clearly,  people don’t transfer all that money; they make some payments out of existing accounts  So we  have been saying that in round numbers this little fact--the greater nonwithheld payments and the  slower processing by the Treasury--might have temporarily added 4 to 8 percentage points to the  growth rate of M1 in April     Now, given the usual patterns of inflow to the Treasury and even with some slowing in their  depositing checks into their own account, we would have expected that to come out in the first  week of May and it didn’t  It went to around $4 billion  But our preliminary data for the second  week of May suggest a drop of about $4 billion  So there is some evidence of things beginning to  calm down to a more normal level  However, the average for those two weeks in May is not  sufficiently low to believe that you’re going to have all these 8 percentage points go away and get a  May growth rate of around zero, which is what would be required  So we are not able to put  substantial credence into that explanation  We’re not able to say for sure that the underlying  growth rate is 7 percent and you’re going to get 19 percent with a zero or negative in May and     5/16/78              27  [return to] the underlying growth rate  We just don’t have the evidence to substantiate a reasonable  explanation  So it may very well be that the underlying growth rate for M1 is stronger than on the  order of 7 percent  It’s clearly stronger in the second quarter because of a large rebound in nominal  GNP calling for transactions cash  So that’s why we’ve come up with a 9 percent projection,  possibly with a margin of error that’s close to 1 or 2 percent       The projection assumes a further increase in Q ceilings  That’s the first  thing the projection assumes, which we now do not have  And secondly, the projection is in some  sense a maximum likelihood, but I don’t think it means that the probability is over 50 percent  I  think that if you order the probabilities, the projection may be a modal one and that mode may be  20 percent and you have 19 percent and 18 percent and 17 percent for a lot of the other ones       Well, it can be on either side       I can’t really give you a guess  I think you have to go through the GNP  projection because if you have higher taxes than you would otherwise have or reduced spending,  you clearly have to go to the GNP projections and through that assess money demand  So offhand  I really couldn’t give you an estimate, Governor Wallich, and I don’t know whether we’ve gone  through that projection method yet       5/16/78              28     Yes       That’s right  To hold 7-1/4 we think you’d have that interest rate rise, but  of course not at the levels we had in the Bluebook       That’s our thought, yes--given recent trends in velocity       I’m talking about individuals       No, that was individuals only on the nonwithheld [taxes]  I would relate  the strong surge in business loans to the strength of the economy; and the strong demands for cash  in the economy had an effect on M1  I think they are related facts, but through the effect on the  economy       5/16/78              29     No, no, that was not it       I have the figure right here--98 percent       6-1/2 for M1       For the quarter it would be 92       Mr Chairman I think that--       That affects the interpretations of policy, I think  For example, when the  Committee adopted the 3 to 8 percent range, it was not clear to me from the discussion that they  wanted to lower the midpoint or whether they were just saying that you don’t worry too much if  [growth hits the low] end and worry more when it gets to the high end   So it’s the limits that got to  be more important, even with the aggregates directive or the money market  So, really, I think it  depends on a sense of the interpretation of the Committee’s wishes, no matter what the form of the  directive       I think that wording can be interpreted asymmetrically, if the Committee  wishes       Or sensitive to up or down       I was asking if the Committee is more sensitive to moving above the  midpoint rather than [below]        Well, I just wanted to mention this Mr Roos indicated that [the figures  he cited] were the projections in the Bluebook, but they are simply the results of arithmetic   That is, if the Committee is going to achieve a 5-1/4 percent growth [in M1] Q1-to-Q1, that=s the  arithmetic of it  Next quarter, depending on the Committee=s attitude toward the high rate of  growth in the second quarter--whether it compensates for it or not--those rates are [likely to be]  substantially higher       [Statement--see Appendix]       Well, President Eastburn, if I abstract from that 2-1/2 percent and assume  that the Committee permits this--doesn=t attempt to make up, in effect, for the second-quarter  overshoot and doesn=t attempt to make up for the third-quarter overshoot--then I believe that it is  quite possible that interest rates will begin to level out for a while  But then beyond that point,  where you then get into the question of whether that generates further inflation, you wouldn=t have a  leveling out for long  That would have to be assessed, of course, depending on the economy at that  point  But in terms of this arithmetic exercise I see no hope  If I track past Committee behavior and  average it out, I believe there=s some hope for the short run       No, I think [people might ask] to be sure it’s not a misprint  [Unintelligible]       Does that mean daily average?   I just want to be sure I understand,  President Volcker, because that weekly average was in there to give day-to-day flexibility and--       6/20/78                41     So the Desk isn=t tied each day [to a] target; when it changes it would be an  average--       Mr Chairman, if I might add  If the Committee adopts this form of a  directive, the staff would anticipate providing these two alternative languages each time just as it  provided a money market directive and an aggregates directive       The only practical problem may be that I think Peter has been somewhat  reluctant to undertake his normal operations in agency issues because this is pending  If he felt free  to do that, I see no problems in holding     SPEAKER(?)  In sales you mean?       Both sales and purchases       Mr Chairman, we have a very simple suggestion, I think  It simply is that  the Desk cut down a little bit on its buying, which it has done already--probably more so than it  would have if the decision had already been made  And that wouldn=t be inconsistent with  occasionally letting an agency [issue] run off, just as occasionally a bill is       In some sense, Mr Sternlight and I view this as a rather simple--       Mr Chairman, you don=t mean that the Desk would have to go out and sell?       We send it out very promptly  It goes out within 30 or 45 minutes  How  long it takes to get there, I=m not sure        President Balles, for purposes of the projection, I think the point you raise  doesn’t matter because the projections are based on a 6-1/4 percent rate of growth in M1  abstracting from automatic transfers  If there’s automatic transfers, that rate of growth may indeed  be lower but if you added back in the shifts that occurred as a result of the automatic transfers  you’d be back to 6-1/4 percent  It’s as if the rate of growth in M1 is 6-1/4 percent and with  automatic transfers it was reduced to 4-1/4 percent; you’d add back in the extent of the shift from  demand to saving deposits and you’d be back to 6-1/4 percent  So the fact of automatic transfers  doesn’t really matter in the way the projection is developed       7/18/78              5     President Balles, excuse me, but Jim’s forecast assumes the midpoint of the  M2 range       Yes  It is a difference of the assumption on the relationship--       Mr Chairman, I would first like to give some factual background for the  Committee to ponder in considering its decision on the longer-run aggregates ranges  And then I’ll  present, in effect, some arguments for and against certain changes with regard to M1 and the  broader aggregates  On factual background I would note--and I’m sure the Committee is well  aware of it--that in the year ending with the second quarter of l978, the most recent policy year, M1  and bank credit ran well above the top ends of their ranges  M1 growth in the year just ending was  around 79 percent; the top end of the M1 range was 6-1/2  Bank credit was running 113 percent;  the top end of its range was 10 percent when [a range for] the Q2 ’77 to Q2 ’78 period was  established and it is now 10-1/2 percent  On the other hand, M2 and M3 have been running well  within their ranges  M2 growth in the year ending with the second quarter of 1978 was at 86  percent; the top end of its range is now 9 and it was 9-1/2  And M3 growth was around 99  percent; the top end of its range was 11 and is now 10      In the first half of l978 the same set of relationships obtained  M1 and bank credit were  above their ranges by about the same amounts as they had been for the full year  M2 and M3,  however, were further within their ranges; M2 growth in the first half of this year [slowed] to 77  percent and M3 to 79 percent  So very clearly we have a phenomenon where M1 growth, as well     7/18/78              20  as bank credit, is strong relative to the whole set of relationships that the Committee had viewed   The stronger growth in M1 reflects, we believe, the shift in demand for M1 relative to GNP  It is  stronger than the staff and the Committee had earlier assumed  There are a variety of ways of  looking at that and one of the methods most commonly employed--and the one we have used--is to  compare the money growth predicted by the money demand equation in our quarterly econometric  model with what actually happened That is, the model says there’s a relationship between M1  growth and GNP and certain short-term interest rates with a certain lag structure  What did the  model predict relative to what actually happened?  For about eleven straight quarters, beginning  with the fourth quarter of [l974], the model was very consistently predicting more M1 growth given  the GNP and interest rates than we actually got  That’s what we kept referring to as the downward  drift in money relative to GNP   Since then, in the last four quarters--the third and fourth quarters  of 1977 and the first and second quarters of l978--there has not been any further downward shift in  terms of what the model would have predicted  The increase in money predicted by the model has  been virtually the actual increase in money, given GNP and interest rates     Our assumption that is built into the GNP forecast and built into the Bluebook is that there  will be a further downward drift again of modest proportions--about l8 percentage points of  downward drift  That is based on the idea that with interest rates as high as they are and are  becoming, institutions will more actively market substitutes for money  And [our view is] that the  public has been sensitized since l974 to their earnings loss with high interest rates, compounded by  the effect of inflation, so we believe they will become more desirous of substituting  It is quite  likely that the model, which was through l974, does not have that built in  So that is the basis for  our assumption of a further downward drift  I might add that there are other ways of looking at  this The DRI model money demand equation would predict money pretty much as we predicted it,  for GNP and interest rates  That is, if you look at that model, you would not observe a downward  drift given the set of relationships between money, GNP, and interest rates that we have predicted   I hasten to add that most other models, however, would give a downward drift     With that background, I would like to present some argumentation with regard to Ml, M2,  and M3  The fact that money demand has been running strong, of course, is the reason why we  have assumed a 6-1/4 percent M1 increase  Now, this assumption in itself argues for raising the  range  In fact, it argues for making 6-1/4 percent the midpoint  Given the normal error distribution  around our assumption of a midpoint, it would argue for raising the range to where 6-1/4 is the  midpoint--somewhere in the range of a little less than 5 to a little less than 8 percent  On the other  hand, automatic transfers, which will go into effect on November 1, suggest that actual money  growth may be lower than 6-1/4 percent or so because people will shift out of demand deposits into  savings deposits in some amount  Thus, in practice, it may be desirable to raise only the upper end  of the range by some amount--and not necessarily raise the whole range--to take account of this  shift in money demand  Any increase would have adverse announcement effects regarding the  willingness of the Committee to fight inflation  But the larger the increase, the greater the risk of  these effects and the more likely it is that the market will believe that the Committee may have  given up some on the fight against inflation  To minimize such a possibility, the Committee may  wish to consider an increase of the upper [end] of the range of only l/2 percentage point  I think  this sort of an increase would minimize the adverse announcement effects; the upper end would  still be lower than recent growth rates, so it would point in the direction of restraint  And it might  just be attainable  On the other hand, if you do that, it may make the market come to believe that     7/18/78              21  you have some intention of really hitting it or otherwise why would you make such an adjustment   Therefore, if you don’t hit it, there is some danger of eroding credibility even further      With regard to the broader money supply ranges, they too, like M1, imply a substantial rise in  velocity over the next year relative to historical experience  I believe they might be attained,  however, given the movement out of deposits to market instruments that we have been seeing and  that is likely to develop, as interest rates remain well above ceiling rates  Thus, the recent  experience of being within their ranges clearly suggests no need for an upward adjustment at this  time, even though the velocity increases are somewhat out of keeping with historical experience   In any event, any upward adjustment--particularly if M1 were adjusted upward--would be clearly  interpreted as an inflationary move and would be quite counterproductive from the Committee’s  viewpoint  The Committee may also wish to consider lowering these ranges, particularly if M1  were adjusted upward as a countervailing move to that  I believe there are strong arguments  against lowering these ranges, against even dropping the lower end but not touching the top end   The principal argument, of course, is that that would very clearly imply considerable pressure on  thrift institutions and even banks to a degree and more pressure than may be desirable given the  present stringency in the mortgage market      Finally, Mr Chairman, the issue about dropping M1 entirely has been raised  The main  argument for that at this point, of course, is that there are large uncertainties with respect to the  automatic transfers, which may go into effect after November l  Thus, it is very difficult to set a  range because one does not know how promptly and to what degree the public or the banks are  going to respond to this innovation  In addition, of course, there is a certain awkwardness about the  range because the actual growth has been so far out of line with the target; this provides a kind of  incentive to ditch the target and there is a good reason      There are arguments against dropping it and I believe some fairly strong ones  First, the  automatic transfers will not be effective until November l and, in any event, there are still legal  uncertainties  We have not had a ruling on the request for an injunction yet  Second, even if it is  dropped, the market probably will still pay attention to M1--and I believe with very good reason,  since our research indicates that M1 is the principal financial element that foreshadows GNP and,  therefore, it is a sensitive monetary indicator  And people are unlikely to give up on it unless there  is a very strong and obvious technological innovation that is disturbing it  Thirdly, I don’t believe  dropping M1 will solve the problem of market attention to weekly money supply figures  That  problem, I think, has been abating recently  In any event, without Ml the market will focus on M2,  which has also very large variations in it--and larger than Ml  For example, M2 rose $5 billion in  the week of July 5       Finally, Mr Chairman, and in a way convincing to me, I believe that it would be very  undesirable for the Committee to be left with only one operating variable in the short run  [unintelligible] at the moment--that is, M2  For M3, we don’t have data to permit that to be a  short-run operating range  And I believe two [variables] are preferable from the viewpoint of  providing both operational flexibility and a better basis for judging special circumstances  For  example, it would be desirable to have a less interest-sensitive M1 in place as a target, in judging  M2 in a period when a decline in market rates may be leading to reintermediation and vice versa in     7/18/78              22  a period when a rise in market interest rates may be leading to disintermediation  Mr Chairman,  those are the comments that I would offer to the Committee on these issues       We used four New England states as an upper limit, not as the average, of  course       President Volcker, what I was trying to say was that if you did not have  automatic transfers, it would be like saying [6-1/2] was the midpoint of a range which would be  more like 5 to 8 [these] days       Well, I--       We will get a balanced group and then I would like to come up with four or  five options  I wonder whether we will have three or four dissident opinions       No, I have no comments       No, I don’t, Mr Chairman       Mr Chairman, I certainly share Peter’s view [given] that the market had  been at 8 yesterday and it’s at 7-15/16 today  It is going to be difficult to fine-tune it  So, I would  think that it may be desirable for the Committee to decide whether it should stay right around  where it is, whatever that is--if it’s a 7-3/4 to 7-7/8 range--until the aggregates more clearly suggest  [you ought] to let it go up toward the 8 percent  I think you would end up somewhere above 7-3/4  percent for a while or a shade above  Then if the aggregates come in strong relative to the decided     7/18/78              45  ranges, you could just let it go to 8  But I think an effort to push it to 7-7/8 will probably push it to  8       Mr Chairman, may I suggest that the Committee could simply instruct the  Manager to aim at a federal funds rate in the 7-3/4 to 8 percent range over the next few days,  without making a strong restraining effort to reduce it  I think that the funds rate then could very  likely be up around 7-7/8 to 8 percent because the financings are coming up and you really would  not want to give a misleading signal  And then if the aggregates are strong, he would more clearly  let it move to around 8  I think that, in effect, sanctions where you are now and doesn’t have the  Manager taking any strong actions that might be misleading in this period where we are coming up  to a large refunding as well as current offerings this week     7/18/78              46       Or 7-3/4 to 8  It may bounce back to 7-3/4 some days; it may not       Well, if our projections are anywhere near right, that pretty much assures  that we will be at 8 fairly promptly if that is the upper limit of the range       Our uncertainties about July and the seasonals and all that seem to me to  argue for a wide range in this period       I think that it could read “about the current level” because that could refer  to the last very few days and the Committee understands that as 7-3/4 to 8 percent  So I don’t see  any problem with that       In the last two days, it has been in the 7-3/4 to 8 percent range       You would have an elaborate system there  Peter might be able to give all  the unsecured information on the regular call on the leased line and give the secure information to  the Board on the squawk box and then communicate one or two seconds later on the regular  handset to the Presidents       No, but you could do it at least two ways       The wire actually is done here around 1230 or 1245     SPEAKER(?)  I will secure that wire, by the way       [It provides] preliminary indications of the aggregates [figures]       7/18/78              60     They are not quantitative, because the quantitative--        Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Statement--see Appendix]       A little twist       8/15/78             20     For September, it's close to 8 percent--a shade over       From what you read, Mr Chairman, it would seem like 4-1/2 to 8-1/2  and 6 to 10 would just about average through everyone's ranges for M1 and M2       I don't think that poses any problem over the next few days       Mr Chairman, as a technical point in the directive, the Committee has to  decide on the language under alternative B whether it should say a range initially attaining a  weekly-average federal funds rate “slightly” or “somewhat” above the current level  I think the  Committee has to choose       Well, I think the 8 is slightly       That's the staff's lexicon       Yes, as an exemption  Reg D would provide a basis and also Reg M for  both       Four       It's 4 on borrowings from branches and 4 on borrowings directly for that  branch        Well, Dave, I think I wouldn't describe it as substantial because I've   assumed all along that the Committee is aiming at the top of the 4 to 6-1/2 percent range, following  the discussion the Committee had when it set the target  If the Committee were aiming at the  middle of the range, I believe that you'd have to say there is a more substantial downward shift  involved  The downward shift, if you judge it from our quarterly econometric model--which is not  the only model that exists in the world--is of modest proportions  It’s something like 1-1/2  percentage points, which compares with the shifts in terms of that model on the order of 5-1/2 and  4 percentage points in the early part of this recovery  Of course in the last two years there has  been, in terms of that model, almost no shift  It has been predicting pretty well and if that turned  out to be the case, at current interest rates--or even at the interest rates we've projected, which are  slightly higher--you'd have an M1 growth maybe a percentage point or so above the top of the  Committee's range  Our basis for assuming that you'd get that percentage point less [is that as] the  interest rates get even a little higher there's encouragement for innovations, apart from the  automatic transfers, that will again generate activity on the part of corporate treasurers and also rich  individuals to economize on their cash holdings  Now, we assume that activity will be  considerably less than earlier in this period  We've assumed some such activity, but it's of quite  modest dimensions, really       President Mayo, I might add just a fact  We've been erroneously   predicting that the rate of growth of inflows to S&Ls would slow because there is some sort of  stock adjustment at work  We now have the data for the first ten days of September and we're  projecting a 17-1/2 percent rate of growth at the S&Ls in September  Undoubtedly this will slow,  but as Jim said, this isn't in the statistics at the moment       No, Mr Chairman  For technical reasons, there appears to be a sizable   need to provide reserves and I believe that increase would be justified for this [upcoming  intermeeting] period       Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Statement--see Appendix]      Yes      Mr Chairman, I have an opinion in regard to policy, if you are asking me   that  But I started [with] a somewhat different premise than many members of the Committee  because I believe the longer-run range of 4 to 6-1/2 for M1 is unrealistically low and, therefore, I  would not push as hard on the funds rate  Although I don't have any particular disagreement with  an upper limit of 8-3/4, I'd be very reluctant to go higher without examining very carefully what's  happening on the incoming economic news in view of the fact that our projection depends  essentially on that particular funds rate        Thank you, Mr Chairman, I hope my comments will be less complicated  than the Bluebook but it's a very complicated situation  So I apologize in advance for both      I would, as statistical background, like to make two or three points to the Committee first   For the year just ended, that is the year ending in the third quarter of 1978, the Committee was  generally within its monetary ranges that it had set for the Q3 1977-to-Q3 1978 period  It was  within two of the three  M1 grew at an 8 percent annual rate in that period, above the 4 to 6-1/2  percent range; however, M2 grew at an 82 percent rate within the 6-1/2 to 9 percent range and M3  at a 93 percent rate, also well within its 8 to 10-1/2 percent range  And in the quarter past, there  has been evidence of a faster growth in M2 and M3, mainly because of the success of the money  market certificates  We wouldn't expect the rates of growth of these certificates to be sustained at  the rapid rates seen when they were first introduced  Thus, I think the extremely rapid rate of  growth in thrift accounts in the third quarter is a transitory phenomenon, though growth will be  faster over the next year than would otherwise have been the case      Let me make a final statistical point, Mr Chairman--and I will be coming to this somewhat  later in more detail in view of the prospective distortions in M1 because of the automatic transfer  service and I might add also because of the last minute introduction of interest bearing NOW  accounts in New York State which ought to begin also to have a significant effect on M1  The  Committee might bear in mind that the alternative measure that the staff is suggesting at least as a  collateral or supplementary measure, M1+, grew at a 6 percent rate in the year ending in the third  quarter of 1978--somewhat below the rate of growth for M1     With regard to economic considerations for setting longer-run ranges--and abstracting for  the moment from ATS--I'd like to bring the following points before the Committee  Evidence  continues that the demand for M1 is higher than the FOMC target implies, given built-in  inflationary pressures and a reasonable growth objective for the economy, say, in a 3 to [3-1/2]  percent range for real growth  For six quarters now there has been no downward drift in M1       10/17/78 26             demand, judging by the M1 demand equation of our large econometric model  That model doesn't  predict everything perfectly by any manner of means but I think some attention has to be given to a  period of six straight quarters where it has been predicting very well  I think this argues for raising  the M1 range in the interest of realism; and I think I made this point to the Committee somewhat in  vain three months ago       On the other hand, raising the M1 range may have an adverse effect on  inflationary psychology  Moreover, recent overshoots in M1 growth would seem to argue at least  arithmetically for lowering its range if the Committee wishes to achieve a 6 to 6-1/2 percent M1  growth over the longer run--if the Committee takes that as its objective  And I think we pointed  out in the Bluebook that it would take about a 5 to 5-1/2 percent rate of growth in M1 to get you 6  to 6-1/2 percent over a period beginning with the fourth quarter of ’77 on into ’79  Perhaps the  most important consideration in a sense now would be the relation of the range setting done by the  Committee today to whatever the Administration's anti-inflationary program is      We're obviously somewhat handicapped in discussing this by a total lack of knowledge of  the program, but I think I wouldn't be amiss to make three general points  If the ranges were raised  and the Chairman's testimony is November 16--so that would be after the program is announced--I  think this would rather [clearly] be perceived by the market as not being supportive of the program  and would probably worsen inflationary psychology and prospects for the success of the program   A lowering of the ranges would seem to suggest that the Fed was moving toward monetary  conditions that would, if anything, reinforce the program and in that sense might be said to increase  its prospects of success--that is, if the ranges were realistic to begin with and then lowered  The  third point is that maintaining the ranges I believe would be construed as more or less a neutral  stance consistent with lower interest rates than might otherwise prevail if the program were to  work      Let me turn now briefly to the implications of the automatic transfer service for the longer- run ranges  Of all the aggregates, it obviously adds the greatest uncertainty to M1 and suggests the  need both to lower and widen the M1 range if such a range is presented at all  The range needs to  be lowered because the shifts are only going to be one way, we believe--from demand deposits to  savings deposits  So the direction seems to be very clear  What's less clear is the amount of shift   Because of the uncertainty involved in that, I believe it would be very desirable to widen the range  and I'll make a suggestion at the summary point  The other aggregates are affected by these shifts  but to a relatively minor extent  Both the suggested M1+ and M2 would be affected by the transfer  service because of transfers from thrifts  We estimate an effect of only 04 and 02 of a percentage  point from such transfers  M3 would hardly be affected at all unless people transferred funds out of  market instruments to put them in these kinds of accounts      The issues before the Committee are particularly complex this time and, as I noted, so is the  Bluebook  Therefore, I'd like to make an effort to summarize the various advantages and  disadvantages in terms of a set of proposals on the aggregates  If I had real courage, I think I       10/17/78 27             would suggest abandoning M1 entirely and that may be the best course  But the court hasn't met  and made a decision yet  We aren't really certain about how rapidly the transfers are going to  occur, so it may still be best to present an M1 range, though widened  But I would strongly  recommend adding a range for [M1+] to provide collateral information with regard to the behavior  of the transactions demand for money in a transition period  I would not rely only on M2 and M3  in such a period  Our research suggests that a narrow money measure, whether M1 and possibly  M1 in the new environment, conveys better information about current and prospective short-run  income changes than does a broader measure  In other words, it's a better monetary indicator of  how to change the money markets than a broader measure  Broader aggregates are more sensitive  to asset shifts and involve, of course, such non-money elements as 6-year certificates, 8-year  certificates, and 4-year certificates      With regard to M1, I would suggest a range of 2 to 6 percent for the period from Q3 ’78 to  Q3 ’79  Such a range has the following advantages  It's wide enough to reflect the uncertainties  that prevail and that were discussed in the Bluebook  At one extreme it would allow for a shift out  of demand deposits because of ATS by as much as 4-1/2 percentage points from the top of the  FOMC's current M1 range, which I believe is the minimum realistic rate of growth in M1 and is the  rate of growth used in Mr Kichline's projections  And it would allow for a shift as low as 1/2  percentage point  I believe 4-1/2 percentage points is a highly likely amount of shift, given the  analysis we have made  This range, by representing an adjustment because of ATS to the top of the  FOMC’s current M1 range, would establish probably a more realistic M1 range over the next year   It would also appear to the market that the Committee does not intend, in effect, to accommodate  the more rapid expansion in narrowly defined money by not adjusting its target sufficiently to  prospective institutional changes  And it would thus, I believe, be supportive of any  anti-inflationary program     With regard to M1+, I would certainly include it as an additional aggregate and would  recommend the alternative B range of 5 to 7-1/2 percent  There is much to be said for a wider  range because of various uncertainties; and if the Committee wished to lean to the restrictive side, a  wider range would be 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent  That would be 3 points, the same as the M3 range, or  it could be 5 to 8 if the Committee wished to lean to the less restrictive side  I could not make up  my mind which way I’d want to lean and I think the 5 to 7-1/2 percent is probably a desirable  range      With regard to M2 and M3, I would see no need to change the current ranges, which are  6-1/2 to 9 and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively  Relative to recent trends and prospective credit  needs to finance economic expansion, these ranges appear quite taut  That's all I have, Mr  Chairman       Yes       Yes, we centered those M2 and M3 [ranges] around the midpoints of the  current [ones for] M2 and M3, which would encompass our best estimate  In alternative B, for M2       10/17/78 30             our best estimate is 8-1/4; [for M3 it’s] the midpoint between 8-1/2 and 11, which is 9-3/4  That  would be encompassed by the present M2 and M3 ranges  I think for policy purposes it's highly  desirable not to raise the M2 and M3 ranges and to leave the current ranges, which give enough  scope--even if the staff projections are right--to be within them  And they provide added scope, in  case the President's program is effective, to have a lower rate of growth       May I comment on that?         10/17/78 31                Well, there are two comments I would like to make  One is statistical and  the other is economic  On the statistical point, it's almost impossible to deal with--pardon the  jargon--two independent [variables] and to encompass all the tails of the ranges  You maybe ought  to have a 10 or 12 percentage point range, and that's obviously impractical  So I think the  Committee's job is to put down the range which is both reasonably likely and also will convey the  correct policy  On the economic point, President Willes, I think if it was happening as you suggest,  as is possible--that is, that you are getting in effect a 10-1/2 percent M1, then interest rates would  have to be a lot lower for that [to occur]  The Committee would have to sanction a lot lower  interest rates  And if it were developing as you suggest what I think would happen is that for, say,  a 9-1/2 to 10 percent funds rate, which is our projection--and if the shift were 4-1/2 percentage  points, which is our projection--[for] 6-1/2 percent the Committee would have to be running at a 2  percent M1 growth  If it weren't running at a 2 percent M1 growth but at the 6 percent M1 growth- -in effect the 10-1/2 percent without transfers--then you wouldn't have the funds rate at 9-1/2; you'd  have something like 7-1/2 or 6 percent  In the practical world, I don't think your outcome is very  likely  Secondly, in the [real] world we would be getting data to try to monitor the extent of shifts  so we will be able to report to the Committee these kinds of developments  I think the economics  are very different from the arithmetic       Mr Chairman, would you prefer for me to respond to that now or at the  point where you're discussing the [short-term ranges]?       Do you mean [have language] in the directive like “the associated range  for M1+ and bank credit” or in a footnote to the directive?       Well, that's a separate question from putting it in the longer-run ranges       [I’d like to] follow up, Mr Chairman, by saying that the staff has been  under instructions to prepare alternative definitions of money  [Not only] in view of the discussion  but even before the discussion, we were planning to circulate those before year-end throughout the  System       Well, the credit union share drafts--       The others are pretty minor, except for the NOW accounts in New York   I'm not sure what will happen there       Well, I think I batted 50-50 on the first round  Mr Chairman, I have only  two brief comments, one of which is not quite appropriate because I'm not sure what the  Committee did or didn't do with M1+  With regard to the directive, the Committee might wish to  give particular consideration at this meeting to a money market directive in view of the absolutely  huge uncertainties that are going to surround measurement and analysis of the monetary aggregates  and also in view of the fact that the staff is forecasting growth in M1 abstracted from automatic  transfers and M2 not too far from their longer-run ranges  So, as long as growth is around those  ranges, it may be very desirable just to consider a narrow or restrictive money market directive  without speaking out about the level of the federal funds rate that's the center of that particular  directive--not have any particular movement in the funds rate from the decided level unless the  aggregates are very clearly running above or below reasonable expectations  And I think  alternative 1 and alternative 2 in the Bluebook on page 12 are [reasonable] relative to the long-run  ranges      If automatic transfers [go into effect] on November 1, Mr Chairman, and if people move  ahead and go into those, I think M1 is absolutely worthless as an operating range  We're not going  to be able to get good estimates of transfers from demand deposits  And I think it's very dangerous  in operating to rely on only a single range like M2 or M1, given the uncertainties in the world   Thus, in this period, I really believe that M1+ would give you a much better basis for operations  than M1, assuming there are automatic transfers  And in the short run, M2 is not subject to [much]  uncertainty, as President Guffey pointed out, because we're not about to get interest rates below the  ceiling rate on savings deposits in this period  So my recommendation would be to drop the 50-50  weighting of M1 and M2 as we had suggested and let the Manager take account of the behavior of  M1, M1+, and M2 within ranges decided by the Committee, using his good common sense in  judging how these are coming out relative to how the Committee has thought in the past and how it  might express itself today  And if the Committee adopted a money market directive, I think there  would have to be very clear evidence that this collection of aggregates was running well above or  well below its ranges  And if automatic transfers go into effect, I would tend to reduce the weight  on M1 considerably and put much more weight on M1+       We would not expect that to have any impact on the money supply  We  would expect it to go into effect somewhere in the first week of November  But we expect it to  have an impact on the distribution of Treasury balances between the Fed and the banks and some  effect, therefore, on Alan's operations in the market in the transition  But no effect on money  supply       Mr Chairman, is there to be a supplemental M1+?  I just want to be sure       Well, on definitions of money, we plan, as I mentioned before, to have  within two months new definitions taking account of the fact that the world has changed  With  regard to the reserve base as an alternative guide, we've had various definitions of the reserve base  which from time to time have had varying degrees of prominence in the Committee's instructions  And that's a matter that I think might be taken up by the Subcommittee on the Directive when they  consider the relationship of monetary targeting to the Humphrey-Hawkins bill       I would propose to bring it up by that route if Governor Partee agrees to it        We are expecting money growth to be down in December, and if it  weren't for the automatic transfers, we would have M1 growth up in the 8 to 9 percent range   Demands for credit have remained relatively strong in recent weeks  I'd also comment that we  think there are some odds that we might not need a further rise in interest rates to have M1 growth  at the top end of the range [with] ATS  But, again, that assumes that further downward shift in  money demand, which we haven't yet seen, of about 1-1/2 percentage points  So the odds are really  not any better than 50-50       Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Secretary’s note  This statement was not  found in Committee records]       Mr Chairman, does that mean that you are including the language on  page 15 under money market emphasis--that we would add that?         Mr Chairman, “correcting excessive exchange [market fluctuation]” is  what we used       11/21/78              32     Mr Chairman, I would just suggest that the Committee be prepared to  answer, when this reaches the public, whether in fact the Vice Chairman’s wording means that the  Committee would tighten or fail to lower the funds rate when the dollar is weakening  I think that  question will inevitably come up at that time, whereas general language as is in there now or as  President Mayo suggested wouldn't raise that question  I think it will be taken as an active change  in policy  If that's what the Committee intends, fine  I'm not qualified to--       No, I assume we don't need “in an orderly fashion”  And I would just  like to call the Committee's attention to the last paragraph beginning on the bottom of page 15,  which used to be in the directive and we have added it again in case the Committee wants to  include this  It spells out what is implicit       We were thinking of the 6th and 7th  It might have to be a 2-day  meeting       This report has to be out on the 20th and it’s the first one so we need  some time       I think it was--I may be off a little bit on the dates--somewhere around  the 12th or 13th  I can't remember       Well, some of these schedules change all the dates throughout the year,  so I think it might even be premature to give tentative dates        Thank you, Mr Chairman  [Secretary’s note  This statement was not  found in Committee records]     12/19/78          6         Thank you, Mr Chairman  As a brief introduction, I would say that the  data we are getting on automatic transfer seem to be giving us a reasonable handle on evaluating it  and we are going to be continuing with that data [collection] through January  Therefore, I think  it’s possible to move back toward giving M1 more equal weight than has been given to it in recent  months, particularly in light of its weakness  I would suggest returning to the period when M1 and  M2 were given just about equal weight  I would suggest a range, Mr Chairman, for M1 of 2 to 6  percent--that is taking 1 percentage point off of the top of the alternative B range  And for M2 I’d  suggest a range of 5 to 9 percent, which takes 1/2 point off of the top and bottom, or a range of  5-1/2 to 9 percent  One is not far superior to the other      On the interpretation of M1, if it does happen that our ATS data are showing instead of the  2-1/2 to 3 percentage point shift that we have built into this--if the shift happens to be 5 or 6  percentage points or vice versa, of course, [if it is less than we assumed]--we would bring that  promptly to your attention to indicate that the range was out of kilter  I would suggest for the  Committee’s consideration the fed funds rate range of alternative B but it might be desirable to  interpret that as moving rather immediately to 10 percent and letting the rest of the adjustments  within that range depend on developments with regard to the aggregates      With regard to those developments, I would suggest the possibility of interpreting the  aggregate ranges somewhat asymmetrically--that is, that the Manager be more sensitive to  movement of the aggregates toward the tops of their ranges  That is, be more willing to tighten the  funds rate as the aggregates move toward the tops of the ranges and less willing, or less inclination  to move promptly in easing as the aggregates move toward the bottoms of the ranges  This would  be just a suggested interpretation  All of that could be accomplished with either a monetary  aggregates or a money [market] directive, but I think more consistent with past Committee practice  would be a monetary aggregates [directive]       12/19/78          25       Well, I would suggest that that would be probably at the bottom of where  it is--maybe 0 to 4 or 1/2 to 4       Well, we have under alternative B a growth rate of a little over 2 percent  for the December-January period  I think consistent with the suggested M1 and M2 ranges would  be a growth rate just a shade under that  So I would say 1/2 to 4 percent or 0 to 4 percent          For M1 I think the weakness of the last couple of months makes it  desirable to begin to give some credence to continued weakness  Thus I think it’s probably  important to not only have a cap on the upper limit but to have a lower point where you may want  some response--although I suggest that the response would be not prompt but delayed  You’d have  to get right down to [the lower limit] to respond  That’s the reason for having a range instead of  simply a cap  I also think now we are beginning to get a handle on experience with ATS and can  interpret it better for you         With a move to 10       Well, I was suggesting that possibility if M1 and M2 came in at the  bottom of their ranges, literally, down to 2 percent [for M1] or 5 percent in the case of M2, giving  some weight to both  That is, if it was down on M1 but up on M2, no       That’s right  That’s what I was, in effect, suggesting       That’s why I didn’t know whether it was an aggregate or a money   market--        It would say that at that rate of growth the Manager would be at the top  of the funds rate range  Since I don’t know that you could affect that [M1 growth] in that month, to  "allow" is a funny word        I would assume that with this directive and those specs the Manager  would be at the top of the funds rate range at that point         With those facts, if it worked out that way, I would assume that the  Manager would be at the top of the funds range       That would be my understanding     12/19/78          27         Governor Teeters, I think one factor you’d want to consider in this is how  permanent that 10-1/2 is  It’s a question of whether or not Jim is talking on the assumption that it  goes to 10-1/2 and stays there  It would be a somewhat different outlook, I’m sure, if it went to  10-1/2 and came back down in a few weeks        I’m just adding that as a point        There was an additional thing that the Committee may or may not want  to take up with regard to this warehousing  Unless action is taken, half of it will have to be  renewed in six months and then the other half in one year  Under the current circumstances, the     12/19/78          37    simplest thing might just be to have it renewed in one year, rather than going through a 6-month  and then a 1-year procedure         Well, we have to simply divide it up in half  As this builds up whatever  half is going to be in six months the Committee will simply have to take an action to roll it over for  another six months  It’s purely a housekeeping procedure, and it’s a question of whether the  Committee wants to go through that housekeeping business in six months or one year        That leaves it then that half of this comes due in some sense in six  months and half of it comes due in one year        Those are all quarters, depending on the time period, Governor Coldwell,  third-to-third, fourth-to-fourth, third-to-fourth  They’re all quarter-to-quarter        That’s what we have now          Mr Chairman, I consider the [unintelligible] for M1 as against [M2] at  the end--       SPEAKER(?)  I was talking about M2        Yes, I understand, but it doesn’t always come out the favorable way   And without speaking for or against one approach or another, I just wanted to be sure that the  Committee understands that there is absolutely no difference between the two approaches  If we  have done our math right, the Committee is going to be reacting in absolutely the same way as it  reacted in the past with absolutely the same weight  We have adjusted the ranges, given the  projections now  This is not something that makes any substantive difference in the procedures          I don’t have any preference  I really believe strongly--and we thought  about this [hard but] I don’t know how to get it through to the Committee--that it makes not one bit  of difference  We’re narrowing the range to make up for the averaging process  The different  multiplication, if we have done our math correctly, should [result in] the same degree of  responsiveness          It isn’t all that clear, because for example this time your M1 would be a  very low range  You’d have to explain to the public that really, we are letting the growth in, but the  growth is going to be in January  But it’s going to be below because we are averaging January with  a low November and December; you have that slight problem          Mr Chairman, if I may make a suggestion  We have been somewhat  neglectful recently in the analysis of reserves and the monetary base in the Bluebook  And actually  I think it might be desirable to put, without specific figures even, some analysis of what’s going on  in there        It's not quite believeable, but we did assume 6  months ago, even 9 months ago, that we would begin to get this drift  around the fourth quarter of 1978 It has begun to develop; whether  it will continue or not we can't be certain, but we had assumed it and  we have continued to assume it    Right, about 3-1/4 percent That's all    Well, if we don't get that 2 percent shift,  then at the level of interest rates assumed the actual growth will  turn out to be 5-1/4 percent if we're right about the ATS [effect]    For this level of interest rates, if we don't  get the shift we'd have 8-1/4 percent    I think that's correct The only caveat that I  would note is that this isn't a new assumption We have essentially  been assuming that this shift would take place at this time    That's right    That's right    That's one way of putting it It's the other  side of the demand for money    [Statement--see Appendix]    President Volcker, we've looked into that with  your staff There may be a lot of biases in the money supply To get  a measured bias from what you're talking about, it appears that it has  to be transferred between two zero balance corporate accounts So we  don't believe the effect would be very large     2 / 6 / 1 9  -11-    We have it declining in 1980 At the end of  1979 ATS accounts in total are, on our assumption, around [$26]  billion If half of that comes out of demand deposits that’s about  $13 billion The total amount of deposits that are eligible about  that time is $100 billion So it’s fairly modest if you look at it  that way It‘s a little more than 12 percent of the total that can be  transferred So I don’t feel too bad about it as an estimate In  part, the reason I recommended 2 to 5 percent as a possibility to  consider is that my instinct is a bit like yours It may be wrong,  but my instinct is that in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent area it’s more  likely to be 3 percent or a perhaps shade under    That's correct    If I may say so,  Mr Chairman, on our projected  interest rates perhaps we’ve swung too much to giving ranges We  thought they would be helpful But, Governor Teeters, while we have  allowed for some increase it’s the midpoints that we think are the  most likely [for the funds rate] and the midpoints are 10-1/4 and 10-  3/8 percent [for the first and second quarters respectivelyl We’ve  allowed for the possibility of some upward drift in the midpoint  because we think the economy looks stronger in the first half than in  the second half Basically, the staff feels that interest rates would  be essentially unchanged ov@r the year, with a possibility of a little  upward drift in the first half and a little downward drift in the  second half That’s how we have been interpreting it If we had just  put down the midpoints down, that table would read 10-1/4, 10-3/8,  [10-1/41, and 10 percent, in essence    Well, no, the interest rate assumptions take  all of that into account They were merely meant to express the  staff’s view that if interest rates were going to go anywhere, it is  more likely to be up than down in the first half and more likely to be     2/6/19 -21-   down than up in the second half given the GNP projections  just meant to give that sense to the Committee   This was    [Statement--see Appendix]    I would think about 4 to 9     2/6/19 -32-    And an asymmetrical interpretation of the  directive--that is, to permit tightening if growth moves above the  midpoint of the 4 to 9 percent range but not easing until growth got  to the bottom of the range That was [the bias] the Committee adopted  last time in its directive at the December meeting    May I suggest, if the Committee's sentiment is  moving that way, that you might want to reconsider the virtues of the  optional paragraph we put [in the Bluebook] It's quite consistent  with holding [current conditions in] the money market but it permits  some tightening, which I assume the Committee wouldn't object to, if  the aggregates were exceptionally strong The Committee merely has to  m a k e  a decision in advance of what [exceptionally strong] is And  that language would be quite consistent with reconvening through a  telephone conference if the aggregates [were weak] It really doesn't  specify how weak they would have to be, but that could certainly be  developed with the Committee    No, but as I say, if--    We've ignored the asymmetry It was written  with asymmetrical wording    A lot--3-1/2 percent    The quarter is about 3/4 percent, so add 3-1/2  to that plus 3 percent [for ATSJ   if you want to put it in those  terms    Somewhere on that order    Well, also, a considerable pop back up is  needed to get them back on the Committee’s path     Thank you, Mr Chairman I thought it might be  useful for the Committee's discussion to analyze a little more closely  recent developments in the money supply and bank credit Basically,  they appear to be giving somewhat conflicting signals Growth in all  the aggregates has slowed considerably--[the levels have] actually  declined--in the first quarter, and bank credit has accelerated To  set the stage a bit--and focusing on M1 for convenience--Ml growth for  the third quarter was about 8 percent and for the fourth quarter it  was 4 - I f 2  percent on a quarterly average basis And in the first  quarter the figure is probably going to be something like minus 2  percent with January and February showing a decline on average of a  little over 4 percent Bank credit, on the other hand, had grown at a  9  8  percent annual rate in the third quarter and dropped off to a rate  of 73 percent in the fourth quarter In the first quarter it will  probably be back up to about a 97 percent annual rate, with January  and February growing at rates averaging a little over 12 percent So  its growth has been very rapid, with loan growth picking up some  Unfortunately, neither of these aggregates is an [unequivocal]  indicator for policy--in the case of the money aggregates to ease, or  in the case of bank credit to tighten     3/20/79 -5-   I think it is very important to adjust the slow growth in M1,  and even that of the broader aggregates, for the demand shift that we  believe is occurring in the public's willingness to hold money If  you will pardon a technical expression, we think a lot of the behavior  reflects not the fact that interest rates are rising and therefore  that people are willing to hold less cash and moving along a demand  curve but that the whole demand curve for money is shifting at given  interest rates and people are willing to finance their transactions  with less money There are two ways to look at this One is to look  at the alternative assets to money to see if there is any unusual  behavior in those assets that people may be holding John Paulus and  I made some estimates on that in '75 and '76 and the staff has  reviewed them recently bringing them up to date The second way is  to look at what is technically called the residual in our equation in  the quarterly model, which tracks the demand for money against GNP and  interest rates Both [approaches] have their dangers, but putting the  two together may give us some idea of the extent of the shift that is  occurring   In terms of other closely related assets, we've estimated, of  course, that the ATS effect will add about 3 percentage points to M1  growth in the first quarter We then made estimates of that portion  of the increase in money market funds and R P s  that might have come  from demand deposits, placing that arbitrarily at around 25 percent  In the case of money market funds we believe the bulk of the increase  was coming from savings deposits and in the case of R P s  from other  market instruments I would add about another 2 percentage points at  an annual rate So that would raise M1 growth in the first quarter  from minus 2 to around plus 3 percent It also raises growth in the  fourth quarter from around 4-1/2 to around 7 percent If you look at  the residuals in the models of the growth rate for M1--if you take  those literally, and I don't believe you should over a short period--  the model has been overpredicting M1 growth by a large amount in both  the fourth quarter and the first quarter The amount of  overprediction, setting aside or allowing for ATS, is about 2  percentage points in the fourth quarter and 6-1/2 percentage points in  the first quarter As I say, I wouldn't advocate adding in that 6-1/2  percentage points and taking that as fact because, after all, itrs an  error in the model that we are using to indicate something But if we  took that 6-1/2 points as an outer limit and added the 3 percentage  points for ATS, that gets us to [more than] 9 percentage points, and  we would be having growth at about a 7 percent annual rate in the  first quarter   Now, to give a little perspective to that, in 1975 and 1976  when the model overpredicted money for 11 straight quarters beginning  in the third quarter of 1974 that gave us a little more confidence in  using the residuals as a rough indication of the amount of demand  shift and, therefore, confidence in using that adjustment to give us  the economic impact of what was happening to M1 If we had literally  taken the model Iresultsl--and again it would be an overstatement--the  growth in M1 in '75 and '76, which was between 5 and 6 percent, would  instead have been between 9-1/2 and 10 percent That in my view is  probably a better analysis, economically, of what that low rate of  growth in the literal reading of the M1 numbers meant in ' 7 5  and '76  But as I say, to the degree that we use the model in this way, I would  caution that this may be an overstatement rather than an  understatement     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  - 6 -    On the other hand, with regard to bank credit, if anything, I  would tend to subtract from that acceleration The bank credit growth  that we've seen in the first quarter has not been accompanied by any  acceleration in total credit raised In fact, there appears to be in  our flow of funds accounts a drop in total funds raised by  nonfinancial sectors in the economy of around 10 to 15 percent Much  of that drop has to do with funds [raised] for the U  S   government and  foreigners The drop is quite small--more on the order of 1-1/2  percent--for private domestic nonfinancial sectors, the area which may  be more closely related to economic activity That's a very small  drop So I don't think the bank credit number is an indicator of a  strengthening in total credit; on the other hand, the credit flows to  domestic nonfinancial sectors remain generally strong Another factor  strengthening bank credit has been that it is displacing other sources  of funds raised A considerable amount of the funds raised in our  market in the fourth quarter was funds supplied by foreign governments  --monetary authorities buying US government securities in view of  the weakness in the dollar This has come to a halt in the first  quarter; it has been reversed And that sharp turnaround in funds  supplied has been made up in part by the banks supplying funds to the  market, in [effect] a reflow of funds from abroad In February, on  the basis of fragmentary data, it looks as if about $4-1/2 billion of  the $9 billion increase in bank credit was supplied by a reduction in  bank lending to their foreign branches So this would be the other  side of the support operation The dollar became stronger and the  money is coming back home in this way That kind of reflow is not  associated with any kind of money supply liabilities It simply  involves a bank reducing its lending to [foreign] branches and  increasing its lending in the domestic market So, we would not see  that on RP or fed funds type liabilities on the domestic bank   Well, Mr Chairman, the conclusion I would draw from all of  this--and I present this to the Committee for its consideration--is  that the behavior of the monetary aggregates when interpreted in light  of ongoing demand shifts is certainly not in itself a signal for  easing And if one believes the extreme estimate on the amount of  demand shift, the aggregates might weigh slightly, or be not  inconsistent with, moving in the direction of tightening if the  Committee thought the behavior of the real economy required it   On the other hand, the behavior of bank credit--when  interpreted in light of overall credit flows and the diminished credit  flows in mortgages and corporate bonds that is occurring to offset the  business loan expansion--certainly doesn't give a clear signal for  tightening  easing So I am afraid the conclusion can't be unequivocal in any  way 1f I were asked to give odds on whether these conflicting  signals were most consistent with tightening, easing, or staying the  same, I would say they were least consistent with easing In my  judgment, the case for that conclusion is the weakest And the  strongest conclusion I can give is that they are most consistent with  staying the same, but not inconsistent, of course, with tightening   Nor do I believe these data are very consistent with    President Eastburn, that may or may not be  The point that I would like to make on these measurement problems is  that in 1975 and 1976, as an example, when we added back in 1-1/2 to 2  percentage points because we included the business saving accounts and  all that in evaluating the money supply, I think that was wrong I  believe that understated what was happening because when the public  decides that the existing stock of deposits is too large--that they’re  going to take deposits and put them somewhere else--there’s no reason  to think that that money necessarily is going to go into very close  substitutes It could just as well go into Treasury securities and  items like that So I think adding up the very liquid assets will  tend to underestimate the demand shift At the same time, I wouldn’t  say that the residuals in equations are the perfect measure But in  ’75 and ’76, Dave, I think they were a convincing argument that the  demand shift was greater than we would have gotten by simply adding up  the money substitutes And to a degree I think they’re probably  telling us something close to the same thing in the first quarter Of  course, even so, we may not get to so rapid a rate of growth    Well, it’s very difficult to give an answer to  that, President Eastburn, because we don’t control the supply of money  and we make no effort to control it    I have no quarrel with that, President Balles  In terms of dimension, I would feel very confident that a minus 2  percent M1 in the first quarter is plus 1 percent, because I add the 3  percentage points for ATS I feel reasonably confident that it’s  probably as much as plus 3 percentage points and I have diminishing  confidence as I go above 3 up to I percent    Yes it does    Well, it ought to include them, netting out the  CDs the money market funds hold I’m not convinced that we’ve got it  all measured exactly right    Right, they should net them out    NO, I have nothing to add    Well, Alan, when it goes up to $ 3 0 0  or $400  million after one day’s operation, it would be possible to go to the  Subcommittee and get prior approval     [Statement--see Appendix]    There's a slight conflict, you're quite right  I said early on that the slower growth [in the monetary aggregates]  we're now having is consistent with our staff projections of a slowing  later on in economic activity But then I went on to say that the  slow [monetary] growth we're having was sufficient to finance this  rapid expansion in nominal activity And the rapid expansion in  nominal activity mainly reflects, of course, the rate of inflation and  only to a minor extent expansion in real output Real output was low  in the first quarter; it increased at only a 1-1/2 percent rate and  the rate of inflation was up close to 10 percent    We only have two [pieces] of evidence One is  that the most recent week's data show a slowdown in the [decline] in  the outstanding amount of savings deposits at commercial banks That  decline has gone on for five months; savings deposits have been  dropping very sharply since late last fall I think that mainly  [reflects] a shift of those deposits into other kinds of assets, maybe  even into goods, and [that process] has slowed Therefore, we  possibly are reaching the point where the stock outstanding has been  shifted and [the process] is ending That in itself will increase  rates of growth as [it is now1 subtracting [from them] It involves  taking away a negative factor And then there have been slight  indications in very recent data of some uptick in M1 But, again,  President ROOS, I don't feel the least bit [confident] that I could  guarantee the Committee that there's going to be a rebound in M1  growth this month, next month, or the month after that because I don't  know how long this kind of demand shift is going to last In history  we have not had periods with such rapid rises of velocity as we've  experienced in the [last] three quarters in a row, including this  second quarter S o  on that ground alone, one might think velocity is  going to drop and money will rise    Well, Governor Wallich, I really don't know and  I don't think anyone knows when exactly we'll get back on the  relationship AS YOU said, in the early stages of this expansion  beginning around the end of ' 7 4  it took us 2-1/2 years to so-called  "get back on the relationship" We have always assumed that this  demand shift is not going to last as long because so much [of it] had  occurred earlier and there is just that much less cash to use up It  was because of the uncertainty about the aggregates, as you point out,  that I tried to stress as much as I did the kind of analysis one would  go through in assessing the restrictiveness or non-restrictiveness of  the present level of market rates In that way I think one gets down  to what is going to be a very judgmental factor, and that is assessing  what really is the expected real return on capital That is, if  inflation expectations are accelerating, that could be offset by  declining expectations in the real return of capital One just  expects to make less profit on any given investment And that would  tend, in so far as [assessing] restrictiveness, to offset the impact  of accelerating inflation S o  I really do believe under present  circumstances that that kind of judgment is critical to policy, more  so than a judgment--if I may put it this way without meaning it  prejudicially--about a mechanical application of rules with regard to  the aggregates That's the more critical judgment now; it's  essentially a judgment about the future economic outlook    Mr Chairman, I believe the two supporting  memoranda provide the Committee with the various arguments in some  depth--with some differing points of view--and I don’t feel it is  necessary to review those arguments orally Mr Holmes and I have  recommended raising the informal limit on balances to the neighborhood  of $2 billion for the four reasons that we have outlined [in the  memo] One thing I would like to highlight is [something I’ve  learned1 in the relatively brief time I have been involved in this  area It‘s a rather practical approach And that is, if you are  going to play in the game, you’ve got to have chips Playing in the  game means not only with relation to the rest of the U  S   government  but with foreign central banks So, our holding balances [of foreign  currencies] would seem to me very crucial in order to have a degree of  flexibility in dealing with these groups If the Federal Reserve is  to have what I think will be a necessary input into the decisions that  are made in this international game of affecting foreign exchange  market operations, I believe we need to hold some balances And I  would simply stress that view, Mr Chairman    M r   Chairman, our suggestion was that at the  moment we would be contemplating three currencies But we would  assume that the possibility of the Desk holding minor amounts of other  currencies would not be excluded     Yes    Well, we’d be looking at 26 percent with the ATS effect     Mr Chairman, [we’ve had] stability in the  federal funds rate and short-term rates in general since the beginning  of the year, except for the most recent 25 basis point increase in the  funds rate [However], an apparent worsening of inflation and  inflationary expectations presumably would have the effect of reducing  real rates of interest These two factors together raise questions  about how to interpret monetary policy with regard to [whether] it is  restrictive or not in relation to credit markets The Committee, of  course, has worried in the past about interpreting M1 and M2, but  there are similar problems I believe in interpreting the credit  markets It might be helpful in that context to review what might be  elements of restraint and elements of nonrestraint, so to speak, in  the credit markets   If you accept the proposition that market interest rates have  been declining in real terms because of increases in rates of  inflation, I think you have to look for elements of restraint in  lender and borrower attitudes in relation to those interest rates  And I believe several elements of restraint have emerged since the  beginning of the year and even since the last meeting The most  evident one perhaps is in the mortgage markets, as Jim has mentioned,  and probably stems in part from the action taken in mid-March to  eliminate the differential on money market certificates In the six  months prior to April, inflows to savings and loan associations for  the most part had been running at annual rates over 10 percent,  generally between 10 and 12 percent In April, the annual rate of  increase in deposits at S&Ls was 3-112 percent and our estimate is  that it will be around 6-1/2 percent in May So that rate of inflow  halved from around 10 percent to 5 percent, and there has been a  similar change at mutual savings banks We don’t have the latest  commitment data, but in view of this [reduced deposit inflow] and the  need for S&Ls to rely more heavily on Home Loan Bank borrowing,  unlikely that we’re going to have an increase in outstanding  commitments in any lasting way The declining trend in commitments  that has been in evidence since November probably will continue   it’s   I would also point out that at smaller banks, loan to deposit  ratios have been rising steadily thus far in this expansion We don‘t  have data beyond the end of 1978, but at that point they were well  above the ratios in the 1973-74 period There’s not a marked cyclical  trend in such ratios at small banks, but after being flat they had  been going up steadily in this expansion And I think that’s  beginning to imply some restraint on availability [of funds at1 these  banks, which of course have less access to the money market than  larger banks Their [reduced] access would in [turn] cut down on  federal funds sales to large banks   With regard to other factors affecting attitudes, these  [developments] affect the attitudes not only of suppliers but also of     5 / 2 2 / 1 9  -14-   borrowers The debt burden on consumers, [taking into account] both  mortgage debt and consumer credit debt, is well above what it was in  the 1973-74 period Of course, that [concern] is in part alleviated--  [analytically at leastl--by inflation expectations, which make the  debt burden seem light On the other hand, any uncertainties about  future income will make it seem very heavy Furthermore, we've had  very recently a continued step-up in the deterioration in business  liquidity; the ratio of liquid assets to current liabilities of  businesses is approaching very closely its ' 7 3 - ' I 4  lows Another  ratio, short-term debt to total debt, is pretty much at its high of  the ' 1 3 - ' I 4  period So in that area too we're now getting what might  be characterized under more ordinary circumstances as a strained  situation in business liquidity Its actual impact on spending will  depend, of course, on how businesses assess their future cash flow   Finally, I would add that attitudes toward credit may also be  being influenced by the impact of the gasoline shortage Whether that  would dissipate if, through a miracle of bureaucratic manipulation,  the gas shortage turns out to be transitory, [I don't know] In any  event at the moment I believe it's making people very conservative  with regard to spending, and thus borrowing would not appear  attractive or needed at current interest rates   Offsetting those elements of restraint is the general point  that there has been no change in private short rates There's  considerable availability of bank credit at current prices and bank  credit has been strong, as large banks have been able to borrow  through fed funds, RPs, and Eurodollars And corporate bond yields  are up since year-end by about 6 0  basis points I would estimate that  a third of that is because of the nuclear power plant failures, which  have made lenders more cautious with regard to financing utilities  But I would guess that most of that increase probably reflects the  worsening of inflation and should not be interpreted as a tightening  of the bond markets   I would venture the judgment, Mr Chairman, that on balance  one can say that nominal interest rates have not become more  restrictive since the beginning of the year, or even since the small  action taken a couple weeks ago However, I would say that lender and  borrower attitudes toward credit have worsened in a sense and that  given the level of interest rates and those attitudes, the posture in  credit markets should be characterized as somewhat more restrictive  That is, it seems to me that there's less of an inclination to use  credit and more of an inclination on the part of certain institutions  to restrict the supply of credit at current interest rates   One approach to policy when there are uncertainties about  interpreting credit [conditions] is to put a lot more reliance on the  aggregates That is the reverse of the other approach, which is to  look at credit when there's uncertainty about the aggregates The  aggregates have their problems, but perhaps they're gradually being  resolved I would point out that M1 now has moved back up into the  1-1/2 to 4 - l / 2  percent range that the Committee has adopted, as can be  seen on the charts on page 10 of the Bluebook M2 has moved up close  to the bottom [of its range] And if the staff's forecast for the  May-June period is in the right direction, M1 will be moving up closer  to the middle of its range and M2 might actually touch the bottom or  move up into the range     5/22/79 -15-   I think it continues to be the better part of wisdom for the  Committee to take account of both credit market conditions and the  aggregates in its policy deliberations and instructions to the  Manager And in view of the recent developments in the aggregates and  the uncertainties about credit conditions, one approach might be to  have a rather wide range for the aggregates--that is, not to take any  tightening actions unless the aggregates were moving close to the  middle of their long-run ranges or above, and not to take any easing  actions unless they were falling clearly below the bottom of the long-  run ranges One way to do that would be to widen the ranges from the  4 to 4-1/2 percentage points that the Committee has been using to 5 or  5-1 /2  or even 6 points, and to put most of that widening on the upper  ends and not on the lower ends of the ranges This could be  accomplished with either a money market directive or a monetary  aggregates directive, depending on how sensitive the Committee wants  to be to changes in the aggregates Under current circumstances, and  [given] my interpretation of the restrictiveness of credit conditions,  I would recommend a money market directive    If I may, President Baughman, I did want to  lean more on the aggregates but I didn't want to [suggest] that the  Committee should tighten with growth rates as low as they are under  these alternatives That's why I [proposed] a wider range on the high  side     5 / 2 2 / 1 9  -19-   M R   BAUGHMAN I'd like to toss in a couple of points which  seem to suggest something a little different than some of the points  that have been made thus far One, we were advised that Sears Roebuck  recently sent out mailings to most of its credit customers raising  their [credit limits] Sears apparently inspected its records and  discovered that a high proportion of [its cardholders] were at the  maximum amount authorized It has been reported that they got a nice  response, which I construed as indicating that those consumers at  least were still willing to use credit that was made conveniently  available to them I have also encountered--and it seems impressive,  possibly because it's surprising to me--a number of instances of what  I would call small speculators on houses People are acquiring  ownership of several units of housing Frequently a part of the  explanation given is the recent increase to $100,000 in the amount of  capital gains I don't know how they're going to hitch that to gains  on more than one unit, but in their minds they seem to be able to do  it   A development that I am still unable to explain is the  persistent decline in the number of active drilling rigs In an  attempt to check into that, we heard a whole array of what seem to me  rather peripheral explanations In total I suppose they have to add  up to the fact that for increasing numbers of owners of these rigs--  most of them are for lease--people who would hire them apparently are  not willing to accept the risks and the costs involved in drilling  But that seems to me to be an incongruous development   The housing bounceback that I've been inclined to expect in  Texas in particular, with the revision of the usury law which seemed  to be moving through the legislature satisfactorily, may not now  materialize We have a phenomenon in Texas at the present time which  has been rather colorfully characterized as the "killer bees" where a  miniority interest in the state legislature--but a group still large  enough so as to prevent a quorum from being constituted--has simply  absented themselves from the chamber That has consequently stopped  the forward motion of legislative action    Thank you, Mr Chairman I would recommend for  Committee consideration the alternative B range for the federal funds  rate, which is 10 to 10-1/2 percent centered at 10-l/4 percent--the  prevailing federal funds rate With regard to the aggregates, I would  suggest an M1 range of 0 to 5-1/2 percent, which is a wide range, with  more of an increase on the up side compared with alternative B than on  the down side That would mean, if the Committee adopted a money  market directive as I would also suggest, that easing would occur  until M1 got above the midpoint of the long-run range With regard to  M2, in view of recent events and to provide some room for the shifting  of funds to banks because of the regulation Q action taken in the  spring, I would recommend a range of 4 to 9 percent, one percentage  point higher on the upper end than the alternative B range In terms  of M2 then, no tightening would occur until M2 was well into its long-  run range And as I indicated, M r   Chairman, I believe that a money  market directive is desirable under the current circumstances    Yes, that's right    That's right We have a little stronger growth  rate on average for April and May together than we think is the     5/22/79 -28-    underlying trend June itself at around 5 percent, is closer to what  we think is the underlying trend, even though that‘s a shade above it  S o  we washed out the April--    Well, we have zero for May At current  interest rates we think the normal rate would be more like 3-112 to 4  percent on average if the ATS stays as it is    As I would understand it, President Balles, the  Manager would raise the funds rate from 10-114 toward 10-1/2 percent,  at as deliberate a speed as the market could bear, when M1 and M2 on  average got toward the top of their ranges There would be a degree  of flexibility as to whether he would start moving with M1 at either 5  or 5-112 percent If it was over the range, he would then have to be  at the top of the federal funds rate and would have to come back to  the Committee for instructions It’s symmetrical reasoning, of  course, on the down side So a money market directive would imply a  less prompt movement relative to the aggregates than a monetary  aggregates directive    Yes, that’s correct    That’s right But zero or half--     5/22/79 -29-   M R   BALLES Close to it at least    Yes, that's right That would get [Ml] to the  bottom end of the long-run range    Yes    Or are very close to them   M R   COLDWELL A 16th or a 32nd of a point?     5/22/79 -30-    I think within 1/2 point, [as] in the past,  depending on how much certainty we have regarding the data on the  aggregates   M R   COLDWELL Well, I just wanted the ground rules straight  this time so we don't have another--    That's with the money market directive    The next month that's like that [typically] has  been July    Mr Chairman, may I make one suggestion? If  it's a question of the publicity of [a change from] 9-3/4 to 10-1/2  percent, as I believe both President Mayo and Governor Teeters  mentioned, you could marry that with the 10 to 10-1/2 percent by  simply indicating that there might be a telephone conference if the  rate got down to 10 percent--before a move to 9-3/4    That way you wouldn't have--    The caveat was "without consulting'    Yes we would move the funds rate up or down  well before the aggregates got to the outer limits of the ranges  We'd move more promptly    Yes The usual zone of indifference has been  that or sometimes a little larger, depending on the uncertainty we  feel about the aggregates    M r   Chairman, the Committee had a discussion of  three memos [on this issue] at the last meeting Following that  discussion, the Committee asked us to present a specific proposal  This memo, briefly put, is our specific proposal I have nothing  further to add Mr Holmes?    They have large amounts of yen already    That's what we have now    This would also be an exception to the total    It would also be an exception to the total  That is, if the Manager had a billion dollars in yen he could still  have $500 million in DM     I think that’s right Except that we’re facing [a situation where] only  about that much is all that has disappeared [Ml] went from $371 billion to $368-1/2 billion on  the 13” and has been staying there That’s about the extent of the special factors The other thing  I would mention, President Moms is that when we have these large numbers and they don’t go  away, we tend to average them out over a longer period; that’s why I mentioned the second-  quarter average What we’re beginning to fear is that this so-called demand shift that we have  been pointing out to the Committee--which was very prevalent in the fourth quarter and the first  quarter--may be abating and getting smaller While in retrospect the demand shift that occurred  in 1975-76 seemed to have lasted 2 years or a little more, we thought the one that seemed to have  begun in November of this [past] year might last a smaller length of time That’s because it was  in effect the second round within a period of five years [As a result] many of the large cash  holders had already economized on cash to the extent they could with the existing technology  They didn’t have that much left to do And it’s quite possible, while we can’t explain special  weeks or months in a way, that we can explain it over the long run in that we may be beginning  to see the abatement of the demand shift In that case we would begin to get more money growth  on average than we have experienced since November--not necessarily because the economy is  stronger or weaker but simply because we’re getting a [return to a] more normal relationship of  money to nominal GNP recurring And even with a weak economy I would remind the  Committee that inflation is very strong, so nominal GNP is running pretty strong at the moment     President Morris, it may or may or not occur as  projected, of course, but there is an enormous rate of inflation built  in and an increase in nominal GNP of substantial size even though  there is a recession And our evidence thus far, particularly in the  second quarter, is that the downward shift in money demand that     7/11/79 -9-   appeared in the fourth and first quarters doesn't really appear in the  second quarter to any real extent If that has abated and we have the  substantial increase in nominal GNP, even in the face of recession,  we've got to finance it So our assumption has been that money will  be called out, so to speak, by the economy That may not develop, as  you point out, but I think it's not an unreasonable assumption given  the high rate of inflation that's built into these projections    For '73 the rate of growth in Ml was 62  percent and for '74 it was 51 percent Bank credit growth for '73  and '74 was 15 percent and 102 percent M2 for ' 1 3  was 88 percent  and for '74, 17 percent    Yes    I was interpreting such a move as unchanged  because the midpoint remains 6 percent after [adjustment] for ATS    Mr Chairman, may I ask two questions on that?  In explaining it to the public in the report, I assume we would say  something like Given what has happened in the second quarter, it is  now expected that ATS growth may be somewhat less than originally  thought and, therefore, growth in M1 may be somewhat higher in the  range than at the midpoint But more importantly from the point of  view of material presented to the Committee--in terms of a tracking  path for M1 to judge against--would I be wrong or right in assuming  that the tracking path would center not so much on 3 percent if we had  evidence that the ATS effect is running at 1-1/2 percent, but would  center more on the 4-1 /2  percent top of the range? In other words,  the staff would have a question of what we would present to the  Committee for it to judge how it is going to--    From the discussion, absent any other  instruction, I would assume that we would track essentially on the 3  to 6 percent measured range    I have a copy, M r   Chairman    It says that as a part of its report on July 20  of each year in addition to [the ranges for the current year], the  Board of Governors shall include a statement of its objectives and  plans with respect to the ranges of growth or diminution of the  monetary and credit aggregates for the calendar year following the  year in which the report is submitted    Mr Chairman, if I just might add a comment  In no way am I trying to interrupt the decisionmaking process nor am I  claiming to be a market psychologist, but it's my impression that in  1977 the credibility of the System was undermined more for having set  low ranges that it didn't hit than for having set [unintelligible] I  think that had more of an impact than anything else in that period    Well, at least back to the early ' 7 0 s  so it can  be--    I was going to ask, M r   Chairman, whether you  wanted to worry about the wording of this matter now that the vote is  settled Or should we settle that with you later?    Well, Mr Chairman, to be very brief it seems  to me that alternative I1 on page 10 in the Bluebook would be quite  consistent with the long-run decision the Committee just made The  federal funds rate range we show there is the one currently in place,  9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent But of course the operating funds rate level  has been 10-1/4 percent, so it's an asymmetrical midpoint so to speak  That's what I would recommend to the Committee, given its decision  just now     7/11/79 -42-    Mr Chairman, before the Committee Votes on  that, I ought to bring to their attention special factors in this  area The most obvious is that what will affect M2 particularly is  whether the 6-month bill rate happens to be just below 9 percent or  above 9 percent That has turned out to have a very pronounced  effect    That's right    If it goes below 9 percent, then the S&Ls will  have a greater advantage which can take funds away [from banks] If  it goes above 9 percent, the banks have an advantage There's  considerable uncertainty in our projections in that area I just  wanted to explain that     7/11/79 -49-     Well, the present limit is $1-1/2 billion Between meetings the Manager can change the System's position [in foreign currencies] by up to $1-1/2 billion and then [beyond] that point he has to go to the Committee It might be advisable, in view of the Committee's sentiment, simply to suspend that limit of $1-1/2 billion   Well, if intervention continues in size today and tomorrow, we will need to go to the Committee to request that [the limit] be suspended at that point So you could either do it now if you wish or we could simply send a telegram when required    Mr Chairman, I would just like to call to the Committee's attention--I don't believe it requires any action at this point--that there is an intermeeting limit on foreign exchange market operations set by the Committee That limit is $1-1/2 billion and there is $877 million leeway left under that limit It doesn't require any action today but since the issue was mentioned last week, I wanted to alert the Committee to the possibility that a telegram might be forthcoming in a few days if more intervention of size is required    President Balles, it's a measure of the fiscal policy effects that's conventionally [used] People look at the high employment surplus to standardize for the level of activity And on that projection--granted the measurement differences among people--the change from, say, the 2nd quarter of '79 to the 4th quarter of '80 throughout is fairly consistently in a restrictive direction That is, the high employment surplus grows so that more is being taken out of the economy as it gets weaker rather than vice versa That's just one measure people take as an indicator of fiscal policy   [Statement--see Appendix]   Given the recession we have projected, which is slightly under 2 percent [negative GNP], and the degree of inflation, I guess I have the normal lack of confidence, but not any more than that But I would think that [those projections] might be too low rather than too high if the nominal GNP we have forecast develops I say that because on our quarterly econometric model--and you know there's uncertainty around that--the amount of so-called drift that's implied in that number is 3 percentage points It's fairly high, and we have turned out to be right in the past on drift But that we can't be certain about   Mr Chairman, there is the possibility that the Committee could adopt a mixed directive--and the Committee once had such a directive--that in effect was aggregates on the up side and money market on the low side That is, you'd move the funds rate up if the aggregates were high in the range but you wouldn't [lower the rate] until growth is below the bottom of the range We had wording at one point for such a directive    [Statement--see Appendix]    It's quite possible; these equations may very  well not be picking up the true transactions needs if they don't have  the full price effects of the imported prices in them And they  don't The GNP is measuring domestic output prices So that's quite  possible, in which case we would not really be supplying more money     -11-   than historical relationships would suggest but about the same amount  In either event, [money growth] would be rapid but we‘d have a  somewhat different explanation of what we might expect in the future  It would tend to argue less, I would think, for a slowdown in the  future [stemming from people1 just deciding to invest their excess  cash but would depend more critically on a real slowing in the  economy    Yes    Well, there is a considerable drop in what we  projected in bank loans and commercial paper raised in the fourth  quarter A l s o ,  we were talking mainly about business credit demands  but there has been a slackening currently in consumer credit demands  S o  we have a little tapering off in the current quarter relative to  the second quarter and essentially we are in a downward trend in terms  of credit demands and credit funds raised in the second half of the  year beginning about now--just as we‘re supposed to be getting a lower  growth in money beginning about now These are in our projections    Well, we have total funds raised coming down in  the third quarter relative to the second, but the second quarter was  an unusual peak  though well below the second and then it goes down further in the  fourth quarter But again, the fourth quarter remains above the first  quarter   And the third quarter is above the first quarter,     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -12-    However, I would add, Mr Chairman, that that's  partly offset in the short-term markets by an increase in borrowing in  the commercial paper market We have a projection for September which  has lower business loans than we had in July and August    I’ll be very elliptical, Mr Chairman, in the  interest of saving time I was of course couching my own discussion  in the terms in which the Committee has been framing its policies If  the Committee had been framing its policies in terms of the monetary  base or reserves or something like that as an operating device, I  would have couched the discussion in those terms It’s perfectly true  that the monetary base or reserves have expanded much more rapidly in  the past two or three months than they had in the previous two or  three months In part that‘s because of efforts to hold the funds  rate down; in part it’s because currency, which has a bigger weight in  the base, has increased more rapidly And in part it’s because banks  have begun adding to holdings of CDs and absorbing more reserves that  way, whereas in the two or three previous months when M1 had been  growing CDs had been dropping, releasing reserves available to support  money So reserve growth didn’t have to be as rapid in order to  support the same amount of money I add those latter factors in order  to indicate how complicated it is to have a relationship between  reserves and money that is stable because the deposit mix and thus the  need for reserves is constantly shifting, and preferences for currency  versus deposits are constantly shifting So it’s very hard to come  before the Committee and say If you set the monetary base or  reserves to grow this much, I can guarantee this much money And it  would be even more difficult to tell the Committee what federal funds  rate or what interest rates are likely to emerge from that--questions  the Committee obviously would want to and need to know   S o  I’m not saying it’s impossible and I‘m not even really  indicating my preferences in the matter But it’s not going to be any  less difficult, in a practical way, to control money with reserves  than it is to control it with the federal funds rate because it will  always involve the Committee in two decisions [First], what should  be its fundamental target Is the money target that it is setting  right or wrong and should it [change] in light of changing  circumstances? And [second], what is it going to do about interest  rates? Does the Committee in fact want them to go up or down in the  way that they would be going if we adhere fairly ridgidly to a preset  reserve target I hasten to add that I don’t mean to say that I don‘t  think it would be useful to have a reserve or a base target  Personally, I happen to think it would be useful   M R   ROOS Well, Paul, the reason I asked the question--and I  ask it purely in a constructive way, not to just reopen the classical  argument--is because of the problems that we’ve had in controlling  money growth [Given] your statements, which I think are great, that  we’re never going to accomplish our ultimate goal until we achieve  some discipline in terms of monetary growth, couldn‘t we discuss these  issues again? Maybe I am out of order to raise this now, but couldn’t  there be a discussion again of whether or not our traditional policy     9/18/79 -14-   of targeting on interest rates, in spite of the possible adverse  consequences in terms of money growth, [is appropriate]? Shouldn’t  this be given another look in view of everything you‘ve said and in  view of the less than happy experience that the FOMC has had over the  past years in achieving its goals of stability in terms of the  inflation problem? Shouldn‘t we take a look at this in some way?    In the first one, I was trying to say that to  some extent people may have reduced their demand deposits and savings  deposits earlier because of ATS accounts and the high interest rates  and found that they just couldn‘t run with such small deposits so  they’ve put some back in [I would] just sort of forget that  addition; it‘s an offset    Of the three explanations, I would put the  lowest probability myself on that one    It’s relatively low, but in the absence of  evidence I was reluctant even to weigh them    There is one other factor, Chairman Volcker  Beginning in that period in the second half where we had that sharp  swing back to savings deposits, which I have been interpreting as part  of this precautionary mood [response], they had been declining rather  sharply Then they've been increasing in very recent months and that  swing would also affect these numbers It may not be the major factor  but it's another element different from previous cycles that may be  affecting these numbers     9/18/79 -16-    Well, perhaps not in complete answer but in  partial answer, President Mayo, I would think that the availability of  Euro-dollar funds abroad has made it necessary to have interest rates  a little higher in this market than we would otherwise because large  firms can simply borrow a little cheaper abroad than they can here  On the general point you are raising, what I tried to say earlier was  that my instinct was that the 13 percent prime rate was producing some  real restraint In simple terms, if people expect the rate of price  inflation to be less than 13 percent, it's immediately a very  restrictive rate Now, we will have [firms] perhaps expecting that  their sales are going to weaken, in which case that adds to the  restrictiveness So the rate is the main factor at present, and the  need for higher rates domestically is greater because of this lower  rate in Euro-dollar markets    If we can't, I think we probably have to throw  out the history of economics    May I say, Mr Chairman, technically the ATS  effects recently have been running only 1/2 percent, not 1-1/2  percent    I was referring to the recent months     Mr Chairman, the aggregates are running high  in the ranges that the Committee had set at the previous meeting on  September 18 At that time, the Committee adopted an M1 range of 3 to  8 percent and an M2 range of 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for the period  covering September to October With data through October 3, our  estimate is that M1 growth in that period will be 7-1/2 percent, very  close to the upper end of the range, and that M2 growth will be 97  percent, also close to the upper end of the range though not quite as  close as is M1   With the money aggregates running strong and a rather  considerable amount of churning and pressures in the foreign exchange  markets, the federal funds rate has drifted up--I'm sure Peter will go  into more detail on that--and along with that we've had some upward  pressures on other short-term rates In the long-term market, [yields  on] high grade corporate issues have reached record levels for the  year, rising on the order of around 11 basis points since the  Committee meeting They are at the point where in the latest week we  estimate a new high grade corporate offering at very close to a 1015  percent yield, apparently reflecting the worsening of inflationary  expectations as well as the fairly sizable calendar of such offerings  in recent weeks, led particularly by the IBM offering of a billion  dollars   Bank credit growth continues to be very strong We had very  large demands through the September tax date I would guess that was  because of strains on corporate liquidity positions and the need to  finance large inventories while having to make large tax payments  But we have not seen an unwinding of that commensurate with the  increases in that period, so for the month of September we think that  bank credit is going to grow at about a 19 percent annual rate as     10/05/79 - 3 -    compared with 10 and 13 percent in the previous two months And we  estimate that business loans in September grew at around a 20 percent  annual rate as compared with an average growth rate of 18 percent in  the previous two months So banks have been very actively searching  out funds to finance these demands that they've been accommodating and  we have had a resumption of fairly sizable CD expansion in recent  weeks as well as continued large takings from the Euro-dollar market     Mr Chairman, if I might add a point If the  Committee goes this route, I was planning to have a conference call  with the discount window officers My intent would not be to say  anything about their administrative procedures but to explain that  they might expect more volatile movements in borrowing than under  existing procedures    I wanted the discount officers to be aware that  they shouldn't be shocked if one bank is in and another one is out,  because the funds rate might exhibit more volatility    For Ml?    48    The growth rate shown there produces a rate  [for M11 for the year of 53 percent The range for the year,  suitably adjusted, is 3 to 6 percent So, that 53 percent is about  halfway between the 45 percent middle of the range and the 6 percent  upper end of it    There‘s going to be variability It’s possible  to get different September-to-December growth rates for the same  quarterly average, as I’m sure the Committee realizes, depending on  when in the quarter the growth occurs and all that    Or you could use the quarterly average and have  varying growth rates for September to December, whichever you want    I would have to translate it into the quarterly  average    The Committee’s target is for Q4 1978 to Q4  1979 If we had a quarterly average rate of 59 percent [for the  fourth quarter] the rate [for the targeted period] would be 53  percent To the degree that you lower the [rate desired for the  remaining] months to what you were suggesting--and depending on when  exactly in the quarter that slower growth occurred--it would affect  that quarterly average If it occurred early in the quarter, the  quarterly average would go down more than if it occurred all in  December, say    This shows the slowing that’s going to occur  The slowing is in process, but the effect on the quarterly average is  delayed because we are going into the quarter with such a high rate    Yes    We are coming off a 9-1/2 percent rate in the  third quarter   CIiAIRMAN VOLCKER We are starting the fourth quarter high,  so it’s very hard to get that down    Yes I don’t know about Peter--he can speak  for himself--but I feel very strongly that if we are in any way going  to be held responsible for this operating technique working out, a  very wide federal funds rate range is necessary    M r   Chairman, if I may [ask a question] I  assume that means, in giving Peter some estimate of the nonborrowed  [reserve objective], he might start with a level of borrowing that is  somewhat higher than the $11 to $13 billion it has been running on  average in the past 3 or 4 weeks So initially in constructing the  path for nonborrowed reserves that seems consistent with the money  growth path the Committee sets, we would reduce the total by having a  level of borrowing that is somewhat higher [than it has been  recently]    Well, in a way I’m a little puzzled because our  knowledge of the relationships comes through a whole span of rates  As we get to very high rates, it may be that banks‘ willingness to  borrow becomes stronger If their willingness to borrow is about the  way it has been, I would be thinking about $15 billion But the  banks may become more willing to borrow and we may have to think of a  higher level of borrowing for the same federal funds rate     10/6/79 -47-     Well, we know what the borrowings are going to  be We can tell that It's a question of what rates are going to  fall out of those borrowings    That's right; we know what free reserves are  going to be    Mr Chairman, I could save the Committee some  trouble in reading [this draft directive] by pointing out that page 1  is a repeat of the existing long-run target [directive language]  Page 2 is the new operational paragraph that is proposed     Yes     10/22/79 -5-    Governor Teeters, I might add that that relates  to this week Next week we might have to be absorbing reserves,  depending on whose figures are right on what market factors are doing     [statement--see Appendix]    Yes    On "A" it's a little over $1 billion    For "C," it's between 7-112 and 8 percent--  1-112 to 2 percentage points [less]    Seasonally adjusted--no, just in the sense  that I took it from week to week    Yes    It might be fairer to view it as under "B"  that we have targeted growth in November of 1/2 of one percent and in  December a monthly average of 10 percent Under "C" in November it's  about 1/4 of one percent and in December about 8-1/2 percent I just  want to give a sense that we need to push it up, but the week to week  [pattern] can vary just depending on how the weeks turn out    Yes, that's what we in effect targeted to get  the 4-1/2 percent [growth rate from September to December]    If the Committee puts in the reserves--the  reserve path we've designed--we believe we will get it Where we're  uncertain is whether that will be with stable interest rates or  declining rates Our general view is that it will probably be with  some decline in interest rates, which is the reason we started that  path off with borrowing of $1-1/2 billion--a shade lower than we have  had in recent weeks    It is our collective-type projection of what  would happen to money If interest rates didn't change at all, it  would be slightly lower than in alternative B    We did put in the Bluebook--for general  guidance--January figures And I could--    I can tell you what we did there We assumed  you had a 6 percent M1 growth target for the year 1980 So we  calculated from the fourth quarter average to the first quarter  average a growth of 6 percent And the figure there for January for  alternative B is a level that gets right on that [ 6  percent1 line from  the fourth quarter to the first For alternative A, it's a little  over that because [that alternative involves] easing now And for  alternative C it's a little under it The level that would be implied  for alternative B for January gives a January growth rate from  December of 5  7  percent, just on a month-to-month basis    I don't have worked out a continuation of the  4-1/2 percent path because--    " B  "     F r o m  October to January it's 5  5  percent;  there's very little difference between that and 57 percent for the  month    In "C," from December to January it's 44  percent We assumed that the Committee would be restraining growth a  bit below path in the first quarter, so we have it below and then  coming back up So in January M1 is a little below that 6 percent  path These are all things the Committee can adjust, but that's the  assumption we made if you went to alternative C   M R   PARTEE So you'd have 4  4  percent for January Then  that means you would have something under 4-1/2 percent for the 4  months And for the 3 months from October to January growth would be  about 4-1/2 percent, I guess    It would be 5 percent because the January  growth rate picks up a little relative to the other alternatives to  begin [to get M11 coming back on the path    Does that mean that at the next meeting, Mr  Chairman, you'd like us to provide paths with alternative longer-run  growth rates because the year is starting over and also looking ahead  3 months, say?    I think the Board is going to make a decision  on that shortly    That's right Whatever numbers che Committee  picks, it's a path; it's difficult to work with a range in this kind  of thing    For "B" it's 5-1/2 percent essentially    For " C "  it's 5 percent And it's 5  9  percent  for "A"    Mr Chairman, I hate to suggest the  possibility of moving these numbers and set forth another option But  one way to meet your point and the point other members of the  Committee are expressing is to leave M1 at alternative B as you have--  have no change there--but to lower the [associated] M2 because that's  clearly higher than the Committee intended Then in constructing the  reserve path there would be somewhat less reserves And if it does  turn out that M2 tends to grow higher than we allowed in there, it  would put a little downward restraint on M1 That is, the policy  record would have the M1 [range] unchanged, the M2 essentially  unchanged, and our reserve path total will be a little lower than what  is shown here for alternative B    Yes, we can't really get 7-1/2 percent In  alternative C, M2 growth, as you can see, is 8-1/4 percent over the  two months [Adopting] "C" would get [M2 growth] down to 8-1/4  percent If that were substituted, that might reduce the reserve  growth a bit    The way borrowings have been running very  recently, that is about [consistent with] where the present federal  funds rate is, really It's in some sense neutral in that it's  starting out about where we are    The Committee had specified 76 percent    We are at 76 percent to date and our  projection is that the growth in time deposits will be high relative  to M1, so we raised it But of course M2 growth may not come in that  high It has been running high relative to M1 as compared with  expectations, so we continued [that pattern for November-December]    Ye5    No    Oh, yes The Desk is looking at the reserve  path    If M2 is running slow, it will release some  reserves to support M1 and vice versa But they‘re not going to be  [weighted] equally because of the differences in reserve  [requirements]     Well, President Balles, when M2 was coming in  about on track, I don't believe that the staff felt that it had to  make a special effort to push up M1 because the Committee had decided  that the aggregates [could grow at the target rate] or a little lower  Similarly, if M1 were coming in on track and M2 were running very  high, given the stress that we interpreted the Committee to be putting  on M1, it would have been a question as to whether we would want to  adjust the reserve path down for something like that    Yes    Because M1 is coming below It's the  relationship that seems to have changed    Because we're pushing M1 up    ~ 2 ,  therefore, would be running even higher  That's the--    Yes, as I say, banks may not get all that  [projected increase] in time deposits    I would assume, Mr Chairman, that this is  roughly the sentiment that the Committee decided before--that it has  got a hair less M1, and a hair more M2 This to me is essentially  what it--     Mr Chairman, we have some tables we could pass out, which are somewhat similar to the ones that we made available to the Committee at the last meeting and which might be helpful in considering how and whether to proceed with these techniques These tables are designed to elaborate the numbers that underlie Mr Sternlight's operations As you can see, they are divided into two columns On the thought that the Committee wouldn't want to get too far off its path for any sustained period, we divided this period--the seven-week intermeeting period--into a four-week interval and a three- week interval The three-week period ends tomorrow The tables [exhibit] all the perils of lagged reserve accounting, which makes the relation between reserves and money in the short run not as close as one might hope [Operations] were designed to attempt to attain a growth rate in M1 in the September-to-December period of a little over 4 percent and in the November-to-December period of something like 5 percent In the event, as you saw in the Bluebook, we were a bit short on the growth rate in M1 and also in M2; but I think within any reasonable margin of error we were not really very far short  If you focus on the last column, which [covers] the most recent three-week period, you can see that the monetary base turned out about $379 million short of the original path we set And you can see that total reserves turned out about $218 million short of the adjusted path As will be clear shortly, the adjustments were only $4 million So it really is about $220 million short of the original path; there was a currency shortfall involved With total reserves running short, the Manager added roughly $150 million to the original nonborrowed path That is shown in the third panel, where you see adjustments of $146 million That simply is the $150 million added minus the $4 million, which was a decline in the original total reserve path So that is the added adjustment to nonborrowed reserves because total reserves were running short of what seemed consistent with this money stock figure, again recognizing the looseness in linkages because of lagged reserve accounting Thus, to translate that into borrowings, you can see that the original path based on the Committee's decision in November, which was to assume borrowings at $17 billion, would be subtracted from total reserves to give [the level of nonborrowed reserves] the Manager would aim for initially After the $150 million adjustment, that would get us down to $1,550 million in borrowings; and given the weakness in total reserves demanded relative to what was projected as needed to get the [desired growth in the] aggregates, actual borrowings, of course, fell short    1/8-9/80  even of that So the deviation of $218 million from the [assumed level of] borrowing turned out to be exactly the same as the deviation from the adjusted total reserve path of $218 million That's just simply arithmetic  The source of some of the problems we were having is shown on the next page; they are inherent in this kind of targeting procedure Again, I'd say that thus far I think we've been fairly lucky in coming up with growth in money that was pretty consistent with what the Committee wanted As you can see, on the original total reserve path we were off $222 million from [the path] we first constructed Adjustments came later They really involved two components, and they went in opposite directions One was excess reserves, which actually turned out to be $166 million higher than we had built into the original path; that is line B in the last column And in terms of the uses of total reserves, required reserves were running $388 million weaker So, simply taking total reserves as the sum of excess and required reserves, total reserves were running [below by] $222 million Thinking of it from the sources side, we just didn't supply that much reserves With lagged reserve accounting, to do so we would have had to pile in a lot more excess reserves than even the banks were willing to hold I don't know how much that would have amounted to because we would have had to run down borrowings to begin with  Now, the bulk of the shortfall in required reserves was in the type of liabilities requiring reserves that didn't enter into either M1 or M2 As you can see, there were shortfalls relative to expectations of $80 million in large CDs, $90 million in US government deposits, and $167 million in the marginal reserves, which are connected with the shortfall in large CDs That's essentially because bank credit ran a lot weaker than we expected and banks simply were not borrowing in the market in order to meet those credit demands Thus, we adjusted the path, really, so that the Manager wouldn't supply those reserves We hadn't made any adjustments to path since October 6th until this past three weeks And we had such large consistent shortfalls in these items that it seemed that we would get too much money unless we adjusted the path, so the Manager in effect absorbed the reserves released by the decline in these deposits Of course there was a shortfall in currency relative to expectations, as shown in the third line, line E And in terms of reserve requirements, that meant we would have had to add $30 million to total reserves to compensate for the shortfall in currency However, that was more than made up, as you can see, by the sharp drop in required reserves behind large negotiable CDs, US government deposits, and marginal reserves Those minuses much more than compensated for the added reserves needed for the shortfall in currency That is, simply put, the drop in negotiable CDs released reserves that could be used to expand the deposits needed to make up for the shortfall in currency So, netting through all those things, we ended up reducing the total reserve path by $175 million, as you can see in line F, to reflect changes in deposit mix and in currency flows It's a rather rough net that won't add up exactly, but it goes in the direction that all items listed under D and E would suggest on [balance] On the other hand, because excess reserves were running extremely [high], we felt we had to add reserves because banks' behavior with regard to excess reserves was totally different in terms of magnitude from what we had expected So in the end, as Peter mentioned, because banks kept holding more excess reserves than we    1/8-9/80  were expecting every week, somewhat belatedly we added $171 million So, those adjustments net out to virtually nothing If you took that minus $4 million and related it to the $222 million, you get this $218 million, which is the deviation from the adjusted path In general, this time it seemed very reasonable to make these adjustments to the path In the previous periods we did not because we didn't see extremely large sustained movements; the movements we did see in the earlier periods were more toward rapid expansion in CDs and in bank credit, things that we assumed the Committee wanted to hold down However, this time it was toward very weak bank credit; and we assumed that the Committee did not want that very weak bank credit to be reflected in excessive expansion in Ml, so we made some offsetting adjustments Of course, with lagged reserve accounting, the impacts on Ml are not related one-for-one to what we do this week One has to wait for some time to come But in any event, by the time all this was done, we still ended up with weak total reserves because we couldn't provide enough nonborrowed reserves to bring total reserves up to path within this three-week period   We fell short on total reserves, not on the nonborrowed   Well, Governor Partee, that's certainly a very fair question It has always been an issue, so far as I understand the procedures My understanding of the original Committee decision was that we would put more weight on nonborrowed reserves than on    1/8-9/80  total reserves, but still the Manager would have freedom when there was clear cause The staff would have the freedom to adjust the total reserves but the Manager would have the freedom to adjust the nonborrowed reserves when there was clear cause for there being a shortfall So, early in the three-week period, we did add $150 million to nonborrowed when it appeared that the gap between the total reserves path and total reserves demanded was something on the order of $450 million And then in each successive week that gap of $450 million kept getting narrower as required reserves began revising up from what we had [projected] The money supply [growth] estimate for December when we made this adjustment was on the order of 3-1/2 percent or so, I think; it has now ended up at 5-1/2 percent So as that gap narrowed, I think--Peter can speak for himself--we were a little reluctant to make any further adjustment because we were going in the right direction and we were on the nonborrowed path Now, it did seem to us that the funds rate ought to drop as member bank borrowing dropped from $17 billion to the $12 to $13 billion area In the event, now that bank borrowings in the last past three days have been running $600 or $700 million and the funds rate still has not dropped, there seems to have been a change in the demand for borrowing function, so to speak That is, member banks, who had been very willing borrowers in late October and over the course of November--they had high borrowing at a funds rate that's lower than it is now--have backed away from the window It's quite possible that we have been late in catching up with that and that in some sense the nonborrowed path ought to have been set higher because of this change in member banks' borrowing patterns And as Mr Sternlight mentioned in his briefing, this week in effect he's adding more to the nonborrowed path than is indicated even in this table because borrowing is running so low If that's the case, then the $17 billion of borrowing that was set originally was way too high to achieve those particular targets, and the downward adjustments in them are coming, in a sense, with a lag   I don't have any very good reason at $600 or $700 million, but at $12 and $13 billion I think that's returning more to the historical pattern When we evaluate the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate, $12 or $13 billion of borrowing isn't unreasonable What was out of the historical pattern was November and late October when we had much higher borrowing at a spread that was even less than we have now That was what was [off] the historical pattern What we had up until three days ago is closer to the historical pattern Now we have much less borrowing than one would expect historically, and I would assume borrowing is going to jump back up   [Yes], in looking at the uses of total reserves But if you really make it tough for yourself and analyze this by looking at the sources of total reserves, as I think one should--if you think you're on a total reserve target, which the Committee has not clearly said it's on, having said it's much more on a nonborrowed target--you would say that we fell short on the total reserves in this three-week period simply because we didn't put in enough nonborrowed reserves to push up the total reserves to target Of course, if we had put in nonborrowed reserves--given the required reserves, which aren't going to change that fast--borrowings would have dropped, one for one Then eventually we would have had to add to the excess reserves, which were running [about] $400 or $500 million, and we would have ended up with $700 million or so in excess reserves--that would have been the mechanism--and very close to zero borrowing to attain this The funds rate very likely would have dropped well below the bottom of the range I would say--and I don't  -5-    1/8-9/80  know if Mr Sternlight would put it in the same way--that if you thought we were on a total reserve target, the reason we fell short was that we didn't push out the nonborrowed reserves aggressively enough and push up excess reserves--which is all we can push around with required reserves fixed--sufficiently to get the total reserves And what would have stopped us would have been the bottom of the funds rate range We'd clearly have gone below that  What in practice stopped us, I think, was that the pattern we saw developing was not out of keeping with what in effect had been planned at the time of the Committee meeting and, judging from the Committee's discussion, what the Committee would have found acceptable That is, at the time of the Committee meeting we had a November rate of growth in M1 of 19 percent, and for December--it was just after the meeting when we had the revisions--Ml growth of 79 percent Midway through the period we were looking at growth in November of 1 percent and in December of 38 percent That was around mid-December Then [our estimates changed] as we got to the end of December, and now we are looking at [M1 growth in] November of 1 percent and in December of 57 percent So it began to look to us that growth was moving up That's what I was explaining to Governor Partee Required reserves were coming up and as the period went on-- in the last two or three weeks--our shortfall against total reserves was becoming less; it appeared that we were moving in the proper direction And since we were right on the nonborrowed adjusted path, which was already $150 million above what was originally set, it didn't seem reasonable in that context to take a more aggressive action to chase the total reserves in this very short period I don't know whether I'm being extremely clear, but I think that's the true answer   I was going to say, Mr Chairman, if I may, that I don't know what the test of success is, but if the Committee was aiming at 42 percent in M1 and achieved 3 percent, by my measure that's success   Exactly That's what's so puzzling, Governor Teeters One would have expected a response of a bigger demand for reserves--that is, wanting less borrowing and more excess reserves-- earlier and then getting used to it later And what we're seeing now is an increased demand for free reserves in the last three or four weeks relative to what was the case earlier In some sense for any given amount of nonborrowed that we provide, if there's a bigger demand for free reserves, we're going to get less expansion for them [as they] go into excess or into reduced borrowing   Well, that may depend on certain other factors like the attitudes of people in the funds market and how [they react] to the volatility  [ If I may, Mr Chairman, the staff feels the same reluctance you do about modifying any paths, President Willes In this three-week period it was the first time we did it in any consistent way during the twelve weeks this experiment has been running And it was only, of course, because it seemed that we had a very clear movement of factors That's a partial answer to Governor Partee We did [the adjustment of] $175 million early in the period, and as these factors got bigger or smaller we didn't want to adjust for small changes because, after all, then we would end up chasing it --going up one week, down the next, and we wouldn't know So we try to [adjust] as infrequently as possible just on the grounds that you mentioned, because things would tend to average out However, when there was a very clear change, it began to look as if we had very little alternative But it was only because of very, very clear changes, we thought   [I'd make] two other points regarding [the issue] you raised, President Roos I don't think publishing a reserve path will make the relationship between reserves and deposits any more predictable I doubt that public relations [efforts] would work in the direction of making that relationship more predictable because I think that depends on other things We may want to publish a long-run reserve path, but I think it would have to be for other reasons Secondly, though, if we [publish] a short-run reserve path--say for three months--I think we're going to generate in the markets the same effect that is generated by the money supply publication Every time we come out with our reserves number, which we publish once a week, markets are going to see [where it is] in relation to the path and then start arguing with themselves [about what] that means They might say it means that we're going to lower reserves next week and that means the funds rate is going to go up next week, which may or may not be true because we may have a pattern in mind very different from theirs And it might generate unnecessary movements in the market While that's not fatal to anything, it's an unnecessary impediment to the smooth carrying out of operations Those are the other two points I would add to what Mr Sternlight said   Well, there may be some differences [of view] among the staff on the issues you raised, President Balles I'll respond to two of your points I have not thought for the ten to fifteen years I've thought about it that there was ever any use to lagged reserve accounting, and this experience of the past three months reinforces me in that judgment However, I also have not thought that doing away with a two-week lag is miraculously going to make it easy to achieve the monetary aggregates targets So, while I think lagged reserve accounting is not a plus in targeting monetary aggregates through reserves, doing away with it isn't going to mean that we're going to do better than hitting 3 percent when we're aiming at 42 percent We could continue, in an unbiased way, sometimes hitting 54 percent when we're aiming at 42 percent--getting within plus or minus a percentage point [or so] over a three-month period In my own mind, and maybe I'm wrong on it, I think that was a fairly good result from the Committee's point of view  Secondly, I've become more convinced--this goes back for years because I remember I spent some [time] years [ago] trying to talk President Morris out of total reserves--that in practice total reserves is the more appropriate guide in the short run, namely because of this fatal flaw of trying to decide what is the proper level of borrowing It's very hard to decide that And, therefore, while I know we can't hit a total reserve [target] even without lagged reserve accounting in the short run--because the banks can repay borrowing faster or things like that--this experience indicates to me that it's a somewhat better guide But using [total reserves] more as a guide automatically introduces even more interest rate volatility than putting emphasis on nonborrowed reserves So there's something of a tradeoff Those are the two things--  -11-    1/8-9/80   Well, we're inevitably going to have to make the judgments one way or another But, for example, if banks aren't borrowing and we're on a nonborrowed target, we're going to fall short on total If we're on a total reserves target and they are not borrowing, we automatically sort of have to put in more nonborrowed reserves and we would come up to our total target   If they are not borrowing It's simply like that We, of course, will always have these kinds of judgments to make   To be perfectly frank, we've paid no attention to the base in the process but we've paid attention to currency That's because if currency were falling short persistently as it did last time--if it fell short $500 million, then that would mean to me not to put in $500 million more of reserves because doing so would produce a multiple in deposits and way too much money The way we would do it is that we'd say currency is falling short $500 million, 16 percent is the marginal reserve requirement on demand deposits, and that means to make up for that we would have to put in $80 million more total reserves If that were happening persistently, we'd have to adjust our path for total reserves up by $80 million to make up for it So, while not really paying any attention to the base in an operating sense, we are trying to pay attention to currency as well as non-member deposits to see that our total reserve path is properly adjusted to come close to what the Committee wants for money growth   Right, so we'd use a fraction of the reserves   That's right Well, maybe lagged reserve accounting isn't the impediment I think it is   I would point out, Mr Chairman, that the element of luck and coincidence in here has a lot to do with lagged reserve accounting I may be safeguarding the staff's view because what happens to deposits this week does not have an awful lot to do with what we do with reserves this week It has something to do with interest rates this week, so there is that element of luck and coincidence If we didn't have lagged reserve accounting, we'd have more real problems that might emerge   [The issue] will be before the Board before this month is out   Governor Coldwell, the effective constraint on that--the way it's structured now--is the funds rate That is, the funds rate constraint stops us In my view Mr Sternlight probably couldn't have raised the total reserves in this last [period beyond] that $400 million [in] nonborrowed because he would have been stopped by the funds rate constraint So the Committee--   Or the top, either way You could interpret the present directive as the Committee's saying "Here's where the constraint is; it's on the funds rate" Now, that might [not] be sufficient for you But that is how it is at the moment   Well, that may or may not [have happened] but that is the effective constraint that stops us at some point   I assume that expresses the Committee's will If the Committee wants to express itself in another way, that is of course its privilege But at the moment that seems to me how the Committee expresses its will with regard to how much the Manager is free to do   I guess there are always divergent views among the staff; I would have given a somewhat different answer to be frank about it We discuss these things all the time And [my] answer would be that if the Committee were willing to see the funds rate drop as much as that, I woud have been tempted to put in even more nonborrowed reserves On the other hand, once I saw that the required reserves were rising against that, I don't think I would have made any further adjustments, because I realize the Committee wasn't intent on really forcing money out like mad to get a 3 percent growth rate Chances are you might get more later It's that kind of judgment   Mr Chairman, I might add that Mr Simpson, who is well versed in these measures, is here and is--   Mr Chairman, I'm not sure that I have anything extremely helpful to add to this statistical material before the Committee I was going to point out particularly tables 4 and 5 on pages 6 and 7 of the material that we sent out earlier The remarkable thing to me was that the numbers for the new aggregates came out within reasonable ranges That is, they are not numbers that are going to appear strange to the public; once the Committee begins targeting on the new definitions, the rates of growth that are going to have to be adopted will be reasonable relative to the current aggregates For example, on page 4, looking over the recent 10-year period from 1970 to 1979, the rate of growth of the new M2 of 995, or almost 10 percent, is very close to the current M3 growth of 1028 percent, which is its nearest counterpart And the rate of growth in the new M3 of 1108 percent is very close to the 1064 percent rate of growth in M5, which is its nearest counterpart Now, the new M3 is running faster than the current M3 because it has in it relative to the current M3 large negotiable CDs, money market funds, and RPs But that higher rate of growth for a new concept is not so out of keeping with the rates of growth of the current M3 as to make for considerable confusion on the part of the public  Similarly, on table 5 on velocity, you can see that the current and new measures are not behaving very strangely vis-a-vis each other That is, if you look at the Mls, for the new M-1B, which is again a somewhat different concept than the current M1, the trend of velocity is the same That is, there appears to be a consistent upward trend in velocity in the current Ml; if you compare the peak- to-trough numbers in the middle panel for the current M1, they get larger in each one [unintelligible], so the trend is toward higher  -20-    1/8-9/80  rates of growth in velocity We see a similar development in the new M-1B, even though savings accounts are in there That may change a bit for the new M-1B if we get nationwide NOWs because we may get a lot of savings in there and that would involve a temporary drop in the velocity of that measure as we get a one-time transfer of savings as well as checking account funds into the NOW accounts But, again, I don't think these numbers are strange relative to the old numbers So, [I've come to the view] that the transition to the new numbers is not going to be as difficult a public [perception] problem as I originally thought it might be before I saw all these numbers laid out  Another problem the Committee may want to consider, when the transition is made, is to what extent it wishes to operate on M-1A, M-1B, M2, and M3 on the new definitions At least until there are nationwide NOW accounts, I would think you would want to keep operations most focused on the aggregate that is most controllable through the reserve technique, if the Committee's going to continue using the reserve technique That seems to me to argue mostly for M-1A or M-1B But when NOW accounts become very important, M-1B will be distorted as will M-1A And in that case one might have to fall back to a degree more on M2 and possibly M3 But I would assume at least starting in Feruary that M-1A and M-1B would tend to be an index, unless the Committee really wants to change how we've been doing it   Well, under the current system, I think M-1A would get the same weight that M1 now gets That's how I would tend to interpret it   Exactly That's right   I think we still have short rates and even short coupons high relative to the fixed rate ceilings on deposits, so we'll still be getting the funds into these alternatives mainly in the fluctuating rate ceiling deposits We're not assuming substantially different behavior for now--some increase, but it would be very modest   I'd like Mr Darwin Beck to answer that   When we start publishing this, which presumably will be shortly after the next meeting, we are planning to publish M-1A and M-1B weekly but not M2 and M3 They will be monthly [data]   It doesn't really much matter, Governor Coldwell, because NOW accounts are such a small proportion But I have a feeling--don't make the obvious retort, please--that I know more about M-1A than I do about M-1B And until M-1A declines into a much smaller proportion of the world than it now is, I would tend to prefer M-1A All our models, such as they are, are built on M-1A and historical experience; I just know more about it and feel a little more comfortable with it myself So, I really thought it was a good solution, which emerged out of the Board discussions, [to use both measures for a while]   When there are nationwide NOW accounts, what we won't know about M-lB is the extent to which and how fast its velocity is going to revise downward, as people shift savings into NOWs rather than just demand deposits We simply aren't going to know that Similarly, we're not going to know very much about how much is going to go out of M-1A But I feel more comfortable in the sense that--   I don't think the seasonal factor is that bad because NOW accounts are a fairly small proportion of the total Now, if they were 1/2 or 1/3 of the total--   Well, we were planning to publish M-1A and M-1B right next to each other I really don't believe large problems will come from that Then we'd show a couple of other items, the RPs and the money market funds and go on to M2, which will include the RPs and money market funds The difference in level between M-1A and M-1B is not going to be vast until we get the nationwide NOWs And I really wouldn't anticipate any--   As I understand it, the first column would be M-1A, the second column M-1B, the third column overnight RPs and overnight Eurodollars, which would just be Cayman Islands Eurodollars, and the fourth column would be money market funds The fifth column would be M2, which would include the first, third, and fourth columns as components   That's right   But we'll have all the components We'll have a separate table with all the components of all the aggregates as well So, that will all be available   We'll be publishing that table weekly There will be weekly estimates of M-1A and M-1B and of all the commercial bank components of all the Ms, including those in M2 and M3 M2 and M3 will only have monthly figures, but the table will be published weekly M-1A and M-1B will have weekly figures, as will the commercial bank components [of the broader aggregates]   There was considerable Board discussion on that; perhaps I should let the Chairman summarize it   Many members of the staff, including myself, felt that there was a large investment component to RPs That is, we felt that money managers were not viewing RPs--to an extent of 100  -26-    1/8-9/80  percent or [even] 50 percent--as a substitute for demand deposits but were viewing them as an alternative to investing in 3-month bills or 3-month CDs, depending in part on their interest rate expectations So, therefore, if RPs were somehow outlawed, we felt that only a small fraction of the money in RPs would be going to demand deposits and the rest would go into CDs or Treasury bills or commercial paper   Our econometric evidence, I believe, is quite mixed The staff is well divided on the subject With the Board divided and the staff divided, the Board came up with a very judicious decision   I'd just assume, Mr Chairman, that it would be a useful explanatory device for the Committee, if there happens to be a surge in M-1B, to be able to point to a drop in M-1A so that no one reads too much [into the surge in M-1B]   If M-1B was surging and M-1A was strong, I assume things would be read into that   Well, I'm not sure we're going to be up-to-date on L by February   It just says "monetary and credit aggregates"   Mr Chairman, Governor Wallich's comment reminded me of a fact that was inadvertently left out of the Bluebook We showed the actual growth rate of M1 for 1979 of 55 percent and I meant to show also in parentheses, and did not, the growth of M1 as if there had been no ATS accounts One would have had to add 13 percentage points to that on our latest estimate So, 68 percent would be the growth if there were no ATS accounts That same 13 would be added to M-1A, and its growth would be 63 percent if there were no ATS accounts   Other demand shifts may also be occurring   No That would go with a range of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent   Yes   No, I was referring to M-1A; that would add 13 to M-1A I don't have at hand at the moment any additional M1 data   President Willes, that tax package is essentially the difference between Strategy 3 and Strategy 4 on page 11 [of the Bluebook]   [Statement--see Appendix]   But it would be related to the path You wouldn't lose sight of the longer-run path   We would continue to present the growth rates for the whole year as we go on   I presented December to March, and we have in the text the quarterly average growth rates that are roughly consistent with it   December is the base It's essentially the growth rates in January and February and March averaged   The quarterly average is 4-1/2 percent They're running about--   Just a little lower this time   The staff believes, I think--and I can't talk for everyone--that decisionmaking in the economy is affected by the level of interest rates and credit availability On the other hand, the staff believes, or at least I do, that it's difficult for the Committee to make a priori decisions about the proper level of interest rates That's why a money supply target is important because then those decisions come out of the market to a great extent However, because we believe that decisionmaking by businessmen takes into account credit costs and availability, it seems important to try to suggest what the pattern of interest rates might be in the course of the year, and that's what I was trying to say If the Committee adopted a pattern of money growth in the course of the year because it was chasing a long-run target and got way ahead of it early in the year and then wanted to catch up for credibility reasons late in the year, that might imply a very high interest rate You may not want that, so you may want to give up on your long-run target, which could be one credibility problem If we have very high interest rates, I believe it would have effects on economic activity in 1981 If we entered the year with 15 percent, I think economic activity in 1981 would be slower than we've been projecting I've asked Mr Kichline for verification of that   But, President Roos, to be very brief, I was simply addressing myself to the question--raising it for the Committee --of whether you want low growth of M1 in the first half and high growth in the second half or [vice versa] because the Committee has to make that decision, and there are certain implications That's what I was trying to get to   We got 3 percent from September to December and 49 percent, I think, for the quarterly average   Governor Teeters, there's a degree of fine- tuning in the numbers here that has to be taken with a grain of salt But on page 25 in appendix C, if you reduce that 5 percent to 4 percent and still aim at something like 6 percent M1 growth, which is what Jim's assumption is--that's the third column under alternative C --you'd end up in the fourth quarter with a somewhat lower funds rate than under his basic assumption to make up for the greater restraint now That's in essence what that would tend to lead to Similarly, if you had a 5-1/2 percent long-run growth, which we have not shown here, the funds rate in the fourth quarter would probably be somewhat lower under a short-run alternative C path than under short-run alternative B path   A stronger number, Mr Chairman, is for [the week] we are not [yet] going to publish   We would be projecting a 5 percent rate of growth in January instead of 3-1/2 percent, if that number held up   President Morris, if you did that, some of the staff could sit around and make a decision and say Well, we think borrowing ought to be zero And the funds rate would be dropping very sharply immediately We wouldn't make such a callous arbitrary decision, but you would be leaving that possibility open   Well, it's because we know required reserves for next week, and the Desk has to make the choice of whether those required reserves will be met by borrowing at the discount window or through the Desk's provision of nonborrowed reserves If those required reserves happen to equal the total reserves that seem proper, the Manager still has to make that decision   You mentioned the staff and the departure of the staff if we are off the total reserve path In that regard the Committee should remember that with lagged reserve accounting, if deposits turn out to be strong, borrowing will rise and there is no way in the world to get back on a total reserve path in as short a period as 4 weeks; we are going to have to wait longer for the--   That lagged reserve requirement [study] will be ready within a couple of weeks   That will not be ready in that time frame   I doubt it It could be accelerated, but I don't think--   It will hold, President Willes, for 2 weeks; that's certain under lagged reserve requirements   Alternative C in the first quarter we assume would be [consistent with] something like the present interest rate level; it might go down a bit, but more likely--   Not in the first quarter   Mr Chairman, in view of yesterday afternoon's discussion, the basic GNP forecast would probably assume an M-1A growth rate of something under 6 percent The staff in its wisdom will have to decide on somewhere around 5 to 5-1/2 percent to be consistent with that discussion In any event, we would have some alternatives to interpolate  -85-    1/8-9/80    Mr Chairman, lagged reserve accounting, as the Presidents and Board Members know, has been a subject of considerable contention in the System since it was adopted in 1968   That's what I was getting to There has been considerable contention since 1968 when it was adopted And I must say from an internal perspective there was contention between 1966 and 1968, when it was being studied for adoption under a rather different institutional environment and different operating procedures than we now have Various staff groups have studied this since 1973 I am afraid you are not quite getting independent results since I think I was Chairman of three of those groups And they all three unanimously concluded that there is very little to be said for lagged reserve accounting from a monetary policy point of view if the Committee is operating on a reserves target One can't make a case that it is the least bit of help and one can make a case that it is harmful There have been divergences among the staff even in that context of it not being helpful The question is How harmful in fact is it? Some would contend more strongly than others that it's harmful over the longer run Others would contend that it doesn't matter over the longer run That with or without lagged reserve accounting we can perk along on a reserve target and manage to hit our objectives I think that's a legitimate source of dispute because the long run is compounded of a number of short runs And in a very simple-minded sense in any 1-week period there is no defined relationship between the multiplier on deposits and reserves in that week That is, reserves this week can bear any relationship to deposits because all one has to do is worry about two weeks from now So we rely almost entirely, therefore, on banks' responses to interest rates to control deposits When you cut through it all, fundamentally that is no different from relying on a fluctuating federal funds rate target So, I personally would tend to take the view that lagged reserve accounting can make it virtually impossible to hit our targets in the short run and probably is of some importance in making it difficult to hit our targets in the long run Thus, I think it is really quite inconsistent with the present operating procedures Now, I don't mean to say that there aren't other things that are equally difficult The discount window is a problem and our own graduated reserve requirement structure is a problem But in the latter regard, some of Mr Lindsey's research would suggest that lagged reserve accounting    2/4-5/80  accounts for bigger divergences in the multiplier from predictions than does the graduated reserve requirement structure   Mr Lindsey, on my right So I would say that while doing away with lagged reserve requirements is not going to solve all our problems in hitting the aggregates, it at least looks like a step in the right direction In view of this cogent staff analysis, one might be curious as to the reason no action has been taken to date I assume there have been two reasons One was that with the federal funds rate operating target, which has been the principal System operating target for years, or even with a net borrowed reserves operating target, lagged reserve requirements are essentially an irrelevancy, like almost any reserve requirement is an irrelevancy With a funds rate target, the Committee is simply trying to aim at that interest rate which will cause all the adjustments by banks and the public, whether or not there are reserve requirements, that will bring about the proper money supply So in that sense it's irrelevant The other issue was membership The lagged reserve requirement is viewed as a benefit of membership To test that view we did run a survey during one of these staff analyses and, except for those at the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank, all of the directors of Reserve Banks who represented member banks said lagged reserve accounting was desirable In St Louis, the directors said it was undesirable   That was in 1976   The staff has no other way of assessing lagged reserve requirements as a membership benefit One's instinct would be that it is minor relative to the real burden, which is the reserve requirement itself In sum, Mr Chairman, the staff does believe that it is probably appropriate now to move toward contemporaneous reserve accounting if the Committee is going to continue with a reserve targeting procedure In that context, we did offer three alternatives in the memorandum One is moving from a two-week lag to a one-week lag, which would presumably speed up the response of the banking system a bit The second is making reserve requirements contemporaneous for Reserve City banks and leaving a lag for the other 5,000 banks And the third is an essentially contemporaneous scheme for all banks Without going through all the reasons that are detailed in the memo, Mr Chairman, we did conclude that we see very little advantage to any move now except the move to contemporaneous accounting for all banks That is, if the Board did not feel disposed to move toward contemporaneous accounting now, for whatever reasons, the staff would not suggest taking either of the other two alternatives We believe that their advantages do not outweigh the disadvantages that might be entailed in terms of messed-up reporting, failure to quell the public debate, and certain problems of the    2/4-5/80  multiplier that the mix system brings about Those are all the comments I have, unless Mr Lindsey would wish to add something   We have in the past looked at those and several other gimmicks that have been advanced   We'll be glad to consider them further   We have studies of that also, President Baughman We will be glad to--   As far as Professor Friedman is concerned, I think it was the latter He was the chief proponent of it   We have often expected that when the System tightens, there will be an increase in managed liabilities that holds down demand deposits For example, there would be an increase in issuance of CDs and RPs and all that That didn't turn out to be true in the fourth quarter when there seemed to be a sharp reduction in bank credit demands But for unchanged credit demands, so to speak, I would expect that to be an element in the adjustment process It would be an aspect of the tightening--issuing [such] things and putting upward pressure on interest rates in so doing   Well, Governor Rice, Irv has a much more complicated mind, I think, than I do Also, the evidence with regard to bank response has been developed over a number of years when the System has been running a different kind of policy that is very accommodative to bank needs If at today's interest rates the bank needed reserves, the System supplied it So every banker worth his salt knew that he could rely on the federal funds market within plus or minus 1/4 percentage point to make his adjustments In that kind of environment, adjustments do tend to be made quite slowly That may be the best kind of environment; I am not questioning that But I think that's the basis for the empirical evidence Without lagged reserve accounting you introduce the possibility of controlling total reserves Now, you may or may not want to control them literally, but you introduce that possibility whereas with lagged reserve accounting that's much more difficult to do If you can control total reserves, offsetting borrowing as it occurs, then it follows that the banks are simply not going to be able to put out the deposits and that in consequence interest rates are going to move sharply up or sharply down as banks are forced to make those adjustments If the Committee wants to move toward the kind of world where it is more certain of controlling total reserves in the short run, or indeed in the long run, then I think abandonment of lagged reserve accounting would make it more practicable to do so Now, if bank adjustments take a long time, then it might require a lot more interest rate variation in the short run to overcome that kind of inertia However, I would feel reasonably confident that after some transition period the process of bank adjustments would be much shorter Of course, in that process banks would begin holding more excess reserves so we'd have that problem to worry about I know this is somewhat general, but that's how I would respond to the kinds of comments that Irv makes   Yes I am sure, even if we leave the window open and don't close it, total reserves leaves you the possibility of chasing it You may not ever catch it, but it leaves you the possibility of chasing it   Well, we can It depends how promptly the Board would want to take this up But Mr Lindsey has already done considerable work in that area, so we would be in a position to develop something   A memo on that very subject, on the effect of a move from 7 to 5 days, has been prepared for the Board We didn't want to send it forward right at this time because of the confusion with the memo prepared for this meeting, but we do have a staff recommendation on that   Mr Chairman, I would just like to add one footnote to this From my perspective, it is not merely theoretical desirability and practical difficulty but, as you commented, the artificiality of playing with these numbers That is driven home to me almost every week, so I feel some practical impact of that   We are very pleased that they have not put that in   Only because it's taking funds out of M2   We hadn't intended to but we can   We presented them in an appendix in the Bluebook, giving the comparable figures to alternative II That will be a decision for someone to [make] That does run the risk of adding to the confusion, I might add   No, it doesn't become impossible, Mr Chairman But I remember last year that the old M2 ran above the projection, and that is the aggregate the Committee has come closest to cutting down to just about the lowest that is economically sustainable I would just add that point I think we gave very low, or conservative, estimates for M2 So there is some danger in it   Well, in the old days, I would have said it would have ballooned Nowadays, with interest rates so far above ceiling rates, we don't have that effect We have put the money market funds into M2 and there is going to be a lot of substitutability between the money market funds and other elements of M2 The risk is for higher growth if interest rates decline, but I don't think it is nearly as great a risk as it used to be   Mr Chairman, if the Committee is willing to accept a range of 2-1/2 points, an almost perfect compromise is to take the bottoms of alternative II and the tops of alternative III   We rounded these to 1/2 points, by the way For M2 and M3 I think the [actual] differences are 1/4 points among the alternatives   Mr Chairman, is the staff to assume that in making its GNP projections, it should take the 4-1/2 percent rate of growth for M-1A as a center point? That is a lower rate of growth than we had  -68-    2/4-5/80   Mr Chairman, I don't know if this will be helpful, but one possibility--in the spirit of what has been discussed --is to take the 3-point ranges for M-1A and M-1B of alternative II and to lower the top ends of M2 and M3 by 1/2 point   Then you have more substitutability among the deposits?   I will skip the introductory part, a page and a half, which says that interest rates aren't projected to come down as much as they used to be because the economy is projected to be stronger [Secretary's note For the full text of Mr Axilrod's statement, see Appendix]   Yes   That's right   The [new] M2 is a totally different concept   That's right It was the old M2--   That's right And it is in fact running a little low relative to the target   I would guess it's a shade lower because the old M2 is running a shade lower It's either consistent or a shade lower I haven't worked it out in detail month by month on money market funds   Oh yes, that's right That's why It has money market funds--   Yes The actual growth in M2 is 83 percent because, among other reasons, we had this very sharp expansion in money market funds in January, which we've been expecting to slow  -74-    2/4-5/80   To be clear, Mr Chairman, alternative B, as we construe it, is simply reiterating the Committee's policy of last time with respect to M1   That's in new terms and takes account of the actual growth that occurred in January   Yes But, again, this is a totally different M2   But the old M2 is running a little lower relative to target than we had expected   Initially   I am a little hesitant because I haven't seen the last [figures] on the new basis On the old basis they were weak, but I haven't seen the new ones on the new weekly seasonal pattern yet The old figures were weak, but we had expected a considerable rebound   Do you want to add M-1B into the directive also?   In our view it's--   In that period it was 3/4 of a point   About 1/2 point more   The average borrowing for January was $12 billion, and that's what we were suggesting as the initial level I would add that, following that very sharp spurt in borrowing last week, partly because the Desk is aiming at [a lower level], borrowing has been running much lower this week; it's averaging about $892 million so far   We mentioned $12 billion in the Bluebook Previously, at the last meeting, $1 billion was discussed; but borrowing seemed to be running higher than that So it's a fuzzy question as to where precisely borrowing is going to want to end up But we suggested $12 billion    We'll be announcing--unless the numbers have changed in the last hour or  two, which is always possible--a $28 billion drop in M-1A from the level of [February] 2 0 th  So [the  level for February] 27th will be down to $3747 billion I might add that the prospective figure for  [March] 5th, which is highly tentative, suggests another drop of around $900 million The growth rate  for February will be about 11-1/2 percent at an annual rate We're projecting growth for March on the  order of zero   That's right For the period from December 1979 to March 1980, the  Committee's path for M2 was around 66 percent and M2 growth is running 83 percent--about 1-3/4  or almost 2 percentage points above it For M3 the Committee's path was 74 percent, and M3 growth  is running 95 percent using our projection for March--that is, a March projection with a lower growth  than in February So M3 is running 2 points above [the Committee's target] I might say that the  strength in M2 is essentially in money market funds They are stronger than we had estimated, with no  compensating weakness in other time and saving deposits, and that's the essential factor strengthening  the M2 figure    3/7/80   On the money supply?   I believe so I don't know whether there will be any market reaction or  response to [the figures being released] this afternoon but I think it has been clear for a couple of  weeks that February would be a high number And the market as a whole has adjusted to that, as has  the funds rate in fact   Yes, I just got the bank credit figures earlier, Mr Chairman For January  our estimate on the total is 128 percent, with business loans up 21 percent of which Belridge Oil  Company, as I remember, is around 4 percentage points For February our current estimate for bank  credit growth is around 18 percent, with business loans almost 24 percent and total loans around 19  percent   Yes If this number holds up for the 5th, it will start the month off at a  very low level So, to reach a growth rate as high as zero money would have to grow over the course  of March If money stayed at or just slightly above the estimated February 27th level or the March 5th    3/7/80  level, we'd have a negative growth rate But we've assumed a reasonable pace of growth over the  course of March, which produces an average level that would be around zero [on the growth rate]   I'm not quite sure I haven't figured out that one yet!   Oh yes   I ought to add, President Baughman, even with zero we're getting closer  to target We get a 51 percent December-to-March rate as against the 4-1-/2 percent target path for  M-1A It's the broader aggregates, if our projections are right, that seem stronger relative to path than  the narrow aggregate    Well, at any time Following the previous FOMC discussion, we looked up all our old work on the various proposals that the Presidents put forward And we'd be prepared to bring the issue of lagged reserve accounting plus some of those other issues before the Board at any time If the Board were going to consider it, I would suggest that it be done in such a way that if any change were made, it could go into effect when the new [law] goes into effect-- that is, six months from the time of [its enactment] So, in that time frame--within a couple of months or earlier--we would certainly be prepared to bring something to the Committee   Do you mean on the other measures in addition to the lagged reserve accounting that the Committee has already discussed or just--?   Well, lagged reserve accounting, staggered reserve settlements, and a few other things   Well, we could be   My only point was that if the Board and the Committee wanted to do away with lagged reserve accounting, the time to do away with it is when the whole new reserve system goes into effect, [when it is] applicable to other institutions   Well, I share much of what Mr Sternlight says If you want to estimate an interest rate that would produce these results--I was hoping this method would get away from that a little-- it seems to me that, if anything, it would be more like the federal funds rate In essence, if you look over a long enough time period, it doesn't matter very much what part of the total reserves is supplied by nonborrowed reserves and what part is borrowed What really matters for determining the money supply is the amount of reserves, the total base out there to support money in some multiplier sense And over a long enough period, it can't really matter whether that's through nonborrowed reserves or borrowed reserves In the very short run because of this mix, with required reserves fixed, it does matter because it affects the behavior of the funds rate given the discount rate But if we put in a high discount rate, then for any given total reserves we would have less borrowed reserves and more nonborrowed If our estimate of the discount rate is low, we'd have the reverse situation So, while we could do that, we would simply be changing the mix between nonborrowed and borrowed reserves for any given level of total reserves that would support the money supply I don't think that would be very helpful to you; we would be glad to do it, of course I think in February the alternatives before the Committee were making an adjustment in the funds rate fast by  -11-    3/18/80  raising the discount rate; making it more moderately by gradually lowering the nonborrowed path; or making it even more moderately by keeping the nonborrowed path and letting a gentle rise in borrowing take place instead of a rapid rise What was actually done was to have a small rise in the discount rate and a reduction in the nonborrowed path, which was somewhere in between all those alternatives   Well, our views are probably marginally different A difference is that I might allege that we could hit the total reserve path week to week I don't think it's very important to do it, but we could without lagged reserve accounting But we'd have to have very large movements in the federal funds rate because we'd have to force the banks, within the statement week, to adjust their deposits to the total reserves we'd put out there We'd have to force them to do it Without lagged reserve accounting that is possible With lagged reserve accounting, that could also occur If we allow enough pressure on the funds rate, they could make the adjustments in deposits but we just won't see it in total reserves until two weeks later So within a very short-run period it would look as if we were missing our total reserves; but actually we'd be getting adjustments in deposits that would be [evident] in required reserves two weeks later and we'd really not be off very badly We would just be over path for a while and then we'd be back on path That's the essence of what Mr Sternlight is saying and I wouldn't quarrel with that particular statement Indeed, the money supply is coming back on target now, or seemingly so, if March turns out as we are projecting it There has been a rapid response to the rise in the funds rate that has occurred, just as happened in October, which may be a coincidence or it may be that the lags [in response to changes in] the funds rate are not six months [but are closer to] one day It's hard to believe the latter but something like that has happened for two successive periods I am not sure whether I have answered the question, but I think I at least came close to it   Oh no, I think there would be quite a bit more, for one reason The one [internal] reason is that Mr Sternlight really won't be "able"--and I put the word in quotes because I don't mean that he's really managing the funds rate--to adapt his operations as readily because in the current week he won't know required reserves [Suppose] this week we're going to provide $100 in total reserves Given the fluctuations in deposits that occur from week to week, we really won't know whether the required reserves in the week  -12-    3/18/80  relative to the $100 in total reserves would be $20 or $90 If they turn out to be $20, Mr Sternlight is going to find that as he puts in nonborrowed reserves, there are going to be huge declines in borrowing and huge declines in the federal funds rate And he's not going to have any alternative but to chase those borrowings down and put in more nonborrowed Because of the volatility of deposits week to week, I think we'd be certain to get more fluctuations in the federal funds rate However, with the system we're now operating on, where he knows required reserves and we make adjustments on an average path for a four-week period, we make those adjustments so that we [take into account] the required reserve pattern that we know for certain over the two weeks ahead And we tend to make the borrowings the same in each of those weeks So we let nonborrowed reserves vary with the deposits while tending to hold the borrowing stable in an average path for a four-week period I know that sounds like gobbledygook, but it is what we do   I am not sure I get the gist of your question, Governor Wallich   The multiplier on demand deposits at the moment is roughly 6 So if we took put in $1 of reserves, we ought to get $6 more, roughly, in demand deposits But that is not certain; if we put in reserves, they may end up in currency or anywhere else for that matter But that's the multiplier on demand deposits; it's a lot higher on time deposits   Contemporaneous reserve accounting, as nearly as I can tell, does only two things for you First, it absolutely can remove interest rates in some sense from your consideration If you believed that there was a multiplier that the staff could predict, you could set total reserves; you'd have to chase borrowing up and down but you could come closer to hitting that total reserve target in a given week Lord knows what interest rates you'd have, but you might have the money supply So the interest rates would be forced to adjust to the reserves We wouldn't be doing what we do now, which in some sense is to make adjustments in nonborrowed reserves to deliberately force more interest rate pressure on the system The system would evolve its own interest rate pressure either up or down as we put in the total reserves So contemporaneous would do that for you; it would remove some little element of prediction we still have as to what interest rates we want to see in order to achieve the money supply [objectives] That element is left in lagged reserve accounting The other thing it does, of course, is to speed up the  -13-    3/18/80  response by 2 weeks The latter isn't all that important presumably because 2 weeks out of 52 weeks is not any big deal   What it really does, in my mind, is to remove the necessity of making judgments about where you want interest rates to be But that's a judgment the Committee may not want to remove   If you had taken a further upward discount rate action from 13 percent, say, to 15 percent, I would have predicted a faster adjustment of the money supply only if that rise in the discount rate also meant that you were going to permit the federal funds rate to rise substantially If you weren't going to permit the federal funds rate to rise substantially, I would assume that that upward adjustment in the discount rate would merely have meant that total reserves would be the same over time but with less borrowing and more nonborrowed But if you had permitted the funds rate to rise, I would assume banks would have tightened loan terms and maybe sold off some assets, resulting in lower bank credit, lower money growth, less required reserves and, therefore, less total reserves down the line several weeks later   Well, I have seen first drafts and, in some cases second drafts, of a sizable number of papers Of course, the Board's decisions have in a sense "prejudiced" some of the conclusions [Secretary's note These decisions involving special reserve and other measures were made in conjunction with the President's anti-inflation program announced on March 14, 1980] We were proceeding with our study and the analysis on a schedule that got interrupted because of other work We were trying to get some materials before the Committee at this meeting Whether we can do so at the next meeting or if it will be after that I am not certain, in view of what is going on But we are on course We weren't including emergency borrowing in that study because that is taken care of in other ways This was really a study of how the discount window might best interact with the present reserve [supplying] methods   [Statement--see Appendix]   My memory is that we have ended up with a somewhat better relationship I had better not answer; my memory is a little off on that   It may turn out that we seriously underestimated the growth that would occur in money market funds over the first two months of the year So there was a much bigger expansion in M2 than the Committee, in effect, wanted at that time We have assumed that growth in money market funds would drop from here on to a rate just slightly above what it was late last year However, that was without taking into account the latest 15 percent marginal reserve requirement on those funds Taking that into account, we would think that their growth would continue but at a much slower  -17-    3/18/80  rate Using a rule of thumb that Governor Partee introduced to the staff many years ago--and it's been difficult to find a [better] one-- I would say that something like 50 percent of that money would go into M2 type deposits and another 50 percent would go into large CDs and Treasury bills that are not in M2 but are either in M3 or liquid assets I don't think that's too bad a view because roughly 50 percent of the liabilities of funds are due to institutions and another 50 percent to individuals So I would expect that, if anything, the 7 percent M2 figure you are referring to may be a shade stronger than might develop in light of the program But I wouldn't expect the difference to be large That's as far as we've been able to go [in our analysis]   That's right Those rates are on--   That's correct   Slightly, that's right That would be 5 percent, just given the way the quarterly averages work out relative to these monthly patterns   That assumes a very strong April, so we get the money in early in the [quarter] If it didn't work out that way, it would be a little lower, I would think   I mean it is strong relative to the other months But if [that pattern were] reversed, it would lower the quarterly average growth   I think the direction is the same; it's the magnitudes that are different   We did not put in any specific estimate for tax refunds because we haven't observed them having an effect yet in late February or early March when they began If we put one in, we would add only a couple of percentage points, roughly   I was hoping not to I consider this as reasonable an estimate as a group of human beings working together might come to I didn't give you the specifics, but it assumes roughly a $1 billion increase in M1 in the week of the 19th, which is the week we're in, another $2-1/2 billion in the week of the 26th, and then very little increase thereafter But that gives us a high April figure because from February to the end of March M1 will have increased 12 percent, roughly, and that gets into the April figure I wouldn't doubt, given our GNP projections, that we're going to have a second-quarter rate of growth close to what we've estimated here on average, something like 4-3/4 percent Whether it's going to come with a large April or a large May or a large June, or whether it will be an even distribution among those months, I really can't be very certain It would be misleading to say that I feel extremely certain about this; I don't But I don't think it's unreasonable It would be what a reasonable set of people would come to at this point   Well, there will be checks received by consumers The uncertainty is what people will do with them Will they deposit them directly in their savings and time accounts--in which case it will go into M2--or will they put them in their demand accounts? And if they put them in demand accounts, will they hold them for one or two days? In that case it will have some effect on M1 but a very small one That is the reasoning [underlying our estimate] If people put the funds into demand accounts, we wouldn't expect them to stay there long Why would people want to hold more demand deposits? So, they would either transfer the funds to another asset, such as a money market fund or a T-bill or something, or start spending them In that case, any little upward effect would begin coming down in May and June and July The only evidence we've really had was on the tax rebate program where checks were sent out to people as a tax rebate; those very clearly had a discernable money supply effect On these kinds of refunds, we don't have the experience that would enable us to be very certain about [the effect] So, we are waiting for something to happen; we haven't seen it yet and we may not see it this whole--   Well, as we said last time and this time also, we think the effect in the three months of March, April, and May might be on the order of 1 to 3 percentage points [unintelligible] and then unwinding to that extent in June and July and piddling out in August That's our estimate of what might happen But we haven't deliberately put that in   Yes, but the refunds this year are estimated to be about $12 billion above the average of the last two or three years So it's more than normal   I don't remember the exact number I don't know whether Darwin [Beck] has it Well, this year we're estimating the individual tax refunds to be somewhere on the order of $48 billion In 1979, total refunds were $36 billion Reading back, in recent years they were, in billions of dollars, 36, 34, 31, and 29 So you can see that it's a quantum jump this year on the order of $12 billion In March of the previous four years the refunds were around $9-1/2 to $10 billion; this year they will be around $137 billion, according to these estimates So it's a jump of $4 billion in March and roughly $3 to $4 billion in April   Well, there is some funds rate that would do it But I would quickly mention that there is no certainty that [the projected] bulge is going to appear We took 5 percentage points out of the seasonal factor this year relative to last year; and cumulatively that seasonal factor has been adjusted over the past two or three years to take 15 percentage points at an annual rate out of April growth So, it's not absolutely certain that the bulge is going to appear   Exactly I just want to be covered both ways   We have suggested a borrowing assumption of $2-1/2 billion on "B" and about $2-3/4 billion under "C"   The higher number would be more consistent with the behavior of borrowing in the last two weeks We're having a hard time interpreting whether demand or technical problems--   Around $34 billion And they're averaging $31 billion thus far this week and were $19 billion yesterday   I don't know But I actually went back to [estimate what that breakdown would have been in] the fourth quarter of '79 And if actual borrowing [and its distribution] hadn't changed because of the surcharge--it would have, but if it hadn't--it turns out that of the average daily borrowing of $18 billion in that quarter, $12 billion would have been at the surcharge So, about 2/3 of it would have been at the surcharge rate But what it actually will be over the next four weeks, I really have no idea It has been a little higher than I would have suspected If these banks try to avoid [paying the high rate] by not borrowing and we put in a target of $2-1/2 or $2-3/4 billion, that ought to put upward pressure on the funds rate   I was assuming, Mr Chairman, that one of the implications was that the Committee didn't want to be as accommodative in April as we had in [the Bluebook] and that for whatever path the Committee decides we might lower both March and April and shift a little of that into May and June   I think in October or sometime the language-- not the number--was something like "4-1/2 percent or a little less"   Mr Chairman, just to be clear At the moment we're projecting 46 percent [as the average M-1A growth for March and April], and we'd target on that if nothing else were said In light  -42-    3/18/80  of this discussion, I would propose that we tend to even it out [over the four-month period ahead] That is, we'd target on something like 3 percent or a little higher in March-April which would mean May-June would be around 3 percent or thereabouts; the two periods would be roughly even March would be low and April high, but pressed down relative to what we show now, depending on what the data we get tomorrow look like   Oh, no; I was talking about what we'd target on, not what we'd achieve   Yes We would be targeting on [a smaller] bulge If it started coming in even as high as we have projected, we'd begin resisting   I just want to be sure what that means, Mr Chairman The average March-April rate of growth between "B" and "C" is about 4-1/2 percent I was not going to build a path on that but on a lower rate of growth and then shift some of it into the May-June period   It's about 4-1/2 percent--between "B" and "C"-- for March-April Now, we only know 5 days in March for sure, so March in some sense is an unknown What I think is consistent with the Committee's discussion--I want to be sure of this--is that rather than the 4-1/2 percent for March-April and about 1 percent for May-June [implied in the Bluebook], I should shift some of that growth into May-June So you would be resisting at a lower rate of growth in March-April  -44-    3/18/80   I understand I just want to be sure that what we're planning to do is clear to the Committee   Well, I think we'd have to wait until we look at the numbers and Mr Sternlight and I have a chance to chew it over But one thought would be simply to make March-April 3 percent and May- June 3 percent in round terms and even it out We generally tend to use an even [pattern] if we can It doesn't seem likely that growth in March and April will be even, but maybe for the two months it wouldn't be unreasonable to target it that way Then if March turned negative at minus 1 percent, say, April could be plus 7 percent That would be an example Or if March turned out to be plus 2 percent, then the April [path] would drop down to a plus 4 percent rate or something like that It may not be that even; it will depend on what it looks like   We don't think it's possible in the first half Given the strength we already have, it would take an enormous reduction   You could easily look to a marked slowing over the next two months from the recent [rate]  -47-    3/18/80    Well, the growth rate [of Ml] in April of 1976 was 66 percent; in 1977, 92 percent; in 1978, 126 percent; and in 1979, 147 percent My memory is that there is genuine weakness in the unadjusted deposits If one compared year over year and applied the seasonal factor of 1976--that is abstracting from all the adjustments we've made--the increase would be something like the 66 percent recorded in 1976 I assume there is some possibility that we've over-adjusted because in the process there is a certain amount of coincidence of random factors It's a conflict of terms, but something like that may have happened And we may see [some rebound] in May and June I'll have some comments on that in my own briefing But other than that, we have no special explanation; there are no special factors that we could think of, unless income really is being destroyed at a very rapid rate here But we don't have any substantial evidence of that yet   Yes, [M1 growth in] April 1975 was -3 percent In fact, one has to go back to 1970, 1971, and 1972 to have high Aprils again They were between 7 and 8 percent in those three successive years   I might say, Governor Partee, that the -3 percent of April 1975 was followed by a May of 13 percent and a June of 16 percent   The delay does have an effect Our estimate is slightly higher than yours through the week of the 16th We have some slightly counterbalancing upward effect in the week of the 23rd; we assume it will be washed out by the 30th and probably have a trivial effect on the month on average But we are assuming that M1 for the week of the 23rd, the week we're in, rises by something like $3-1/2 billion from the week of the 16th, in part because of this delay Of course, if that doesn't develop, the negative for April will be much bigger   Well, they can pay off debts out of almost any asset They may be paying them off out of cash or they may be letting other assets run down I just have no way of knowing until we get the quarterly flow of funds   Yes, so far I'll have some of that in my own briefing But that's right; thus far we don't have evidence of money moving into higher order Ms We don't have data yet for Treasury bills or complete data on debt   In the money supply?   No, we don't have anything more than we normally have as the weeks go by   [Statement--see Appendix]   We actually have projected a rather sharp drop in borrowing in the second quarter, largely because we assume a very substantial liquidation of liquid assets built up by corporations   That's right So the sharp drop levels off, but with borrowings at a lower level And, of course, we have some weakening in the consumer demand area So, we don't have any substantial build-up in borrowing demand ahead of us Over the long run, of course, we could probably foresee some business desire to restructure balance sheets, but that's a shifting of the borrowing patterns We simply don't see any bulge, really, in credit demands   That's right There is pressure; they're not generating internal funds to any substantial degree It's true that we have them running down their liquid assets There is some built-in pressure generated against expanding their spending to a great degree We don't have a vast expansion in spending; and to the degree that pressure is on them, it might constrain their spending actually at current rates   In answer to the first question, President Roos, I was trying to bring before the Committee the various concerns that the market would see and also the economic analysis I was not expressing my own judgment, particularly, on one or the other aspects of this The only thing I can say is that, empirically, in recent periods when interest rates have gone down, we have had a great hue and cry in the market that may or may not have been rational It has probably had effects on the thinking of those who spend and those who invest; and it has brought forth the view that perhaps inflation isn't going to be conquered That just seems to be a market event and I wanted to bring it before the Committee On your second question, since it was addressed to the Chairman--   For December to June the Committee last time voted on 4-1/2 percent or somewhat less   Yes, that included [an allowance of] about $500 million, when we were [calculating] that--   I might add, Mr Chairman, that we set that $1-3/4 billion [borrowing level of alternative B] before the banks this week suddenly decided to borrow more So I would go on to say that there's a lot of uncertainty in this borrowing/funds rate/ discount rate relationship here But our best judgment at the time we set this was that $1-3/4 billion of borrowing would be roughly consistent with this whole pattern   In the first three weeks of April, ex the special borrowing, it has been running around $18 to $2 billion It was about $18 billion in the week of the 16th This week, though, it has moved up to around $2 billion That, of course, is with the funds rate running 18-1/2 to 19-1/2 percent So our thought was that with the funds rate running in the 16 to 17 percent range, the borrowing level would drop from what it has been running   Yes I should be clear, Mr Chairman, that the borrowing level in alternative B was on the assumption that rates would come down And the borrowing level in alternative C--   Yes, the funds rate Alternative C was more like the borrowing that we had [earlier] And even that was shaded a little lower because we thought the funds rate would be more like 18 percent, which is a shade below what it had been So we did put in something that carries with it an easing in the funds rate    4/22/80   I'd say it means 15 to 17 percent   I interpret that, Mr Chairman, for constructing the path--it's only four weeks here--as putting in $1-1/2 billion for the first two weeks and $1-1/4 billion for the last two weeks What would actually develop--   I think that would happen if the data we get tomorrow or next week--   Two weeks from now   Operationally, I think there are two things, President Eastburn If we construct the path on 4-1/2 percent, which is the exact point, then the "or less" would mean to me that if total reserves were falling short a little, we would not make a big upward adjustment in nonborrowed reserves to offset that That would be the immediate operational [effect] We'd just let the normal drop in borrowings occur and work its way through The other thing that could be done, but which the Committee hasn't followed, of course, would be to set the initial path not at 4-1/2 percent but 4-1/4 percent But assuming the path is set at 4-1/2 percent, it would mean to me that when total reserves are falling somewhat short we wouldn't rush in to raise nonborrowed reserves to offset that   Yes, but with some limits to it   Yes, I believe--we'll talk to Mike [Keran]-- it's May 2 We, Mr Lindsey, Mr Simpson, and myself, will be meeting with the various Bank economists to discuss it in detail   That is right We think we've covered the issues that the Committee members have raised One is mildly irrelevant, as we're told it's illegal  SPEAKER(?) Totally irrelevant?   Unless the Committee members would like to suggest other options, we hope to have this discussion with Mr Keran's group and then be prepared to have a more pointed memorandum, with this as background, for the Committee at a later point   But [we will present it at] a joint Board and President's meeting We weren't assuming this to be part of an FOMC meeting since it's a matter to be decided ultimately by [the Board]   Oh, yes; that's our idea   Yes   There are no recommendations in this document except implicitly   I don't think we're going to be any worse off than we are now    Mr Chairman, following the Committee meeting we had a very sharp drop in the money supply numbers that were coming in The data we published for M-1A for the week ending [April] 16th turned out to be $14 billion lower than the preliminary estimate we had at the time of the Committee meeting Also for M-1A the number that came in for the 23rd turned out to be $57 billion lower than we had been projecting for that week; [our estimate reflected the number needed] in order to have a decrease in the money supply for April of only 4 percent Given the data we have in hand through the 23rd--with the 23rd being a preliminary estimate and assuming some increase but a modest increase for the 30th--our estimate for M-1A growth in April is now minus 12 percent Our estimate for M-1B growth for April is minus 9 percent and our estimate for M2 is plus 02 percent  This weakness in both demand deposits and currency has weakened required reserves and therefore [reduced] the amount of total reserves that we would expect in this four-week intermeeting period Given these required reserve figures for the first two weeks of the four-week period and our projection for the last half of the four-week period, our total reserves appear to be running about $400 million below path, largely reflecting this decrease in required reserves And of course, in providing the nonborrowed reserves, we would be expecting borrowing to be dropping substantially Our estimate is that instead of the $1-1/2 billion of borrowing ex First Pennsylvania that had been indicated at the time of the Committee meeting for the weeks of April 30th and May 7th, we'd be looking at borrowing of something like $910 million and declining to something like $660 million in the next two weeks  Of course this week, the week ending April 30th, borrowing thus far is running higher than that $900 million--somewhere on the order of $15 billion ex First Pennsylvania, as banks did borrow substantially earlier in the week Given these reserve paths and the projected levels of implied borrowing, it would seem that the feder funds rate would begin dropping below the 15 to 16 percent notional range mentioned at the Committee meeting Most recently, yesterday and thus far today, it has been in the 14 to 15 percent area   I have our projections, Dave They would suggest a growth rate in May of 4-1/2 percent, followed by a growth rate in June of 93 percent That projection assumes interest rates roughly at current levels   Yes They assume really a very modest recovery in the course of May from what we presume will be a slightly higher level in the week of April 30th If we have a very substantial recovery over the course of May, we could have a rather large [rate of increase] in May I understand from Peter that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has a much [higher] projection for May than we now have   This path, Mr Chairman, has $900 million of borrowing followed by $660 million; that is just what falls out of holding to the nonborrowed [objective] that was set at the time of the Committee meeting I should hastily add that it makes no adjustment for an initial look [suggesting] that for multiplier reasons we ought to add around $250 million [in reserves] We did not do that the first week because we have found [in the past] that [the reserve injection] might have to be reversed So ordinarily [in such cases] we've let that go for a couple of weeks But should that persist, borrowing would go down another couple hundred million because of the addition And that makes no allowance for the fact that total reserves are running below path; in the past we have often raised nonborrowed reserves simply for that reason So what I'm saying is that at the moment, unless there's a big change in deposits, that [$900 million] is kind of the maximum level of borrowings that jumps out of the path Next week, unless the deposits change, the path could call for a lower level of borrowing   No, we're mopping up the excess reserves What is technically happening is that with required reserves dropping, we're kind of releasing reserves to excess and they are being mopped up That is what literally is happening If we supplied all these total reserves, which we couldn't, we would have a massive amount of    4/29/80  excess reserves So we're in effect mopping up the excess reserves that were released by the decline in required reserves   Well, borrowings ought to drop off to almost nothing today and tomorrow Our estimate is that they might drop off to $600 or $700 million If we literally followed the nonborrowed path, they would drop off to very close to zero to achieve this $900 million [average] But banks did borrow quite a lot early in the week--more than we think is needed given the required reserves and the amount we were planning to provide by nonborrowed reserves So at the end of this week, the funds rate would drop and the level of borrowing would drop   Well, do you mean the $900 million we're planning on or--   In terms of the actual of $23 billion, you have to take out the $700 million that is First Pennsy So that puts it down to $15 or $16 billion Whether that is consistent or inconsistent with the money supply would depend in part on banks' response to that level of borrowing We believe that it is high [in relation to] this money supply, but we have been wrong before on banks' attitudes toward borrowing And it may be that they're quite happy and are willing to borrow and are going to go on and expand despite that Our judgment is that the level of borrowing would have to be lower to promote a very rapid rise in the money supply   Yes That is simply because of the weakness in required reserves relative to what we had planned at the time of the Committee meeting It makes no allowance for multipler changes or any effort to compensate for the reduction in total reserves relative to the path   Mr Chairman, with that level of borrowing, the 13 percent discount rate I believe is a very effective floor for the funds rate And so with the--   That's right   You're talking about something like $400 or $500 million borrowing above minimal levels So we would expect some spread of the funds rate above the discount rate--[a funds rate] in the 13-1/2 to 14-1/2 percent area   Yes, without allowing any resistance    Mr Chairman, [as the Committee knows], of course, we have had continued very weak money supply data since the last get-together And total reserves for the four-week intermeting period, estimated from what we can tell about the amount of required reserves and the excess reserves that would be held at roughly current interest rate levels, seem to be running about $800 million below the target path And that's with borrowing coming down very close to nominal levels In the current week, borrowing ex First Pennsylvania is now down to about $500 million Our projection and expectation is that in the next two weeks it will run around $250 million ex First Pennsylvania Thus, if any more reserves were put in to try to attain the total reserve path, they would have to go into excess reserves, which would cause a very sharp drop in the funds rate from the recent level The funds rate has been moving down toward the 13 percent bottom limit of the Committee's range and yesterday was below it Thus, effectively now, the funds rate is a constraint on the adjustments we would make to the total reserve path We won't have any additional data on the aggregates until tomorrow, but I would not expect them to change substantially enough to indicate that the funds rate would not remain a constraint in adjustments to the reserve path   Peter may wish to speak to where the funds rate is this morning Yesterday it averaged 12-1/4 percent I think it's around there this morning    Governor Teeters, it wasn't only the foreign central banks that were supporting their own currencies We were intervening substantially to find the marks to cover the Treasury's intermediate-term debts We may not even have done enough in that regard So we, too, were trying to take advantage of the improving dollar availability to pick up the marks that would cover the Treasury's debts We did it in substantial size   [Statement--see Appendix]   I have a judgment; perhaps Jim also has one I would say that it probably did have some effect on bankers' attitudes, or at least it seems so from the data But perhaps even more importantly, it seems to have had some effect on consumers' attitudes Spending has been very weak and I think that weakness is associated with a reluctance to use credit There have been reports all over the papers and it [is evident] even in one's personal experience that people have some reluctance to use credit Going along with that there has been some shift, apparently, to using cash and a shift to paying off debt and reducing spending Whether the end of these programs would change those attitudes is an open question, of course, because once a person finally decides something is right, for whatever reason, I simply don't know whether the ending of a program is going to change his mind substantially That's particularly so if we're in the middle of a recession when the program ends and people have some doubts about future income prospects But those are subjective judgments and we have precious little evidence other than to note that the sharp declines in bank credit and consumer debt are very coincidentally related to the imposition of the program That suggests a change in attitudes, and I think it's the attitudes of both the lenders and the borrowers   I should add, Mr Chairman, that our long-run forecast, of course, is for interest rates not to be lower but actually to edge up   I would interpret that operationally, Mr Chairman, as meaning that if it so happens that required reserves in the first two or three weeks of this forthcoming period come in significantly higher than these paths call for, that we should adjust the nonborrowed path up, given that [earlier] shortfall, in order to avert a rise in the funds rate immediately   Of essentially 4 percent for May and 10 percent for June--an average of 7 percent   Well, if I understood the Chairman correctly-- and taking a number for purposes of an example--if the Committee said to focus on May-June at something like a 7 percent growth for M-1A but tolerate higher growth in view of the [April] shortfall, we would set a total reserve path consistent with that 7 percent and a nonborrowed path roughly equal to the total reserve path because borrowings are at minimal levels If in the very short run deposits turned out to be stronger, we would raise the path because the Committee said it is willing to tolerate stronger deposit growth We wouldn't try to keep to this original path set on 7 percent if higher growth, within the Committee's own tolerance ranges, suddenly began to develop So, we would raise the reserve path in order to [accommodate] that On the other hand, if the aggregates turned out to be significantly weaker, we would not lower the reserve path We'd still shoot at the nonborrowed and total reserve paths but that might then call the bottom of the funds rate range into question fairly promptly, which would require Committee [consultation]   Well, clearly, we would have had to call a consultation on Thursday or Friday if a meeting weren't scheduled for today We had a consultation the week before and that range then became a limiting factor   Mr Chairman, I don't know if this would be helpful to Governor Teeters, but perhaps she's worrying that if the bottom of the range were stipulated at 9 percent rather than 8 percent it might be an inhibiting factor in the speed with which we approach the bottom of the range I don't think it would affect operations That is, we wouldn't try to hold the rate at 9-1/2 percent because the bottom of the range was 9 as compared with 8 percent We'd go ahead and provide reserves until we hit the bottom and we'd have a consultation It wouldn't inhibit the process of getting there   I think if the Committee indicates as it passes through that zone that it doesn't see a need to change the fundamental range, Mr Altmann might not view it as a vote that needs to be reported   Yes, [when the funds rate was] at 16 percent the Committee met and, though it met, it decided [to retain the range in] the directive   The alternative was to put down 7 percent, say, if that's what you voted for It would be stated in the Policy Record very clearly that 7 percent was the target but that you would permit some overshoot Our thought behind not putting specifically in the directive a number for growth over a two- or three-month period was that it would be better understood in the Policy Record where it would be surrounded by the analysis of the shortfall and all that So we tried to phrase the directive to reflect what we thought the Committee might be trying to do in general, which was to [foster an increase] back into its range, and leave the specificity to the Policy Record    5/20/80  We could put the specifics back in there, and they'd appear at the same time [as the directive was released as part of the Policy Record]   Yes, that's the other thing that bothered me a little because [that would cover] only two months and that seemed like a very short period to focus on particular aggregates It gives a sense of short-run control over the aggregates   Well, to seek growth over the next two months at a rate high enough to promote achievement of the Committee's long- run objectives implies the whole year Or you could go to a nine- month [figure] We were trying to avoid deciding at this point whether you were getting back in the range by September or December   Yes, that's what we had in mind   Those point estimates would appear in the Policy Record?   Well, 7-1/2 to 8 percent [for M-1B] would be consistent with 7 to 7-1/2 percent for M-1A And for M2 I would say 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 percent would be consistent   Around 8 percent    Well, Mr Chairman, the latest deposit numbers we have that we'll be publishing tomorrow--and of course these can revise even in the next 24 hours--indicate a drop in M1 for the week of May 28th Whereas on the basis of preliminary numbers we had been expecting an increase of $12 billion, the drop in M1 in the week of the 28th could be on the order of $600 million And the early data we have for June suggest that M1 is at a lower level than we had been expecting when we built the path Thus we have a situation where at the moment our best estimate for M-1A growth in May is around 3 percent and for M-1B growth it's closer to 1 percent M2 is still holding up rather strongly because of the great strength in money market funds and we have its growth in May at 8-1/2 percent Our estimates for June are all for more rapid growth rates based on our continued expecations of a rebound But the two months together would be at a slower growth rate than the minimum growth that the Committee was contemplating at the last Committee meeting  That means in effect, without going into the details of the path, that in the current week and in the next week--taking those weeks as the remaining part of an initial four-week period--borrowing would probably drop to zero While it should need to be around zero, that is virtually unattainable because someone is bound to borrow from us And in adhering to the original nonborrowed path, excess reserves would probably move up above the $250 million minimum to between $250 and $275 million So under those conditions we would be confronted probably with a drop in the funds rate from recent trading levels The only other point I might add, Mr Chairman, is that the rough estimates we have for May for bank credit show continued substantial weakness in that measure, with probably a further negative in total loans and investments So in those categories, total loans and business loans, the outstanding amounts also would be dropping   I don't have up-to-date figures with me, but it has been rising And of course corporate bond issues have been extremely strong So it [accounts for] a large part, but I don't think all, of the weakness in the business loan component of bank credit   Well, a large part, but not all of the weakness in business loans probably represents refunding of short-term debt into long-term debt and also continued use of the paper market where the rates are considerably lower than the prime rate But I would say an additional part of it represents the underlying weakness in the economy, the weakness in credit demands And that's particularly evident in the real estate area and probably the consumer area as well as the business area   Desperately!   Yes I don't have the precise number, but with the June estimates for M2 the December-to-June growth rate would be above 6-3/4 percent, probably on the order of 7 percent   It's coming up into the target [range] On M3 we would have a December-to-June growth rate, if our projections are right, on the order of probably between 7 and 7-1/2 percent   Yes, though not so much for M3 Well, it is 93 percent against our current estimate for May of 87 percent   For M2 we had an 11-1/2 percent estimate for June, tracking the very high estimates for M-1A and M-1B also   Mr Chairman, I think both Mr Sternlight and I have the feeling that if an effort is made to provide the reserves to hit this literal nonborrowed reserve number, the funds rate will drop rather soon    Well, no The figures actually got changed at the last minute, so the marginally above was correct when it was written It's wrong with regard to M-1A and M-1B; and M2, of course, is well above It should read that with regard to M-1A and M-1B we were marginally above; the figures were changed at the last minute and the text was not I think that's the answer   No, the path is above because of M2   Yes, the footnote numbers seem incorrect I'll get those numbers The $43,377 million is not the original target but the one we now have; $43,293 million was the original target Those are simply transposed   You are quite right; those figures are transposed   Yes Whatever shifts occur would be subtracted from that So if the shift were one point, the number would be 3-1/2 percent; and if it were 2 points, it would be 2-1/2 percent, etc   These are shifts that could be related to the introduction of nationwide NOW accounts beginning around the end of this year So the 4-1/2 percent subsumes whatever is going on now This is the new introduction--   Well, given what is going on this year, we think that 4-1/2 percent is more reflective of unchanged policy than 4-3/4 percent because there seems to be a little more movement out of demand deposits into NOW accounts   Yes It's a small amount We raised M-1B a bit  MESSRS KICHLINE and ZEISEL [Statements continued]  -12-    7/9/80   From reading the model--which is all this is talking about--in the year 1979 there was virtually no shift There was a little downward shift, but I wouldn't take the model that seriously on that For the year ending in the second quarter of 1980 there was a shift of about 3 percentage points, all of which occurred in the second quarter   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we did We assumed that an unchanged policy from what was adopted in February meant that M-1A growth could be about 1/4 point below the midpoint of the range and M-1B growth about 1/2 point above the midpoint  -28-    7/9/80   We didn't change the ranges, but we spelled that out as an assumption   That's right That's why I particularly stressed M-1A and possibly M-1B; but M-1A is a more logical candidate   That's right   That's right We expect that by the time the year is out, M2 will have grown [at a rate] somewhat above the midpoint   I do have one The July rate of growth for M3, at 58 percent, is weaker than that for M2 and M1 because we still have very weak bank credit demands and consequent reductions in large CDs   Yes, well below the range   Yes, our forecast for bank credit is literally 4-1/2 percent   Yes, December to December it's around 5 percent   Yes, that's consistent with the 4-1/2 percent [forecast for M-1A], etc   I don't have that rate of growth in mind, but I don't think it would be that low   I'd have to calculate it   Oh, sure We were giving some consideration to elevating M2 in emphasis in our targeting procedures this time In the end that seemed [unlikely to] solve the Committee's problem and it involved a little more difficulty in terms of the continuity of the presentation As you say, next year there's an obvious case for it But, again, I would stress that money market funds are in M2 and RPs are in M2, and we don't have a lot of experience with how those components are going to behave   I would suggest that your waffle, Mr Chairman, is probably one that would fit better in the policy record And the Committee could be silent in the directive  -55-    7/9/80   Mr Chairman, with regard to President Solomon's point on--   Tony, the law says the Committee has to say something about it   No, not in the directive, but in the report  [Lunch recess]  [Secretary's note Typically, after lunch the Chairman would have called the meeting to order and made some opening comments No such remarks by the Chairman were captured on the tape and included in the raw transcript]   We've been waffling   Well, to 4-1/2 percent   Under "C" [growth for the year] would be 3-1/2 percent   No, by year-end--   By year-end "C" gets M-1A to the bottom of the range, 3-1/2 percent Continuation of that 6 percent [growth rate results in] 3-1/2 percent growth for the year   That's right, and [money supply growth] has even weakened a bit more since I had a first report earlier today It's in such a state of flux I hesitate to mention it at all   We need a number to construct a path  -61-    7/9/80   Yes, that's right   That's right   Well, Mr Chairman, as I understand the thrust of this, if the Committee opts for 7 percent and we wake up tomorrow and it looks as if our best projection is 8 percent, we'll set a path that will achieve 8 percent but the funds market can behave pretty much as it has been behaving If [our projection] goes up to 9 percent, [the funds market] may still be behaving that way but we'll  -65-    7/9/80  be getting to the point where we'll have to consult with you to see if we're getting outside the bounds   The problem that might come to the Committee more immediately is weakness because that would get reflected rather more quickly in a drop in the funds rate, and we won't know where it will stop   That's right So the constraint could become operational if there's any weakness right away, and we'd have to come back to the Committee [almost immediately]   We've done research on that and they all are difficult! [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, the [tenor] of this discussion means that when M2 is running a lot stronger than the targets--let's say it's running 12 percent and the target is 8 percent and it's all [caused by] money market funds--and everything else is running stronger, the staff has not in such a situation in the past cut back on reserves because the multiplier in M2 was off If we did, as Governor Teeters said, interest rates would go up faster And as a consequence of that, money market funds would go up faster and--   Well, either way But, for example, in the last [intermeeting] interval we could have been cutting back on reserves because the money market funds were growing very rapidly [Had we done so] interest rates would be higher and the MMFs would be growing even more rapidly   Well, at the time we wrote the Bluebook if we had had to say something--it would have been fine-tuning of a silly nature--we would have raised the lower limit from 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent or something like that Given the data I now have on the aggregates, I wouldn't have The data are in a state of flux; that's why it's better to have this meeting on a Tuesday   I have around 15 lines of language, which I--   Both! It might be worth my reading it to you to see if it's even worth typing up and distributing  SPEAKER(?) Humility   I was a little afraid that would argue strongly against lowering [the ranges] It makes it very clear   Mr Chairman, that is not, I insist, what the Bluebook says   Well I don't think that's what the numbers say either We'd say it even more obviously if we had put '83 in there    7/9/80  But we tried to compare a tax cut strategy with a no tax cut strategy and to look at that--    Well, the dating might change your results It is true that recently other short-term rates have risen more than the funds rate But I don't think that is terribly unusual After all, you are talking about 3- and 6-month rates as against a 1-day rate There are times when people begin to expect a rise in rates, and the 3-month or the 6-month rate will move a little more than the funds rate under those conditions In August we had a big resurgence in bank credit demand and large CD issues, which pulled up the CD rate in particular I don't think that is extremely unusual, although those rates have moved up closer to the funds rate than had been the experience over the past two or three years   Governor Wallich, as you know, with lagged reserve accounting there is simply nothing we can do in the current week other than determine the level of free reserves in the banking system with open market operations, given required reserves And to the degree that there is a relationship--and it's pretty loose these days--between free reserves and interest rates, we are in some sense in the short run determining the funds rate But in the longer run, of course, it's the market movement in the money supply relative to our target that will determine the funds rate   I was trying to say that, inevitably, doing that in one week would have an effect on the funds rate relative to not doing it in that week because required reserves are fixed But over the longer run--though I don't know what the funds rate would be because of the looseness in the relationship between free reserves and the funds rate--it does not That little [effect] passes away   Well, as Peter mentioned, this was done in the fourth week of a 5-week period So one could ask Should it have been done in the third week or the second week? It was delayed until the fourth week because there was some hope that what was in train in the first and second weeks, in terms of tightening, would show some evidence of bringing down required reserves Then, by the fourth week we were still running well above our total reserve path, so by that time it seemed only reasonable, in view of past experience and past operations with this technique, to make an adjustment of roughly half As Peter mentioned, if that adjustment hadn't been made at that time-- and I would say maybe we should have done it earlier--then we would have had a very sharp drop in borrowing and maybe some drop in the funds rate in the short run, but I'm not sure We had a large bulge in borrowing earlier without a lot of rise in the funds rate   Mr Chairman, if I may just take one minute of the Committee's time It's a little difficult to think of what is going on with the money supply in a vacuum, independent of what is going on in the rest of the economy In the spring we had rather strange events We had the introduction of a credit control program, which was rather unique in our history; we had interest rates going to levels that were unique in our history; and we had responses in the rest of the economy that were rather unique Among those responses were that people chose to get out of debt rapidly and to get along with less cash by a huge amount And the mechanism that the Committee  -11-    9/16/80  put in place, as I would see it, was flexible enough--it could be a lot more rigid with certain institutional changes--to be responsive to those changes I believe it's wrong to think that in the short run the money supply will behave only in the way the Committee a priori wants it to behave, Rather, in the short run it will behave in response to what is going on in the economy, only toned up in certain ways by what the Committee wants It's an awfully big thing the Committee is confronting and in the short run it's very hard to influence it   It's hard to believe they'd be sustained, I think   I think what Governor Gramley is saying, Governor Wallich, is that in '75 and '76 we might have been making an analysis that we were at the beginning of a recovery and velocity would be increasing That's true But if we only said that much, we would have been underestimating how stimulative monetary policy really was in 1976 because in addition we had this downward shift in money demand People didn't want to hold money, so velocity was going up in part also because of that That's what this demand shift is; it already takes into account the impact of interest rates And with that impact, people want to hold even less money, so we have an even bigger velocity In effect, the measured growth of money in '75 and '76 of 4 or 5 percent or whatever it was in an economic sense was really more like 10 percent   If we throw out '75 and '76, it probably would still fit [the rest of the period] It depends on what one thinks really went on in that period   [Statement--see Appendix]  [Coffee break]   Under alternative A we would expect an average level of the funds rate by the fourth quarter of something like 11-1/4 percent, give or take a little So it may be higher than the level of the last few days by about 1/2 point or a little less   Yes, and we'd expect a further rise--   Yes And under alternative B the average for the quarter would probably be around 12-1/2 percent That's assuming that the move toward that level doesn't somehow affect economic activity in the fourth quarter [very] promptly   The mortgage rate we have under "A" would be around 13-1/8 percent, which is not far from where it is now But if that were wrong, I suspect the rate would be higher And under "B" I could easily see the mortgage rate moving up between now and year-end -- this is my view and others maybe differ--to around 14 or 14-1/2 percent, depending in part on the degree of concern institutions have on whether rates are going to move up even further   In the week of the 10th we had a $1-1/2 billion decline and [we expect] very little increase in the current week   The borrowing was high in the week ending [September] third; and excess reserves were originally extremely high, on the order of $650 million That was revised down to about $489 million a week later, but that is above average I might add, Mr Chairman, that I don't have the borrowing by Federal Reserve District but I do have it broken down by money market banks, which are the 46 largest, and others In the week of the third, when borrowing was $13 billion, money market banks borrowed $800 million And in the week of the tenth, when borrowing was around $600 million, money market banks borrowed around $400 million I don't have any breakdown for this week, but that indicates a fairly active use by the large banks, which probably fits with the hypothesis that they don't feel very reluctant to borrow, not having been in for ages   I don't think we are going to get slow money growth over the rest of the year And whether that [more] rapid growth is going to occur in September, October, November, or December I'd be the first one to say I couldn't really tell you because there is a lot of noise in the month-to-month fluctuations of money growth The only basis for saying slow growth in September is that we have modestly firm data for the first three days of the month and preliminary data for the next seven, so we have data for something  -32-    9/16/80  like a third of the month Those data show an average level for the month below the level in August So allowing for some rise over the balance of the month--I think there will be some rise--we'd get a very low growth rate Now, if we get a revision in the preliminary data for the week of the 10th of plus $1-1/2 to $2 billion, like we got last week, and if the week of the 17th shows no coming down from that but remains strong, then it's quite possible that September could be moving up again to very high growth rates Similarly, we could get downward revisions and get very low growth rates What I'm saying is that all we have is the first 10 days, of which seven of those days are partial data   Yes, that happens often [I feel fairly comfortable] predicting what is going to occur--that there will be strength sometime in the fall But in which particular month is almost impossible to tell   No, on the assumption that the Committee retained a 14 percent ceiling, we wouldn't see that as an impediment because it's largely been interpreted as an average over the days of the statement week Therefore, if it were at 13 or 14 percent or even a little above 14 percent on some days, I wouldn't presume [the ceiling] would be an impediment If we were wrong and there was a lot more demand for money and we are much closer to the ceiling, then it could in fact become an impediment   I'm not sure exactly how that 7-1/4 percent got in there, but I probably ought to explain, President Mayo, that it is sometimes difficult to make a distinction between projections and targets   And what we have in alternative A is 7-1/4 percent growth in the fourth quarter, which would be the implicit target if you were going to hit 4-1/2 percent for the year   We would expect that; that's very close to a projection because we like to make projections assuming no changes in interest rates But we expect some rise in interest rates as I explained even with that So in the Bluebook where we have the 7-1/4 percent [growth rate], that is the target necessary to hit a particular level over the year   I should add that if New York is right and the Committee adopts either "A" or "B," there will be a sharp drop in interest rates   If money demand is going to be that low, there ought to be a drop in interest rates  -34-    9/16/80   We assume the present discount rate   I might add, Mr Chairman, that when we were writing "B," which was Friday afternoon, we were not aware that banks were going to be quite as willing borrowers as they were   The borrowing has run--   It was 10-1/2 percent and then it dropped to 1022 percent and borrowing to around $600 million   That's right   We tried to blend this in some sense by having the operational target go from month to month, but trying to get it so that it results in the quarter-over-quarter growth that the Committee wants   In general I have a little trouble with the quarterly average because if one took that quarterly average extremely seriously, whatever we put in there for the fourth quarter implies one real wrench to hit it If we go off [target] very early in the quarter--if the pattern month to month varies from what we have in  -44-    9/16/80  here--in the last part of the quarter we really have to wrench it around to hit the target It is true that the quarter over quarter will vary, but it makes for a much more orderly procedure in relation to markets to do it that way   Mr Chairman, I was assuming that if the Committee wanted to start off in a posture where in some rough sense the pressures in the money market weren't terribly different from what they have been in the last week or two, I would think an average level of borrowing of $600 million is way too low An average level of $800 million might just about be consistent, given the fact that borrowing has been running high in the last week, with not much change in money market pressures If my interpretation of what the Committee means by  -49-    9/16/80  neutrality to begin with is right--that is, basically money market pressures about as they have been, taking everything relevant to that into account at least initially--then I would think a number between $700 and $800 million would about do it We would technically write down $750 million in the path, but if borrowing were coming in high, we'd adjust the nonborrowed reserves down a bit and vice versa We could just as well do that with a $600 to $800 million range We'd write down $700 million and if $750 million looked right, then we'd lower nonborrowed reserves in the course of the week If $650 million looked right to give a money market sense as it has been, we'd raise them a bit We can operate with that kind of flexibility, and that may be best given this developing uncertainty about what particular level of borrowing is "right"   My memory going back three or four weeks ago-- well, I wasn't here but from the discussion I heard--three weeks ago there was an expectation of a rather high funds rate, say, around 11 percent, with borrowing around $400 or $500 million That didn't develop Banks were much more willing to borrow and the funds rate only got up to 10-1/2 percent We expected this week a funds rate between 10-1/2 and 11 percent, closer to 11, with borrowing around $750 million Well, banks very promptly went in and borrowed $17 billion when the funds rate got to around 10-7/8 percent, again indicating a greater willingness to borrow So, therefore, we should provide less nonborrowed reserves I think there is some uncertainty If I had known the level of borrowing on Friday when we wrote the Bluebook, I would have raised both the $600 and the $800 million to get to the point where "A" was a tick toward ease and "B" a tick toward tightening to start with   If the Committee decided on "B," no I would assume that borrowing consistent with this discussion of somewhere between $600 and $800 million is neutrality I would assume [for "B"] it would be somewhat above $800 million   With uncertainty   Mr Chairman, the discount rate is 10 percent In some sense that's a fairly effective lower limit because if [monetary growth] gets weak enough that borrowing gets to zero--   It's going to be a problem for [a funds rate of] 8 percent   When you asked the question, Mr Chairman, I was assuming that $750 million was the midpoint around which there could be some variation With nothing else changed--that is, if the  -55-    9/16/80  paths were all working about like this--if the funds rate was going up very high and if borrowings were $750 million, there would be a certain freedom within the very first week on that interpretation such that borrowings would be lowered because that would be an indication that the demand for borrowing was not as high as we thought So I think we would be interpreting it along the lines of what you were saying, Governor Gramley   Yes    But without necessarily any impact on total reserves in the period you are talking about That is, the impact on total reserves and the base might well have come later And it might have been considered, conceivably, to be a lot greater than you would have wanted later It's really very difficult to judge I doubt that the banks would respond instantly to an increase in the funds rate of another 1/2 point or 1 point They will respond, but perhaps not instantly The response may come later when the money supply might otherwise have been being reduced, so we have to judge that also   I don't know [that it's a] convention There's always an option of adjusting the discount rate or the nonborrowed path I don't remember exactly when the discount rate went up, but I think it was in this period So that's an additional factor; that is, I viewed that as an alternative to further downward adjustment in the nonborrowed path That's [equivalent to] taking another $200 to $300 million off the nonborrowed path So I would say [the adjustment] went pretty far Otherwise, you're left with a rule--I don't know what the rule would be--that every time total reserves are above where the original path was, we lower nonborrowed The amount of lowering in the nonborrowed path we have to do really isn't equal to the [drop in] total reserves It would have to be one heck of a lot more-- billions more--because banks are going to borrow more So we'd have to lower nonborrowed even more to offset the increase in borrowing to get any drop in total And to do it within a month is very difficult; it would require very substantial drops in nonborrowed reserves So, inevitably, we get into the question of either letting nature take its course or trying to figure how much speed we can give to the process given the lags   When Governor Partee was head of research, in all uncertain things he laid down the dictum 50/50   They have gotten shorter On both our quarterly model and monthly model the lags are quite a lot shorter than they were a few years ago when we first started [looking into] this On the monthly model, to the degree there's a response in money demand to interest rates, the elasticity is a little over 10 percent On our current estimates of the model, fifty percent of the impact comes in about two months It's pretty fast   No, no   It's down at least to three months Our quarterly model, which has been re-estimated very recently but only with data through '74 because using data after '74 we couldn't get a fit that was worth talking about, the elasticities are variable There is one for the bill rate and one for the [unintelligible]  -15-    10/21/80  savings rate If you add them up--pretend they're additive--it's something like 10 percent again It says that within a quarter we get 60 percent of the response, depending on how things go And after one quarter we get three-fourths of the response That's much faster than we had when we started estimating these things That means that if we have done a little here, we will begin to get some movement shortly thereafter I don't think this is too inconsistent with the kind of behavior we have had this year, but we are working on [an analysis of] it But our latest view is that the lags are a lot shorter than they used to be   For the quarterly model But for the monthly model that's estimated with more up-to-date data   Yes; it's a lot shorter now   Yes, it's one of the things for sure There are several, but that is certainly a key issue   Well, I'll just give a tentative response, because we are doing research in that area and the results of that research, particularly with the relation of the lags to what happened to money, would be critical in one's appraisal I don't view it myself, President Balles, as a discount rate question I see it more as a question [relating to the level] of the federal funds rate or the constellation of short-term rates So I would transpose your question to be If the discount rate had been raised earlier, would it have put more pressure on the funds rate earlier and, therefore, damped money growth in January and February of this year? I don't think it's a question of discouraging borrowing but of discouraging bank [lending] activity and the public's demand for money And that's not a question of the discount rate per se, but a question of the level of short-term rates My tentative view is that one would have raised the discount rate to higher levels only if one came to the judgment that other short rates ought to have been higher If one were content with the level of short rates that emerged, I don't see any need to have adjusted the discount rate from what was done On a more technical basis, there is some validity [to that concept], and I think the surcharge is a step in that direction There is somewhat of a slippage in that; one can't be sure, as we saw this time We might get a lot of borrowings early on when we're expecting [only] a little, and we might get little when we are expecting a lot There are uncertainties in the relationship between market rates and nonborrowed reserves as a result Those are rather short-run slippages and probably a more structured discount rate system, which the surcharge was, might help to give a little more certainty in the relationship between borrowing and the funds rate So we may get more certainty in the response But that's a technical thing and not a question of the overall level of the discount rate I think the question is what overall level of short rates the Committee is willing to see and tolerate   [Statement--see Appendix]   I would say the effects of that probably would be negative because I perceive difficulty already in the public's understanding of the increase in the M-1B range [described] in the appendix to the Chairman's letter in February, having to do with the 1981 targets I've heard people interpret that as an increase in monetary growth and an easier policy when it was explained that that meant a tighter policy So I think an effort at this point to do that for 1980 would probably be nonproductive   For alternative B, through this year we would expect a funds rate roughly around the recent level of 12-1/2 percent, virtually no change Over the course of next year we still expect rates to rise Maybe Mike has those figures with him   Next year it gets to be a question of the feedback of that on GNP and inflation   Well, [the relationship] has been a bit shaky   We have had a level of borrowing in the last two weeks of $11 and $12 billion [respectively], with the funds rate right around 12-5/8 percent So, I'd say it isn't unreasonable to think of $1-1/4 billion with a funds rate around 12-1/2 percent In the previous two weeks we had a much higher level of borrowings and a much lower level of the funds rate That was around quarter-end But also in that period very large banks were much heavier borrowers than they have been recently In the last two weeks of September, large banks borrowed 45 percent of the total borrowing and in the recent two weeks they have borrowed 25 percent of the total borrowing And when there are large borrowers, I think it takes a little pressure off the funds rate; when they are not [in], it puts some pressure on the funds rate That's my view in any event So a lot depends on which banks decide it is their turn to borrow I would say that a 12-1/2 percent funds rate and $1-1/4 billion in borrowing isn't unreasonable to think about, but I'm uneasy because I can't quite tell which banks are going to decide to borrow or not to borrow   Well, that's right, not precisely; but there is certainly a reasonable band In interpreting the demand for borrowing we certainly interpret the discussion of the Committee as well   Again, if large banks suddenly decided to borrow, I'd say it could be [higher] Ordinarily--   [Unintelligible] that's right   These are tenths in all cases    If you are talking about publishing the reserve figures, I don't think so   We are going to publish two forms of total reserves One will be the total including all the vault cash of all nonmember institutions, which would imply very sizable so-called excess reserves But then we are also going to publish a total reserve figure which will include the reserve [deposits] held at the Fed of all depository institutions, vault cash of those institutions that hold required reserves at the Fed, plus the vault cash for those who do not hold required reserves at the Fed up to [the amount] equal to their required reserves The sum of those figures [less required reserves] would be excess reserve balances at the Fed, but not excess vault cash since we are not putting in the [surplus vault cash of] nonmember institutions And that's the item we propose to run on; that will have in it an implicit excess reserve figure that is very little different from the excess reserves that we've had recently   We will explain that   Mr Chairman, we have done various kinds of research, which we could make available to the Committee, to try to determine if the market has behaved "rationally" or not My memory is that the results are that mainly they have behaved rationally That is, they have moved when they view the change in the money supply as a good predictor of the change in the federal funds rate and have not moved otherwise for the most part So from that point of view, there doesn't seem to have been all that much irrationality in market reactions But we can update that research and present it   We wrote it 3 or 4 years ago   That's right, but it will include the same sample   That's right, but that might be for only a very few weeks   No, not at this moment We don't even have the total required reserves for members for this week as of this very moment That may be part of the source of Mr Sternlight's problem   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, President Roos, we are going to have all- day staff meetings tomorrow and Thursday on the first drafts of the papers and I would be in a much better position to comment after that than before But so far as I can tell, people are right on schedule in the production of the documentation and I expect to have a very fruitful meeting   The implication of what we were targeting on was that $16 billion in borrowing would emerge out of the week   Mr Chairman, I mentioned that number because that was implied in the week's figure But we tried to be clear to the Committee that in thinking this through we had assumed in the Bluebook, for whatever constellation of pressures you are considering on bank reserves, that with this discount rate move you'd have to lower borrowing relative to what it had been So in some sense that $16 billion was before the discount rate action; a level of borrowing consistent with that $16 billion after the discount rate action would be somewhat lower We'd put in a notional $15 billion   That's right But even you just said you wanted to start at the recent level of borrowing If you factored in the discount rate action, that would have to be a bit lower That's just a technical [comment]   That's right   Well, we had suggested $15 billion for "A" and $1-3/4 billion for "B"   Actually M-1A would come out at "A" That is, the average for the week of the 5th and what we expect for the 12th comes out to a level for M-1A of $3879 billion, and that's the December level that's built into "A" To achieve the specs of "B" would require a drop in M-1A from here on in  -43-    11/18/80   I was giving you the December average level for M-1A; it would be $3879 billion That's virtually no change from the November average level, and the first two weeks of [December] are roughly at the November average level So there would be no change, in effect   Borrowing would rise in any event  -47-    11/18/80    Well, Mr Chairman, as you suggested, immediately following the meeting we had a considerable upward revision in the money supply data, measured by M-1A For the week of [November] 5th we published a level that was $12 billion higher than what was implied by the growth path adopted by the Committee, and for the week of the 12th we had a level $18 billion higher So the markets [saw] an increase for the 5th--the final number--of $29 billion and a further increase of $18 billion for the 12th The    11/26/80  preliminary data we had for the 19th had suggested no change from the level of the 12th The data we have as of about an hour ago, without nonmember banks available, suggest a downward revision [The numbers] suggest that we may show a drop of $1-1/2 billion from the week of the 12th for M-1A and a drop of similar magnitude for M-1B Even with these latest revisions, money growth will be running above the total reserve path adopted by the Committee As of yesterday, it was running about $400 million above on a weekly average basis, and this increased demand for total reserves was pulling [up] the demand for borrowing The amount of borrowing was up from the $15 billion initially assumed to $19 billion We have not made any downward revision in the nonborrowed reserve path to take account of the increase in total reserves at this point, as we normally do not do that this early in a period In any event, as I say, we now have had the first sign of a downward revision in the money supply Whether it will hold up, Mr Chairman--   Only time will tell With borrowing running recently around $19 to $2 billion, the federal funds rate has moved up After the discount rate was raised on Friday, the funds rate moved up to around 16-1/4 percent on Monday It had been running at around 16-1/4 to 17 percent and now, most recently, it has been running between 17 and 18 percent The average for the week to date is 17 percent Yesterday it was 1728 percent and it was running very high today, on Wednesday, the last day of the statement week--17-1/2 to 18 percent--and then moved above that later Mr Chairman, I think that very briefly updates the Committee on the aggregates and related reserve and money market conditions   We were in the middle [of those estimates] before we got this very recent data Our estimate for M-1A growth for November was on the order of 9 percent or a little higher, and for December it had been around 1-1/2 percent Our estimate for M-1B was    11/26/80  around 12 percent for November and close to 3-1/2 to 4 percent for December Whether these latest data will cause any further downward revision to that depends on the week of the 26th, for which I just don't have any data If they prove to be somewhat weaker also, I suspect the December number will revise down, because the latest data in November will be lower and that will tend to carry through somewhat and lower the December average level But that's highly tentative, President Eastburn   Yes, the implied borrowing literally called for in the path is $19 billion And given the way the federal funds rate has been running, [a funds rate of] 17 to 18 percent ought to be generally consistent with that But if the borrowing were to rise significantly higher--if the money supply came in stronger--then of course there would be a question about the 18 percent itself I might also add that last week we had an unusually large amount of borrowing from banks over $3 billion in size Virtually half of the borrowing was from them, and they are the banks more prone to try to avoid the window because of the surcharge So it may be that we are getting more pressure from the surcharge than we might have expected That may abate but, again, I'm not certain   I don't think there is any particular concentration by District As I say, the only thing we noticed, particularly last week, was that very large banks borrowed a little more than usual, but borrowing by the smaller banks continued very heavy I might say that over the past four weeks, Mr Chairman, [one statistic we monitor]--the average number of weeks borrowed in the past 13 weeks--has been creeping up It's one indicator It's up to 42 weeks; and if we do [the calculation] by size of bank, it looks as if the large banks are very close to the sort of national guideline that had been put out, which would indicate that some will be subject to pressure    Mr Chairman, on the latest data the aggregates have been showing some signs of weakness, even on an overnight basis since late yesterday As of the moment we're planning to publish this afternoon an increase of $11 billion for M-1A and of $12 billion for M-1B for the week of November 26, in each case less than the preliminary numbers had indicated Preliminary numbers for the week of [December] 3rd show a drop--more than we had expected as of late yesterday--of about $18 billion for M-1A and about $17 billion for M-1B These numbers would give us estimates for November of a 68 percent rate of growth for M-1A and a 96 percent rate of growth for M-1B M2 remains strong, growing at a 122 percent annual rate, as the weakness in the transactions components of M2 has been offset by strength in the nontransactions components We still expect growth in December, despite the very weak number for the 3rd, at rates of 37 and 49 percent for M-1A and M-1B [respectively] The weaker recent numbers do, however, lower required reserves in this 5-week operating period And given the level of borrowings that we had achieved in [the weeks of] November 26 and December 3, working through the paths for total and nonborrowed reserves hitting the targets would imply a level of borrowing for the current week and the next two weeks of around $1760 million So that's down somewhat from the $21 billion level of borrowings that we actually had in the week of December 3rd Borrowing on Thursday, by the way, was $14 billion So we are starting off not too far away from these targets but on the low side of them I believe, Mr Chairman, that updates the Committee on the position of the aggregates   No, I couldn't answer that right now, Larry I can give you a figure that [might give you some perspective] To be perfectly consistent with the target path adopted at the previous Committee meeting, it would have to be minus 61 But the--   And that target path led you to a rate above the long-run range   To hit the cone, so to speak, in December would involve a lesser decline, but it would be huge And to hit the quarterly average that would [produce] a fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter number at the upper end of the range would involve a massive decline as well   Well, we have differences in estimates, as Peter reported earlier We have to provide reserves What Peter has done today already provides more than our path had called for, assuming that the estimates are accurate So we are in a position where we have already provided more than the amount called for and unless there is a shortfall in the factors, we wouldn't be providing more And in response [to what we provided today] the funds rate did drop down to 18 percent   It depends If the factors break away from us on Monday or Tuesday, then we might have to provide more   The implied level of borrowing, Governor Teeters, dropped to $1760 million from the $2 billion we had then So we are providing [reserves] on that assumption    12/05/80    Thank you, Mr Chairman Since last week the data we've gotten on the aggregates appear to be somewhat weaker on balance We will be publishing today levels of M-1A and M-1B that will essentially show very little change from the revised levels for the week of [November] 26th The partial data that we have for the week of [December] 10th again suggest very little change from the levels of the 3rd So, since mid-November we've had about four weeks of an unchanged money supply   For the week of the 26th we will revise down [the preliminary figure] we have already published   Governor Gramley asked for the numbers for the 26th and the 3rd For M-1A they are $3889 billion for the 26th; $3887 billion for the 3rd; and [based on] a partial estimate $3886 billion for the 10th The pattern of M-1B is essentially the same, slightly higher   The published figure for the 26th had been $3896 billion and we will revise that to $3889 billion With these figures coming in, we have weakened our estimate of growth in M-1A for December to 2-1/2 percent from the 37 percent we had last week [Growth of] M-1B remains just under 5 percent We also have weaker data coming in on small time deposits and our estimate of M2 growth for December, which last week was 6 percent, has been reduced to 5 percent, reflecting essentially this weakening in small time deposits   For M2 growth the revised figure for November is an 11 percent increase   For M-1A the November figure, slightly revised, is 71 percent and for M-1B it's 93 percent But this weakening in the recent numbers, Mr Chairman, tends to weaken required reserves very slightly And we ended up last week coming in very close on the borrowing; it was $1,786 million at the end of last week Taking that into account and the previous weeks, and the weakening of required reserves, we would tend to have a somewhat lower level of borrowing implied from our reserve paths in the weeks of [December] 17th and 24th There is some uncertainty about that level of borrowing, which    12/12/80  might be anywhere between, say, $16 billion and a little over $17 billion It depends in part on technical adjustments that could be made to the multiplier; there is some remaining doubt about that  Two other points I would add, Mr Chairman One is that the gap between total projected reserves, which reflects the actual behavior of money, and the total reserve path set in the light of the Committee's decision at the November meeting had been quite wide at the beginning of the period and is narrowing Total reserves are now projected at roughly $200 million above the path And they had been orders higher at earlier periods The other thing, Mr Chairman, if it is of interest to the Committee, is that based on the data we now have M-1A growth for the year measured from Q4 '79 to Q4 '80 looks as if it will be 5-1/2 percent M-1B growth looks as if it will be 7-1/2 percent, and M2 growth will be about 98 percent In the case of M-1A, that's just below the upper end of the range M-1B is just above the upper end and M2 is about 08 above the upper end of its range   Well, yes, if we adjusted for the fact that when the ranges were originally set M-1B was set to grow 1/2 point more than M-1A In the event, there were a lot more shifts out of demand deposits and other assets into ATS accounts than we had expected, [largely as a] consequence, I think, of the Monetary Control Act and banks wanting to get into the business fast before thrifts get into the act this coming year If we adjusted for that, then of course we would want to lower the M-1A range and raise the M-1B range I think the outcome would be just about as you described it   Mr Chairman, if I may just correct that a bit, it's the last two-thirds of December that [is projected]   Yes, in the case of M-1A, it's a hair below   Well, it depends a bit on what we assume came out of demand deposits and what we assume came out of other deposits If we said it was 50/50, that would reduce the 3-1/2 to 6 percent M-1A range to something like 2-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent I may be off a bit And it would raise the 4 to 6-1/2 percent M-1B range to something like 4-3/4 to 7-1/4 percent But don't hold me to precision on those numbers That is the order of magnitude   Well, I would have to--    Now may be the best time [for my comments] I think that would just about do it   At the February meeting We were assuming that there would be an extra day at the February meeting   Well, if God's willing, we will distribute something a week or two in advance That is our plan, but this is a very large--   [Statement--see Appendix]   I'm not so certain, President Morris, although of course I would tend to prefer a narrower M to a broader M because of [the former's] closer relation to income over time But if I might just take a minute on your question, Mr Chairman, we came to the conclusion in two ways that intersect One relates to the public's demand for assets based in part on this year's experience and how we think the public would respond, given our projection of interest rates next year And secondly, going through the credit picture we asked Would the credit demands expected to come out of that nominal GNP and this conservative allowance for growth of thrifts and banks satisfy them? They need [how] much in deposits in order to meet these kinds of demands? It was the intersection of those two strands of analysis [that led to our conclusion]   Yes, but that was in a period, President Morris, when interest rates were generally low and deposits were subject to ceiling rates We have a very different situation now, with most of the movement in M2 and M3 occurring through these money market accounts and saving certificates that are at market rates So there's more of an institutional volition in them than there used to be   That's right   May I make a clarifying comment on M2, Mr Chairman, extending that?   Since about the middle of last year or longer, we have been projecting a much higher M2 growth than the Committee has been targeting, consistent with the M1 growth and what we expected in nominal GNP So this is a sudden change from what the staff has been indicating is likely to happen to M2 And on the question of interest sensitivity--though it's a phrase that means different things to different people--from our point of view, M2 in a sense has less interest sensitivity without fixed ceilings on interest rates [When] ceiling rates disappear, institutions can adjust to the market As market rates go up, we are not seeing a substantial reduction in flows into those types of deposits; and as market rates go down, we are not seeing a substantial increase in those flows So interest sensitivity in that sense is lessening And what we are seeing is that these flows are more responsive to what the institutions for one reason or another think they need in order to maintain competitive positions and to meet credit demands That's essentially what is at the base of our projection of a further fairly sizable increase   I don't mean to take too much of the Committee's time, but in response to Governor Teeters, one of my less fortunate suggestions to the Committee a couple of years ago was to introduce an aggregate called Ml+ when we had this very problem with ATS transfers That was going to be demand deposits plus savings deposits And that happened to be introduced at a time when savings deposits began to drop sharply because market rates were high and savings deposits were subject to a ceiling rate So the Committee was confronted with a series that was declining very sharply and it wanted it to increase a little   Mr Chairman, as a point of information, the Committee at its last meeting established a range of 13 to 17 percent It was subsequently widened in a special meeting to 13 to 18 percent  -70-    12/18-19/80   I think the easiest way to see it is on page 12, Governor Gramley Just throw away that December 2-1/2 percent rate of growth; we now estimate it at 1-1/4 percent Look at the panel that has December '80 to March '81 under alternative B for M-1A; that's constructed right on the midpoint of the tentative range, which is 4-1/4 percent As of now we think NOW accounts will subtract 56 percentage points over the quarter, so the M-1A number in parenthesis would be -14 percent For M-1B under alternative B, it would be 47 percent--that's the 4-3/4 percent--and we think NOW accounts would add 2-3/4 points We would try to monitor this as these data come in to see if we're anywhere near right on that And we'd construct the path on that -1-1/4 percent, which is something like -2 percent for January and -19 percent for February That's the path we would construct the reserves on, which is what we'd guess now; and then we'd adjust it as the data come in   Well, for lack of anything else, President Corrigan, I would tend to start out about where we are And where we have been is that last week the average was around $15 billion and yesterday it was $17 billion So, somewhere around $15 or $16 billion strikes me as a reasonable place to start, lacking any other indications   Well, on that there is a divergence of opinion on the staff My view, which has proved wrong this week, is that a level of $1-1/2 billion of borrowing is probably consistent over time with a lower level of the funds rate than we have had Once we get through this period--  -75-    12/18-19/80   But that isn't certain And I'm not sure Peter shares that view exactly   We would construct the path assuming something like 10 percent   That's what we have as consistent under alternative B We have 10 percent for the December-to-March period, which translates to roughly that for January and February That may be wrong, but most of those [components] don't have reserves attached to them anymore, of course   No, that's right But in constructing a path, January is what we would be putting in there And I would tend to put in around 9 percent   Well, it may or may not; we have had this--   Well, the only operational question is what number to put in It's not going to have any real effect on the operations   Whatever number we put in there, because we tend to ignore M2 in the very short run,--     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Some of my  introductory comments will repeat some of yours, but I don't think  any of them will contradict      2/2-3/81 -2-            I'd like to organize my introductory comments  around three general points  One is the limitations in the study;  second is a very brief summary of the findings, since they have been  summarized over the course of 15 pages in a memo; and third is a  general statement about what I, at least, would see as some of the  implications of the study for our present procedure      First, on the limitations  It seems like a long period  since the introduction of the [new] procedure in October [1979], but  the period is now 15 months; and it's really very short for  evaluating the procedure  And it's particularly short because last  year was a very strange year in that there were a lot of what we call  exogenous factors affecting the economy that would have had impacts  on the money supply and interest rates no matter what procedure the  Federal Reserve was following  That makes the problem of averaging  out, so to speak, even more complicated because we had a year where  interest rates, money supply, and spending were subject to exogenous  shocks that make trying to find out what the procedure did to the  economy or to the money supply or to interest rates very difficult   It's very hard to separate it out  So, given the nature of the  period, the 12 months that we actually used in [our studies to  evaluate] the 15 months or longer that we now actually have [used the  new control procedure] is quite short      Secondly, of course, we couldn't just observe the procedure  and say  "Well, there was a lot of money and interest rate  variability"  We were forced to try to see if we could conclude that  either the procedure gave rise to the variability or the variability  was caused exogenously and was independent of the procedure  We  needed something to judge all that against, so we had to use models,  which are nothing more or less than an average of 10 or 15 years of  experience, and see how they would have worked if 1980 in some sense  had had the characteristics of those 10 or 15 years over which the  models were constructed  Thus, I would really want to caution you  about that  I think that was a necessary procedure, but I want to  caution you because  (a) 1980 wasn't like the previous 10 or 15  years; (b) models do tend to be misspecified and they may not even be  a correct representation of the previous 10 or 15 years; and (c)  models have a disconcerting tendency to give very different results  if you put in one variable and take out another or if you change the  period over which the variables are estimated  As a result of that  we did try to use a number of different models, which had a number of  different views of the world, in order to try to give as fair a test  as possible  But I would use all these results with caution   Because one model works in one period surely doesn't mean it's going  to work in the next      Finally, I would say on behalf of the whole staff that we  have had a limited time to evaluate so complicated a subject  We  started thinking about this sometime in September; I remember  discussing it with the Chairman  I think we started working in  earnest on it sometime in October, and that really is a limited time  given the very complicated procedures we were involved in  So, some  of the work is actually ongoing and is therefore subject to change as  we learn more or stumble across better ways of doing things  As a    2/2-3/81 -3-    2/2-3/81  check on ourselves, we did try in a seminar-type setting to expose all the work to all the people in the Federal Reserve System who were working on this project [for their critical evaluation] And on two of the crucial pieces, those by Mr Tinsley and Mr Lindsey, we did have a conference with academic economists--Messrs Brunner, Meltzer, Rashe, Pierce, Kareken, and LeRoy--to have input from that end and to expose our work not exactly to disinterested observers but to, we would hope, rather critical observers And I think that our work there survived rather well and did have some impact on their thinking  With that background, I'll try to generalize the findings even more than they are generalized in the discussion paper One principal finding--and again this is not a matter of logic but partly a matter of logic and partly just a matter of judgmental analysis--was that 1980 was a rather special year, mainly because of the credit control program and also, I believe, because of the dynamics of inflationary expectations The latter led to very much higher interest rates than otherwise would have developed, which I think set off apparent sizable further efforts by the public to economize on cash as those high interest rates developed So, I think the special nature of the year gave us very pronounced disturbances in the market for goods and services, which were set off by the credit control program, and pronounced disturbances on the side of money, which were set off by the very high interest rates that developed very early in the year And some of these developments actually were occurring [concurrently], which tended to confuse some of the econometric models  Another general conclusion I would draw is that so far as we could tell, because of these external shocks, much of the interest rate and money variation was probably not intrinsic to the procedures but derived from the large-scale shocks external to the Federal Reserve [impinging upon] monetary policy against which the procedures were working That is an odd assertion In some of the work that Mr Tinsley did, using the model constructed over the past 10 or 15 years, he tried to see whether the results of the year fell within a confidence interval one would expect, given the average of the past 10 or 15 years And he found that for the most part they fell at the lower end of the confidence interval or below So, just from that kind of simulation, it looked as if it was a rather special year  Another conclusion is that on a more technical level it seemed that our procedures performed reasonably well in the present institutional environment relative to the simulated options; and I think that was the conclusion drawn by our academic consultants also in that conference we had with them That is, we could not assert from what we found statistically that we would have gotten better control of money if we had just used as the criterion the monetary base or total reserves over a period of one month and probably not over a period of three months in the present institutional environment Indeed, it did look as if control of the base or total reserves might even have made for less control over money in the present institutional environment Now, it is of some interest just to indicate why that turned out to be so; it turned out to be so because I think we all tended to underestimate what we call our [money] supply-side disturbances That is, there were shifts in the deposit mix, with more CDs, meaning a need for more required reserves And unless [the needed reserves are] provided--if we just hit our  -4-    2/2-3/81  total reserves or total base target and don't provide them--we immediately would get less money supply because the reserves aren't there and [we would get] higher interest rates in consequence of less money, given short-run money demand And unless we have made multiplier adjustments or have made a good guess about what the multiplier is, we would get these erratic money supply movements if we were following total reserves or a total base target because of these supply-side disturbances--not demand-for-money disturbances, but the [money] supply-side disturbances And, of course, the models we work with don't allow for that So, our conclusion was that it would be very important to have judgmental multiplier adjustments if we were to work on total reserves or the total base, certainly in the present institutional environment  Now, with institutional changes, it did appear that we could do very well with a total reserve or total base aggregate; we'd make the obvious institutional changes that I don't think I need to detail for all of you Some of this will [be discussed] later But our evidence, again working from the model, was that we'd do better with total reserves in that context than the base because in the end we would still have the institutional supply-side problem that currency has a 100 percent reserve requirement and deposits have a fraction of that reserve requirement So, changes in the mix of currency and deposits seem to have bigger disturbing effects in the multiplier if one works with the base than if one works with total reserves Another conclusion we reached--and it seemed fairly clear--is that more precise month-to-month control in money is likely to lead to greater interest rate volatility Indeed, the more precise we try to make it--that is, the more we try to hit it month-to-month instead of letting it average out over a 2- or 3- or 4-month period--the more interest rate volatility there is likely to be And this is a result of what seems to be a rather inelastic money demand in the short run; that is, in a week or two or three or whatever time affects the monthly average, it takes one heck of a lot of interest rate change to make people want to hold less or more money than they otherwise wanted to hold when there is a normal, and often random, flow of funds in the economy  Finally, as a general finding, we detected little need for precise month-to-month money control on economic grounds It appeared that significant economic effects are more likely to appear after three months or so than before, clearly Some work Mr Enzler did gives us an order of magnitude of the effect [on GNP] if we were off path for six months It turned out, for example, that if money was growing faster than target by 2 percent at an annual rate over a 6-month period, we might get a higher nominal GNP of about 1/2 percent at an annual rate So, it's after six months that there gets to be a little but nontrivial effect; it depends on your values and preferences But [such a divergence for] three months is rather trivial in terms of its effect, and much of the 6-month effect is offset later if you undershoot later; it's not offset, of course, if you don't undershoot but just go back to the original level that you had  Let me say a few words, Mr Chairman, if I may, about the implications I'd first like to note the advantages of the present target procedure, which is a procedure in which we use nonborrowed reserves as a day-to-day or week-to-week target but take total    2/2-3/81  reserves as a general guide so that adjustments are sometimes made to the nonborrowed target because of what is happening to total reserves This procedure can be viewed as something of a compromise because it is somewhat accommodative to deviations of money from the demand side That is, when money demand is strong--and it could be strong for random reasons, as Dave Pierce's paper showed, because there's a lot of noise in the money [stock] weekly and even monthly--there is a degree of accommodation; borrowing goes up But it is not total accommodation because interest rates also go up So the procedure in some sense involves a degree of accommodation to money demand shifts If disturbances are from the goods market, there is a degree of offset; it's the other side of the degree of accommodation, because if there's an increase in spending and an increase in money for transactions purposes, then there's pressure against that and interest rates go up This is not a bad thing because the economy, so far as we could tell, last year showed evidence of both types of shocks in it; indeed, since the mid-1970s there have been considerable money demand shocks So, there is something to be said for a target that compromises between these two and gives the Committee time at subsequent meetings to make a judgment as to how it wants to weigh what is going on in the economy, particularly since in the 1-month interval it doesn't look as if anything very fatal can happen to the economy from that kind of compromise In a sense, the present procedures are a reasonable compromise But because the discount window isn't entirely open--if it were, then we'd be accommodative entirely to all money demand [variation] whether it was a shift [relative to spending or not--I'd say the compromise is weighted to assuming that the shocks probably are mainly from the goods market But that represents a judgment on my part  If the Committee wants more short-run precision and control of money than it now has, there are a number of suggestions that come out of the study I would say that last year we did detect a little more slippage in the way the control procedures have been run and have worked than one might have expected in advance I [use as] the criterion that what one might have expected in advance was not so much the 1-month slippage but the gain in precision if one goes from one month to three months If you look at the control horizon, it's three months And the gain in precision we got last year and actually how the procedures worked out was less than the gain in precision one might have expected just from averaging out a bunch of random errors in the money to reserve relationship That means there may be something somewhat systematic [happening] there And that systematic thing could have been exogenous, in that it just sort of happened that way, or there could be things in the procedures that we could improve  Now most of the things that one would think of improving go in the direction of playing the game as if we were operating on total reserves because, while they don't bear a close relationship in the models, once we abstract from all the things that the models can't abstract from--which include the reserve requirement structures and things like that--then the relationship gets closer The evidence we developed indicates that; much of that is in Mr Lindsey's tables So, one way of pretending that you're a bit more on a total reserves target is to adjust the nonborrowed path more quickly when total reserves are strong or weak relative to path--that is, of course, with total reserves strong or weak properly adjusted for multiplier shifts to the extent that we can detect them That would be one method of    2/2-3/81  pretending we were tending more to follow total reserves Another method would be to employ the discount rate more actively, which in some sense is very similar to adjusting the nonborrowed path In one case, if total reserves are strong, you provide less nonborrowed reserves In another case, if total reserves are strong, you raise the discount rate and provide less incentive to borrow So the two methods are tantamount in a way to the same thing In some subtle sense of policy strategy, there are differences; but in a technical sense they're tantamount to the same thing You are trying to control total reserves either by holding back on nonborrowed reserves or by holding back on borrowings or vice versa if [total reserves] are weak  Another possibility is to restructure the discount window so that the demand for borrowing is more certain That's a much more controversial question and it tends to limit in a sense the System's flexibility if pursued very far We discussed that at length in Mr Keir's paper and in the summary document I'll only mention that there are two extremes to consider One is to close the window entirely except for emergency borrowing, which would really convert the nonborrowed path to a total reserves path; the other is to open it entirely, and that would give you a structured discount rate possibility so that as borrowing rises, interest rates would rise and some resistance would develop, somewhat like now, to increases in money above path Of course, if we didn't have that structured discount rate--if there were just a flat discount rate and an open window--then the increase in borrowed reserves would be tantamount to nonborrowed reserves Even with a structured discount rate, I think this kind of technique would make the highest discount rate the top of the funds rate [band]; the funds rate would never go above it and it would elevate the discount rate as an instrument of policy to an even more important [position] than it could be under the present way we operate It's not a more important instrument of policy now but it could be; and if the discount window were restructured, it could become even more important The variability of borrowing [demand] that we've been so suffering with and unable to predict to any great extent this year--and the evidence of last year is that it did become more variable--so far as one could determine must have had to do with administration of the window because if the window were open and there were no problem with borrowing, presumably banks would use it And if it were closed, there wouldn't be any administration to worry about So there's something in the interaction between the way the discount window is administered and how banks view the administration that causes a variability in the borrowing demand that is difficult to predict  On other matters, it was difficult to find anything that would say that a shift to contemporaneous reserve accounting would not help short-run money control, particularly if we were on any kind of even shadow total reserves target On the other hand, it was difficult to argue that maintaining lagged reserve accounting would be a major deficiency if our horizon were something like a 3-month period I did not take a staff vote on any of these matters, but I think the people who worked mostly in the Lindsey-type area do prefer a shift to contemporaneous reserve accounting Finally, on these particular points, if you want to control a narrower aggregate like M1-B, then it's obvious--again, if you're playing a shadow total reserve game--that you ought to remove the reserve requirement on nonpersonal time deposits If you want to control the broader    2/2-3/81  aggregates, you have a considerable problem because you don't have the legal possibility of putting reserves on most [of the components] of those broader aggregates, even those that are held at banks and thrift institutions So, by their nature they are going to be more difficult to control with a reserve technique than the narrower aggregates  All of these changes that one could suggest--some of them are small and some of them are large--structurally would lead so far as we could tell to more short-run volatility in interest rates in the degree that they reduce short-run accommodation to random money supply movements So, in a sense, if you're organizing the system to achieve precise month-to-month control of money, we believe that would give you greater short-run volatility in interest rates unless you're fortunate enough to predict exactly the amount of money the market happens to want [in a particular] month And given the amount of random noise in the money [stock], I suspect that's just purely impossible However, these things would reduce the odds, I believe, on getting far off the long-run [money growth] path over a period of three months or so I think they would have that constructive effect So, even if they increased the volatility of interest rates in the short run, which is likely, you might get a little less intermediate- run fluctuation That's because even with more volatile short-run movement, the trend up or down [in short-term interest rates] once you begin deviating--once money growth begins to get stronger or weaker-- would begin sooner and with less of a lag than now, possibly So, you would have less need for very high [rates later] because you would have gotten less far off [the money growth] path over a 3-month period While it rather clearly gives you more short-run volatility in interest rates, it seems to me quite possible that you would reduce the highs and lows and the intermediate-run fluctuations in interest rates  Finally, and on balance, Mr Chairman, I don't think we found a clear need for overhauling our procedures radically; at least that's my conclusion I'd say that was particularly so because it was also clear that last year may have been a special year in that the disturbances that hit the system from the economy occurred [not only] in the market for goods and services, which argues for a money supply target, but also to a great extent in the long-run and the short-run, that is the monthly, market for money, ie in money demand And with those kinds of disturbances, the present procedures tend to be a rather reasonable compromise   Well, Mr Lindsey is here If he would like to come up to the table, he could review very briefly the evidence from using total reserves, the total base, nonborrowed reserves, and the nonborrowed base from several models, as well as some of the results that the simulations suggested if we made some of these structural changes That is mostly in Table 7 of your material, Dave?    2/2-3/81   Plus or minus 5   Well, Mr Chairman, if I can translate that, I think he's saying minus 10 is as likely as plus 10 if you aim at zero   Well, very clearly, on economic grounds short- run precision isn't very necessary So far as we can see, it has a disadvantage of much greater interest rate volatility It's very hard to evaluate the implications of this greater volatility, but there are certain kinds of thin capital structures in the various markets for securities and [greater volatility] does tend to increase risks rather greatly because of that But if I could translate your question a little, it's clear to me that if you could hit [a target] month-to- month precisely, these interest rate variations would go away over time That's because as the market responded to them, then of course that would give you greater assurance of hitting it quarterly That is, if you can hit it month-by-month, you can surely hit it quarterly Clearly, it's more important to hit it quarterly than month-by-month I'm trying to say the only importance of having a procedure that gives you better assurance [of hitting the target] month-by-month is that it gives you better assurance [of hitting it] quarterly I have a feeling--and I'm not sure how we could test this--that you have better assurance of hitting it quarterly even if you don't have a lot of control month-by-month by aiming at it month-by-month; that would get you where you want to go in the quarter even though you can't hit a month-by-month target I've gone around Robin Hood's barn a little in answering the question, but that's how I would perceive it   Oh, heaven's no! And that certainly was not the staff's conclusion  -10-    2/2-3/81   That's right That's what I was trying to say Jerry Enzler's simulation showed that if growth is off 2 percent at an annual rate for two quarters, you'd have an impact of 1/2 percent at an annual rate on nominal GNP   Well, I think the answer is in part what I was trying to say in response to President Roos' question To the degree that these are random errors, you keep aiming [at the path] This month, let's say, you aim at the path and you go way over Next month you keep aiming at the path and you may go way under, so in some sense you've averaged out There's no reason to think that the errors are going to be persistent on one side or the other   What we found in the past year was that, in fact, [the actual errors] didn't average out as well as the models averaged out So it might lead you to think that there was something in the way the procedures were constructed or maneuvered that produced this result or that there was something in the economy that was more special [last] year Of course, the models were confronted with that also; but that worked out in practice to give you these greater deviations The simplest way to put it is that your average error in a month is 6, or 72 percent at an annual rate if you think of it as an absolute error But if you think of it quarterly--the world isn't this way--but if you had plus 6 and minus 6 and plus 6 in each month of a quarter, then the absolute error that quarter because you're now averaging quarterly in absolute terms would work down to plus 2 With plus 6, minus 6, and plus 6, you'd be left with plus 2 [for the quarter] According to the models, the errors aren't distributed in that nice way, so the improvement shouldn't be that spectacular But [the improvement] ought to be more like 6 to 3 or something instead of 6 to 2 We got an improvement of 63 to 47 or something like that It wasn't quite as good as some sort of random distribution of the multiplier errors would suggest, and that was the reason to think that there might be something more systematic [happening] or some way to operate the procedures that would get us there better   I don't think so What we actually did in this test was to take each month's target and see if we were off and just  -11-    2/2-3/81  average each intermeeting target for 3 intermeeting periods as a way of viewing the random nature to see if, because of the random nature of the money supply multipliers, that [approach] would capture that That is, if randomness had [produced] an upside shock in one period, it ought to end up [producing] a downside shock in the next period We just averaged through that, so it wasn't a direct test of what you're asking But I would say the answer to [your question] is probably no One can conceive of a world where you're trying to get on a long-run path and you just keep aiming at that level each month to get you there, trying not to forget the past, and you're aiming at [unintelligible] If two months from now you're supposed to be "here" and in one month you were "there," you'd still try to get "here" two months from now   Well, I assume they did some studies I'm not acquainted with their model as far as what results it would give I assume they have done the same kinds of studies we've done on running over or under path for given periods and determining how much effect on nominal GNP the model gives them We used to say 6 months here; the lags seem to have gotten a little shorter, so 3 months seems a little safer But, again, it depends on the magnitude of effect one is willing to tolerate I ought to add in that respect, Governor Schultz, that none of the models takes account of the expectational reaction to what is going on in the money supply The expectations are largely derived from past price behavior or past interest rate behavior to the extent [the models are looking at] interest rates or price expectations And in this modern world I think [expectations are] an additional factor to take into account That is, if you're running off path for 2 or 3 or 4 months, what will be the reaction in markets to that? You may get more prompt interest rate responses You may get different kinds of pricing decisions than the models are suggesting   We tried to examine some of the evidence on that and Mr Enzler, who I don't think is here at the moment, did a  -12-    2/2-3/81  considerable amount of work in that area, both theoretically and using the model You could construct a system where money demand was highly interest inelastic--much higher than it is, presumably--so you would have a lot of interest rate fluctuation when you tried to control that, and where there was no response in the economy in the current period but it occurred with a lag Cycles in economic activity might begin to develop because you are controlling money This is quite the opposite of what monetarists would contend He could develop, with reasonable estimates or unreasonable estimates of interest elasticity, 4- or 5-year cycles Last year, of course, our cycle was--   Yes, with 4- or 5-year regularity Last year our cycle was 3 or 4 months and that would imply a lot shorter lags than we discovered empirically and that are therefore embodied in our quarterly model And given the fact that--   Unfortunately, there was a credit control program last year and there seems to be quite a correspondence between the behavior of consumer spending and the imposition of the credit control program and [subsequently] the reemergence of consumer spending and the phasing out of the credit control program It's difficult to ignore that evidence So, we concluded tentatively that the lags haven't gotten so short in relation to money policy and interest rate behavior as to make it likely that we're going to get consistent 3- and 6-month cycles as a result of a policy of trying to control money I wouldn't say that that's impossible, really; but it just didn't seem consistent with the evidence of last year, given that the credit control program was a very big factor in the year   Well, I wish Jerry [Enzler] were here, but I don't think we have evidence that says the lag time is related to the level of interest rates But, of course, the higher the interest rates, the more there is a current reaction, given a lag, because it's just multiplied; if interest rates go up 20 percent instead of 10 percent, you get more effect given any lag structure right away because the 20 percent is bigger If you're going to get a 1 percent effect right away out of 10 percent, you'd get 2 percent out of 20 percent So it's simply that you get more power right away, but it's the same kind of lag structure   No, we did not   Well, it's certainly worth thinking about As I say, we didn't consider it The types of structures we did consider were to try to increase rates as the amount of borrowing went up; and, depending on how you do it, that could have an effect on larger banks relative to smaller banks The surcharge, of course, affects mainly the larger banks where the capital ratios are low So, I think in practice, particularly now, much of that is taken into account But we could certainly consider it The legality of it would be something I would wonder about also But it's certainly something to be considered   It was run two different ways First, if you were above path in the first quarter--your path level was here and you ended up there--in the second quarter you would go back to path You'd reduce the growth rate in the second quarter but just enough to get you back to the long-run path level The second kind of experiment was that if you were above the path in the first quarter, you'd [aim] below path in the second quarter and go back to path in the third quarter and continue on   That's right For example, if growth is over [path by] 1 percent on average for 2 quarterly periods and then goes back to path, you obviously have more money in there on average than if you'd been on the path consistently and also more money on average than if you had gone under path before   That's right In the second case it tends to offset Now, the Committee targets are more like the first case because they are measured QIV to QIV, so you have a QIV average level that you get back to So the way the Committee has set its targets is much more like the case of being over and then going back to the path instead of going under   Yes, if it works out that way   I was going to say that I thought one of the things you were asking, President Ford, was Did we have more trouble predicting demand for borrowing as the market rates widened above the discount rate? I just checked with Mr Johnson, who did some regressions and looked at that material, and his response coincides with my memory or lack of memory, which is that I can't recall that we did have any more trouble with wide spreads than we did with relatively narrow spreads But it may be--   We had more borrowing; trouble in predicting the borrowing, I don't think we had   Or something   What would happen when the demand for borrowing is elusive is that in the end the funds rate would turn out to be different than we expected We force the borrowing on them but then the funds rate might be different from what we expected, if we start from that point of view   Mr Chairman, maybe I should try to be clearer Where the demand for borrowing--the lack of knowledge of it--gets us in trouble is this We believe, as the Chairman said, that it's the rise or decline of interest rates that sets in motion forces that get you back on your money supply path And the theory of all this was that as required reserves strengthened, borrowing would have to go up because Mr Sternlight isn't going to provide those additional reserves; and with the rise in borrowing, the funds rate and [other] interest rates would have to go up, setting in motion these forces And what throws us off sometimes is that on occasion the borrowing will go up but interest rates won't On occasion there's not that kind of consistency and we get delayed; and then what further throws us off is that the borrowing might go up and the interest rates might go up but not enough and we really ought to be lowering the nonborrowed path and forcing more current rate fluctuation That's what we tend to mean when we say the demand for borrowing is a problem Sometimes banks are more willing to borrow than at other times and we don't get the kind of rate response we think would develop in [these circumstances]   The evidence that Dave Lindsey has developed would say that contemporaneous reserve accounting would clearly improve the multiplier between total reserves and money in the short run I think that would clearly happen It would mean that in the very short run, like a week, we wouldn't be able to predict required reserves very well, so the funds rate might vary a bit more for any given nonborrowed target So, it would have that "cost," if that's a cost But, on your other question, I was unable to convince myself-- maybe others have convinced themselves and if they have, then they should speak up--that tying the discount rate [to market rates] would make [the relationship] between reserves and money a lot more predictable Even if we had a penalty rate, if money got created this week like mad--and it might--then because Mr Sternlight is holding back on nonborrowed reserves, market rates would jump well above the penalty rate So we'd get a sharp rise in market rates and then of course we'd have to reset the penalty rate above that; and unless the money supply responded very promptly that week, we'd get another ratcheting up of rates and that sharp rise in rates might cause the money supply to drop rather substantially And we'd end up chasing our tail a bit, particularly if [money] were to drop substantially [and] randomly in any event So, I can't believe that tying the discount rate [to market rates] would give us more predictable borrowing; but it would, I think, more predictably and probably more certainly, force rates up faster or force them down faster And [some may] consider it [desirable] to have that advantage; but that's about the only advantage I could come up with   All we could come up with is that as the time lengthens, it gets less and less random We, too, have observed that the revisions seem to be consistently up or consistently down over intervals of a month or so And we have not yet shaken the resources loose to finish the project of examining the sources of those revisions to see if there is any bias evolving as we get into a period when the revisions are moving up or moving down But I don't think that relates particularly to the material that Dave Pierce worked on because, after all was said and done, it still looked as if there was a substantial amount of noise, so to speak, which included anticipating next year's seasonals in the weekly series less than the monthly, less than the quarterly, etc   No If it's plus or minus $33 billion, two- thirds of the time it's noise in a weekly series and we show a zero; we don't know whether that zero has a +$33 billion of noise in it offset by a -$33 billion of trend   Well, that was one feeling we had when we were living through it, in periods such as April and then in the summer We had that feeling [in April] when the economy was weaker than expected and the revisions in the money supply between the preliminary and the first published [number and] between the first published and the second published [number] were showing a weakening in the money supply And we had that feeling in the summer when the economy was turning out stronger than expected that those revisions were [all] going the same way That sounds as if there's a ghost operating two machines--the economy and the money supply There's not much reason, if the data we get are coming through in some sort of "unbiased" way, for those things to happen that way I don't have any response other than to say that we are trying to see if that was really true and what the sources were The only thing we could think of offhand was that some of the original data, particularly the preliminary data that we don't publish, have a good deal of estimating in them And if we are in a period when the money supply is dropping sharply, the estimators --either at the Reserve Banks or the [commercial] banks--put in last week's figure, but they should have been lowering last week's figure; so, we get that more systematic kind of bias I don't have the evidence yet to say whether that was indeed what was happening [We don't know] whether we have a coincidence or whether our instincts of what was happening were not right  -19-    2/2-3/81   Well, I think the answer to that is probably "no," because of the length of lags in our big model between long-term rates and investment plans We didn't see evidence in 1980--this is what I am remembering from the paper that Ed McKelvy and Larry Slifman did--that there was much of a response in investments to the kind of interest rate fluctuations we were getting Moreover, we couldn't find evidence that long-term rates were made higher in some sense than they otherwise would have been because of the uncertainties created by the operating procedure That is, we couldn't find much evidence that a liquidity premium was developing which would have lowered short rates from what they otherwise would have been and raised long rates from what they otherwise would have been The latter, of course, would be a damper on investment but with some lag So, in general, we were not really able to investigate, except through models or judgmentally looking at the economy, the possibility of some impact of greater week-to-week fluctuations in interest rates, short and long, on business planning That's an area we just--   Exactly One could not say that there was no impact of this kind of interest rate variability on business planning It was rather difficult for us to detect it or to find out how to measure it, really   My memory, looking at it another way, is that the monthly multiplier errors, at least in the models, were bigger on M2 than they were on M-1B but that our judgmental miss--judgmental meaning how we actually ran things--was less on M2 percentage-wise than on M-1B in terms of the growth rates I'm not sure whether I have answered your question exactly   Yes, exactly That's right   No, only if the past is any guide to the future And on that I would say that in the future M2 gradually will have less and less assets in it that are subject to reserve requirements because [such requirements] are being phased out at member banks Savings and small time deposits at member banks will no longer be subject to reserve requirements and certainly are not now at thrift institutions and nonmember banks So, whether that will pertain in the future or not, I'm really not certain Nor do I know if it would pertain if we really aimed at M2 We were aiming at M-1B here or at M-1A; we weren't really aiming at M2   I thought Governor Rice was raising the question [of what would happen if] we were aiming at the target, which is different from what would happen to these [aggregates] over the cycle It's quite possible, though I just don't remember We didn't look at that in detail But M2 might have a little less volatility over the cycle than M1; one would think that would be the case because it has higher interest elasticity of demand and M1 is much more sensitive to income   That depends on whose model and what time period   Well, I don't want to quarrel with your conclusion in particular What I have been exposed to shows--and my memory may be wrong--that you can come to virtually any conclusion you want, with virtually any aggregate, in large part depending on how you do it, but probably based on the premise that everything tends to go up and down with GNP There are big differences; the broader the aggregate, the more it tends to go up and down with GNP Sometimes you can even find that total credit goes very well with GNP but there is a cause and effect problem there The world turns out very  -21-    2/2-3/81  differently depending on what determinants you control In this study it was shown that the monetary base goes very well with money That happened to be because we were controlling the federal funds rate They went up and down together If we turned the world upside down and tried to control the monetary base, it didn't look to us from that experiment that it went very well with money because one would be in a different kind of world So, without trying to contradict you directly, I'd view all that with considerable caution   No, there was not   Well, we had a very difficult time, as you might guess, trying to distinguish between interest rate fluctuations that were a result of our procedures week-to-week or month-to-month and interest rate fluctuations that reflected what was going on in the economy, given the System's money supply targets As we went into the year, most people would have expected that if interest rates rose, we would have had a sharp drop For a while we fiddled with the idea of developing what economists, taking the words of philosophers, have begun to call counter-factual worlds, and pretending that we knew what the Committee would have done if they were on the old procedures After two or three what I thought were abortive attempts at that, I thought the safest thing--in fact I might say the only intelligent thing to do--was not to do that, because who knows what the Committee really would have done in this very unique period So, we didn't try to construct the world based on the funds rate moving only a quarter of a point or a half point We in no way meant to say that housing wasn't affected by the rise in rates that occurred or wasn't aided by the decline in rates that occurred But it looked as if the decline in rates that occurred in the second quarter was not out of keeping with the weakness in the economy in that quarter, so that we normally would have gotten that [decline] no matter what procedure the Committee was [following] The question was how fast However, we  -22-    2/2-3/81  could not ignore the fact that there was a credit control program that went off in that period It looked as if the sharp drop in GNP was also caused by the credit control program [and that to an] extent the rebound in the third quarter was affected by the phasing out of the program So we were driven to a rather weak conclusion that the procedures themselves may have hastened the rise in interest rates and hastened the decline in rates and, therefore, induced the drop a little earlier and moderated the decline That was our weak conclusion because we really expected that under any control procedure, given those money targets, we would have had that cycle developing Maybe that isn't stated as clearly as it might be, but that's the basis for saying that the procedures as such might have had what looked like other minor effects We didn't think that monetary policy did   Oh, sure It can get you into all sorts of multiplier problems because of the mix of deposits, if there is any response of bank excess reserves--we don't think there is much--and also questions about the demand for borrowing if you are on a nonborrowed target So, I do think that interest rates react both to the demand for money and the supply of money functions The inability of our monthly money market model, for example, to examine and to allow for variations in the supply function are what throws it very far off Its ability to predict interest rates that might emerge from money demand/money supply interactions is, on the other hand, what gave it a little better track record than we had judgmentally last year Judgmentally last year, in some sense, we didn't have it right; we weren't able to say interest rates would go up fast enough or down fast enough Therefore, in determining the path, we were unable to set borrowings high enough or low enough to begin with and, if we began to get off, we didn't make adjustments fast enough But I do believe it would have an effect on the supply function   Well, as a matter of tactics, I would be more inclined to start with adjusting the nonborrowed path because you can undo that more easily if it turns out, as it may, that you've made a wrong adjustment and want to undo it When you are really rather more certain that you want to force interest rates up or down faster than they are going, then it strikes me, again, as a matter of tactics that it's "better" in some sense to use the discount rate because it is a more forthright, clear announcement to the market But in periods when you are a little more uncertain, which will probably be a large proportion of the periods, then it seems to me that adjusting the nonborrowed path, pretending you are more on total reserves, is a reasonable approach for putting pressure on market rates that you may want to undo later if it turned out to have been a wrong thing to do   Well, that's a difficult question--   --to respond to, President Balles, because with hindsight I might not have adopted the paths the Committee adopted   Well, we've always known from work we had done before with the model, and this is specifically in this study, that if  -24-    2/2-3/81  you put yourself in a contemporaneous reserve accounting world--if you had forgotten, it's almost impossible with lagged reserve accounting-- if you were really aiming for total reserves and total reserves were running, say, $200 million stronger [than desired], it's not sufficient to lower nonborrowed reserves by $200 million because borrowing would go up You'd have to lower nonborrowed reserves by $400 or $500 or $600 million so that the increase in borrowing is less; so if borrowing then goes up $400 million, you've got your $200 million effect on total reserves You have to do a lot more in some technical sense than you were suggesting that we were doing at times last year All our study suggested to me was that if we want more short-run control, we ought to do more of whatever we were doing last year Now, that doesn't say how much more Other evidence would suggest one heck of a lot more to hit that total reserve target Of course, our other evidence was that you shouldn't bother hitting that total reserve target because it's going to give you more disturbing interest rate variations than are worth whatever good you do for the economy   Oh, no   That's right; they are reinforcing   Well, it is widespread throughout the member banking system Very little of it, of course--the way we counted it, it couldn't be very much--is for nonmember banks It seems to have developed in the first week of November just before they actually had to hold reserves under the new procedures; and it has been sustained and actually was rising on a monthly average basis through January So, in terms of correlations, it relates to the new Monetary Control Act Why it just didn't disappear after four or five weeks, we don't  -25-    2/2-3/81  have an answer for because we can't locate it at any particular set of banks; it is pretty generally dispersed   I really think it's the switchover to the new accounting that is somehow screwing up their own internal bookkeeping procedures   Yes, but it should have worn down by now   Well, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by smoothing techniques, President Winn  -26-    2/2-3/81   Well, after the fact, we did try to see what would have happened to GNP if we held the money supply path constant-- that is, if one wanted to eliminate the M1 fluctuation In that work we did that partly through the quarterly model But an implication of the work Mr Tinsley did on the monthly money market models was that we would have had a lot more federal funds rate fluctuation So, we concluded that there was no way, given what was going on in the economy, that we could have smoothed the money supply without desmoothing--if that's a word--the federal funds rate If you wanted to smooth the federal funds rate, it wasn't absolutely clear that on average you would have gotten more [money] supply fluctuations There was probably a little more, but that didn't show up as strikingly   Well, yes If you wanted to smooth the funds rate, you would have had rather different intervention points You would have had a different funds rate limit   Better than the preceding housing study?   In the work that Dave did, using the models, we got about as good a result with the funds target as we did with the nonborrowed reserves target in terms of short-run precision However, if you assume structural changes in reserve requirements that would eliminate multiplier problems, I think we would get better results  -27-    2/2-3/81  either with [nonborrowed or] total reserves on the Board's monthly model than we do with the funds rate just because of the elimination of that multiplier problem But, in general, we get roughly the same result with the funds rate as with nonborrowed reserves   Well, we certainly would have agreed with that if we could have found convincing evidence that long rates were on average higher because of fluctuations induced in short rates--that is, if the yield curve involved a wider spread of long rates relative to short rates Of course, the yield curve was downward sloping much of the time, so in that sense the spread was narrower, and we couldn't really find much evidence of that So, that led us to think that the procedure itself is not a factor making long rates higher than they would otherwise be There were the fluctuations, and we can't answer the question on that Monetary policy, of course, in the sense that the money targets did give that constraint [unintelligible], and that isn't exactly what we were investigating I would agree, of course, that the money target was relatively low, so that did give us higher short and long rates and the constraints from that But my memory is that we didn't find evidence that the fluctuations endemic to the procedures were making for higher long rates relative to short rates   We did not find a way, really, of investigating that I don't think there's evidence for or against that proposition I would say the evidence does suggest that transactions costs have gone up So, in some sense, if you go to that point, a new issue is slightly more expensive even though the whole yield curve may not show it We did find that bid/ask spreads were higher; I don't know who is bearing that [cost] ultimately, whether it's the borrower or the lender But there was evidence that transactions costs went up   Well, in the housing market there would seem to be evidence--again it was a continuation of a past trend--of [lenders] trying to put all the risk on the borrower, which tends in effect to raise rates When rates go down, they don't want to incur the bigger cost of getting out of that higher rate commitment, so they try to [lend] at the higher rate, and that sort of thing But whether that had to do with our procedure or was just a response to the cyclical volatility of rates and the greater rate of inflation expected and the fears that that induced is somewhat open to question   It's a bit higher; we assumed essentially that the demand for mortgages is still pretty strong given the structure of the--   No   Well, also more particularly, given the decline in real GNP   It was not out of line with what normally happens   We might I'd have to think it through more carefully It's sort of like opening the discount window   I suppose it could buy some week-to-week interest rate stability at some cost in terms of the multiplier   I'd have to think it through; my instinct is that there might be But how big I'm not sure   Another factor to consider with respect to the spring is that we were literally stopped from raising the nonborrowed reserve path Total reserves were weak because there was no borrowing; and if we had created a substantial amount of excess reserves, the funds rate would have gone close to zero So, in some sense the lower limit of the funds rate range was a stopper there The Committee, of course, gradually lowered that limit, but that was an effective stopper And when you're lowering the nonborrowed [path], one of the advantages of lowering it in a sense, is that often it will require a Committee meeting That's because to lower [the nonborrowed path] means we're probably going to hit the upper limit of the funds rate range, and it might mean we'll get there faster and that will require a Committee meeting to get beyond it   It's only a stopper in a sense when we hit the upper limits or the lower limits Then you'd have to have a Committee meeting  -44-    2/2-3/81   Yes, it would have a market effect Well, very few banks are borrowing at the surcharge now   Do you mean the summary or the rest of it?   Well, I would view the rest of these as virtually final, but semi-final drafts I would like--and I think also the authors would like--one more opportunity to review them carefully for technical problems   Oh, yes   Mr Chairman, on publication I should mention one thing The summary memo, if we put that out, has a list of the staff studies So, if it's put out with the list of staff studies, people will write in and ask for them   No, only indirectly At the end we suggested that to the degree the Committee thinks the federal funds rate target has any validity, it means narrower bands Of course, I ought to say that all the model work [assumes] unconstrained interest rates With unconstrained interest rates, as President Balles mentioned, their model gives a little less interest rate volatility than ours does   Well, I was trying to think that through I think that would require yet another one of our studies of these various proposals   I do think it results in the problem of delaying reaction into the third or fourth week [with the banks thinking] maybe the Fed will come and save them finally But I would have to think through whether that is not reproducing, in effect, a two-week lag or something like that We would just have to analyze that carefully   Well, one week earlier   It's one week because of the way we operate That is, we don't wait If deposits are running high and borrowing has to be high for that four- or five-week period, we immediately put that in So, it's only if it happens the very next week instead of waiting two weeks when the required reserves are technically higher [that we] wait until the deposits are higher in that week So the effective lag is really cut down from two weeks to one week by the way we operate   There is an offset to that, I think That's in the intermediate run, as I was trying to say earlier We might get a little less variability because the process might start a bit sooner In the very first week banks extinguish some deposits instead of borrowing all the money so there is a little less interest rate [effect] than if we had to wait until the second week or the third week But in the very short run we might get more up and down jiggles because by our mechanism now we sort of eliminate those by estimating the demand for borrowing and spreading it over the weeks [of the reserve adjustment period]; so we're accommodative to the up and down jiggles in deposits We will know those up and down jiggles in deposits under contemporaneous reserves and thus we're likely to get more up and down jiggles of the funds rate with contemporaneous reserve accounting, I believe   Well, they may be   Well, I think we were essentially on a variety of targets, but the way to describe them all was "the tone and feel of the market"   Yes, and we'd smooth that out It was less jiggling in some sense because the Desk was tending to offset the jiggling   Mr Chairman, I think I should add--because it comes out of President Black's comments--that we have a heck of a time predicting the demand for money But we have [difficulty]--and that was one of the results of the research--predicting the supply factors that are affecting what money is going to be, such as deposit mix, demand for borrowing, and things like that, given interest rates and GNP and money Contemporaneous reserve accounting might strengthen that linkage but there are a lot of other factors that would argue for permitting the borrowing to do some of the work, which would tend to offset the misestimates on deposit mix and things like that So, I wouldn't think that going to contemporaneous reserve accounting would automatically mean we're going to be better off because we can chase borrowing up and down A certain amount of borrowing seems necessary to offset our own multiplier misses, so to speak   The Board has already announced it is thinking tentatively about doing it by September of this year  -69-    2/2-3/81   We've had several on this subject of carry- forwards and carry-backs   Do you mean the carry-forward and carry-back?   But we could put all this together again, and we certainly would, prior to further discussion by the Board That would be the intention, I assume  -70-    2/2-3/81   We have never been able to convince ourselves on that It's a fine point as to whether widening those offsets the advantages of going to contemporaneous accounting, if you think the advantage is better control of the money supply in the short run CRR does tend to make our multiplier a little less loose, clearly   That's right [The announcement of the Board's tentative posture] had a slightly positive cast rather than a negative cast in it   I think Mr Davis has   Well, with regard to a predictable relation between money and GNP, the velocity of M2 has shown very little change in the last couple of years But [the problem] gets very hard when one puts oneself in another world of controlling [M2] Then, what are the relationships? In the present world in which we live, the interest rates that are available on the instruments in M2 move very easily with the market They have been designed that way When you start controlling M2 and market interest rates go up, the [depository] institutions raise their interest rates; In my mind--and I may be wrong--if we really actively control M2, I fear that we'll get much more interest rate volatility out of that than one might think When you are looking at a world where we weren't trying to do that, M2 sort of goes along with the more moderate movements in interest rates relative to GNP that we were having So I think it's much more complicated than just looking at the past history of these relationships I'm probably not being clear, but--   May I just make one final point, Frank? I don't want to bore the Committee, but what I'm trying to say is that M2 in 1980 didn't vary quite as much as M1 did But [what would have happened] if we had been trying to keep M2 from doing what it was doing? Then we would have had, I think, even more interest rate variability because the market would have had an easier job working to offset [our actions] because the [depository] institutions could change the interest rates on the deposits in that aggregate If we had worked policy your way, that might have generated a lot more interest rate variability and, for all I know, a lot more money variability The reason is that to reduce M2 growth sufficiently we would have been putting most of our pressure on demand deposits because institutions would have been raising their interest rates to get more of the other deposits [in M2]   Well, for either one, I think that's the issue that it tends to bring up   Yes   That's what led me to try to put controlling M2 in those terms because that might be shifting whatever variability we had in M2 somewhere else, so to speak It would be in demand [deposits] then, with possibly even more variability in M1 and, as a result, even more variability in interest rates than we are observing   I think that's right  SPEAKER(?) For the long term?   Back to the midpoints of the long-term ranges   That's right Looking at the monthly money market model simulations, that was kind of a tradeoff If you tried to get back faster than that, the assurance of hitting your long-run target wasn't all that much greater [and that needed to be weighed against] the probable increase in money market rate volatility   I'd say that the first thing had to do with the Committee's targeting procedure The second had to do with the success of hitting it, which wasn't all that great  -78-    2/2-3/81   The Committee targeted fine, but the aggregates didn't behave quite as targeted If they had, we probably would have had more interest rate volatility   Yes, there were some times when it might have been six months, but it was--   We ran [the model] a variety of ways If you run it holding money growth constant so there's no cycle, you tend to  -79-    2/2-3/81  get some cycles in interest rates That's possible But if you tend to hold interest rates constant, you might get some movement in money growth related to GNP But we didn't succeed in getting cycles in both, if my memory serves me   Which [conclusion]?   [There was a] sharp drop in money in the second quarter; the models would have projected a higher amount of money in that quarter--much more money--even with the weakness in GNP So we interpreted the sharp drop in money, even at the interest rates that developed, as reflecting a sharp drop in money demand at that point We weren't creating the money demand; that was the public's reaction to what interest rates [were doing] The San Francisco interpretation puts much less stress on the sharp drop in money demand and would stress instead that there was a temporary deviation in money supply in some sense because everyone was paying off loans And viewing loans as a supply, the amount of money dropped They wouldn't tend to interpret it as money demand But again, there was an exogenous factor, that credit control program, unrelated to our operating procedures The big variations were coming out of that And that's essentially the basis for saying that   I'm not sure I did ask the question If we held the nonborrowed path, however constructed, and put in more money, however that comes about, which gets more borrowing, would we ever get back to the path? I don't know whether you're asking that question   The answer to that is No, we don't get back to path We would have to lower the nonborrowed path   Well, again, that has to be answered somewhat indirectly Working through the money market model, which has explicit interest elasticities and demand for money and lags, if you want to hit that total reserves badly enough in a one-month period,  -80-    2/2-3/81  and you're running a couple of hundred million ahead on total reserves, meaning you're running ahead on money by whatever the multiple is--10 or something like that--then you've got to lower the nonborrowed reserves a heck of a lot more than $200 million if you want to get on path that week I've forgotten the exact numbers that I got out of this; I got them a year ago October when we started this and kept getting them lately That month you've got to lower them, say, $1 billion, because you get an offset in borrowing of $800 million or something like that, even under contemporaneous reserve accounting So you generate massive interest rate pressures Now, we don't have evidence that if you generate those massive interest rate pressures, you're going to start cycling money Our evidence is pretty clear that you'll get interest rate cycles or interest rate up and down movements, but not money cycles   Well, that's a technical question The lags are, on average, six or seven or eight months at the longest and [most of the effect is] done in about three or four months You have to start comparing the effects of this month's drop in interest rates given that [sort of lag] It takes most of its effect three or four months from now   Yes Well, it affected our deviation, I think That is, we were so far off a couple of times that it made our average deviation bigger than it otherwise would have been I don't remember exactly how the Committee targeted in those periods; I don't remember whether the goal in that period was to get back fast--   That's right And I just don't remember how it came out But the misses there certainly affected our average absolute deviation The year was very much affected by those two occurrences Another year may not be We might end up looking a lot better in another year because of that   That's right Yes, [it's an adjustment of] about 1-1/4 points for M-1A and 5 or 6 for M-1B   Just make that table for M-1A and M-1B?   It's very simple  -101-    2/2-3/81 -102-   It's the table, which should be in front of you, entitled "Long-run Targets on Alternative Bases" Probably the best thing to do is for me to go through it stage by stage The panel on the left-hand side says "Abstracting from shifts to ATS/NOW accounts" That gives the target ranges for 1980 for M-1A and M-1B that the Committee adopted in February of last year and reaffirmed in July There is a 1/2 point differential [between the ranges for M-1A and M-1B] The best way to conceive of it is that it reflects some higher trend growth in M-1B relative to M-1A and some small residual amount of shifting [to ATS/NOW accounts] we expected to occur at that time in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania; we were unable to [isolate the separate effects of those two developments] That's how that 1/2 point differential gets in there The second panel says "Reflecting shifts to ATS/NOW accounts in 1980" That means the shifts that occurred beyond whatever little residual we thought was left--[beyond] that 1/2 point As you can see, we divided those shifts up, assuming two-thirds came from demand deposits and one-third came from savings and other time accounts That would have lowered the M-1A target to 2-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent and would have raised the M- 1B target to 4-1/2 to 7 percent if the Committee had known in advance what those shifts would be and had stated its target that way  Now, it is those ranges to which it is more proper to compare the actual growth in M-1A and M-1B for the year As you can see, that was 5 percent and 7-1/4 percent, [respectively], roughly 1/4 point above the tops of those ranges Shifting back to the first panel, the adjusted numbers, one can look at that in another way One could say If I want to compare the behavior of M-1A and M-1B to their ranges, I can either adjust the ranges or I can adjust M-1A and M-1B In the first panel you can see that if you take the actual growth in M-1A of 5 percent and add 1-1/4 points to it to represent the demand deposits that were shifted out into ATS and NOW accounts, you get 6-1/4 percent; and if you take the actual growth of M-1B of 7-1/4 percent and subtract from it the 1/2 percentage point that represents the NOW accounts and ATS accounts that came in from savings deposits, you get an M-1B growth of 6-3/4 percent In both cases, you can see that growth is 1/4 point above the top of the range You can view the ranges and the growth rates in two different ways; [either way growth is] 1/4 point above   If we used one-half and one-half [instead of two-thirds and one-third], both the ranges and growth rates would be adjusted by those relevant amounts   That's right I'm not sure if the Chairman didn't say in some testimony recently--   Now, focusing for a second on the left-hand panel, line 1 there says "Target ranges for 1981 with a 1/2 point reduction" That simply is going down 1/2 point from the target ranges for 1980 Carrying on the 1/2 point differential by this time reflects whatever we felt was going on in 1980 and continues in 1981 Line 2 is a 1 point reduction, simply going down 1 point Then the next line says "Expected adjustment to target ranges to reflect actual shifts to NOW accounts in 1981" Of course, that reflects our expectation of the actual shifts at this moment Our estimate is that M-1A would go down 7-1/2 percentage points more to reflect the demand deposits going into NOW accounts and that M-1B would go up 2-1/2 points more to reflect the savings deposits or other assets going into NOW accounts That's on the present thought that there will be a sharp slowing in growth of these accounts beginning pretty much immediately and that the shift instead of being four-fifths from demand deposits and one-fifth from savings works its way down to two- thirds and one-third That averages out to about three-fourths, given the extent of the shift that occurred earlier in the year, though that could, of course, vary In any event, with that assumption, to get the adjusted ranges to reflect the actual shifts to ATS and NOW accounts, you have to take that 7-1/2 points off of the M-1A range, which gives you minus 4-1/2 percent to minus 2 percent And you have to add the 2-1/2 points to the M-1B range, which gives you 6 to 8-1/2 percent  Shifting over to the second panel and focusing on that "Expected adjusted line," the reason the minus 7-1/2 percent becomes minus 6-1/4 percent and the plus 2-1/2 percent becomes plus 2 percent is that we are carrying forward in the second panel the actual extent of shift that occurred in 1980 That is, if the Committee specified its target for M-lA as down 1/2 point from the adjusted range to 1-3/4 to 4-1/4 percent and its target for M-1B as down 1/2 point from the adjusted range to 4 to 6-1/2 percent, then it is carrying forward in those ranges the shifts that occurred in 1980--not the 1/2 point differential between M-1A and M-1B but what turned out ultimately to    2/2-3/81  be a 2-1/4 point differential That is being carried forward as if it were going to occur in 1981 Therefore, the expected adjustment you have to make is less In the case of M-1A it's less than 7-1/2 percent; it's 6-1/4 percent In the case of M-1B it's 2 percent Of course, if you add those in, as you can see in the bottom lines, you get exactly the same numbers in the right-hand panel and the left-hand panel   I'm sure the public will very easily grasp this!   Well, we don't have any evidence that that's what is happening   These are net shifts, so [a shift from an ATS to a NOW account] doesn't affect this Both ATS and NOW accounts are in other checkable deposits, so that doesn't lead to an increase in other checkable deposits   Yes, sure If it was an ATS account and we got the data from a bank that was reporting accurately, we added [it to] other checkable deposits   It's clear, I suppose, once there are a lot of NOW accounts, that to whatever extent people made use of a savings account before they are going to put their savings in a NOW account for a while instead So, eventually, we assume that this will be a much more complicated animal to evaluate; it's going to move not just as a transaction account but as something that's a mix between a transaction and a savings account   We asked the banks early in January and we had asked them at one point last year--I forget exactly when The results last year were not inconsistent with the two-thirds/one-third proportions that we had derived from past experience But it couldn't be proved one way or the other   Yes, that's the monthly average [for January] Effectively, it's $20 billion going in from then, so it's almost half   I'm not sure I follow your averaging   I don't think it's a matter of "must," but essentially it's because last year growth in M2 was almost 1 percentage point above the target of 6 to 9 percent We don't have much evidence of significance in the past two years that velocity of M2 rises or falls much What seems to be developing is that, because of institutional changes, we now have assets in M2 on which the rates offered by institutions vary with market rates So, the spreads between the active part of those assets and market rates don't open up to the extent they used to and we don't get large shifts in and out of those deposits to the extent we used to Therefore, it doesn't seem unreasonable to think that we wouldn't get much change in the velocity of M2 this year In fact, we have assumed about a 1 percentage point increase in velocity because we have a GNP projection of 9-1/2 percent for the year and alternative I assumes an M2 growth of about 8-1/2 percent So, in our projection of what is consistent with M-1A and M- 1B we are allowing for about a 1 percentage point increase in the velocity of M2 Another factor to consider, of course, if you look at it from the credit side and not from the side of the public's demand for assets, is that M2 except for the large CDs that are in M3 is essentially institutional credit And given our estimates of the amount of mortgages and consumer loans and so forth that have to be financed at banks, we think banks are going to have to bid for a certain amount of funds to meet those demands and to maintain their place in the market So, those are the factors that get us to this estimate, which is higher than the Committee's tentative range adopted in July I would say also that at midyear we were assuming that M2 growth was going to be high in the Committee's range for 1980 or even [above it] We never expected it to be down toward the midpoint of that 6 to 9 percent range for 1980 Those are essentially the reasons   I thought it was only one or two tenths   It's page 5, but we don't have the adjusted figure for M-1A in there   I don't have them with me but I can get them I'll get them and report   I don't remember what happened a year ago on that That may be the case It certainly was the case in July that we were saying [M2 and M3 growth] would be a little higher than the Committee expected I don't remember [the circumstances last] January   Well, if you look specifically at the flow-of- funds data, it might come out to something like 88 percent We've squeezed it down to 8-1/2 percent rather than up to 9 percent   On the M1s it's 2-1/2 points; on M2 I don't know the base drift We don't really have that   That's what I was just figuring out Yes, it comes out that the rates of growth are exactly equal to the upper ends of the ranges   I do not have a good guess on that In the old days, one would have said the broader aggregate But now institutions can compete actively in either aggregate We have money market funds in M2 as well as M3 And we have money market certificates in M2   That's right And in both aggregates there are [instruments] that institutions can offer aggressively or less aggressively depending on conditions Equally likely would be my answer; I can't tell which   Mr Chairman, I don't know whether it's helpful but, in answer to Governor Teeters's question, we looked back at last year The Committee essentially took what the staff had down for M2 and M3 It wasn't until midyear that the staff said the specifications were off   Yes, they are on page 5 I can read the numbers as we have them adjusted for the so-called shifts For M-1A for 1978, we have 78; for 1979, 65; and for 1980, 62 For M-1B, we have 80 for 1978; 69 for 1979; and 67 for 1980 Essentially for 1979 that reflects the shifts to ATS accounts and for 1978 some rough and ready adjustment for a sense of differences in trend of those two   Well, it's a bit obscure as to whether one should or shouldn't, so I wouldn't make too much of that   It's much more clear in '79 and '80   Yes   I ought to point out that that's the one range that was hit last year   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, they have a certain reality in that--   I won't give you my wife's comments on that!   That's right The actual numbers are charted and are given in parentheses in the detailed tables on page 10 of the Bluebook   That's right, assumptions about the amount of shifts and the percentage of shifts The assumptions are that in February the amount of shift will be something on the order of $1-1/2 billion and in March about $750 million and that the percentage out of demand deposits is something like 70 or 75 percent  151-    2/2-3/81   Those are differences in [end] points I think within the ranges we'd expect it to end somewhat differently We didn't really center these exactly; that is, in "A" the funds rate is already at 17 or 17-1/2 percent and could go down a bit from there, although we are a little skeptical about that In "B" it looks to us as if it could go up a bit, and in "C" we think it could go up much more toward the top of that range So, those are just notional and they weren't precisely centered   In essence what we're saying is that we'll have a very substantial velocity [increase] in the first quarter on average and that it looks as if that would require pressure on rates   Well, the only answer to that--it may not be convincing--is that there's a lot of money that was in effect taken out of the economy in December, so there's some sense that you have to put that back on a month-by-month basis But [what is put back] doesn't give us very much on a quarterly average, or as much as it seems, because so much had been taken out in December   That's because what I did with alternative C, Governor Partee, is to say that this is what the Committee adopted last time from December-to-March, a 4-1/4 percent rate for M-1A   It's an option that says Forget about the December shortfall and then just go ahead with that target The base fell rather radically What alternative C in essence does is to forget about that sharp drop in the base The other two, in effect, make up for the drop in the base, though not entirely because they're based on the midquarter But they get you back to the midpoint of the longer-run range you adopted Alternative C was just taking literally the percentage increase, forgetting about the December shortfall and asking Where does that leave you?   Yes   Well, alternative A gets to the midpoint of the ranges you've adopted We constructed alternative B to be at the midpoint of a tighter [set of ranges], and alternative C had the rationale that I mentioned But the Committee's decision today doesn't have to be based on those rationales, of course; it could be based on an idea that you might want to be short or not   They had divergent rationales They weren't done in the usual way where here's a midpoint--   That's right   Well, when the estimates turn out to be wrong, as they did of course after December, some of the degree of error ought to be compensated for by multiplier adjustments so to speak That is, if there is a lot more money coming from savings accounts into NOW accounts, which have higher reserve requirements, we should be adjusting the path for that so that we don't get inadvertent tightening and vice-versa   Well, they're all relatively low Those numbers are in the table on page 10 on the bottom line   That would be a better way to look at it   "A" got back to the midpoint within 3 months   Yes, I have heard of that I don't believe we have noticed any substantial increase or change in the other liabilities category, but I haven't inspected that personally We have not found any real evidence of something like that going on But [money supply] behavior in the last two weeks of December and the first week of January was rather odd; my inclination has been to throw those three weeks out and start [comparing] recent weeks of January  -158-    2/2-3/81  with where we were because they did drop sharply and then rose sharply There was a very big increase in M-1A after adjustments   No, I just can't answer that directly We didn't find anything, but there is this peculiarity of the deposit data that we think is just a bad seasonal But we have to look elsewhere   Oh, don't ask   That's explained in some footnote, which I think is accurate It has to do with where the month of December ended up relative to the quarterly average We constructed the path going from the quarterly average to March, but December's numbers for M-1A and M-1B were divergent relative to where they were on the quarterly average   There we just started out in December and went ahead with the normal divergence between M-1A and M-1B   Because we--  SPEAKER(?) Don't ask   I would gladly explain it to you after the meeting   I think that's what we have, but that's somewhat an artifact of how the averages for the weeks with lagged reserve accounting worked out Over the next 2 months it's lower   There would be a decline I don't have the exact number at hand   No, that's a real reserve figure Reserves decline 3 percent allegedly under alternative C, assuming all the shifts are as we estimated I don't think what happens to reserves, of course, is as important as what happens to the money That takes account of lagged reserve accounting, which can make for a certain artificiality   We suggest for alternative B something like $15 billion, which turns out to be very close to where borrowing is running this week   Borrowing in the week of January 28 was $18 billion In the week of January 21, it was $14 billion; and in the week of the 14th, it was $13 billion It has been rising recently and the funds rate has been dropping The funds rate dropped off this week   And the funds rate is about 17-1/2 percent So, we'd say $15 billion or perhaps a little less We're somewhat uncertain   Well, it looked as if there was a sharp drop in the demand for borrowing in December So, borrowing was low and the funds rate was a lot higher than it is now--19 to 20 percent That's what we generally thought was an oddity More recently it appeared that what one might have thought of as "normal" relationships were being reestablished But they're being reestablished with borrowing going up and the funds rate dropping This really reflects the fact that we don't think what we had in early January reflects, in essence, banks' demand for borrowing at the funds rate we've projected here, which in fact under alternative B--assuming the economy doesn't collapse under foot--is a somewhat higher funds rate than we now have If the Committee believes that the funds rate should be lower either way, then I would certainly suggest to the Committee that it take a lower borrowing level   In "A" we had it closer to what it had been recently, more like $1-1/4 billion   Given recent experience, if borrowing in the last two weeks is anywhere near what bank demands for borrowing are, that would suggest that $1-1/4 billion would perhaps lead to a drop in the funds rate--one can't be all that certain--from around the current level We had made that more consistent with "A," where we thought the odds on a drop in interest rates were greater but not with "B," where we thought the odds were less that interest rates would drop   If we held the level of borrowing, all the studies suggest we would get further off path than if we varied it   Last week it was higher; it was $17 to $18 billion   They've generally been running relatively high I don't know how they're going to come out this week   That's the range of uncertainty If you believe the borrowing level of early December and early January, you might think there will be an increase If you believe the borrowing level of very recent weeks, you might think there will be a decline   Yes, we generally put that in the Bluebook each time    Well, Mr Chairman, the monetary aggregates have shown diverse trends since the last Committee meeting The narrow monetary aggregates, M1-A and M1-B, viewed after abstracting    2/24/81  from shifts to NOW accounts, of course, have been much [lower] than we had anticipated But making the best estimate we can of the distribution of [those shifts], they appear to be from out of demand deposits and out of other deposits It looks as if both M1 measures-- really it's best to consider them both together--are doing the same thing; they are running substantially below the path that the Committee set As you recall, that path called for a rate of growth in the M1 measures of roughly 5-1/2 percent So far as we can tell, from December to March--with a projection for March that indicates a distinct rise in the rate of growth, so if March turns out to be weaker than the 6 percent or so we're projecting we'd be even further below the path--we'd have growth of M1-A at about a 2-1/2 percent rate and growth of M1-B at a 3 percent rate From December to date, they're both showing no growth So, this growth we're showing from December to March really is a projection of growth in the last half of February and the month of March  On the other hand, while the narrow aggregates are weak relative to the path the Committee set, the broader aggregates are generally strong At the time of the Committee meeting, the Committee set a path for growth in M2 at around 8 percent at an annual rate from December to March In January and February the growth in M2 is very close to 8 percent and we're projecting a March rate of growth, given the strength we've observed particularly in money market funds so far in February, of close to 10 percent So, if March turned out to be 10 percent or even lower--any number down to 8-1/2 percent or so--we'd be somewhat over the December-to-March path on M2 Our actual projection for December to March is 8-3/4 percent as against that 8 percent path To date the growth is right at about 8 percent Meanwhile, although the Committee didn't officially set a path over the December-to-March period for M3, it probably should be observed that growth in M3 has been quite strong In January, M3 grew at about a 13 percent annual rate And given the data we have thus far in December--   I mean February, sorry--growth is at around a 10-1/2 percent annual rate So in a sense M3 is growing well above its long-run path Meanwhile, on an average basis, bank credit in January was quite strong, but the fragmentary data we have for the large banks suggest a substantial slowing in that growth in February, probably an extension of the slowing that might have been developing over the course of January That's the report on the aggregates, Mr Chairman  I don't know whether Mr Sternlight wants to report further on interest rate developments but, given the weakness in the narrow aggregates in particular, there has been a drop in required reserves relative to the original path In consequence, the implied borrowing has dropped from about the $13 billion that was used in constructing the path originally to something on the order of $770 million in the current and next statement weeks, and that has been accompanied by a sharp drop in money market rates, and indeed in the funds rate to below 15 percent recently Given our projection of the aggregates, it would appear that borrowing after the next two weeks would rise back up to somewhere between $900 million and $1 billion So even if this $770 million worked out--and it hasn't been working out this week--the money market would be wrenched by a turnaround in the level of    2/24/81  borrowing back up to the $900 million to $1 billion range And, of course, it would be even higher if it turns out that we're underprojecting the aggregates, as is possible, given the GNP outlook that Jim just mentioned   Mr Chairman, I think it would helpful to the Committee, in pointing to the oddity of this M1 behavior, to note that at the time the path was set at the last meeting we expected--and the Committee adopted a target of--growth QI-over-QIV of around 2-3/4 percent in M1-B, abstracting from all those shifts Given the pattern we have thus far in the month and expecting March growth of 6-3/4 percent, abstracting from shifts, we would end up with a rate of growth quarter-over-quarter of 05 percent, effectively zero Meanwhile, it looks as if nominal GNP is a bit higher So we're staring at a velocity here of M1-B of 14 or 15 percent at an annual rate Granted that the staff in its brilliance expected a downward demand shift, we didn't expect anything like this This would be a very unusual result should it stand up, suggesting that something might give here, either the M1 or maybe nominal GNP It's not clear   Well, I was talking to Jim in the hall, and my memory is that in early '79--I'm not sure of the timing--when ATS accounts were introduced, we got more of an effect on demand deposits than we thought a priori we would get Our rationale at that point was that this made people begin to think about their whole cash management process and that they might have switched not only into ATS accounts but decided that they had surplus cash in general and put money in money market funds at the time That's similar to what is going on now   The market would be somewhat tighter than it would otherwise be, but I'm not so sure it would be much easier or tighter than in fact it is now; borrowing has been running about $11 billion That's literally where we are   It would be about $150 million a couple of weeks from now and in the current two-week period it would be close to $350 million because we would in effect be leaving borrowings--   --at the $11 billion level, as they were in the first two weeks following the Committee meeting, instead of having them drop to around the $770 million, which would require it to average out at $950 million, if you know what I mean   Excess reserves have been running a little lower than in the previous three or four months In the first week of this period, they dropped to--   The question, Peter, is What has happened to excess reserves since the Committee meeting?    We also suggest the possibility of changing the $8 billion to $5 billion   It would give the Committee more flexibility in decisionmaking   Mr Chairman, the total position, which is in the document in the footnote, is $8 billion That in some sense governs the total open position, and we would put that up in the text  -7-    3/31/81  The informal limits on the individual currencies we would not put in the directive   We didn't assume the Committee needed permission   But it's conceivable, if the Committee wished, that it could reduce the yen limit and raise the [mark or the other currencies limit] It's not impossible to substitute among those things   That is exactly what was done after the February 24th call The borrowing level in the last 2 weeks of the first 4 weeks of the 8-week interval--I don't know what it was in the 3rd week, but it was very low in the 4th week--would have been zero It was understood after that call that half the adjustment would be made to keep it at around $1 billion And in the next 4-week period, we reverted to the original path, which itself implied borrowing of around $1 or $11 billion at that time I thought that was made clear at the time   Well, if we had made the same adjustment downward in the path that we made in that two weeks, it would have implied borrowing rising to a considerable amount   Yes, because in effect the Committee is still under its path that it adopted--   --at the last meeting   Our interpretation of that amendment was that it applied to the first 4-week interval The second 4-week interval was leading to borrowing that seemed likely to bring the federal funds rate back up to the 15 percent lower limit, so that no further adjustments were necessary one way or the other to bring to the Committee's attention   They were a little under $900 million, I think   Well, that's right Total reserves have been running well below   Mr Chairman, I'm sorry, but I'm quite sure that it was pointed out to the Committee at the time that one of the reasons for making the adjustment to keep borrowing at $1 billion was that looking ahead to the next 4-week interval, it was apparent at the time of the February 24 call that, unless something weird happened, borrowing--given an adherence to the nonborrowed path--would move up   Well, it moved up I don't know what the average is going to end up being; it will be something like $900 million or maybe a little higher   I'd say we have targeted on the nonborrowed path; we had to in the last four weeks We adjusted the nonborrowed path for the first four weeks downward in order to keep borrowing in line with how it appeared to be evolving That's how I would put it   The reason borrowing dropped below the $1 billion we thought it would be at the time of the February 24th [telephone] meeting and [the assumption of] $1 billion we set for the next two weeks was that in the next four weeks required reserves turned out to be weaker than was thought at that time So, borrowing dropped and the funds rate dropped If required reserves had been what we expected at the time of the conference call, borrowing would have stayed at about $1 billion In the event, borrowing has come back up in the last couple of weeks   I'm trying to say we're adhering to the nonborrowed path and borrowing is fluctuating   I'm not sure what would have happened if the Committee hadn't met on February 24th and said it was all right to lower the nonborrowed path for the last two weeks of the first four- week period   The funds rate would have dropped to, say, 2 or 3 percent in that two-week period   And then looking at the projections of deposits and required reserves, our numbers would have suggested that adhering to the nonborrowed path going into the next four-week period would have brought the funds rate back up to 13 or 14 percent at that time, because borrowing at the time of that February 24th meeting was projected at $937 million precisely So, if the adjustment hadn't been made and we had just followed the nonborrowed path constructed for the first four weeks [in the] second four weeks, funds would have dropped to around 2 percent and then moved back up to on the order of 14 percent What the Committee's action effectively did was to stop that drop down to around 2 percent   Oh, yes Well, I was assuming that all through that period normal procedures would have meant raising nonborrowed reserves even further And, of course, I would just assume that that was forestalled by the Committee's action   Well, I'm sorry I'm not misunderstanding your question, Jerry, [but] I can't put the question in that framework The way my mind works on this, there's something I'm missing on that That path in the last two weeks was simply to keep borrowing at $11 billion for a two-week period   Oh, no I'm sorry, there must have been something lacking in our communication with the Committee at that time, then No, that was not--   The question would have arisen as we looked at it, going into the next four-week period Holding the path that we had originally constructed after the Committee meeting, if it looked as if borrowing was going to have to be very low again, then the policy decision for the Committee would have arisen   It would have been six at that time   Oh, absolutely Sure, we would have been required to raise it the first four weeks   We didn't do that in either the first four or the second four weeks   I hope it's clear I tried to explain in the Bluebook that the sharp drop in nonborrowed reserves in February, when total reserves also declined about the same amount, reflected the adjustment made in lowering the path below where it had originally been set And the rise then in March kind of offsets that, because we  -21-    3/31/81  lowered it and kept the March levels So, we get a bigger increase in March The two months together are about right, so to speak   Yes, that's right   Statement--see Appendix]   Since I don't know the method of calculation used by your staff, I certainly can't do much reassuring The percentages we took were based on the surveys from banks We asked what percent came from demand deposits and what came from other accounts We got similar percentages out of the Michigan survey of consumer attitudes For the S&Ls we took the percentages that the Home Loan Bank people told us came out of their own accounts versus what came from other institutions The amount that came from other institutions we divided up in the same way as on the banks' reports and we rounded a little We came to 80 percent for the first month and then 75 percent for the next two months I'm not sure of the exact number, but I think it probably came out at something like 76 or 77 percent Probably the best thing to do is for us simply to send to the Committee a note on the exact calculation method we used, and then  -24-    3/31/81  it would be verifiable against how other people might like to view exactly the same data   Well, I'm not certain of that, President Balles I know that we tried to make allowance for the fact that the sample we used was wrong--well, not wrong, but it had more large banks relative to small banks than there are in the nation as a whole So, therefore, we tried to weight it so that we gave more weight to small banks [in the survey], in line with their role in the nation as a whole We didn't simply average it, so to speak, which would have resulted in a higher number because the sample had fewer small banks relative to large banks than is true nationally Now, that could be a difference I don't know whether, in fact, it is   Well, but we changed that assumption   We have postponed that two-thirds because the latest data coming in suggest that [proportion from demand deposits] remains very high, and we have stayed with the same [assumption]   Yes, that's right But we haven't For sure we would do it around midyear But whether we would want to do it before then--   We will be putting out the revised seasonals in May They are delayed this year because last year was so exceptional that we didn't feel we could run an ordinary X-11 and we were trying to do some modeling to abstract from the credit control program, which is a one-time event But as a temporary ad hoc measure, we were thinking that what we should do is to take 80 percent or 75 percent, whatever the number is, of the other checkable deposit increase above trend in 1981 and put it back into demand deposits when we seasonally adjust So we would not be adding it in unadjusted; and that's what the market is focusing on I asked the fellows back in January, right after the first week was so big, to keep track of a series on that to see what difference it made And as you suggest, it doesn't make a substantial amount of difference in January, February, and March The growth rate in January, as we do it now, was 29 percent; if we had thrown the demand deposits back in, it would have been 20 percent This would be partially but not entirely offset in February; where we have now a -23 percent, it would have been zero And then in March, it doesn't happen to make any difference You are quite right that when the seasonal factors get large in April, May, and June, it makes more of a difference On our current estimates of the distribution of OCDs between savings and demand, it would lower the growth rate for April, and I'm going to round, by 2-1/2 percentage points The growth rate adjusted "properly" would be lowered by about 2-1/2 percentage points In May it would be raised by 3-1/2 percentage points and for June it would be lowered by 2-1/2 percentage points So, they're not quite offsetting, but that would be the relationship We have presented the targets as we're [making these calculations] now If we had presented them in these other terms, instead of 6 percent, let's say, for April, May, and June, we would have presented under alternative B something like 3-1/2, 9-1/2, and 3-1/2 percent April would have been low, May high, and June low But we are presenting them on something like a straight 6 percent if you take alternative B And as long as we measure against the target in a way consistent with  -27-    3/31/81  how the target is set, I don't think we have troubles We don't intend to measure it in an inconsistent way   The growth would be--   Well, the growth would be somewhat smaller, the way it works out on these figures The growth, by the way, from January to June evens out entirely   The numbers I gave add up to 16-1/2 percent the other way and to a little under 18 percent the way we are doing it currently   Well, that's right Also, we think the seasonal is going to change in any [event] And that isn't done yet   Oh, that's right Given the size of the shifts, we should But this is very ad hoc We don't know because we don't know how the OCD series is going to behave once [the shifts have] happened This is just putting back into demand deposits what was shifted out But once it is shifted out, combined with some savings deposits, it bears interest Given that interest payments are made, we don't know that the seasonal behavior is going to be the same   Well, I think [that's true of] the shift But otherwise I doubt it When interest rates fall, I don't know what is going to happen to these accounts Their behavior is going to be very different, I'm convinced, than demand deposits We might be able to get the cyclical movement out, but it's going to be something of a problem But we intend in May to get this all corrected As of the moment, we are operating in this way And I don't think the Committee is being misled as long as we set the target and measure against it in a consistent way   Let me get the figure Here it is For the week of the 18th, it's only about $500 million and we're projecting $600 million for the week of the 25th Our pattern had been that big increases occurred in the first couple of weeks and then they slowed down in the last couple of weeks of the month In the early part of this month, increases had been about $2 billion I would assume from here on out--or early next month--that the increases might be more in the $1 to $1-1/2 billion range and then come down again We are at a higher rate of growth than we expected   Last year?   6 percent   That's our estimate That's from March to June From February to June it's 2 percentage points different   That's right   I probably should say something There are any number of ways one could set this range One is to project what interest rate level the staff thinks is consistent with these aggregate targets and set a range of plus or minus 2 to 3 percentage points around that That would again be different than taking the current range, because we don't think the current range is particularly consistent except for "A" We have done that in the past under previous kinds of operating procedures I have felt reluctant in general to make the range substantially different, even though our staff forecast might be substantially different in a sense, from where the Committee had been So, what these ranges really represent is some skewing of the present Committee range; they are skewed to allow for where we think the funds rate will be, but there is more room on top because our projection is that, if anything, rates will go higher than where it appears the rate will start off and not that they will go lower So, they're in some sense judgmental in that respect, trying to distend the existing range to make allowance for how we think the funds rate comes out of the analysis  -42-    3/31/81   Well, it depends There's no flaw in the logic of the argument, clearly But the staff expectation of "B"--what we presented--is a borrowing level of $1-1/2 billion If the Committee chose that borrowing level, I believe that the funds rate probably would be above 15 percent and maybe closer to 16 percent, although these relationships are loose In that case, the range around that wouldn't be 11 to 17 percent; it would be quite a different range if that was where you wanted to start and you wanted to allow variation around that If you wanted to start at 14 percent as you were suggesting and allow variation around that, then I don't think the borrowing level we specified for alternative B is consistent with that approach   Yes, 8-1/2   Yes Last week we revised down the [most recent] weeks in March   Yes, M2 is around 17   I think "or somewhat lower"   Well, we had language about interest rates-- that you were not forcing them down  -48-    3/31/81   There was such language I'd have to look it up, but there was such language   Well, in the last three weeks, which is easy to [calculate], they were almost $800 million   But before that, they were in a range of $11 to $17 billion in that one exceptional week   Oh, yes In some sense, for this four-week period that is ending, we are aiming at an average level of borrowing somewhere on the order of $900 million We're aiming this week at $12 billion because in the earlier weeks borrowing had dropped well below that $900 million So, it's coming up this week   To the bottom end of the range   That's right And "B" to the middle   [Unintelligible]  -49-    3/31/81   Well, the equivalent quarterly growth rate is 57 percent for M-1B over the 6 [months]   Well, yes, quarter-over-quarter   In terms of the level of borrowing?   Yes We had a rather high level of borrowing because we were assuming considerably higher interest rates than I think the Chairman or the specifications are either explicitly or implicitly assuming So there would be a difference   Governor Partee, I would mention that we really only know half of March   Yes, we're aiming at that, but it is running stronger We're aiming at $116 billion That's the point [target]  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] decimal point   Mr Chairman, may I add on to that? I don't know what the funds rate will be with that borrowing We had borrowing of $1145 billion in the week of [February] 18th and the funds rate was 1581 percent The preceding week borrowing was $11 billion and the funds rate was 1651 percent And in the more recent week of March 4th, we had a borrowing level of $13 billion and the funds rate was 15-3/4 percent All this [suggests] that we can't be very certain where we're going to come out on this But I would assume it's somewhere above 15 percent, which would be above the existing--   Yes   Yes I think from this day it would be above 15 percent, but I can't be absolutely certain    Well, it's about 02 off   3-1/2 to 6 percent   But that's not what it would be quarter--   With the wrong seasonal   It started at 77-1/2 percent out of demand deposits, then 72-1/2 and 72-1/2 percent Now we're estimating 70 percent for April, but we don't have any real data yet for April   Also, we did a cross-sectional analysis of 9,000 commercial banks through an econometric technique And we're planning to--    4/28/81   I don't have it   We have M-1B and then we have to seasonally adjust the other components   Well, one can combine those in a way We tried 6 or 8 different ones because we had this technique that the Chairman mentioned of, in effect, leaving out part of last year We also made a similar kind of intervention for late '78 and early '79 when the ATS accounts were introduced; that would distort the demand deposit figures for M-1A and we had to do something So we could do it with or without that And then we used 3 or 4 different methods of trying to figure out what to do with the other checkable deposits   Always on the X-11, which the consultants who were making the report found to be the best thing to do, although they had certain other things they would like to maneuver But essentially it was an X-11 program We have not found a superior program, but we felt assured by the consultants in some sense on that   '78   We'll recheck, Bob That would make about a 1/2 point difference   Well, we'll recheck that It should have been worked out on a 70/30 split We may in the end have to go back to the other, but we'll recheck   Yes, that didn't affect our seasonals We couldn't find any effect Looking through the data that we have here for '78, '79, and '80, one can't find any acceleration in collections over the course of April A little more was collected in April in the past two years relative to earlier years, in terms of percentage distribution But over the course of April you can't find any acceleration in collection looking at '78, '79, and '80 In '81 there might have been; it looks as if a little more was collected through April 28--leaving out two days in the month--than in earlier Aprils    4/28/81   We hadn't been planning on it I don't think we have any experience whatsoever to find the seasonal on that   Well, one trouble, Jerry, is that here we felt reasonably confident about how much was coming out of demand deposits And there we literally have no idea, and it's probably small   We don't know what came out of Treasury bills and what came out of savings accounts It seems to me that it would be almost an impossible problem And one would hope, since M2 is so big--it's $17 trillion--that [the seasonal effects] would get much more swallowed up in M2 than they are getting swallowed up in M-1B   We didn't seasonally adjust other checkable deposits separately That ought to be clear What we did for M-1B--   --was the seasonally adjusted total of demand deposits plus two-thirds or whatever fraction of other checkable deposits   Well, Mr Chairman, just to step back a minute, I think the Committee will recall that two weeks ago we were expecting borrowing to rise to about $13 billion, given the shortfall we had in borrowing in the week of April 8th In the event, in the week of April 15th, we did get borrowing of close to that; it was $11 billion [As a result] of an overshoot in market factors affecting reserves, we had somewhat higher nonborrowed reserves in the week of the 15th--by about $100 million or so--because, as I say, on Wednesday market factors supplied more reserves than projections had suggested they would On April 22, the week just past, we had assumed the nonborrowed path implied borrowing of $1-1/2 billion Again the Desk was very close to path; in fact, Peter, if my memory's right, we ended up a little below path even, and borrowing turned out to be only $864 million That was because, instead, the market reduced excess reserves by $700 million from a plus $300 million that we thought they'd have to a minus $435 million That was the actual number So, borrowing, in effect, was $700 million less than planned and there was very little pressure on the markets, even with this large negative excess reserve number Given the shortfall in borrowing in that week, borrowing falling out of the path for the current week, the week ending April 29th, looked like $17 billion And we left the path there, implying that level of borrowing for the current week In a very technical sense, it turned out that the data we got last Friday suggested more downward multiplier adjustments than we had made We had made none because we had evidence of only small amounts, but it suddenly got large And if all those had been made that were possible to make, this $17 billion would have risen to an order of magnitude of $2-1/2 to $2-3/4 billion  Now, this week is the end of a so-called four-week period; and for the next three weeks the path would have implied borrowing of $17 billion So, in a sense, to smooth the transition between the two paths we left in that $17 billion for the week of the 29th; it would move toward $17 billion in the weeks of the 6th, 13th, and the    4/28/81  20th That $17 billion in this forthcoming three-week period reflects essentially the strength in required reserves above what one would have expected if we were on target with the Committee's objectives for M-1B and M2 In essence, it's M-1B that is running a lot stronger than had been expected and that is strengthening the required reserves It's also, of course, strengthening the total reserves; with borrowing running at $17 billion, total reserves are running about $500 million above the path for total reserves that had been set at the time of the Committee's meeting Over the next three weeks we would expect total reserves to be coming in about $500 million above the path So, this level of borrowing of $17 billion does not reflect any downward adjustment in the nonborrowed reserve path to compensate, as it were, for the increased bank demand for reserves and to try to put even more pressure on the banking system It is at the moment, as it were, the minimal borrowing that would fall out of just merely holding the nonborrowed path where we were As the Chairman mentioned, the funds market, yesterday and today, is beginning to show the pressures of the squeeze on reserve availability relative to demand; but the market didn't show it for a couple of weeks--last week largely because of this sharp drop in [demands for] excess Prior to that, the market was just going ahead as if the funds rate wouldn't change and banks didn't do any borrowing until extremely late in the statement week   Yes On the new numbers we would be $300 million, and on the old numbers $500 million, below the midpoint   Yes, $500 million above where it had been originally set by the Committee at $1150 million   In the very short run, that may be the result Of course, the question would then be Over a longer run than two or three weeks, would it begin to cause faster adjustments in the money supply back toward the Committee's path?   No, I don't think--   Governor Teeters, maybe I wasn't clear enough What I tried to say was that if the full multiplier adjustment had been made-- We divide the period into a four-week and a three-week period We're now in the last week of the first four-week period We got a surprising downward multiplier adjustment If we had taken that in the current week, we could have had borrowing as high as $27    4/28/81  billion We didn't because, without doing it, borrowing was $17 billion and taking that multiplier adjustment for the next three-week period would have left the borrowing at $17 billion So, in effect, we just left one week of it off   Yes, that is right   I should mention that when I said total reserves are running $500 million above the path, that assumed a certain multiplier adjustment These things change quite rapidly   So, by Friday it may--   Borrowing was $21 billion on average in November 1980, and in December it was $17 billion    Mr Chairman, we have some very tentative new numbers on the aggregates They have the normal tentativeness for a Wednesday; they will change by tomorrow and perhaps a little more by Friday The preliminary data for the week of April 29th had suggested a decline of $1 billion from the week of the 22nd The more complete data, which might be somewhat firm--that's the week we're going to publish on Friday--now suggest a decline of about $3-1/2 billion from the week of the 22nd That would be followed, I hasten to add, by an increase, if the numbers hold up, of about $3 billion in the week of May 6th This looks offsetting, but in a real sense the level of the series for both the 29th and the 6th is lower than had been built into the paths So, the level of the series is lower on average by about $2 billion in both weeks, April 29th and May 6th The changes are, as I mentioned above, about offsetting This figure would give us a shift-adjusted April rate of growth--I can't be very precise--probably on the order of 14 percent or something like that And that would put the April level of M-1B almost right smack in the middle of the Committee's 3-1/2 to 6 percent long-run shift-adjusted range That, of course, is somewhat higher than the Committee had been aiming at by April, but it's still well within the range  I don't have any new data for M2 yet for April, but the data we had as of Friday would have had the level of M2 in the month somewhat above the Committee's long-run growth range, viewed as a triangle M3 in April is also somewhat above the range And bank credit growth, which is [uncertain] because we don't have good estimates yet for April, by March had been moving down toward the range I don't believe that the growth in April will be very far from, and probably will be lower than, the 9 percent upper limit of the Committee's range So, I think by April it's possible that bank credit will be at or near the upper end of its range We have been running with a reserve path that would imply in the current week    5/6/81  borrowing of around $2 billion Borrowing started out very high earlier, before the weekend, and it has been running about $1-1/2 billion since then, as banks have had large excess reserves that they've been working down In consequence of this, as you know, within the week there was some easing; we've had a drop in the funds rate from the very high levels it had reached earlier It, too, has been easing down as banks have adjusted their positions within the week But, Mr Chairman, perhaps Mr Sternlight would want to comment on the particular developments in market rates that have followed the discount rate move   I was going to say it's very much a guess, but we see, of course, a diminution from April If I had to put a range around our guess, I would say the rate of growth for May is probably in a range of 6 to 9 percent [for M-1B] Something on that order of magnitude would still leave us with a pretty high growth rate in M-1B for the [second] quarter on average If we had growth a lot higher than that, we'd begin to get zero velocities instead of a small positive coming out of that   Next week?   One second, Larry, and I'll tell you I don't know whether you really want the total reserve figure for the current week, but for the three weeks ending May 20th--that's the week just past, the current week, and next week--it looks as if total reserves might be around $40,960 million I can give you the weekly figures The path for total reserves is a little over $40,400 million That is, for this period of three weeks, actual total reserves appear to be running about $500 million above what the path for total reserves would call for And in each week of that period, it's not too different from that    5/6/81   Well, I'm looking at unadjusted figures, but that would be higher than the preceding four-week period   No, the path is running lower than the total reserves demanded The actual total reserves appear to be running about $500 million or more above the path for total reserves   Well, for the three weeks ending May 20th, I gave a figure of $40,960 million For the preceding four weeks, the average level of total reserves was $40,027 million   The projected level is $40,960 million   No, for the period we're in--the three weeks ending May 20th   The April growth in total reserves will turn out to be quite low, with the way the lagged reserve accounting comes out and the sharp drop in excess reserves at banks, which will hold down the growth of total reserves The monetary base in April grew at around a 6 percent annual rate   Well, going back, on Tuesday, April 28th, which was a little more than a week ago, the effective funds rate was 17 percent; the day before that it was 16 percent Then on the next day it got to 19 percent, then it was 19, 20, and 18-1/2 percent; and presumably today it will be 17 percent or so   "The range indicated"?   No Factually, President Guffey, the numbers we have now suggest that nonborrowed reserves in April declined at around a 13-1/2 percent annual rate But that's just a fact It wouldn't say in the record what particular mechanical devices got it there, if it went there   This would be consistent with that   Yes   I think there was a vote, but I can't remember for certain   Yes, that's right   Might involve    Right Governor Partee, worrying about how to present alternatives and so forth, we did look at the elasticities in the money market model to see if truly we could get an effect within a month, because in these alternatives we do have effects even in May from decisions taken in the last light almost--a little beyond the middle--of May And if my memory is right--it may be off a little--it looked as if a one half percentage point increase in the funds rate [would be needed to effect the growth of money in a month] You could [get the same effect by] working through the borrowing and nonborrowed path, but it comes down to this that 1/2 percentage point on the funds rate seemed to [have an effect of] about 03 percent a month on growth in the money supply   Within the month So, if you wanted to get [an effect of] 3 percentage points, multiply that by 10; it's probably not linear but it might be on the order of 5 percentage points [on the funds rate] [So, if the funds rate were 13 percent at the beginning of a month] and you made it 18 percent pretty promptly during the month, according to the monthly model it would produce some genuine effect--on the order of 3 percentage points or so--in the money supply That is all we really have to work on But then you'd really have to know pretty early in the month what is going to happen   [Statement--see Appendix]   In April it didn't on average, but the data in late April and thus far in early May suggest that in May M2 will come in quite low   We don't have weekly data, except for certain components But the weakness in the weekly data on money market funds and what we have seen in small time and savings deposits have led us to project M2 for May generally around that rate So, it reflects the latest data for those components for which we have weekly data   Yes   That's right We thought with our projections that to stay with unchanged money market conditions we'd expect an outcome more like "A" than "B" So, with added restraint from "B," it looked as if we'd have to have a higher funds rate, on the order of a percentage point or so higher It is hard to relate that exactly to the level of borrowing, but that tends to push up the level of borrowing by $450 to $500 million   It was $18175 billion on Friday exactly   It might be helpful to add, Mr Chairman, that the May estimate of a little over 6 percent in M-1B growth does assume an increase from the preliminary data of the 13th to the end of the month of around $5 billion If an increase of that magnitude doesn't  -27-    5/18/81  develop, May could turn out to be unchanged or be at a level that has changed around 1 or 2 percent It could go almost either way   The comma after percent is meant to indicate that it's only the lower part that is consistent   Sure   Mr Chairman, I don't know if it would be helpful, but part of the reason for wording such as this or the other wording you suggested is technical I understand that if the Committee put a number in there of 2 or 3 percent, we would construct  -41-    5/18/81  the target on 2 or 3 percent or whatever the number is; and at whatever point the Committee felt they were willing to have a shortfall, as money was coming in short we simply would lower the nonborrowed targets commensurately, if that's what the Committee intends this kind of instruction to mean Under that assumption we would really need to know pretty much in a general way what the lower limit is below which the Committee doesn't want the nonborrowed path lowered any more That was why we felt it might be useful to tie it to the March-to-June target the Committee had already set   Or whatever by saying "somewhat less" It's literally what the Committee set for itself at the previous meeting That's what this kind of wording would imply That it's something like the lower limit   Well, we tend to adjust to that, so if [the demands for] excess reserves turn out high, we tend to supply them   Well, I think $2150 million probably would be consistent with a higher federal funds rate than we have experienced thus far, [which is] in the 18-1/2 percent range   I would say between 19 and 20 percent, give or take some   The essential sentence that you have there says that if it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of __ to __ percent are likely to be inconsistent, etc, the Manager will inform the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions That sounds as if the federal funds rate is an objective within the [context] of the instructions The proposal, in line with some of the [points] raised by Committee members, essentially has the same beginning but it tries to make the federal funds rate seem more like a consultation point that involves a little more flexibility It says that if it appears during the period before the next meeting that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths is likely to be associated with a funds rate range persistently outside a range of _ to _ percent, then the Manager will inform the Chairman--the same sort of instructions as before--but then it says "who will then decide whether consultation with the Committee is necessary"   Well, it reads to me literally as saying that the Chairman could permit the funds rate to go almost anywhere    Mr Chairman, we have the preliminary results of the survey from Michigan in which we surveyed a thousand or so accounts and asked about their money market funds   People And there were very close to a thousand [with] accounts in money market funds   Well, you are going to tax my knowledge here   It's 5,000 households of which 1165 had an OCD account Just adding quickly--there's close to a thousand or a little under that have money market fund accounts We asked all holders [of such accounts] the number of checks written per month I don't have it by the amount of deposits at the moment, but 76 percent wrote no checks, 18 percent wrote 1 to 3 checks, 2 percent wrote 4 to 9 checks, and 2 percent wrote 10 or more checks per month That's very consistent, of course, with our measure of the velocity of these accounts, which is very low    7/6-7/81   Well, that's true We asked If money market funds were not available, where would the money be? That's another indirect way of getting at it The answers were Non-interest checking, 2 percent; interest checking, 3 percent; and the rest was in savings accounts, and the bulk in money market certificates   Mr Chairman, I think it might be helpful in response to President Black's question to point out, with regard to the additional very sharp weakness that occurred in M-1B, that the data became available only Wednesday and Thursday when we had a sharp downward revision in deposits of a couple billion dollars for the week of June 24th relative to path And preliminary data suggested a drop of almost $7 billion in the week of July 1st    7/6-7/81   Most of that occurred in the last two days   It may be just under 20 percent by now It has been right around 19-3/4 to 20 percent all day   Only to a degree This afternoon we will publish data for the 24th and that will show no change in M-1B from the previous week But in the preliminary estimate we had expected a $2 billion increase For July 1st our preliminary numbers, for what they're worth, show a $4-1/2 billion drop in the actual figure from what we had projected But that won't show up [in our published data] until next Friday, if it stays   Yes The preliminary numbers have been revising $1 to $2 billion, at least recently since the MCA   Well, we had two downward revisions [in a row]   Governor Wallich, that hasn't really occurred since 1975-76 That's when it most clearly occurred Thus far this year, unless we get further shifts, we're pretty much on the "schedule" that we tended to project--that is, a so-called downward shift on the order of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percentage points If there's no further shift this year, that's about what we'll end up with   If we get a similar shift in the second half then we'll have a much more expansionary policy than was voted for   Four percent of those who have money market funds--is that what you meant?--were writing more than 3 checks   About [unintelligible] percent velocity   We're not that stubborn!   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Those, Mr Chairman, are simply the growth rates--in some sense the midpoint growth rates--we'd expect So, alternative 1 is the midpoint of the present longer-run range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent and we would expect M2 and M3 to grow at rates above the upper ends of the present ranges If, however, growth in M-1B were held to the lower limit of the present 3-1/2 to 6 percent range for the year, we would expect that growth in M2 would be in its range and growth of M3 just a tick above its range That [table on page 8] shows those relationships   Yes   Well, it probably would, if you assume the economy unchanged   Well, the June-to-December growth would be around 6-1/2 percent That would be the alternative C   That's alternative C [M-1B growth] comes in at 3 percent for the year   I didn't mean to imply that   Yes, no M1-A   Or irrelevant   That's why I was suggesting widening the range   Well, Mr Chairman, I had not planned on any substantial statement in view of the preceding one But I thought it might be useful to expand at least a little bit on how these short-run ranges relate to the longer-run ranges And that would give me an opportunity to provide some additional data that would be relevant to the Committee's preceding discussion We constructed alternative A to reach the midpoint of the present longer-run range for M-1B by the fourth quarter Given the shortfall in money growth in May and then in June bringing the level down even further, unfortunately that [calls for] a very rapid growth rate for M-1B month by month [in the June-to-September period] of around 10-1/2 percent Alternative A is  -59-    7/6-7/81  associated with a slower growth rate on a quarterly average basis in the third quarter of around 4 percent, and then of course by the fourth quarter [as the quarterly growth rate] veers toward the 10-1/2 percent monthly rate, the fourth-quarter average rate would be around 103 percent Alternative B again has a relatively rapid growth month by month of 8-1/2 percent in M-1B, and that alternative was constructed to get toward the bottom end of the present range It actually implies a growth Q4 to Q4 of 39 percent, which is somewhat above the bottom of the present range   For the two quarters it's about 5-1/2 percent   That's right And alternative C, Mr Chairman, goes to the bottom end of a range that is 1/2 point lower than the current 3-1/2 to 6 percent range, should the Committee be considering that Even so, that would imply month-by-month growth in M-1B on the order of 6-1/2 percent, again given the low starting point of June Of course, if there should be any upward revision in that figure and if you're thinking of the level as the ultimate target, it would tend to lower that growth rate; and a downward revision would tend to [raise] that growth rate That would give you growth of 1-1/2 percent in the third quarter and 6 percent in the fourth quarter, again veering toward the monthly growth rate by the time of the fourth quarter, and it would only give you 3 percent Q4 to Q 4   Now, those are a lot of numbers, but if the Committee would indulge me with a little patience for a bit, I think it would be helpful, Mr Chairman, to give two more sets of numbers that aren't shown [in the Bluebook], because the upper ends of the ranges are not irrelevant in terms of announcement effects when the Committee reaffirms or changes or does whatever to its targets Given what has happened in the first half of the year, the growth rates in the second half implied by the upper ends of the ranges are, of course, very large as you can tell For example, if we had Q4-to-Q4 growth of 6 percent, which is the upper end of the M-1B range, given what has happened thus far this year, the monthly growth rate would be on the order of 13-1/2 percent; that would give you quarterly average growth of 6 percent in the third quarter and 13-1/2 percent in the fourth If the upper end of the present range were reduced by 1/2 point, say, the potential monthly growth to get 5-1/2 percent would be around 12-1/4 percent from now on, with a third quarter of 5-1/4 percent, which looks reasonable, and a fourth quarter, as the arithmetic works out, of around 12-1/2 percent That gives you an idea of the dimensions that are involved  Finally, associated funds rate ranges were presented [in the Bluebook] with the three alternatives The only range that implies an easing in the money market, from our analysis, is the rapid growth rates of alternative A, and that I think has been amply explained It comes out of this dilemma involved in analyzing money demand relative to GNP If there is a further sharp downward shift in money demand or  -60-    7/6-7/81  if GNP is indeed weaker than we have projected, then of course that lower funds rate range of alternative A could well develop with less rapid growth than is called for in alternative A But under the assumptions that we have been working with, we have more moderate money market conditions associated with "A," while "B" and "C" imply current or somewhat tighter money market conditions on our analysis, again I stress, given the GNP projection   16 to 22 percent It will be published   First we thought $16 billion; that was a week ago This week we think $14 billion, but it's averaging $19 billion to this time We thought consistent with $16 billion we'd have to see the funds rate move down toward 18 percent and it didn't; and we thought consistent with $14 billion, the funds rate would be in the 17 to 18 percent area and it isn't there yet   58 percent   51 percent   Oh, I don't have that  -66-    7/6-7/81   Well, we wouldn't know The money supply numbers, depending on developments in the economy, could be consistent But we wouldn't think that borrowing of $1-1/2 billion would be consistent with a funds rate of 19 to 20 percent We think that implies lower funds rates   Well, it had been running in the 18-1/2 to 20 percent area, or more like 18-1/2 to 19-1/2 percent That's a discount rate structure   Yes, that's very rough   If you put it in the directive along with the growth rate for June to September, I think it would have diminished importance It would just call to the market's attention that this is not such a high growth rate month-by-month If you put it in without the growth rates month-by-month, unless we understood what it is the Committee intended for the growth rates month-by-month, there would be some difficulty in targeting That is, if July came in very strong, the quarterly average would really depend on the projections for August and September So, if that average were the sole target, we would be back in the arena of simply making the money market conditions depend to a great extent on how the staff happened to see the projections, right or wrong, in the months and weeks ahead Whereas if we had some idea of the implicit monthly targets that the Committee preferred, then we would not be so dependent on projections  -71-    7/6-7/81   What we normally would put down is a straight line But this time, as you can see, we put a little more in July and slightly less in August and September simply because we expect the social security payment in the week of July 8th to add a couple billion dollars in that week and 1 percentage point at an annual rate for July as a whole That's probably excess perfectionism, but it--   July 8th doesn't show an increase from July 1st If July 1st is at the low level, then we'll have a very low July probably And if the Committee adopts 8 percent for the quarter--we didn't project a very high latter part of July--presumably an easing process would be needed   We're very dependent on tomorrow's figures There are such big [differences] implied   With alternative B, we say the funds rate would be in the 19 to 20 percent area That's in paragraph 22   Well, [$21] billion was the average level of borrowing last month It only fluctuated a bit   In June, borrowing ran $20, $22, $19 and $23 billion; then it dropped in the first week of July to $17  -73-    7/6-7/81  billion and it's running $19 billion thus far this week with some expectation of a drop-off   That's what we think, if we get it   Theoretically, a lot lower on borrowing and the funds rate   Yes, the question is whether I can find it It was running 7-1/4 percent in May and 10 percent in June; both of those are a lot lower than it ran in the previous months   That's right; it's about 75 percent of M2   We have a relatively restrained growth in the nontransactions component, not very different from last month It's a little lower actually in most cases than the June growth It's pretty restrained   Mr Chairman, did I understand your explanation right that for whatever number the Committee chooses for M-1B, if it runs weak and required reserves go down and M2 stays at 9 percent or something like that, the borrowing would tend to come down and we'd adhere to the nonborrowed path and vice versa if it went up? I was not sure exactly   Well, our calculations are a little lower than that It depends on the ratio one expects at the end Maybe 03 to 05 percent is a little too specific, but it's 1/2 point or lower   It's essentially that It's higher than the demand for other transactions deposits in M-1B And with the increased weight of the household balances in M-1B, this is an effort to see, for any given growth rate in M-1B prior to the increased weight, what this would mean So, 5 percent might mean 53 percent to start with but, of course, we would reduce it 1/2 point thereafter But's that's purely mechanical; the increased savings deposits may be compensating balances for all I know and not really--   Well, just to be clear on these ranges, we had centered them in alternatives I, II, and III on our projections of the midpoints [of the associated M1 ranges] The alternative III range, therefore, has a midpoint of 8 percent [for M3 and for alternative I it's] 8-1/2 percent And with the Committee willing to say that growth in the broader aggregates could be in the upper ends of the ranges, it would not be too difficult to lower the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range to 6 to 9 percent because we're not projecting growth above that [upper limit]; our midpoint is not above or even very near that 9 percent   Well, particularly for M3 If you lowered the M2 range to 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent, the top of that range is really roughly the "midpoint" It's not a case where the top of that range would be uncomfortably near the midpoint we're actually projecting   No, they're growing about the same But if growth is about the same next year, I would say that if you can stand the 6 to 9 percent range for M2, you can also stand the 6 to 9 percent range for M3 But for M3 that would be 1/2 point lower than the range you now have   Conceivably, if you wanted to make some allowance for the fact that household deposit balances may have a higher income elasticity than balances of nonhouseholds   It seemed, within these numbers, relatively--   For which aggregate?   Oh, yes   That's right; the excess is more like 5 to 7   That's what it looks like at this point There's no guarantee on what it will look like in December   Last year, Mr Chairman, I believe the Committee lowered M2 at midyear and then raised it back   Yes, that's right I think it was M2 You lowered it at midyear and then at the beginning of last year--   It's 6 to 9    Thank you, Mr Chairman The data for the week of July 1st that were published right after the FOMC meeting were about $2-1/2 billion higher than we thought at the time of that meeting, based on the preliminary figures The data for [the week ending] July 8th that we are going to publish today will show an increase of $69 billion As you probably recall, at the time of the    7/17/81  FOMC meeting we had projected, without any data in hand, an increase on the order of $4-1/2 billion, in part because of the accelerated social security payments But the increase, as you see, is considerably higher The preliminary data for the week ending this Wednesday, July 15th, suggest that part of this [extra bulge] will come out, and we are looking for a decline of $2-1/2 billion But even with that decline, that would still leave the level of M-1B in the week of July 15th some $700 million above where the target path had put it last week And it would leave the level for July 8th some $17 billion above where the target path for last week had put it So, we're running somewhat stronger on M-1B Without changing the nonborrowed path at all and given the shortfall in borrowing last week to $13 billion, this implies a borrowing level in the current week and next week of $1650 million That's without without doing any adjustments to the nonborrowed path, just holding that and letting the natural course of the figures work through  Meanwhile, because the Committee clearly indicated its concern about M2, I should update the Committee on that aggregate The data we now have, which include preliminary data for the July 15th week, suggest to us that savings deposits are less weak than had been estimated as consistent with the path, that money market funds are considerably stronger, that overnight RPs are stronger, and that Eurodollars are stronger We don't [calculate M2] weekly, but that would give us growth in July of close to 11 percent in contrast to the 8-1/2 percent path In essence, the nontransactions components of M2, which had been targeted, so to speak, to grow at a rate of around 8 percent with M2 as a whole growing at an 8-1/2 percent rate given the greater growth the Committee was permitting in M-1B in that month, look as if they're expanding at about an 11 percent annual rate-- similar to the way they had expanded earlier in the year That's how they look at this moment So, we have greater strength in M2 and we have not made any particular adjustment in the path as of this moment for that   Well, the confusion goes back [to how we constructed the path] and I should be clearer The Committee met on Tuesday; we got new data on Wednesday; and we constructed the path on Thursday night on the basis of the new data So, I should have added, Mr Chairman--the numerology here just gets excessively complex--that the June level on which the current path is based is $400 million higher than the June level at which the Committee was looking And that added a bit   That's right    7/17/81   That's right   In the last week of June, the week ending June 24th, it was $4283 billion; in the week of July 1st, which is the last week [published], it was $4273 billion; in the week of July 8th, which is the number we're now going to publish, it is $4342 billion; and for July 15th our preliminary estimate is $4317 billion   Well, the projection is based on assumptions   Well, at the time of the meeting, we guessed that the number for July 8th would be $4294 billion Shortly after the meeting, we constructed a path based on a number of $4325 billion because the [higher] June base got reflected in that week And we now have $4342 billion So, relative to the number we used in constructing the path, given the increase in the June base, you're $17 billion above And our staff projection for July is a 92 percent rate of growth But that assumes that there is no further increase form this preliminary estimate of the July 15th level, on average, in either the week of the 22nd or the 29th If there is any further increase, that 92 percent will, of course, be higher   The June decline as it worked out is 94 percent   All I have is that the small time component is running weaker, but the savings deposit component is running less weak The two together are just a shade stronger than we'd allowed for   I don't have the raw data for early July here But in June that seasonally-adjusted annual rate--   It was up only around 2 percent for S&Ls and 3 percent for mutual [savings banks]; and I don't have a July projection here It's running weaker in terms of the total In small time and savings deposits we still have a small increase projected   No, for thrifts alone   But that's only the small [time and savings deposits] We don't really have an estimate for the large CDs-- whether they are running off and offsetting that    7/17/81   Well, I think we're below through June--   Well, we have to estimate our July figure and plot it   Yes, as nearly as we can plot it fast, if you plot the shift adjusted number that we have for the week of July 8th-- the one we're going to publish--it's below the cone and also below--    7/17/81   Well, I think you were looking at that more special one you use    The Commiteee had established [informal] limits for each of the currencies, so there is an implicit--   Some econometric work we've done recently suggests that the basic rate in some sense is 3/4 of the surcharge and 1/4 of the basic rate, in terms of weight So the basic rate, if we didn't have a surcharge, was more like, say, 17 [unintelligible] not 18 percent   Something like that   We only sell with an agreement to buy back   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, I'm afraid we're not in a position to come to that conclusion, President Roos, in my view in any event, because we know that M-1B is not really measuring transactions balances--and that's what we're seeking--and we know that M2 is measuring a lot more We don't have an institutional structure that would enable us to sharply distinguish transactions accounts from other accounts In that environment, I'm afraid there's probably little choice but to continue to make judgments about each of the aggregates as we view them and as time goes on--in my view, still paying somewhat more attention to M-1B, after making proper allowance for how one thinks the public is economizing [its holdings of transactions accounts], but not ignoring the others because we know there are shifts occurring between transactions accounts out of M-1B into nontransactions accounts in M2   Yes, but what I had much more in mind were money market funds and overnight RPs; all those sorts of things do have a transactions account element One can run a zero balance demand deposit through these other items One might even run it through things other than what we're measuring That's one of the problems It's very difficult, of course, to distinguish the investment element of those very short-term [instruments] from the transactions element, but they have both   I should add, Governor Gramley, that this again assumes that the Committee wouldn't be rigid in relation to M2 But if the Committee made M2 the predominant target, let's say, we're not certain that we could hit even the low end of the M-1B range And under that assumption, I think interest rates would be higher in the short run and nominal GNP lower in the long run   That's a policy decision on M2   Well, assuming that the economy doesn't just fall on its face, a very low likelihood   Without going into any detail, President Balles, I think developments in the institutional structure of the depository system in the country are such as to make that almost impossible at the moment I don't want to sound pessimistic, but it's almost impossible because we don't have a way of separating out transactions accounts from other accounts For example, if we forbade anything to be issued anywhere that was under 14 days in maturity, then we might begin to separate out transactions accounts from other accounts If it was under 14 days, it would be a demand deposit and have a reserve requirement--to give an extreme example of how we could make a separation But the way things are going now, it's very difficult to make the separation We don't even have reserve requirements on money market funds transactions use; that would give us some automatic separation But now if money starts flowing out of money market funds, I wouldn't be tempted to think that was demand deposits flowing out; I would be more tempted to think it was investment money going out But I wouldn't know So, we just don't have any basis for doing that  -14-    8/18/81   If they behave as it seems likely they would; that is, if they separate accounts that are primarily transactions and subject to reserve requirements from those that are primarily investment and are not, then we would have a basis for putting those separated accounts into M1, very clearly That would be an institutional change that would help   An annual rate for the first half of the year   7 percent   I don't have in mind a QIV-to-August growth rate, but it would be somewhat above 9 percent I don't have the exact number   That's the growth from June to September   Governor Gramley, we are calculating that if August came out as we are projecting, while it would look strong relative to the path the Committee adopted last time, relative to the longer-run target the growth from, say, Q4 to August--the answer we were working on--would be something like 92 percent It's a tad above 9 percent just because of the longer--   Yes, $424 billion   Oh yes, it's below the lower end for that   That's a projection, but total reserves in August could grow at around 10 percent and nonborrowed reserves could grow at around 18 percent or something like that   That's this week, and for the three-week average we have about $1285 billion or so   Mr Chairman, I would like to [correct my earlier comment] Borrowing is not $1370 billion; it is $1409 billion this week   But we can't identify the money that the stockholders got We're identifying the money that Dupont and Seagrams were keeping for making payments When that disappears, it ought to go into M3 or other type assets   Well, alternative II was written only to provide an alternative in case the Committee did not want to continue specifying the third-quarter growth rate it adopted at the last meeting for M-1B That is, if the Committee wanted to adopt a lower rate, this is written so you could have a lower growth rate that is consistent with alternative A, what you adopted last time, but permits it to rise in case M2 happened to come in all right   It's just written to start off with a lower M-1B growth rate, should the Committee wish to do that   Yes, alternative A is essentially the projection   Well, that's right It works out, of course, that alternative A, August to September, is consistent with that 7 percent [for the quarter], so that September growth would have to come down   Well, there is evidence of somewhat more interest in the small savers certificates than had been expected   I ought to correct what I said The calculations with the hand computer came to 94 percent for August   But I don't know whether it's 93 or 94   From Q4 1980 [to August]   Yes, that was a mistake That should say  -50-    8/18/81   That was a mistake It's a transcription error [The intended wording] should be exactly as it was in the Bluebook   Well, we once had a sentence in there which we took out because it included the early estimates for the week of August 12th But we could easily say "Available data for early August suggest acceleration in growth of M-1B and M2, in the case of M2 reflecting" It depends on some of our preliminary estimates, but that would be a reasonable sentence to put in there    We don't have any very obvious explanation There is nothing special that we can see Just as a word of caution, I would hold my breath a little until October 7th We're not projecting a large increase in that week; we're projecting something on the order of $2 or $3 billion, but it's not impossible that it could come in quite a bit larger and could begin to make up for that decline So far as the economics of it go, it could indicate some weakening in real GNP, which is quite consistent with the nonfinancial data that are coming in But again, that's somewhat speculative   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   I was just thinking that in the last 3 months of the year it's possible that there may be some rebound from this very low growth that we have had in M-1B The rebound in itself could tend to increase M2 because I was assuming that it wouldn't  -18-    10/5-6/81  necessarily mean that people were taking deposits out of other components of M2 and putting them in M-1B but simply were putting more money in M-1B in general that they would have put other places because they realized their cash was low relative to what they normally would expect it to be in relation to income   That's right, given the patterns of the months within the quarter If it so happened that October was a very strong month instead of November and December, you might hit [the lower limit of the range] We were assuming October will be--   Well, the best we could come up with is that the range of impact would probably be on the order of 1/4 to 3/4 of a percentage point   We have virtually no evidence   Well, we are going to ask questions in the Michigan survey of an admittedly small sample We are going to ask those who have all savers certificates, what was the immediate source of those funds That would be the only direct evidence we would have; otherwise it would be a matter of analyzing the data that we have available   We would want to look for unusual behavior of time and savings deposits and money market funds If they began to behave unexpectedly relative to what--   Oh, yes But if we could account for everything that happens to all savers certificates from that, that doesn't leave much residual for [funds coming from] elsewhere Essentially in this assumption we have assumed that in the fourth quarter only about $3 to $5 billion comes out of non-M2 assets other than retail RPs, and we have assumed that two-thirds of the retail RPs--$10 billion out of $15 billion of RPs--goes into all savers certificates The reason that I am uncertain between the 1/4 and the 3/4 of a percentage point is that we have to make a further assumption regarding how much of those retail RPs would have come out of M2 to begin with or how much would have come out of non-M2 type assets We have essentially assumed very little, really, coming out of non-M2 assets It's practically negligible if you eliminate the retail RPs and they were in M2 in any event   Yes, $3 to $5 billion About a 1/4--   That only makes 1/4 added to this   No, [M2 growth for the year] would be 9-1/4 percent, abstracting from that   Well, what I said was there's a degree to which it would be; we think it would entail a sharp drop in short-term interest rates over the next 2 or 3 months   No, [raising its growth] to that 12 percent, which would be needed to get it back [into the range] And if you happen to think that there's a sizable pent-up demand for goods and services, as some of us on the staff think--some may not--then we could have a very sharp rebound in spending and a sharp rebound in interest rates later in order to keep money under control And if that large money growth sets off a sharp rebound in spending, I think the progress made in curbing inflationary expectations would be lost That's one analysis that one could make If you think the economy is extremely weak in any event and no one is going to do much when short rates go very low, then you might not come to that conclusion That's what I was saying at the end of my statement   Well, I think it made a lot of sense earlier, obviously It has been making a degree of less sense, but I think we need to have a shift adjusted series to evaluate the year properly Therefore, it has been our thought that we might as well continue at least until year-end, just because that is what we have done for the last several months, and at that point change over We would have to keep presenting a shift adjusted series even if we didn't shift adjust each month If we said the shift adjustment was now in effect zero, we would still need a shift adjusted series for the year So it just seems simpler to continue on to year-end; the differences are small now   Very little We are getting less frequent data on the shifts and we have not changed our assumption One piece of evidence is that we do have data that new NOW accounts are still being opened at a sizable pace But we can't tell what is happening to the deposits in the NOW accounts that were opened earlier this year That money could be going out   Well, we have stuck with our past assumptions; we only get survey data on that about every three months now instead of every month, so I'm not exactly up to date on it   Well, in September, in terms of amounts--this is under a lagged accounting regime--we have a $592 million dollar  -21-    10/5-6/81  increase in required reserves, which is the 179 percent at an annual rate that you referred to Of that amount, $319 million is in savings and time deposits, which is mainly large CDs in that period [Most of] the rest of it is in transactions deposits, which include OCDs, demand deposits, US government deposits, net interbank deposits, and telephone transfers And the remaining $4 million--I had to do this accounting--was in nonmember commercial banks and others and can be accounted for, with the large bulk of the increase coming from items that are not in M-1B If you pretend that the accounting was contemporaneous--   That's right It would be a quite smaller increase   That's right; it's only the last two weeks of August and the first two weeks of September that get into this If you pretend that it's contemporaneous, then the transactions deposits part is in September and instead of being [an increase of] $269 million it's only $49 million Don't forget that currency was quite negative So, if the rate of growth in total reserves in September on a contemporaneous basis, so to speak, is 7 percent, [growth in] total required reserves is 7 percent Total reserve [growth] on a lagged basis is much higher   They're phasing down to where they're 5/8ths of whatever they were originally, which was, I keep forgetting--maybe 6 percent   5/8ths of 6   They're down now Starting in September they are 5/8ths of 6 percent   It's 5/8ths of the difference between 3 and 6-- that's where we are--slipping to zero   All I had in mind, Mr Chairman, was that M2 is increasingly becoming like that because it has money market funds, money market certificates, and small savers certificates in it If the System is holding back on reserves, let's say, in a period of strong money demand, interest rates go up If the return on these instruments that are in money deposits doesn't go up, then you'll get restraint on money relatively easily, in effect, because people will shift out of deposits into something else   If the money definition covers only things that have market interest rates on them, then as we hold back on reserves in the face of [strong] money demand, market rates tend to go up The banks and other financial institutions raise their offering rates on these deposits so that the gap between the market rates and the deposit rates, in effect, doesn't change very much People still demand those things because that gap hasn't changed We have to hold back on reserves even further; that forces rates up more   Well, no, I didn't mean that What I meant was that interest rates move more rapidly than they used to   No, I didn't say that I said the nontransactions component will rise relative to M-1B in this present environment   No, no   No, my only point was that given this behavior of the assets in M2, if there was increasing need in the context to constrain M2, it would follow that M-1B would be weaker than one might have "expected" I also think short rates might have been somewhat higher than the staff was predicting all along They probably are a bit higher And my only evidence that this was real restraint is that the short rates in real terms were quite high They are not only nominally high short rates; they are also high, in quotes, "real" short rates   No, what I was saying is that to the degree the Committee gives more weight to an aggregate that has market rates as offering rates, you get a prompter response in interest rates, I think, than you would if you give weight to something that doesn't have such rates And in the limit--   That's right And, in the limit, if you had an aggregate that only had market rates in it, I would see almost no way to control it except through control of the economy itself If you conceive of something where rates kept going up, finally you'd get GNP so weak that the transactions demand for that aggregate or the savings demand-- But, obviously, we are not at that stage   No, I was saying--   No, I was saying that there would be a tendency for that to occur because the depository institutions would raise the rates pari passu with market rates And to the extent to which the Committee was determined to hit M2--and it probably could--that meant that rates would have to move up even faster, at the limit to the point where income was so affected that there wasn't enough savings to put in M2   $880 million is the present implied level   Well, if you took our lower estimate of 1/4 of a point for the year, it would be 1 percentage point on a quarterly basis   No, that's 3 months   The difference would be only if it reflected a different understanding of what the Committee preferred That's what it would depend on It wouldn't be a matter of wording but what the Committee actually prefers   The Committee accepted a high M2 in--   Yes, over the fourth quarter It probably was a little less than that; but if we put retail RPs back in, it would be more like that   No, please   We tried to allow for that with the suggested wording in the directive that says "It is recognized that the behavior of M2 must be evaluated in the light of effects of recent regulatory and legislative changes, particularly the public's response to the availability of the all savers certificate"   Well, we do think there will be some rebound in M-1B relative to M2, which will narrow the gap that has developed thus far this year We could well be wrong on that, but that's our view at the moment   Well, the degree of error around this is vast We've assumed that that level of borrowing implies a funds rate of something like 14-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent I don't know if Peter thinks it is exactly in that range We probably are going to get M-1B growth on the order of 6, 7, or 8 percent; so if that's right, I wouldn't assume any further drop in borrowing and the funds rate   Yes, in constructing this path we have allowed for an increase on the order of $2-1/2 billion in the first week of October   I should just give the figures In the last three complete statement weeks the funds rate averaged 1609, 1533, and 15 percent That 15 percent was for the week ending September 30, the quarterly statement date For this week to date, I don't have the figure, but it must be over 15 percent   We had a high funds rate early in the week so the average level of the funds rate hasn't really gotten below 15 to 15-1/2 percent, if you take out the exception week   September 30th, which might have some funny--    President Roos, the Committee also had an M2 constraint    11/17/81   If the Committee had only an M1-B target and was determined to achieve it no matter what was happening to M2 or anything else, then, of course, we would have had to push reserves in and raise the nonborrowed reserves path enormously, with a resulting drop in interest rates and presumably more marked expansion in M2 and other things   Well, yes, in some sense maybe they are incompatible You can choose one or the other; you can't choose them both But given the [recent] changes in financial technology and the way people are behaving, the Committee inevitably has to make the judgments it has been making That it's going to take this attitude toward one in case the other goes off and vice versa   Only if God were sitting at this table! Let me tell you, it'd be--   Well, in the short run our experience is that [growth in] money market funds tends to speed up with rate declines because of the lag in [the adjustment of] their rates As rates declined this time, we found a rather unusual experience in that savings deposits at banks accelerated I assume it was just some sort of cautionary inflow But all the evidence we have is that, yes, as rates decline we still tend to see growth in M2 as deposits become a little more attractive relatively speaking Now, this doesn't hold quite to the extent it did before because we do have components of M2 that move with market rates   Well, it is atrophying a little, that's quite right   The M2 figure for October has fallen below by about a couple of percentage points; our expectation at the time that we [constructed] the path was [a growth rate of] 118 percent and it was published at 93 percent In very recent weeks, the latest data show an upturn in M2 because of the persisting strength in money market funds and, as I mentioned to President Black, some strength that we've observed in savings deposits at commercial banks So we think we're on a trajectory that gives us a very high November Again, most of that is just extrapolating the trajectory of the last couple of weeks   It was $100 million for a week; in terms of a 3-week average it was $56 million or something like that   Thank you, Mr Chairman [Statement--see Appendix]   That's one way, assuming GNP GNP could be different   Well, the context that I had in mind was that the Committee is making a short-run decision for, let us say, the next six weeks And whether that decision is for 5 percent growth in money, or 6 or 7 percent--if money growth turned out to be any one of those [rates]--and then the Committee went ahead and attained its 1982 tentative targets or something like them, I simply didn't think that the difference in those growth rates would matter very much   And they won't affect the year as a whole--the result for the year 1981--because in large part that's given Or at least the year isn't much affected by those growth rates   So, that drove me to worrying about what kind of volatility might be promoted in credit markets with effects on expectations from short-run efforts [to increase growth], given the fact that I assumed the Committee was going to phase down into its 1982 targets, or phase down as the year began That drove me into these muddy areas of how people perceive what happens in credit markets And I felt that if rates dropped sharply before anyone felt that a sustained economic weakness was in train, that would start a speculative bidding on commodity markets, use of credit for those purposes, and things like that   I was trying to say, President Roos, that an element in today's short-run decision probably should be how the Committee wants to phase into the targets for next year   Well, that isn't the worst That's our best guess of what these relationships are   Best estimates until--   Well, the model would have generated much bigger drops in rates than--   Well, no The credit control program [produced] drops in money supply well below what was targeted at that time So, in order to hit the target, the declines in rates would have been even more--much, much larger So, this sort of assumes hitting the targets Moreover, it does it with only 6 weeks to go; so you have to get a lot of movement in it   We also had an informal Michigan survey where we asked people what percentage of the money market funds were transactions accounts to them and what were such and such? A very small percentage was transactions   Well, this survey was conducted a few months ago  -11-    11/17/81   Mr Chairman, as a matter of interest, I've put the 1981 average over 1980 in the Bluebook   It's on page 6; it's the last line for M1-B This happens to be a year where the difference between the Q4-to-Q4 figure and the [yearly] average-over-average is a lot bigger than it is ordinarily The difference is ordinarily more like 1 or at the most 2 percentage points As you can see, it's close to 2-1/2 or 2- 3/4 percentage points That is, M1-B looks like it will grow about 4- 1/2 percent year-over-year whereas for Q4-to-Q4 it's only growing--   Yes, this is shift adjusted   Yes I'm not sure in this calculation whether we ended up shift adjusting 1980, but that would lower it from 45 to 44 or 43 percent; it wouldn't be that much of a difference   Oh, yes It averages out that over [the two] years they both come out the same, I think   Well, it's not--   It's not unreasonable to say, Mr Chairman--I hesitate to mention it--that the staff, and in a sense all of us, underestimated the offsetting downward shift we would get [along with] the upward shift in M1-B from shifts in savings accounts There were downward shifts in movements of demand deposits into other things   That's right In some sense we have two offsetting errors here   Well, what I meant was that that alternative would reduce the odds of the funds rate going to 5 percent between now and year-end and rising back up to 15 to 20 percent early next year as an effort was made to hold the aggregates next year down to, say, in the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range tentatively adopted That's literally what I had in mind   It may not be as clear as I was trying to make it The 7 percent was for the quarter   Last meeting we said we'd like the quarter to be this way The operative sentence says we're going to accept the shortfall from that so long as interest rates are declining, which could mean that 7 percent over the next two months would be a shortfall from the 7 percent for the quarter It wouldn't preclude a vote from a Committee member who favored that   Well, I was trying to say that you wouldn't really like it much below where you were going into next year   Well, I happened to look back at the data, President Corrigan, and it might be of some interest to the Committee that in June and July of last year the level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing--and I think the funds rate ran a little below the discount rate at times in that period--came out [in millions of dollars] at 104, 34, 127, 44, 75, 20, 121, and 145 for 8 straight weeks in June and July So, it can run quite low There's no guarantee, but it can run quite low   Well, borrowing sort of goes up It doesn't give you any scope for shortfalls in required reserves because you create large excess reserves That can happen That's the danger   That's only, Governor Schultz, if this so- called frictional level, which might happen in any event, is also accompanied by a very sharp rise in excess reserves Then the funds rate could drop very substantially   No   Well, roughly it would be $200 million lower on that, having started the path at--  -42-    11/17/81   Yes, I was looking at a monthly average, but it would be in that area in December It's $2 billion divided by 10, roughly It's not quite precise   Well, sometimes it means nothing One of our rules of thumb has been 25 basis points per $100 million; another has been 20 basis points They've all been wrong at various times So, one could say somewhere between 40 and 50 basis points is represented merely by that But, as the Chairman has said, misses in money supply are often much larger than this little range   Yes The difference is roughly $2 billion in December So, if we set the reserve path on the highest [growth rate] and the lowest one turns out to be what actually happens, then the average level of borrowing--   All right   The level of the money supply, M1-B, under "A" is put in at about $400 million higher in November than under "C" That's the question   Well, the reserve path difference would be very small; it's not different by much   Well, if you tell us the level of borrowing--   We will hold that level of borrowing through--   That's right And the difference in the amount of those two--   Yes But if you're asking about the difference in the amount of the nonborrowed reserve paths--   I would say Jerry is right; it's roughly $40 million You'd take the $400 million difference and divide it by 10 or something like that  -48-    11/17/81   Well, no   By December the difference is $2 billion, much of which would affect reserves in January So I'd need to make a very exact calculation here If you just take the December $2 billion difference, that would be a $200 million difference in reserves, roughly If you take the November difference, that's a difference of about $40 million in reserves, roughly And the average for the 5-week interval between Committee meetings will be somewhere between that $40 million and $200 million on a nonborrowed reserve path, given borrowing   That's right; that's how I started   Our staff projection, for what it's worth, is essentially alternative C That is, we would expect money supply growth to come in at around 5 percent in November and 6 percent in December It may be a little short of that   Right We think it will be that or a little less So if you set the path at "A" and we were nearly right on "C," then borrowing by sometime in December would probably be a couple hundred million less than whatever borrowing number you choose, assuming nothing is done to raise nonborrowed reserves That's one way of looking at it But the error could be a lot bigger than that difference, one way or the other   Right, but it depends on where you start it   Yes, then borrowing would be down to close to zero   Then you'd be $400 million below path on total reserves   Mr Chairman, I have an instinct--Mr Sternlight may have a different one or may share it--that when we're talking about borrowings between $100 and $350 million, neither of us could argue that the funds rate would be-- At the low end there's a little greater odds that it will drop below the discount rate At the high end there may be a little greater odds that occasionally it will be trading a point above the discount rate But basically it would be around the discount rate, I think   But only if required reserves turn out to be a lot weaker than our nonborrowed path   In that case the lower the growth rate in money you start from, the less chance you have of being presented with that problem early, so to speak   [The staff will] construct the path on whatever the Committee tells us   Yes, there were a couple of instances of that that I have found   It was back in December '80, but that followed a period of rapid growth  -58-    11/17/81   Yes, in May there was a shortfall from the 2-month rate specified, and it was accepted in the light of the rapid growth in April They all followed rapid growth; that's the problem They didn't follow slow growth In August, Mr Chairman, following the slow growth in July, the Committee just reaffirmed the third- quarter target of 7 percent   Yes, that's right   Mr Chairman, if I may say so, in response to President Solomon's comment I'm not an expert on public relations but the Committee had put down a third-quarter number of 7 percent; it was missed and I think it was understood For the fourth quarter a number of 7 percent also was put down, which will probably be missed and probably will be understood But if the Committee then decides to put down a November-December number that is also 7 percent, people are going to wonder after you've missed that one This would be your third try   Alternative C is essentially our projection, or we think it will come in a little lower That's why we bent the wording that way   It's not lower than where the discount rate is  I think it was "a somewhat higher growth rate would be acceptable and would be consistent with the quarterly targets previously [adopted]"   Yes It had a second sentence that it could be higher if it was consistent with the quarterly targets or something like that--   Well, for the quarter, we thought it would be a little higher than 10-1/2 percent; it could be 11 percent But the Committee's decision was 10 percent or a little higher last time   For the quarter So, it's not inconsistent with that at all   Mr Chairman, without raising any further problems for the Committee, with Governor Partee's addition of "after noting the shortfall" does the Committee want to say after the 7 percent "or somewhat more"?    Thank you, Mr Chairman   Two independent staffs within the Federal Reserve System are projecting a decline of varying magnitude So, that might add a little to [one's conviction]   Thank you, Mr Chairman   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, if our projections are right, we think M2 and M3 growth just at, or a shade below, the upper end of the ranges is consistent with growth of M1 at the midpoint That means the margin of error on the up side [for M2 and M3] is above their ranges   Yes, but our projection is for somewhat slower growth in nominal GNP over the year, which tends to hold that down   Yes, to the degree that this year might have had an unusual amount of shift into money market funds [from] market instruments or back into depository institutions that would not otherwise have been there, we would have less of that in store next year In any event, maybe somewhat optimistically, we worked our way down to a growth of just under 9 percent for M2 and M3, but it could very well be a little higher   Well, I don't have a strong feeling that way, Governor Teeters It is not too bad to think of the change in velocity of M2 as normally about zero, or not much change That would give our present projection of M2 some credibility, and that is on average what happens My instincts are not that we have severely underestimated it But, obviously, there is not any room for error in that, particularly   Well, yes I think that particular [development] has another explanation We are adjusting essentially for shifts out of existing demand deposits into NOW accounts because of the opening of NOW accounts But the big increase in November and presumably in early December was also associated with the fact that savings deposits, which had been dropping at a 20 percent or more annual rate month-after-month, stopped dropping And it is not implausible that this is an aspect of the same phenomenon That is, for precautionary reasons or what have you, people have increased their saving rate as they did in the fourth quarter and some of that money has spilled over into what they think of as the safest form one can find that has a little interest paid on it The turnaround in savings accounts and the increase in NOW accounts are--in my mind in any event--aspects of the same phenomenon So I don't take that as evidence that the shift is not over The only evidence we have that the shift is over, of course, is that the data we got on the number of NOW accounts--my memory may be off in terms of the exact numbers--was that they increased at something like a 67 percent annual rate through May And the data we now have for May through November at banks, and I think also at other depository institutions but I am not sure about the latter, show an increase in the number of accounts at only about a 12 percent annual rate So, there has been a marked, clear, and definite [deceleration] While the increase for the year is about as we had projected in July, though much more than we projected in February, the bulk of it came early in the year And then there was this marked slowing in the increase in the accounts We can never say that some inflow isn't [going into] some account that it has taken a person a year to learn about But given the publicity this past year and given these data, I feel that it is reasonable enough to say that the shift is over The risk we are open to is the risk that interest  -25-    12/21-22/81  rates may get a little lower than the staff is projecting and people may say "Well, I'll just put my money in the NOW account, particularly if that interest rate is permitted to rise some, rather than the money market fund It is insured as a NOW account; it is safe; and what do I care about 2 percentage points?" Then we would get a sharp rise But I don't think there will be a shift   I don't think that is a structural shift in the same sense that we were talking about this year It's a shift, and you probably should accommodate it, but it is a different kind of shift   I wouldn't say that is not [possible]; it is, certainly   I think the latter, too, is also a real risk   The average size of those accounts is about $125,000 The average size of accounts of the others is between $12,000 and $16,000 So, there is a sharp distinction in the holder and it is our thought that the holders of the institutional funds would otherwise be putting their money in CDs or market instruments and not otherwise be putting their money in M2-type instruments   I have not made a thorough research of the past records I would have to do that   It might be a little later than that, but it will be early next year   For sure, President Ford, we are going to be developing and suggesting a data system to capture the flows as much as possible   That is our hope In response to a Board discussion, we are in the initial stages of outlining a one-time survey; whether it will be a sample or complete [coverage] we are not certain yet For the money market funds, we have attempted to determine in more detail than we now have the various characteristics of the account the ownership, size, turnover, and other [characteristics] we may think of We would expect to have a draft of the survey in a few weeks to bring before the Board That is the stage where we are now and we hope to have it in the field relatively promptly Whether it could be done and accomplished before the February meeting, I don't know; that seems like a very tight schedule, but we are trying to [meet it]   Yes, it's tricky because that's the actual M1 not shift-adjusted over last year's regular M1, so it works out fortuitously that way   No, in '81 the year over year not shift- adjusted so-called M1 grew [69] percent, so we would get that going down to 40 percent And the shift-adjusted M1 grew 4-1/2 percent, and we get that going down to 40 percent So we really are getting a year-over-year drop   If it was exactly a 4 percent increase month by month after the first quarter, with a little slower growth in the first quarter, it would come out at 4 percent on this measure   If I might take a minute before I do that, I did look up the answer to the question that President Morris raised of whether we have ever had rapid growth in M1, such as the 4-1/2 percent rate of growth we are having in the fourth quarter, with a marked deceleration of the economy, where it is going down as it is this quarter at a 5-1/2 percent rate There are a surprising number of quarters of negative growth in the economy and positive growth in money--I am talking about on a quarterly average basis There were even quarters where we had a deceleration and then an acceleration of money, surprisingly enough For example, in the second quarter of 1979 real GNP was [minus] 1-3/4 percent after being plus [39] percent in the first quarter, and money growth went from 5-1/2 in the first quarter to 10 percent in the second quarter Similarly, in the the first quarter of '74 real GNP had dropped at around a 4 percent annual rate after rising at a 3-1/4 percent rate in the fourth quarter of '73, and money growth accelerated from 48 to 67 percent So it is not an extremely infrequent occurrence that something like that happens and, of course, we are aiming at it this time   This is only quarter to quarter I didn't trace out the averages I was just responding to the question   But it's even the case going back   Well, that is a different question I was just responding to the question that President Morris raised of whether within a quarter we had had this kind of movement Our observation is that it's not as rare as one might have thought it would be  Mr Chairman, we designed the short-run alternatives on the basis of the tentative range of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent that the Committee had set for M1-B and on the basis of the Committee's previous practice of, in effect, shifting the base to the actual level of money Alternative A was designed to hit the upper end of that 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range, alternative C to hit the lower end, and alternative B to be in between by March It is a fairly mechanical setting of the ranges Thus, from the fourth-quarter average that we suggested as a base, the growth rate for alternative A is 5-1/2 percent, the upper end of the range That [took account of] how the Committee has set short-run ranges before Our thought was that December as a base is somewhat unstable because we don't know the  -50-    12/21-22/81  number yet If it did come out as we are projecting, the implied growth rates are so low that they raise the possibility of being subject to some misinterpretation when put out in the directive An alternative way of doing it would be to make the base November, which the Committee has done before, and the growth rates for alternatives A, B, and C would be about 03 lower That is, the 5-1/2 percent with November as a base would be 52 percent to hit the upper end of the range; and that 03 would extend across all of the other alternatives That, as I say, the Committee has done one time before   Yes With regard to the implications of these alternatives for credit markets (and assuming less of a demand shift, so to speak, than took place in 1981) our analysis suggested that the odds were--unless the economy was considerably weaker than is being projected--that there would be not much room for further interest rate declines under either alternatives B or C, which call for really quite modest growth in money consistent with the Committee's long-run range Under alternative A it looked to us as if there was more of a possibility for declines in interest rates given the GNP projection So, in a sense, one way of putting it is that the Committee's choice would be to set a target depending on how it tends to lean in its attitude toward credit markets at this time, before the recovery has started To the degree that the Committee wishes to give a little impetus to easing in credit markets in order to encourage the recovery, that tends to argue, of course, for the more liberal [fourth quarter to March] alternative within the Committee's range To the degree that the Committee would want to leave more room for expansion later and believes the recovery has enough momentum and can turn around on its own, that tends to argue for an alternative of lower growth, leaving a little more room later to finance the expansion as it develops  I should mention one other point, Mr Chairman, with regard to the borrowing assumption We have assumed borrowing in alternative B of around $450 million, which is a little higher than we have actually attained in recent weeks Again, to the degree that the Committee wants to lean toward a little easing in credit markets in setting its monetary target, consideration could be given to lowering that more toward the levels of borrowing that are suggested for alternative A, which would be around $250 million That leaves a range, obviously, in between   We've assumed in the Bluebook that if the path were $450 million and it was successfully hit, probably there would be some little upward tick in the funds rate, but maybe not a lot I would assume that $350 million at a minimum would probably avoid that; whether that would cause the funds rate to drop initially, I feel more agnostic about   I'll give you the precise numbers in just a second It has been running about $340 million this week so far and that would be about the average For the week of the 16th it was $268 million; for the 9th, $493 million; for the 2nd, $192 million; and before that, $214 million [For that period] we were expecting borrowing of $400 million or higher   Well, initially But excess reserves were revised upward successively as the weeks passed They ran a little low in two out of the first three weeks and were very high in one of them, so they averaged [close to expectations] in the first three weeks and then were very low last week Last week [excess] was negative; I don't how it's coming out this week It didn't turn out to be nearly as low as it looked at the beginning because we got "as- of" adjustments subsequently   Well, I don't think much   I think the funds rate would stay somewhat above the discount rate at that level of borrowing When borrowing in the first two weeks of this intermeeting period was around $200 million, the funds rate was a little below the then discount rate And in the next week borrowing was $493 million, followed by $268 million and thus far this week $330 million or so, and the funds rate has been about 1/2 point above the discount rate So, it's probably a little above--   Well, for December, the M2 growth estimate is rather high, given [the data] we now have In the last week growth of money market funds was a little slower That's not much to base [your decision] upon But [flows into money funds] have usually slowed down, with a lag, following a period of declining market rates   We really have not allowed for the savings accounts to show the same kind of strength, so to speak, that they've shown If they showed that kind of strength, it would spill over also into NOW accounts, I think We haven't allowed for that continuing Those are the two principal factors   That's right, and a very marked slowing in January   Well, those are the two factors, Governor Partee The only thing I could offer is to look at October, which was 8 percent   Well, we were assuming that at the beginning of January we would switch over to M1 as is and do away with M1-A and M1- B But we had hoped to make the other changes effective in February when we've [typically] done the seasonals and the benchmarking and do it all at once Because there are other--   That I don't know That depends   No, I was thinking of the other ones   Well, I was assuming you'd start in January with regular M1   M1   Well, you're comparing it with old M1-B, which is in effect M1 That's right M1-B not shift-adjusted is M1   Well, there's roughly a 12--     Well, that number we know It's the shift- adjusted number that's a little doubtful   That's right   Well, it rose from 3 percent to 11 percent in one month   I think the Committee once did have [something like] that in the directive, too, for some reason   Well, I think these are very small differences, Governor Teeters, given our track record in predicting these relationships I don't think it is a matter of strong significance for the Committee, actually   I was trying, Mr Chairman, to make that apply also to M2 to allow for savings deposits which have been very strong as well And we're not predicting any strength here   I know we did once before   I am not sure if it was for both M1 and M2 It certainly was on M1   Yes The policy record in that light, Mr Chairman, with regard to M2--   With regard to M2--and also M1, more tentatively--the policy record [for the November meeting] clearly indicates that the Committee expected a slower growth rate in the course of the quarter That is, the 9 to 10 is really consistent--it wouldn't be that specific with something like 7 to 8 percent [for M1-B]   For M1 it would be somewhere between 4-1/2 and 5-3/4 percent on a quarterly average basis, and for M2 somewhere between 9-3/4 and 10-1/2 percent They are fairly high   Yes, the monthly growth rates are slow  -72-    12/21-22/81   Something like that [No], by March it is that big, so it is less [for the next few weeks]   Well, we could certainly expand on it   Maybe I could explain, President Balles We could develop it further, of course But one of the things that came out of that study we did last year was that in terms of analysis and achievement of targets, the best kind of borrowing assumption to assume at the beginning of our path is the borrowing assumption that seemed to be consistent with the interest rates that come out of the money supply target So, generally what we try to put down is what the Committee in reaching its decision may wish to use as an initial borrowing figure Heaven alone knows what the final borrowing will be because that depends on how the money supply actually behaves Presumably what the Committee makes its decision on, in some sense, is first whether it believes those relationships, and second, how it might wish to tilt, if it wishes to tilt, the initial starting point But after the initial starting point, this borrowing is pretty well dominated by what happens to the money supply   We also plan to have alternative strategies, if the Committee wishes, as we have put it at other times, on implications for phasing down or staying the same    Well, so far as we could tell, in the last 2 or 3 months we have had this very sharp run-up in the money supply, which partly was expected, given interest rates, and partly unexpected I can't divide it very easily between the expected and unexpected parts, but I would point out, as many of you have heard, of course, that we have had a fairly sharp turnaround in all of the components of money; but in particular the turnaround in other checkable deposits seems to be correlated with a turnaround in savings deposits For example, the savings deposit component of M2 declined over the 6-month period from April to October '81 at about a 21 percent annual rate at a time when other checkable deposits were growing at around a 15 percent annual rate I picked that period because that is after the bulk of the shifting into other checkable deposits was finished in the first 4 months of the year Since October--in the last 3 months--savings deposits on the new seasonals have increased at a 12 percent annual rate, compared with this 21 percent decline, and other checkable deposits have moved from a 15 percent annual rate of increase to a 53 percent annual rate of increase At the same time, of course, demand deposits have turned around They had been declining at a 6 percent annual rate and are now expanding at a 6-1/2 percent rate through January But the bulk of that expansion in January occurred in the first week and is now ending, whereas the expansion in other checkable deposits has remained strong through the balance of January So, I think the demand deposit expansion is working its way out whereas as yet we have not seen the NOW account and savings deposit expansion working its way out  We've tried to investigate the various reasons for the increase in savings and in demand deposits We have surveyed the banks and we have not gotten very satisfactory replies In my view some of it is related to nonconsumption, just savings resulting from a failure to consume [and funds] flowing into the easiest alternatives for a while--demand deposits, NOW accounts, and savings deposits Some of it is related to actual financial uncertainties We see that in time certificates; small time certificate growth slowed very noticeably in December and January, and that money is being placed elsewhere, at least temporarily, in more protected forms And we have heard bits and pieces of evidence that corporate demand deposits were  -16-    2/1-2/82  rising toward year-end and early in the year, partly for corporate window-dressing and partly for compensation balances However, those were bits and pieces of evidence and they were not very clear-cut  This rapid expansion has tended to exhaust much of the growth for the year [allowed for] in the tentative targets, as the Committee can see by observing chart 1, following page 11 in the Bluebook That range of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is plotted from the actual level for M1 in the fourth quarter of 1981 As you can see, the January expansion has brought growth well above the range; growth is well above the parallel dashed lines [unintelligible] In effect, much of the expansion for the year has been used up It is quite possible that we could get negative numbers in February and March As the Bluebook points out, we had that in 1981 following the April bulge at a time when short rates rose very sharply And that has occurred on rare occasions at other times But absent such a sharp drop, the amount of monetary expansion [that could occur] over the balance of the year is relatively limited [if money growth is to be] within the tentative range adopted by the Committee That, of course, Mr Chairman, brings up questions about the range and its basing and whether it should be raised   The data we got show that--   That's right This was all [accounted for by] existing accounts going up    2/1-2/82 -18-   Well, there's a correlation, obviously It wouldn't be there if we hadn't put the reserves in The question one has to ask oneself is Why this much money at current interest rates or rising interest rates? That is the question, mostly, that we are trying to answer Why has the demand for money at current interest rates expanded? If we had somehow managed to get all those reserves out and not permitted this much money in these NOW accounts and demand deposits and currency, then it's our thought that, of course, interest rates would have been a lot higher So we'd have to ask if you'd still be wanting to know the answer to the question at that point If we had succeeded in doing that and had these high interest rates, you would want to know why interest rates were so high in the middle of a recession and we'd be trying to explain why the demand for money was strong That's what we're looking for, those kinds of explanations   Well, I'd have to go back and review We tried to [determine] the extent to which we might have been off on the multiplier relationships that we put in the reserves to money path Of course, we change these each week as we get data, and with lagged reserve accounting in some sense we are always perfect on it But the current relationship doesn't mean anything and the lagged one does I don't recall to what extent we've had to change them We've made considerable changes, but I don't recall that as being a big source of error with the lagged reserve accounting   Well, President Roos, maybe to put a little perspective on this--I don't know about those figures but I'm sure they're accurate--from September to December of [last] year the Committee originally wanted M1-B growth, shift adjusted, of around 7 percent They changed it a bit in mid-course By the time September to December was over, we had [M1-B] growth on the order of 8-1/4 percent I haven't checked the most recent seasonal figures, but these are the figures before they were adjusted That's not far off from what the Committee found perfectly acceptable and is probably on the order of what the Committee would find generally acceptable given what happened What then occurred was that January growth was unusually high, going into a period when the Committee wanted growth to phase down into the longer-run range It was made unusually high by a bulge in demand deposits early in the month, which I believe is in process of working its way out, though not entirely And it has been maintained at a high rate by NOW accounts not quite working their way out so far but, in fact, growing faster in January on average than in the preceding two months In light of all that and with total reserves running strong, of course, a downward adjustment of around $190 million was made in the nonborrowed path midway through this period We put additional pressure on the funds rate There's no way in a period as short as a month, given lagged reserve accounting or possibly even given contemporaneous reserve accounting, to have gotten that growth of 20 percent down to, say, 5 or 6 percent or whatever the Committee would have felt comfortable with, short of a funds rate moving up I would guess into the 27, 28 percent area, with contemporaneous accounting I made a theoretical calculation at one point, which would not have changed the basic question that the Chairman raised as to why money demand was so strong in this very short-run period One would have had to answer that question either way But I think the actions taken with regard to the reserve path were such as to work in a constraining direction   Yes   If we had pulled out $400 million, we would have had more borrowing, of course But all the research I've seen suggests that to pull out $400 million of total reserves in a month-- under contemporaneous reserve accounting, let's say, not under lagged --we would have to reduce nonborrowed reserves by something like $3 billion because the banks are going to offset that with borrowing And if we reduced nonborrowed reserves by about $3 billion, the banks would borrow $26 billion to get the total down $400 million, and interest rates would go up extraordinarily high That's how the mechanism would work in the short run You might conceivably get January down, assuming contemporaneous reserve accounting, but then interest rates would be so high that February would be plunging negative Then interest rates would have to drop very sharply to induce banks to expand again and get the February growth up That's how the process seems to work    2/1-2/82   Well, in my judgment, President Roos, last April that bulge probably would have come out to some degree without our doing anything--that is, with interest rates unchanged And the rise in rates that occurred--because it was just [due to] temporary factors--of course encouraged it to come out more It may even have contributed to money running low for the rest of the month So, I'm not sure how the variability would have worked out in that respect You can make the case that you could get less variability in money growth with less variability in interest rates if you examine these things carefully through a different procedure   Mr Chairman, President Corrigan mentioned the effect of interest rates and I probably should point out to the Committee that our monthly money market model, which is very often wrong and is sometimes right, would have projected very sharp growth in the money supply That is one of the reasons we thought [M1] would grow in November and December, way back when And [the model] would project that growth continuing on, given interest rate moves that had already occurred, into January--but not at this rate--and February and March and petering out after that On the other hand, if you look at our quarterly model, it would suggest that the money growth we've gotten in January is more than enough to finance the quarter's income, given interest rates And to get what it says we would have for the quarter, then we would have to expect [M1 in] February and March to drop at around a 13 or 14 percent annual rate That's just about what the money model says it is going to increase So, the models tend to give varying results   We looked into that, President Guffey The Bach Committee a long time ago recommended an alternative measure of the money supply which grosses up the demand deposits side by adding "due to" [balances] and grosses up the subtraction by adding "due from" [balances] Presumably, then, we would not have this bias you are talking about We keep track of that series seasonally adjusted and compare it with our current series seasonally adjusted And they have shown similar patterns; that is, they both showed this sharp bulge in early January and they showed subsequent weeks about the same Actually, the alternative series showed larger growth unadjusted in November and December than did the present series So, we have used that as the basis for checking We are well aware that this bias could arise and could get worse It's there, but it could get worse But it doesn't seem to be getting worse and making our present measure more biased in terms of growth rates at the moment   Well, there is nothing in any evidence we've ever looked at or in any experience certainly in the past two or three years and earlier that says that money demand is naturally smooth In this large an economy, it seems to me that money demand is naturally volatile And we're annualizing, and the numbers look terrible A 15 percent change in a level looks like 20 percent because we're annualizing it We probably shouldn't be annualizing those monthly figures It gives a wrong impression   So, I don't think that policy is ever going to get away from the question of Do you want to try for a smooth growth path with what every bit of evidence anyone has dug up says will be sharp variations in interest rates--and you can only do that with contemporaneous reserve accounting, if then--or are you going to try for a path over a more sustained period of time and live with the short-run variations in money demand that seem to be built into the kind of economy we have? We have this huge economy with several hundreds of billions of dollars of money flowing daily, some of which happens to sit in demand deposits on top of which--and I don't mean this to sound preachy--we now have a narrow money supply that has savings in it They are not being paid a very high rate, but they are what many people consider savings When these NOW accounts were installed, people in many cases just transferred what were savings accounts into NOW accounts So, for whatever reason, people decided to increase their savings, and it flowed into these accounts You and I know they have very low rates of interest, but many people feel they are safe And people are willing to take that [low rate] for a very short period So, we have a mix that is changing over time, making it even more complicated to evaluate money movements, which to me means that one has to have a longer-term horizon to come to some judgment Sure, we could begin to constrain it faster by letting interest rates rise faster, lowering nonborrowed reserves faster, raising the discount rate But that again gets into areas of policy judgment for the Committee as to whether it wishes to put those kinds of interest rate variations in the economy or live with the potential for a little more money volatility or whatever trade-offs it can think of there    2/1-2/82   We're trying That's right Last year we did some very complicated [calculations] by assuming that part of the NOW accounts were demand deposits and part of them were savings deposits In concept, that's right, but it strikes me as a distinction that is going to be impossible to [judge] in terms of whether [the actual proportion] is 2/3 or 3/4 or 1/2 So, we felt that as time went on we should simply begin constructing a seasonal for total demand and NOW accounts based on the movement of the total and that whatever difference there is in the movement, with the increasing composition of NOW accounts, it gradually will be worked out in the seasonals And that's how we have begun to proceed   I'd have to look up the answer to that We'll check that out I don't know, but I doubt it   Yes, it's an OCD   That's right; that's pure projection   Yes, it was 04 percent   Well, it's getting much less sensitive to market rates So, we wouldn't think it's [going to be] as volatile as [those] rates change The conclusion we came to in evaluating this was that with more and more instruments in M2 having market rates, for any given reserve target aimed at we'd get more rate movement in holding money growth and prompter income movements, so to speak That is, you hold if there's a money demand of so much--   There is a money demand of so much Market rates tend to rise In the old days, people would shift out of M2- type instruments into market instruments Now, instead of that happening, the institutions mark up the offering rates so people don't shift out So, if you insist on holding [M2 growth down], then interest rates rise even more on both instruments until income falls    2/1-2/82  back to where you're producing only enough savings to be consistent with your monetary targets   In the limit, not totally   Well, I don't think the institutions will move their rates quite as fast as the market rates So, I think it would have some effect   Mr Chairman, it's very difficult to isolate the structural changes as they're occurring now, operating with an instrument that pretty much has market rates in it For example, I would not argue that M1 was weak last year because in a sense M2 was strong There was a partial element of that but there was a downward shift in the demand for M1, where people were taking money out of currency and demand deposits and putting it into a lot of other assets, some of which were in M2 But that was a substitution that didn't affect M2 itself So actually, on the level of M1, the downward adjustment in M1 that occurred was a structural change that was evolving When we get away from that structural change, it's quite possible that M1 and M2 will move closer together as we are projecting that they will this year We really have a slower growth in the nontransactions component of M2 this year than last year, largely because income is growing more slowly and we expect M1 to grow a little more normally in relation to income than it did last year With that combination we still would have M2 slowing in this coming year We don't have a reason to think the nontransactions component of M2 will grow substantially faster in 1982 than it did in 1981 with a sharp slowing in income in prospect, regardless of the interest rates that they're offering on those [deposits]   Yes We have growth a little above the midpoint for M2 but, rather than put our neck out on the line, I think the safer way to put it is that it's a lot more consistent than it was last year   No We are just going to be getting the first complete data at the end of February We may not make [the decision] then   Well, we haven't done anything about the IRAs in M2 We're waiting to see what we're dealing with    2/1-2/82   [From] the money market funds they can go into bonds   No, but it doesn't sound wrong It sounds about right   There's a discussion in the Bluebook of shifting the base, Mr Chairman   There's a text discussion in paragraph 14   47 percent   That's right If you hit the upper limit, it would be around 6 percent; at the midpoint it would be around 5 percent   President Roos, may I just make a comment? When you observe in the market that there is an increase in money and short-term rates go up, it is not in my opinion because people believe that there's going to be more inflation In my opinion--and this is what is predicted in the Bluebook--it is because the market believes that the Federal Reserve is going to hit its longer-run targets and, therefore, will take action to restrain the growth in money that has bulged in the short run because of the [increased] demand And with demand high relative to the supply, the price, as Governor Wallich says, goes up And the price of money is the interest rate Therefore, they realize that interest rates are going to go up in the short run and short-term interest rates are what we're dealing with   In large part, Governor Teeters, the [OCDs] were a lot weaker than we had allowed for in the path So, if we hadn't taken out the reserves that had been allowed to support them, of course, they would have supported even more money growth And for similar reasons, if we had left the reserves in, they would have supported more total deposits Those were the essential multiplier adjustments, and they were larger than they normally are   One point, President Black--and this is somewhat subjective because I don't have the data laid out--is that we know for sure that, for one reason or another, the relation between borrowing and the funds rate has become a lot looser over the last year or two than it had been Often we get a level of borrowing without as much pressure associated with it in the funds market as one might have expected It could be that in this period when things are confused by year-end [pressures] and all that, and in addition it is early in a period of pressure on bank reserve positions--that is, it has only been three or four weeks or so of which the first week or two are uncertain, because it was the year-end period--it may simply take more time for those pressures to build up The function may be somewhat asymmetric or something The banks may have to be in debt for a longer period before we get as marked a reaction as we might have expected ahead of time So, if they have these kinds of pressures for a more sustained period, we might see a more prompt reaction in market conditions than when they first get in debt by $1 billion or so   We have assumed a sharp deceleration in money demand in all of the alternatives in that we don't think the high double-digit growth rates of the past three months on average will persist We have not assumed in any of them a contraction in the outstanding amount of money over a two-month period We could have a 1 percent [annualized rate of] increase--say, a -7 percent [annual growth rate one month] and a +9 percent [in the next month] or something That is possible, but we have not assumed a contraction over a two-month period in any of the alternatives unless action is taken to make market instruments more attractive, which in effect means interest rates rising, which is the assumption of alternative A    2/1-2/82  That is, we believe that a contraction could be attained but with interest rates rising substantially Alternatives B, C, and D suggest much slower growth rates than we have had and alternatives B and C would hit the upper limit of the present long-run [range] later Alternative D remains outside [the range] if the Committee were to vote for a continuation of the [previously set] growth rates over the rest of the year  I might add, Mr Chairman, that because of this problem we did suggest a second alternative in the Bluebook for the directive language on the thought that the Committee may not wish to squeeze the economy further in order to attain the contraction but might find such a contraction highly welcome if it were to develop without squeezing the economy further The second of the two alternative languages presented, while it need not be different in the substance of the numbers, is somewhat different in the public posture it portrays about the Committee decision It is meant to provide an alternative which would in effect welcome a sharp drop [in money growth], provided that the drop could be attained without squeezing the economy further   I meant that if the Committee targeted on a drop of 7 percent, our suggestion would be that to attain that we'd need borrowing to start as high as $3 billion But suppose the Committee said no, we don't believe that; our thought would still be that if you targeted on a drop as low as 7 percent and even if you started with borrowings where they are now, the required reserves would immediately come in higher than is consistent with that drop And borrowing would tend to rise very sharply, so that you would get a sharp rise in short-term rates because the immediate demands for money would be in excess of the -7 percent that was targeted If we're wrong about that--and we may very well be--then we would not get this rise in interest rates So, what I meant by squeezing the economy was that the Committee may choose not to target on such a thing on the grounds that it runs greater risks of raising interest rates in the middle of a recession But it may wish to target on something involving a slower deceleration into the long-run targets--a more gradual slowing on the grounds that that minimizes the chances of rising rates On the other hand, the Committee might be quite willing to accept a sharp decline if that could be attained without further upward pressure on short rates at this time   Well, I've just given the substance of the comments I had written out, Mr Chairman   Well, one could base it from December to March The first alternative left that blank in case the Committee wished to    2/1-2/82  retain November or December or whatever The second alternative was designed just to make it clear that the Committee wants a deceleration from the very recent growth rates, which was January essentially That was what was carrying the Committee beyond its tolerance point, so it just seemed natural to base it on January We have full data through the 20th of January and partial data through the 27th; so there may be a change in the base but not as substantial a change as it appeared we would have in December because we had quite a bit less data for December when the Committee met last time   That's what your base was before   The December-to-March numbers consistent with alternatives B and C, President Solomon, are 8 percent and 9 percent for M1 That's why in alternative I [of the draft directive language] we left it for the Committee to fill in whichever base it felt most comfortable with Alternative II suggests simply [to base on] January, to make clear that with January behind us the Committee wishes to get money growth moving back toward the range That's the essential reason for that approach   In our judgment, it could go as high as $3 billion because we believe that we can't get that kind of reduction for two months without a further rise in the funds rate, even though the economy is as weak as it seems But I have a certain degree of uncertainty about that because our quarterly model does suggest, if you believe it, that given the amount of money that has already been produced and given the weakness of the economy, that that amount of money isn't in effect needed for transactions associated with GNP in the first quarter But it might be needed for precautionary purposes, so you have to force interest rates up to get it out of there   Oh, it could go a bit higher; that's correct We assumed that was consistent with a fairly high funds rate But it could be anything   It depends on how hard you want to fight it   That's correct   Yes, in general, it's right in that order of magnitude   Well, our thought at the moment is that something like what you described will develop more or less given demands at something like current interest rates That is, we will get a sharp deceleration in money growth to a 1 to 2 percent monthly growth rate over the next couple of months--it's implicit in that--and a moderate rate of growth over the second quarter Where we would see more of a sharp effect on output would be if that pattern required higher interest rates because there were bigger demands for money than are implicit there Then we would see much sharper effects on output But our projection for GNP is based on a pattern somewhat like what you were describing, on the thought that that will not be accompanied by substantially different interest rates than we now have   It all depends, President Roos, on one's assessment of the demand for money relative to the amount the Committee is willing to supply   It's very difficult   Right   Pardon?   The 23rd would be the alternate date    2/1-2/82   We would have partial data for the 17th and the 3rd and 10th would be published   Tomorrow we'll have partial data for the 3rd   That's right   Mr Chairman, the staff's view is that the data would have suggested there were stronger arguments for raising the range for M2 in the previous two years than there are this year, given our [GNP] projections   Yes   Not very consciously at all, Mr Chairman I don't know what one would say One percent on M1 is about $18 billion, which is probably as reasonable an estimate as one might make if you consider 10 million people at a $2,000 maximum per person   Yes, that's right I'm saying as an upper limit I would think 1 percentage point is not unreasonable So, it would be small in practice   Governor Gramley, if I might say, believable or not, the staff forecast is based on the scenario you described--that is, virtually no growth in money over the next couple of months and then three quarters of growth averaging 13 or 14 percent quarterly And as you have pointed out, that requires, if you believe the models, a resumption of the downward drift in so-called money demands after this quarter at a rate almost as rapid, but not quite, as we had all of last year So, if that does not develop, then we would get much higher interest rates, at least in the short run   That is right, on that assumption of a--   That is right, but with some further downward shifts in [unintelligible]  -95-    2/1-2/82   For M3? For M3 we would have growth of around 9 percent   Well, we have in M3 many things that are not in bank credit, such as the money market funds and Eurodollars held overseas I think that is a good part of the reason   That would be the large CDs, the long-term RPs, and Eurodollars other than overnight--those maturing in more than one day   I stand corrected on the Eurodollars, which are in L   We will be collecting data to the end of getting the aggregate instead of just the various subcomponents that we now have   8 percent   That is our projection   I think the Committee might as well stay with the range it has of 6 to 9 percent   We will make the proper adjustment for the bank credit base because of the IBFs We either have to go from December- January or the fourth quarter, properly adjusted, because of the IBF shifts   It would still be 8 percent [growth] from the December-January base That is how our estimates fell   Well, the last time it was used was in December 1980 We said "In the light of the rapid growth of money and credit aggregates in recent months, some shortfall [from what had been specified] would be acceptable in the near term if that developed in the context of reduced pressures in the money market" That is what the directive said in December 1980   If that were an updating meeting, Mr Chairman, I assume you would not need the full panoply of staff presentations    Well, I was going to include a bit of it in my statement, Mr Chairman, but our underlying estimate for April is somewhere between 8 and 10 percent, as you can see from the Bluebook In our seasonal adjustment methodology, we have followed strictures given to us by the various academic groups who looked at our seasonal methodology--the last one being a group headed by Jeffrey Moore and including such people as the former Presidents of the American Statistical Association, and the august Mr Box of Box-Jenkins And they say avoid judgment They also asked that it be reproducible outside and that we take into account a technique called an Arima method, which projects the unadjusted data for the year ahead on the basis of the past performance of the data to eliminate the revisions in the seasonal factor by getting a better sense of '82 So, this year we adopted the X-11 Arima method   If we had not adopted that method but had continued with our old X-11 without the Arima method, we would be allowing for about 7 percentage points more growth in April than we are now If we had instead used the present method but unleashed our judgmental man, Mr Fry, we would have allowed for 2 percentage points more growth So, that presents a range perhaps of where we might be erring on predicting too low a growth There are some odds, Mr Chairman, that what we have done is correct, however   I would point out that in that case one would look more at what we have judged to be the intrinsic error in the seasonal adjustment process And at the 95 percent level, that's plus or minus 6 percentage points in any month, at an annual rate   So, in assessing the forthcoming situation for the Committee, we have tilted toward thinking that the seasonal might be understating the actual seasonal increase because of the difficulties of '80 and '81, and thus we are projecting 8 to 10 percent growth rates If you think that we have understated by 5 percentage points, that would mean we're projecting 3 to 5 percent growth in some real sense Now, if we are understating, it's probably the case that May and June will be a lot lower It looks as if May and June would be mostly the times when, whatever error in the seasonal in this period, the curves would be taken out April is a particularly difficult time    3/29-30/82   Just looking at the data judgmentally, it looked as if that's when it would be April is a difficult month because we had the credit control program in 1980 and we had a very sharp decrease; and in 1981 we had a very sharp increase, part of which probably can be attributed to the preceding easing of monetary policy when interest rates went down some The machines have a very difficult time with these extreme variations and we have done some [judgmental] intervention to smooth it in 1980, and these results reflect those interventions Also, the machine throws out 1981, by the way   Well, I feel rather agnostic about it I am not all that certain If we follow the advice of a group of academic experts, at times we may be right And we don't want to discount that [possibility]   Well, we have indicated how we make our seasonal adjustments to this We explained the X-11 Arima But, of course, the market has the same suspicions most of you and many on the staff have That this still isn't sufficient allowance for the April seasonal   That's correct   Well, we didn't throw 1980 out   We didn't throw out 1980, Mr Chairman And there is really a technical problem We intervened through a model to smooth through and--   No, it lowered it In effect, it put in a modest growth rate, which made the machine doubt the accelerated trend in '76 to '79    3/29-30/82   Yes   Oh, yes; that's right   Well, I would relax myself if it were between 8 and 10 percent I think you're getting on to strong policy judgments beyond that I would not really want to give any technical advice on that particular point   Again, it's hard to psychoanalyze people But I would assume that they would understand that 8 to 10 percent might be the peculiarities of April and the difficulties of seasonally adjusting in the face of tax payments, refunds, and all that   Well, I don't think I have that with me I have the seasonally unadjusted weekly pattern on another paper but I don't have that with me   Yes, it's 40 percent   I don't have that; I can get it by tomorrow   Oh, yes  SPEAKER(?) Well, there's a huge social security thing coming up again   No, if we keep the same unadjusted increases we now have and use the old X-11 method untampered by Arima, it would be something like 7 percentage points less than this 8 to 10 at an annual rate  SPEAKER(?) If my understanding of that is right, it would be 1 or 2 percent?   Well, that's a large number and we wouldn't have used it But that's what it would be if we didn't change our unadjusted number It allows for 7 percent at an annual rate more increase in money supply [for] the seasonal purposes alone Instead of the money supply increase unadjusted being 40 percent at an annual    3/29-30/82  rate in April it would have allowed for 47 percent That's well above what it has been   No   No, smaller   At present for demand deposits plus OCDs in 1982 we're allowing for, in annual rates again, a 416 percent seasonal increase In 1976 this was 359 percent; in 1977, it was 398; in 1978, it was 430; in 1979, it was 437; we forget about 1980; in 1981, it was 426; and in 1982, we have 416 Under these various methods we could add to that 416 this 7 percentage points As I say, our judgmental fellow would have added 2 points to that to make it 436, or the same as in 1979, which is only 2 percent at an annual rate If we took the extreme, it would be 7 percent  SPEAKER(?) And the one in the Bluebook forecast is which now?   Well, it's what we've been using--the published figure   Yes Well, January took care of a good part of that   I doubt it; it's really a time series analysis  -10-    3/29-30/82   Well, if there were a very large fundamental change in the tax laws or tax structure that we could see would change things, despite all our academic experts, we would do something judgmentally [to adjust it] But so far as we can tell from the refund estimates and the tax payment estimates, we're not confronted with that   Thus far in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, we have $70 billion out of our projected deficit of $111 billion That leaves a mere $41 billion to go and they're not going to have a seasonal surplus They're going to have a very small deficit in the second and third quarters of the year And then in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, the third quarter of the calendar year, we get the tax decrease It's not very difficult to get up over $100 billion   We do have a number of people starting to work --they have been at it for about three weeks--on very detailed analyses of the variability we've had since October '79 They are trying to isolate what we can attribute to special credit controls and NOW accounts and are trying to relate the method of operations to any elasticities in response to interest rate changes, with the aim of seeing if the method involves greater fluctuations in both necessarily or if it's an accidental product I hope we will have some results to report   Well, some of that will be implicit in my comments In a sense, it assumes that the buildup in liquidity in the first quarter and late last year, reflected in first-quarter average growth in M1 of around 10 percent and also a large increase in M2, is divested; it is used willingly by the public to finance an expansion in spending If it is not and if the public really wants to hold that  -26-    3/29-30/82  liquidity--it wasn't just a temporary reaction to uncertainty which is going to be unwound--then our interest rate forecast of a very slight decline might even seem a bit optimistic, which would make the GNP forecast a bit optimistic That's how I would respond to it Maybe Jim--   Well, as I mentioned to the Board yesterday, I refused to put the 1983 interest rate forecast in the Bluebook this time because that's such a long way off Attitudes might change and we could have a wholly different outlook But our basic interest rate forecast is for high interest rates in '83 of about this dimension And with the deficit being even larger, one might want to question again the possibility of that being associated with the type of real GNP growth we have But the quarterly model, which is of course often wrong, would suggest growth at these interest rates also This is somewhat different from President Solomon's question of how can we reconcile this and not have interest rates higher But even at this higher level, the quarterly model would suggest that real growth will indeed appear to be something like what we have projected   Well, Jim may--   But that assumes, with this strength in demand, that the amount of money created in November, December, January, and to a degree in February, which was just a minor drop, is used by the public--just to use a word that comes easily to mind--willingly That is, they don't want to borrow additionally to hold that money; they don't have to be cadged out of it by even higher interest rates That money is used by the public willingly to finance spending And if it isn't, then I don't think this forecast is consistent with declining interest rates I don't think this forecast is consistent with your monetary targets   Exactly That's going to be the burden of this implicitly   Well, on short-term interest rates, I think it is simply that the Committee's targets are low relative to the demand for money in the current situation I think short-term interest rates, except for minor variations, are pretty much determined by the demand and supply for money in the very short run On the longer-term rates, I would say that probably the world isn't yet convinced that the rate of inflation isn't going to get worse when we get out of this rather deep recession It may not be as bad as it has been, but it may become worse certainly than it is now Secondly, the policy of attempting to control the money supply month-by-month, which can't be done, has led to fluctuations in short-term rates because of the way the money supply behaves [It is] out of sync with fluctuations in the business cycle and people are not convinced when rates go down that they're not going to go back up And, therefore, there is not a great incentive, once short rates go down, to move immediately into the long-term market and capture a higher yield because one could stay short--and who knows?--the short-term rate may be back up later and one doesn't have to worry immediately about getting into long-term securities So, I think that's another factor, which is sometimes called the liquidity premium, or risk premium Those are my essential explanations The thought that the rate of inflation will continue to decelerate over the long run is not firmly in the minds of investors And they believe there's no real penalty for staying short because they're not convinced that when short rates come down they won't go back up, as has been happening cyclically, because we've been trying to control the money supply independently, in a sense, of the business cycle And I believe the short-term rates are determined by money demand and supply under the current conditions   Yes, I should have mentioned that the way I think the budget outlook enters into this is that it keeps the public convinced that inflation is not going to get better That's how I think the budget enters into people's thinking It's not just merely that there will be more securities to absorb, although that's a factor in the government securities market as such, but that the odds are that when we get on the up side of the cycle inflation will get worse So, it is a strong factor   Mr Chairman, if the Committee will bear with me, I have a a body of anti-climatic comments, I'm afraid [Statement --see Appendix]   Well, I'll try [A policy stance] somewhere between alternative A and alternative B is consistent in the short run, we believe, with the staff economic projection One can't be very specific there, but if the choice is somewhere between alternatives A and B, that essentially says that interest rates ought  -33-    3/29-30/82  to track down a little in the very short run Over the long run, as you know, a recovery is projected, fueled by defense spending and the impact on consumer spending of the tax cut at midyear At the moment, we think that could be done without any further rise in interest rates into late next year because of people having accumulated liquidity  Alternative C says that interest rates might go up, and probably will go up, substantially; and even "B" says some rates may have a little back-tracking in them I believe "C" is quite inconsistent with anything like the pattern of recovery [forecast] because whatever initiative might be coming in terms of housing being vaguely sustained and inventories not being a drag, I think the rise in interest rates entailed by alternative C would turn those factors less positive if not absolutely negative Thus, we would not get an environment consistent with economic recovery not to mention the psychological impact of the greater doubts cast upon the safety and soundness of thrift institutions under the circumstances That would be my answer In a long-run sense, one might argue then that alternative C is most consistent with getting inflation under control   Oh, yes It depends on where [in the range] the Committee wants to hit for the year As we tried to show in the table toward the back of the Bluebook, adoption of alternative B, for example, would be consistent with [M1] growth in the second half of the year, on a June-to-December basis, of 3-1/2 to 5 percent, depending on whether the Committee aims at the middle or the upper part of the present range, letting alone any base shifting that might be considered Alternative A would be consistent with growth in the 2-3/4 to 4 percent range Our assumption is that inflation rates will be down and that there will be some cyclical expansion in velocity and those growth rates might be generally consistent with a reasonable rebound It may not be as large as we have there, but somewhere in that magnitude   Mr Chairman, if I just might clarify one comment you made The nontransactions component of M2 was growing very moderately in December, January, and February, after having grown rapidly in November The latest data we have for the weeks of March suggest a very rapid growth--something like 12 percent at an annual rate in that month--and that is what brings the growth in the first three months of this year up to around 9-1/2 percent And we believe you have to get it lower than that--not a lot lower, but maybe down to the high 8 or low 9 percent area But it's really [due to] the behavior in March   Yes, but I was just clarifying the point   No We have the preliminary data [only] That has a sharp drop of almost $3 billion in the week of March 24, as you know And we have assumed a rise of $1 billion in the next week, which is a very reasonable assumption So, in that sense, I wouldn't expect a large variation, but there will be some I think we're in the right order of magnitude   Well, I think fairly close It could vary 2 or 3 percentage points at an annual rate   Well, the fluctuations average out, we hope   First, we don't think the shift has been completed; we think it has come down to modest proportions Second, I assume--I guess contrary to your view, President Morris--that the increase in NOW accounts that we had is part of or the same as the related increase in savings accounts that occurred at the same time   That's right And that makes the problem for the interpretation of M1 I'm not interpreting that growth of 50 percent as representing a shift from demand accounts to NOWs or a shift from old savings to NOWs but an aspect of allocating more of one's savings and possibly more of one's income to highly liquid instruments, some of which are now in M1 where they didn't used to be and others of which are in M2   There might have been some more in demand deposits, that is for sure   Well, the increase in accounts--I don't have the number here--has been at the same rate since the beginning of the year as it was from August to November, or something like that And that probably is a more rapid rate of the birth of accounts It's much less than it was at the beginning of [last] year, but possibly more rapid than you would expect if there had been no shifts I think there has probably been a residual shifting But there would have been no acceleration in this recent period, [based on] the figures we get from the commercial banks on births of accounts  -36-    3/29-30/82   Well, that's right As the Chairman says, transactions accounts as we used to think of them probably would have bulged somewhat because if you get an increase in liquidity preference, some of it would have fallen into demand deposits Also, to the extent that reflects the fact that interest rates were going down and one is going to wait until they go back up--the conventional Keynesian sort of speculative motive--that would have fallen into demand deposits So, I think demand deposits would have been a little higher But of course we have the old savings account vehicle in there as well, which is probably distorted   Oh, it is Absolutely   It looks as if under all the alternatives that 6/10ths of it comes out in May and, depending on which of the alternatives you pick, either all [the rest] comes out in June or takes a little longer   Well, what I was suggesting was that if M1 were running strong relative to this 8 to 10 percent that we think makes a rough allowance for the possibly peculiar behavior of April, the Committee might consider in effect adjusting the reserve paths when that is happening if M2 is not running strong--if it were running right around the top of its range or something close to where it is now On the other hand, I also thought that because of the uncertainties in April, if M1 were running weak, it might simply mean that we did make a good seasonal adjustment; and you may not want to react to that Then, too, you could take into account the behavior of M2 and, if M2 were also running weak, it might mean that the money supply as a whole could be considered to be running weak relative to your basic objectives I'm suggesting using M2 as kind of a fly wheel to help judge the behavior of the whole group of aggregates, given the uncertainty about M1 in April and May   Well, it was a pretty good growth I may be off slightly in my number, but it's something like 9-1/2 percent on a quarterly average basis   It would be 9 percent from December to March; it's running right at the top of the range   The current week's path implies $14 billion in borrowing   That's what I was going to mention, Mr Chairman  -52-    3/29-30/82   Well, we could go whichever way the Committee wants What we have proposed is given in the Bluebook, which would be allowing for something like 8 or 9 percent [M1 growth] in April to start with and zero in May But if the first week or two in April seems weak rather than strong [relative to] the 8 or 9 percent, there would be no reason--if it were consistent with the Committee's view-- not to reconstruct the path to where it would allow for 3 or 4 percent [growth] each month, as we normally would do, absent some doubts about April itself But that would depend on getting some evidence in the early part of April   Well, last year in the first week of April, M1 seasonally adjusted rose $54 billion unadjusted it rose $17 billion   This year we've allowed--   The earlier it occurs, the bigger the odds are on the month being high Last year it occurred early In 1979 the increase unadjusted was pretty large; the first week had the biggest increase but the last 3 weeks had increases, unadjusted, of about 50 percent So, it was fairly evenly spread in 1979, looking at the unadjusted number And in 1978 it was more in the first week   The market is sitting around worried that the first week will be strong, largely because they have looked at last year And, as I say, we are projecting a big increase, $32 billion seasonally adjusted If that didn't develop, and the week of the 14th weren't strong, we would get a preliminary view of that in mid-April Then one would tend to think that it would be better [to construct the] path on a more even basis, consistent with whatever view the  -53-    3/29-30/82  Committee has as to what it wants for the 2 months But it would take a week or two to know about that   Yes, if the Committee wants to give some flexibility to--   Well, that's what we have in there That assumes a decline in growth in the nontransactions component of something more like 9 percent That is a drop from the rate of growth we have in the first quarter If that doesn't happen, then I'd say it's more like alternative A So, again, it depends on how much scope the Committee, in its own judgment, wants to leave   In the eight-week intermeeting period, the average was $14 billion But the average has been a little lower in March March 3rd was $1278 million; March 10, $1141 million; March 17th, $1163 million; and March 24th, $1343 million   Yes   That's right So, the aggregates strengthened when the borrowings were rising   Well, on our rule of thumb, either 20 or 25 basis points, and that's [likely to be] wrong    3/29-30/82   If you took the alternative A path, we have 9-1/2 percent for M2 in April   Well, we do now get weekly M2 data   We have shifted over to that through the Monetary Control Act data, so we have--   We certainly don't do it in anything except a tentative experimental way   Not seasonally adjusted  -62-    3/29-30/82   Mr Chairman, just so I understand the M2 for April Left to our own devices, if the Committee adopted 8 percent for M2 growth, we would put in a 9-1/2 percent for April and a 7-1/2 percent for May That's what falls out of our patterns   No    I think that [crisis] was mainly handled, President Morris, by our removing the Regulation Q ceilings on very short [maturities], and the banks ended up financing the [maturing] CDs [with] very little [difficulty] in the end   [Statement--see Appendix]   Oh, yes It could--   I think that's possibly quite right   It depends on whether we get the very large accounts into the sweep accounts, and whether that is offset by people building up balances in the smaller deposit accounts   Well, President Guffey, what we try to do--if I could take a minute [to provide some] background on that--is based on the results of a study we did a year ago We try to estimate the rate of interest that would be consistent with the intersection of the money supply target with what we perceive to be money demands over that period And then, given the discount rate--that rate of interest in here we think is a little lower--that implies the level of borrowing So, we construct the total reserve path on the money supply target and project, in effect, what we think is the proper interest rate in order to say what the demand for borrowing consistent with that path would be And that's how we got to the $800 million, given the discount rate That, in effect, is what we think the sustained amount of borrowing would be over the period   Yes, and consistent starting out if we're right Of course, we might very well be wrong in our interest rate projection, but that's a way--just as a first step--of trying to derive a nonborrowed path consistent with that total reserve path   May I just make one comment that I think is relevant, particularly in this recent environment? What we have experienced very recently is a little less borrowing and the funds rate just coming down Before that we had a higher funds rate than we thought [likely] for the level of borrowing I'm not at all certain that the banking system feels that eager to borrow If we ever got into a liquidity pressure situation, it may be that they'd want to store up their goodies a bit So, I'm not exactly certain It could go that way I'm really just not certain, President Guffey   Yes   Well, that's where it is implicitly; we've never been there Last week the borrowing averaged $914 million or so and thus far this week it has been just a shade under $800 million    [Statement--see Appendix]   If money increased 5 percent on a quarterly average basis, velocity would be around 3-1/2 percent If money increased, say, 5-1/2 percent from June to December, that would produce a quarterly average increase of more like 4-1/2 or 4-3/4 percent, which would make the velocity increase more like 4 percent   I think I'm about finished talking, Mr Chairman, but I might just call to the Committee's attention the alternatives presented on page 10 and also note that the base from which those alternatives take off, which is June, is probably lower than presented in the Bluebook The Bluebook had the June growth rate at about 3-1/2 percent; the data we had as of yesterday, which will be firmed up in a couple of hours--and it could change some, I'm sure-- suggest that the June growth is closer to zero or maybe a small  -36-    6/30-7/1/82  positive Alternative A, the 5-1/2 percent growth rate, would leave M1 by September running at a 6 percent rate; with the new lower June base, alternative A would leave M1 much less above the path by September--more like at 5-3/4 percent So, it would be 1/4 point above the top of the path The [aggregates] should all probably be viewed as somewhat closer to the path than is indicated, with M1 moving within the range under alternative B and much more within the range under alternative C, given these weak end-of-June numbers  I should also add, of course, that the weak end-of-June numbers, if they hold up, run the risk of July being higher in terms of growth rates if the July level that we have estimated is about right The special factors to take into account in July, of course, are the cost-of-living increase on social security payments, which will affect the first week of July and to a minor extent the July average by maybe about a percentage point in our estimate, and the beginnings of the tax decrease The first paychecks to reflect the tax decrease probably will start in the second week of July, and our estimate is that it will have a temporary effect within the first month of roughly 2 or 2-1/2 percentage points So, we think those two special factors will add 3 to 3-1/2 percentage points to the July rate of growth Our maximum estimate before we had these end-of-June weak numbers was a growth in July on the order of something like 9 percent, give or take a little, at roughly current money market conditions So we have constructed a path for Committee consideration that is very similar to what we constructed at the beginning of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter The path has a relatively large growth rate in the first month followed by very modest or no growth in the succeeding two months Our luck will run out on that at some point but it seems to have held up in the first two quarters  The other technical point I might add, Mr Chairman, is that it is not so clear as it was in April that there might be an error in the seasonals because there have been high Julys and low Julys over the past several years It isn't like April where in recent years all Aprils have been high except for the period of credit controls So I think the jury on July is out and we can't be very certain about any verdict with regard to the seasonals [for that month]   If it is to be believed, it would take roughly 5 points off the July seasonal and add it to August   Yes, but it is the method recommended to us by the experts on the Committee on Seasonal Adjustment when they presented their report So, it's well grounded in the current literature on seasonal adjustment   Well, we carried it back and it doesn't, in some way fortunately, smooth out last year all that much   Not nearly as much as it smooths out '82, which I think gives more credibility to the smoothing out of this year   It smooths them but just a very little There would still be the erratic movement around the time of the credit control program and that sort of thing   I was going to add only one thought, Mr Chairman, which is that I don't know if it's clear that alternative A is the one that would be more consistent with a decision to run at the top of the present ranges or with possibly raising the present ranges All of the alternatives are consistent in a sense with anything the Committee decides for the long run; the fourth quarter can always be adjusted But alternative A is more consistent--even more so with the downward June revision--with running closer to the top And alternatives B and C, of course, would be more consistent with retaining the present ranges and an effort to run growth down within the range rather than close to the top Those were all the comments I had, Mr Chairman, apart from the Bluebook   I had that somewhere What I have immediately at hand, Governor Gramley, is that the new Q4-to-September growth rate would be reduced by about 03 percent The level of June is down $1 billion, roughly, so that would be $3 billion I guess it's not quite 1 percent higher on the growth rate if you kept the September level of M1 that is in here   I don't have the new M2 figures, Governor Partee, but the effect on M2, if nontransactions don't change, should be roughly one-fourth the effect on M1 In answer to Governor Gramley's question, for M1 we have not quite 1 percent higher growth  -39    6/30-7/1/82  from the new lower June base; at the present [level] we've projected for September, M2 would be about 1/4 of a percent [higher]   They are a lot better than they used to be   We have rough estimates   Well, they will change in an hour, which is why I'm a little reluctant, but--   June is going to be a lot closer to the May level than the number that's [on page 11] So, around $4515 billion is about where it would come out   I might say, Mr Chairman, that President Black's calculation is certainly correct   The September top of the range would be somewhere around 4-1/2 percent from a June base of $4515 billion   Well I was rounding--   Yes, I was rounding to $1 billion instead of the exact $13 billion and for M1 I would add about a percentage point   I forget the exact wording but my memory of it is that we said that if April came in a little stronger than was in the path, that would be tolerable I forget the exact wording, but we can get the April directive if that--   I think there was some understanding, if I'm remembering right, that if April came in a bit stronger than the skewed path that it would be tolerated so long as [M2] reflected some offset to Ml   As an aid to judging, that's right That is exactly right  -51-    6/30-7/1/82   The old seasonal is in there   Oh, yes, surely   The upper limit is $4567 billion   For--?   Yes, we have about a $4-1/2 billion increase in the first week of July   Yes, about $4 or $4-1/4 billion lower   That's right   It brings the March-to-June growth rate to 3 percent, that's right   Yes, we're right on the target the Committee voted for   If borrowing were around $800 million, I think that would bring the funds rate to 14 percent or a little below-- probably more below   I would add an important caveat In the first place, the July 4th holiday weekend often has fairly high funds rates for the same reasons as the statement date Secondly, if financial pressures or financial problems develop and they become known, sometimes that gets associated with a high funds rate as these pressures immediately hit the banks and they have to lend or some  -64-    6/30-7/1/82  uncertainties develop That, too, could produce a relatively high funds rate But in a normal situation I would say the $800 million would be [associated with a funds rate] of something under 14 percent   Yes Our expectation at the moment is that July would be lower because of the very low base that we're starting off with for the end of [June] On the other hand, August could be higher because--   We could interpret that in light of any potential revisions of June 30th also It could go either way    6/30-7/1/82   That's right; that's leaving the July level where we have it It would imply something like a 12 percent rate of growth from June   We would not draw the path, if I understood the Chairman, on this July level It would be a quite lower level, interpreted as he mentioned   I would not expect any downward revision in M2 for June; it might even be up a bit    No, Mr Chairman You covered the aggregates In the first two weeks of July, [ending] the 7th and the 14th, the level is just about equal to the June level M1 is running well below the path level for July which was up around $454 billion So, it's running around $3 billion below that path level   Well, the Committee adopted a path for that aggregate for June through September of around 5 percent We allowed for a bit of a bulge in July--not much, around 7 percent--and the average level in July, to hit that, would be close to $454 billion It's running around $451 billion That's all I really meant   Yes For another reference point, the top of the range for July would have been $4527 billion, so we're running well below that also    Well, Governor Partee, when Continental borrowed a couple of weeks ago on Wednesday, that was well within the average that we were expecting   And as Peter was mentioning, if they borrow today as well as yesterday, it might raise the average for the week  -13-    8/24/82  some But it would be in the context of having to borrow; they were at the tail of the queue and got caught It isn't as if they have rushed in to borrow because they didn't have real access They have access but they are at the tail of the cue   [Statement--see Appendix]   That's right   Well, by September M1 growth would be maybe a tenth above, at 56 percent   No, it has always been--  -28-    8/24/82   Well, I was just thinking of the image, since the Committee was discussing images The image of a narrow range for the fed funds rate strikes me more as an effort to manage interest rates in this sensitive period as we go toward the elections than does worrying about the volatility of credit markets The latter does not imply to me volatility in the funds rate, as it did to President Ford, but volatility in bond markets and other markets; a little funds rate increase might have very severe repercussions on those markets So, that's the context in which I would have thought about volatility, not just the funds rate movement per se    No, [it has not changed]   $700 million   The revised number for the 8th will be $4619 billion Then there will be a $13 billion drop from there, which is well within the range of market expectations That's about what they are expecting--I mean the drop, not the upward revision   Well, it's very uncertain, but it might be somewhat above the level of the 8th   Yes, assuming the growth that we now have, Q3 over Q2 would be 38 percent   We're going to publish today a level of borrowing for the week of the 22nd of $691 million  SPEAKER(?) Right   [That includes] special borrowing by a large bank in the week of the 15th--not special borrowing, but borrowing that occurred at 12 or 13 percent So, it probably would be close to or below the [recent] level   --any special borrowing    I intend to get into this in my briefing   [Statement--see Appendix]   We could make efforts to make shift adjustments in somewhat the same way, probably with the same degree of credibility   I thought it was small   If there were not a specification for M1 and there were for M2 or M3, we would draw them on the basis of the M2 or M3 specifications and we would draw an M1 path, unless told otherwise, that we thought was generally consistent with that   Well, the one that is reserveable certainly would be in M1 Where the other one would be is a question one would have to consider carefully, I think It will [allow] at least six transfers Our present boundary line, other than for money market funds, is about three transfers   If it were in M2, it could lead to a very sharp contraction in M1, if NOW accounts shifted into [that instrument]   That's right   No, I didn't mention in this briefing the all savers certificates, Mr Chairman We mentioned in the Bluebook that this week $22 billion of originally issued all savers certificates mature, with a maturity value of $25 billion including interest Our limited preliminary estimate of the likely effect on M1, which is nothing more than a very informed guess--   We are at the moment guessing that there will be about a $7 billion increase in M1 in the current week from that But it could, depending on how long it lasts--though we think it would be temporary generally--have a very sizable effect And there are a total of $33 billion or so maturing in the course of this month   Yes, if they haven't used up their $2,000 in tax-free interest But to the degree one is going to invest in something else, it could go into a NOW account or demand account temporarily as one waits to invest it   That I'm not sure about   Yes, they are all in M2   Do you mean partly the all savers certificates?   Well, if an account were offered, let's say a Super NOW account, where you could write all the checks you wanted and that was already in M1 and it was [ceiling] free on funds over a certain amount, I would see sizable transfers out of money market funds as well as other savings deposits right into M1 from that That would occur almost instantaneously   Yes, and it would--   It's quite conceivable   We could It's like suddenly permitting a market rate of interest on demand deposits And to the degree the account is like that, it's in M1, which ought to increase   It may very well I was answering your question on the conditions under which it would increase M1   President Roos, I wasn't suggesting burying M1; I was suggesting that there is a problem over the next two or three months   If M2 were 9-1/2 percent, for the year growth would be about 9-3/4 percent; if it were 8-1/2 percent, growth for the year would be about 9-1/2 percent M3 looks as if it's going to be around--   Yes, that's for the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter I don't have the year-over-year figure   Well, with this kind of language, I would take M2 growth at somewhere around 9 or 9-1/2 percent or whatever the Committee sets and project the M1 that is roughly consistent with that, which by the Bluebook [estimates] would be on the order of 5 percent, forgetting these special circumstances So, if we assume substantial increases in the first week of October and take the borrowing that the Committee says to take--   Well, that would be the Committee's decision But consistent with some easing, one would assume that the initial borrowing assumption would be down [to] about $200 million, moving back toward where it was at the last meeting and probably a little lower because that initial borrowing assumption is really pushing to move the funds rate back above the discount rate So, in part depending on the sense of what the Committee wants, it may be below that level   Well, at the 10 percent discount rate, if you had a borrowing of $200 million, just to take an example--I'm not saying it should be at that level--I would not expect the funds rate to get as low as that It would be more like 10 percent or a shade under Peter may have another view    10/5/82   Yes, if the Committee were adopting this sort of directive, those variations in M1 would all tend to be allowed for as multiplier adjustments   That would be the logic   That's right   No, I was using that as an example   We allowed for about $500 million and so far they are a little over $1 billion; that could come out on its own if our projections are wrong   We allowed for $500 million because the week with the quarter-end statement date normally has well above normal excess reserves   That's right, and then to allow for the [unintelligible] week statement date excess reserve averaging   There is some The Midland Bank in Dallas still is in for some; I've forgotten the exact number   Yes, they haven't been in for a while--about a    10/5/82   At the present level of the discount rate, I think that's right   Yes They are up on average in the month, but the weekly data are--   Well, market rates have been rising and the rates on the [money market] funds have been dropping with a lag, so they've come back together If market rates began going down and if [money market] funds rates tended to lag the drop in market rates, [flows into money] funds would tend to go up We have only a modest expansion projected at the moment   Well, I wasn't there but if they said anything, the M1 behavior might suggest that I don't think we can say very much about M2 On M1, if you look at the models--depending upon which quarter you start with--you can interpret M1 as being roughly on the quarterly money demand model If you start in the first quarter, it might be an upward shift instead of a downward shift; if you start in the third quarter, it's about on   There's the language of the last directive-- "are leading to"    Mr Chairman, the comments I'd be tempted to make would be in a fairly broad range There is a dilemma between the short run and the long run It is probably true that because most of M2 doesn't have any reserve requirements this 2 percent average reserve requirement on M2 relative to total reserves is giving us a very weak response in the short run to overruns in M2 That assumes, if we just go to the 2 percent, that the response is somewhat proportional and that M1 together with the nontransactions component would be roughly [as variable as M1] But as President Black pointed out, in the short run they clearly won't be; as interest rates go up, the market will raise rates on the nontransactions components and they will respond So, in the short run probably we ought to react, [in effect,] by moving the reserve requirement on demand deposits That is, if M2 is strong, the really practical option is to lower demand deposits substantially; so we'd have to use a demand deposit ratio in the multiplier--for the purpose of the [technical] adjustment [to the nonborrowed reserve path]--rather than the M2 ratio In that case we would get a very powerful interest rate response To reduce demand deposits sufficiently to offset an expansion in the nontransactions component would require a very substantial rise in interest rates That's just another way of saying in technical jargon that the interest elasticity of M2 is low relative to the interest elasticity of M1  So, to try to control M2 over a very short-run period risks very substantial interest rate movements In the end, we would have to have enough [of an increase in interest rates] to bring income down and reduce the amount of money available to put into M2 That's the reason that we started using the 2 percent ratio--to moderate this particular impact, consistent with the Committee's decision Also, it has a certain reality When you think of the market response, the control horizon for M2 is [necessarily] somewhat longer than the control horizon for M1 Whether the Committee would then want to go directly to the control of the funds rate and make a deliberate decision about that instead of leaving it implied from a reserve path- -knowing the control horizon for M2 might be a little longer, but implied M1 movements would still be substantial--strikes me as an issue that has more than economics in it My personal preference, of course, would be to stay with a reserve path because I think it makes it a little easier in practice to get the movements of interest rates that the Committee probably would find tolerable and desirable under the circumstances   We'll look at all the aggregates   [Statement--see Appendix]  [Coffee break]  [Secretary's note The meeting resumed at this point with more limited attendance]   Well, the growth rates we have here are certainly higher than we assumed at the last Committee meeting would be consistent with your original M2 targets The M2 target may be slightly higher, but not very much A problem, as far as we can see from the casual information we get on bank deposits, is that the all savers certificate money that went into demand deposits has not come out yet And we don't know when, in fact, it will come out For all I know it may sit there and jump into this new money market instrument that the DIDC has authorized So, in some sense, that temporary money is still in there and is raising these growth rates I think that's what is causing these numbers--   Yes, [but] the 3-month, 6-month, and one-year bill rates are down [some]   Yes There has been a shift toward things that have a market rate of interest   Well, if the aggregates came out that way, yes; it's set that way   Yes, for "B" we just put in the range that the Committee adopted at the last meeting But our expectation was for a funds rate more like it is now   Yes We started with "B" as the range the Committee had, but the range--   Including the fourth quarter of last year   Yes   The last weekly number that we had that was independent of this problem Peter mentioned was something like $366 or $367 million We never quite obtained that Borrowing for the last five weeks has run, in millions, $248, $405, $273, $263, and then $530 million last week, which was also influenced by that high Wednesday   It's running fairly low, Governor Teeters We have had $50, $77 and $90 million recently It has been below $100 million for the last five or six weeks   No That has risen a little; it's about $190 million   It's not in this number, but the seasonal is   No The last sentence of paragraph 9 is our feeling about it We're not certain when we--   No, but I do think there is some uncertainty related to both the all savers certificate and the new instrument about what is going to happen in the interim, [which should be in the record] for discussion purposes I don't know where people are going to store their money in anticipation of those things But you don't need it for operational purposes   I guess there are special circumstances in connection with--   I did the same thing, but I haven't changed my view    Well, Mr Chairman, the Committee's decision today or tomorrow for operating purposes--the one that pertains to the directive between now and the next meeting--also, of course, relates    12/20-21/82  to the fundamental problem before the Committee about how to target 1983 as a whole, a decision that has to be made in February So these two things are somewhat related at the moment and I'll try to bring the two together if I can  In the alternatives that we presented in the Bluebook we have keyed on the broader aggregates, following what the Committee has done in the last couple of months, of course, though we've given enough data on M1 should the Committee wish to go in that direction The large memo [Secretary's note A copy of this memorandum, "Options for Intermediate Targets and Implications for Operating Procedures of Deposit Rate Deruglation," has been placed in the Committtee's files] that was prepared by Messrs Davis, Judd, Lindsey, and myself and sent to you suggests that in this transitional period that we're entering-- beginning on December 14 with the availability of the MMDA accounts, and continuing to January 4th or 5th with the availability of Super NOW accounts--the transitional difficulties with M1 would tend to make it very difficult to present in February a target for M1 for the year And thus by definition we believe that it would be difficult to target on M1 now going into the first quarter, as the target that is set today or tomorrow will pertain to the first quarter We came to that view, recognizing that it was quite possible that we would luck into offsetting shifts and we'd have a low number [for M1 growth], but we couldn't really say with any definiteness that that would occur On the one hand, as you probably read in the DIDC [report], the MMDA accounts could tend to dominate, and that would pull money out of M1 and lower the growth of M1; on the other hand, the NOW accounts may tend to dominate, and that may bring money into M1 I don't see how anyone can decide in advance exactly what is going to happen We have done our best in the Bluebook appendix to make a variety of estimates and, as you see, we came to a wide range of estimates, particularly with regard to Ml So without discounting the possibility that we could get a moderate M1 performance from offsetting shifts, we felt that one couldn't rely on that in advance nor could one with any definiteness say exactly how the shifts were going to go, and thus it might be better to bypass M1 at least for a transition period  Now, having said that, the group as a whole felt--and I would say we felt it more strongly as we talked together--that M1 was really the best that might be left if you looked at everything So we were left with the great "hope" that when the transition is over, whenever that might be--and it may be midyear or conceivably earlier if everything goes rapidly--that it would again be possible to target on Ml, but we didn't think it would be the same animal So, even if it became possible to target on M1 when all the shifts are over, we might be left with an animal that has a very different composition if NOW accounts dominate; it may have a large mix of investment-type funds and transactions funds, something like a money market fund And, therefore, it would behave differently than the old M1, and it would take some time to analyze and evaluate its behavioral characteristics That's no more than saying, of course, that the new M1 could be like the M2 that we now have, but it would be somewhat better in the sense that it would at least have more transactions components in it than M2, which has the transactions component and a much wider variety of assets So, for the reasons given in the memo that I don't need to repeat, we tended to hope that M1 would come back and be a somewhat viable target around midyear, maybe not in the full force it has had    12/20-21/82  before but at least viable enough that the Committee would not feel the need to ignore it within a broad range  M2, of course, also has its transitional problems I think we went to some pains to point those out; and we tried to make estimates in the Bluebook about how much M2 might be affected by the shifts We think that pretty clearly we are not likely to see shifts out of M2 into market instruments So the shifts would be from market instruments into M2, perhaps even from large CDs or from Eurodollar liabilities into M2, through these money market deposit accounts mainly And we would think, if the behavior of NOW accounts is any guide, just in terms of the speed of transition, that much of it would be finished over a 3- to 4-month period We have not estimated quite as fast a transition as occurred with NOW accounts largely because a lot of the money that would go into these other accounts is in market instruments, which bear a relatively high interest rate, so in a sense there's [no] need to rush But our estimate, with a wide range of error around it, was that in the first quarter perhaps something like 3 percentage points at an annual rate worth of funds might be shifted; and that would raise M2 for the year something like 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points [because] of shifts We think the effects on M3 would be a little less because of offsets That is, if banks get money through MMDA accounts they may issue fewer large CDs, not to mention shifts directly from large CDs into MMDAs So, we don't believe M3 will be as much affected as M2  One of the problems, if the Committee does wish to continue targeting on M2 and M3 for a longer period--let us say, 3 to 6 months or whatever--is that, as the Committee knows, we don't get as much automatic response because of the reserve requirements The average reserve requirement is much lower on M2 and M3 than it is on M1 It's on an order of magnitude of 2 percent as compared with 10 percent; it's 5 times lower And since M2 doesn't vary proportionately as much as M1, we just don't tend to get as large an automatic adjustment Now, this would lead to a greater need for the kinds of judgmental adjustments that we have been making with regard to M1 We normally make them on the up side, when the total reserves demanded are $200 million or so in excess of the total reserve path; we have more often than not lowered the nonborrowed reserve path in order to provide more restraint And with regard to M2 and M3, it's possible that if the Committee wishes to retain roughly the same sort of handle, such a judgment might have to be made a little sooner because the automatic response simply is not quite as great I ought to point out something that I think was in the memo but maybe not as clearly as it should have been If you're targeting on M2, you don't have to control it any more closely than you have controlled M1 in the past to get a better GNP performance In some sense it has that advantage because interest rates are a lot more sensitive to efforts to control M2; you have to push the interest rates to control M2 because it has very little interest elasticity So, if you're off on M2 by roughly the same [percentage] amount as you're off on M1, you might have more interest rate movement and, therefore, more impact on GNP So, while it's more difficult to control, if you miss it but you're trying to control it, you may get a somewhat better GNP performance On the other hand, this has risks that are important because if you happen to have specified the wrong M2 target or the wrong M3 target--if the demand for M2 relative to whatever GNP is satisfactory to you has shifted and you're making a big effort to control this broad M with    12/20-21/82  little interest elasticity, or even a narrow M with little interest elasticity--then the penalty on the economy will be much greater because interest rates will have moved very rapidly and the economy will be behaving very unsatisfactorily in the situation when the target is wrong That means, of course, that you may want to think somewhat cautiously about letting the money market adjust until you're fairly certain that the movement in the broad money supply is truly reflecting credit demands and GNP behavior and does not simply mean that the public's behavior has shifted and you have chosen the wrong target So, those are the kinds of risks involved when we move toward broader monetary aggregates and even when we have an M1 that has less interest elasticity  Now, we examined even broader aggregates, which got us to the vexing question of credit I don't have much to add to the very carefully worded concluding section on credit in Part I [of the memo] where we as a group thought that credit would provide a reasonable context for judging financial flows but felt that as a short-run guide to monetary policy it had its problems, at least at the present stage of our knowledge, given the statistical problems we think there are and the vexing questions of cause and effect that are also involved Certainly, these kinds of questions also relate to the broader monetary aggregates, so it is a matter of degree as you go out [toward broader measures of money and credit] as to where you think the effect on GNP [dominates] or where you think there is some causal connection between what you do to the aggregates and GNP There are controllability problems with regard to total credit that are simply the same kinds of controllability problems we have with M2--possibly a little worse--and I've mentioned them with regard to M2 The question is Can it be controlled independently of controlling GNP? Or when you go to total credit, are you in fact simply saying you are going directly to GNP, so the control mechanism there is not just simply a reserve base to money kind of control mechanism  We also discussed the narrower aggregates, the monetary base and the nonborrowed base As a group we felt that the monetary base basically should be viewed as derived from the demand for the various other aggregates, so that it did not really save the Committee the difficult task of making judgments about the more standard aggregates It might disguise that problem a little, but in the end when you come down to making a decision, you really have to judge whether you are happy or not when M1 is coming in strong and the monetary base is on target So we felt that it was really a derived demand and in that sense did not give it much weight The nonborrowed base is also in some sense derived from the demand for the other aggregates but at least borrowing is available as a buffer so that it can accommodate shifts between demand deposits and currency; thus we thought there was a little more to be said for the nonborrowed base as a target rather than the monetary base However, we felt that the nonborrowed base had somewhat less public credibility than either the monetary base or any of the other Ms and we did not in our own thinking put much weight on it as a guide to the Committee Nevertheless, I would say--and others here can speak for themselves--the more we thought about it, most of us began to see some virtue in it  Looking to the immediate problem, in the context of providing a directive between now and the next Committee meeting, one might be tempted to take the view that the [shape] of the adjustments to the  -10-    12/20-21/82  new accounts will be much clearer by early February when the Committee has to decide on the long-run targets and, therefore, that over the next few weeks in this initial adjustment period the aggregates will provide virtually no basis for guiding policy Even if they're going to provide a difficult basis in February, the question would be What basis would they provide between now and February? These uncertainties immediately ahead of us--the unknown range of possible outcomes--seems to us to be greater for M1 than for the broader aggregates, as I've mentioned However, there are uncertainties with respect to the broader aggregates; the direction of effect seems clear but the magnitude of effect is uncertain Moreover, partly because of the wide range of assets involved, it is going to be very difficult to measure the magnitudes actually shifted after the fact, although obviously we will attempt to assess them from the behavior of various components of the series [constituting the] aggregates, questions to depository institutions, econometric evidence, and consumer surveys  Despite all these problems, the suggested directives for Committee consideration in the Bluebook retain the broad aggregates as a guide between now and the next Committee meeting in February There are number of reasons for that but an important one is to insure that the public understands that the Committee is continuing on the anti- inflationary course set earlier, even while taking steps to stimulate economic recovery That is particularly important at this time in view of the doubts that seem to be emerging, at least in bond markets, about the Federal Reserve's intentions I may put slightly more stress on that than Mr Sternlight put on it The last discount rate cut was followed immediately by a drop in long-term interest rates and also short-term rates, but the declines in long rates subsequently have been reversed as have the drops in short rates to a degree In part these reversals might have been the result of unusual mid- December tax period pressures in the money market combined with the coincidence of unusually heavy Treasury and state and local government borrowing demands Still, many in the market have come to wonder whether in practice, even if not in concept, the aggregates are not being ignored at the expense of stoking inflationary pressures later In that context it may be something of a tactical problem whether or not the Committee specifies a [monetary growth rate] in the directive that appears relatively high If some credence is given to the staff's estimate that shifts into M2 in the first quarter will be at an annual rate on the order of 3 percentage points--and I stress that there's a wide range of uncertainty around that--then a relatively large number would probably be needed for M2 to accommodate that shift, as indicated in the three Bluebook alternatives However, if we are right about the nature of the shifts that will take place, a relatively moderate M3 figure would seem to be attainable If a high M2 number is stipulated in the directive and if a moderate M3 is not felt to be a sufficient counterweight, the question naturally arises as to whether an indication should not also be given regarding our preliminary thinking about the extent to which that high number is affected by shift distortions The risk of doing so is that in the weeks ahead the System may then have to provide a specific quantitative shift adjustment factor, a highly conjectural procedure in my opinion under current circumstances Qualitative-type judgments about the extent and nature of shifts will be necessary in any event but quantification, apart from fairly broad ranges, is likely to stretch the available data beyond its reach    12/20-21/82  An alternative approach to the directive would be to provide a relatively low M2 figure and indicate that growth could be high if there were evidence that shifts were distorting M2 by a significant amount Since the figure initially given should probably accommodate some amount of shifting, I would think that a figure representing M2 growth for the first quarter much lower than 9 or 10 percent may be too far out of touch with possible developments, unless of course the economy and/or the rate of personal saving is much weaker than currently anticipated If a figure in the 9 to 10 percent range or fractionally lower is inserted initially, it would seem that in practice the Committee might wish to tolerate a reasonable range of growth around it, certainly in the initial weeks of the adjustment period, before any substantial automatic changes in money market conditions occur This might also be the case for the relatively high figure, though in those circumstances shortfalls might appear more tolerable to the Committee than overshoots If the Committee goes that route, the initial tilt given to the money market by the Committee assumes more importance than usual in the sense that the odds increase that the tilt will last for several weeks, the next scheduled meeting being 7 weeks from now With borrowing from the discount window already near frictional levels or implied to be so by the reserve paths, there is only a little, though some, scope for the Committee to ease market conditions, if that's the inclination, without risking losing touch with the market by setting a reserve path that could come to involve virtually no borrowing and thus virtually no anchor for the federal funds rate On the other hand, the discount rate does remain as an available guide to money market conditions if borrowing is left to fluctuate around or slightly above a clearly frictional level That probably would put borrowing in a $200 to $300 million range, based on recent experience, although there is a fuzziness about the edges of that range I apologize for the length of [my comments], Mr Chairman, but it was an effort to bring the short- and long-run [issues] together   Well, M2 has been very weak [this month] and the average level through the first half of December is not inconsistent with that kind of growth rate We foresee only a small expansion over the rest of the month beyond the fragmentary data we have through the middle of the month I would say there is some doubt about that; it could come in higher But I would put the range of estimates between 4-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent I don't think we're exposed, at least at this point, to a real burst of M2 growth Two years ago we had a huge drop in M1 components in the last two weeks of the year, which saved the year in 1981 I think that was the year when we had the sharp [December] drop in M1; we don't have that built into this M2 estimate What we have is virtually no increase in the nontransactions component You are quite right that the 4-1/2 percent growth is something that might not develop, but it's not inconsistent with the pattern of weakness that has developed in the last couple of weeks when we have been surprised by the weakness   Well, if it has a lot more interest elasticity one might have to see; if it doesn't, then it's not going to be But one can go into that problem another way, too We used the 2 percent, but it's an open question as to what really will happen in the short run We could do this [in such a way as] to have a massive effect in the short run If we assumed that in the short run there was nothing we could do about money market funds and all that and that all we could affect was the demand deposits subject to reserve requirements, then we could construct the path in such a way that when money funds went up we would force all this money out of demand deposits Then the reserve requirement we are dealing with is 10 percent and we wouldn't be trying to affect everything proportionately because we wouldn't believe that's what would happen in the short run If we did that, of course, we would get massive interest rate effects in an effort to control it That's what led us to suggest a shadow of 3 percent or something in between   Well, yes I suppose I haven't made the calculation I suppose there is some reserve requirement If it were 100 percent, we would have no problem because we would force whatever interest rate adjustments were required, and they would be massive So, at some point, we would find ourselves with a reserve requirement, given the interest elasticity, that would make us feel comfortable I'm not sure exactly where it is   I would say, President Corrigan, that we did hold out the hope, but mostly we didn't really want to be in a position of prejudging it at this particular time I guess we mostly felt that something was needed between the Committee and GNP If we don't have some aggregate--I don't see much else to choose from, the others may speak for themselves--between the Committee and GNP, then in that case you might just as well start controlling interest rates depending on your best assessment of what is going to happen to GNP That is what we were grappling with   Yes, that's true There can be a lot more shifting within M2, but we get a flow of data continuously and we can adjust for that If money market funds were strong and demand deposits were weak but M2 was on course, we would simply reduce the reserves for that purpose Now, with lagged reserve accounting, we don't have any problem with that When we get the contemporaneous reserve accounting, then we're likely to be faced with a more difficult problem because it could happen in a current week that money market funds are strong and demand deposits are weak If we put in the reserves as if it were going to be vice versa, interest rates would drop So, with contemporaneous reserve accounting there is more difficulty with multiplier adjustments They don't come with certainty after the fact But in principle, that is what we would be doing   Yes, but that's in the nature of reserve paths That's right That's the problem with anything less than 100 percent reserve requirements and targeting on anything that has aggregates in it that aren't subject to reserves The controllability to a degree is reduced That's quite right  -14-    12/20-21/82   Actually, we're thinking in terms of an underlying [growth in] M2 in 1983, independent of shifts, of something like 8 percent And we have nominal GNP growth on the order of 7 or 7-1/2 percent, so we have a slight--   --downward movement in velocity as not out of keeping with that It's hard to tell exactly what would happen, but we feel that when we get to the point of price stability--and I don't know whether we'll get there, but assume we get there--that the store- of-value function of money will be restored in some sense People will be more willing to hold money at any given level of interest rates for its store-of-value function because they are not losing purchasing power At least that is what we think So, from that perspective, there'd be a one-time increase in cash balances when that occurred I would be very reluctant to predict whether it would occur next year; it seems somewhat doubtful to me, but it may The basis for our assumption for next year was that some of this present liquidity that has been provided would tend to be used up We're not using up much of it because we still have a slightly downward tilt to velocity If we're using up a lot, we might see velocity go up and we would have a somewhat more rapid recovery We have projected a rather calm picture with no rise in interest rates from around current levels in the course of next year On that thought we have not projected what many are predicting--that there will be a sharp turnaround in velocity We do have it calmer   Right   One of the reasons we suggested midyear as the time to relook [at Ml]--and we were a little hesitant about that--was the thought that the DIDC presumably would have this interest bearing checking account for businesses coming on stream, although I'm not sure [that will happen], by early spring So there would be a little more time to see how that behaves I would assume the adjustment to that might go a bit faster than for the others but I really have no way of knowing in advance   No, he didn't  -23-    12/20-21/82   It's closer to three weeks or four It depends on how much estimating one wants to do But on the same basis that your staff has, President Morris, we would estimate around four weeks unless we wanted to do a little more estimating than is actually implied in that memo It's a technical difference, but I think there is a difference You might do it in two weeks The truth is that we don't have such a series We don't have it seasonally adjusted And we don't know anything about its volatility characteristics The last time we had one--and we could develop it again--was about 15 years ago when Governor Partee and Governor Gramley were running the division   It was so volatile, actually, that we gave up on it It can be developed I don't think the lag is two weeks; I think it's closer to three or four But it certainly could be estimated Our estimate is 65 percent in two weeks as against your 85 percent; we could estimate that 20 percent and add it and not be terribly far off But we don't have it available in any real sense and it hasn't been tested That doesn't mean it couldn't be developed or shouldn't be developed But we're not near it, in any real sense, from our point of view But if the Committee wants--   Well, in general, M2 is less volatile than M1, though it is volatile, of course But what would happen as it moved off a path is that the built-in response would, in fact, be less because it is less volatile than M1, fortunately So the built-in response could be less and the practical question would be [whether to take] a $200 million, roughly, movement of total reserves beyond where the Committee wanted it on average to trigger an ad hoc adjustment to the nonborrowed [reserve path] It may be as we gain experience that it will turn out to be more [appropriately] like $100 million movements if M2 is targeted That would trigger a downward movement of some amount in the nonborrowed path because the automatic adjustment isn't big enough That's the nature of what would happen   Well, that would only be if the Committee wanted to; we just suggested that   One thing I may not have made clear, Mr Chairman, is that the way the shadow requirement was set is that we figured out what would give us for the average variation in M2 the same average variation in interest rates that we have had M2 would move a little more [in relation to] that [interest rate] variation than M1 would have, but the economy would be roughly the same If you take M2 times its velocity, you would be getting roughly the same GNP So, you get the same interest rate movement, but because M2 isn't as interest rate sensitive you can get a little more [change in] M2 than you would have in M1 relative to its path, but roughly the same GNP outcome because the velocity behavior will be offsetting to a degree   We would put the Eurodollar deposits in if we could get them on time and we're trying to get them on time   I assume the Committee will come up with, say, an M2 or an M3 guideline, or both, for the period over the next three months and we will simply make, as put in the Bluebook, an initial rough assumption of what would happen to M1 consistent with that; it's all rough And that would imply a certain total amount of required reserves The Committee, I assume, will come up with an initial borrowing assumption as it has been doing We will provide an excess reserve assumption and with all those pieces we'd come out with nonborrowed reserves It's fairly straightforward, except that we know we're going to be way, way off So, when the deposit distribution changes, as it undoubtedly will, we would simply redo the reserve path in order to put in the more or fewer reserves that are consistent with the new deposit distribution, assuming the Ms are on track If the Ms are off track, then we would have to change the reserve path for the change in the deposit distribution but in addition borrowing would tend to go up or down depending on whether the total was high or low   The multiplier adjustments are fairly straightforward That is, if there is a vast increase in Super NOW accounts and a drop in savings deposits that we hadn't allowed for-- savings deposits having no reserve requirement virtually and Super NOWs having a 12 percent requirement--then we'll observe that this week The reserves come in two weeks from now and we will have put into the reserve paths sufficient reserves to accommodate the big    12/20-21/82  increase in Super NOW accounts consistent with a drop in savings accounts   Well, pretty soon That's one thing I wanted to mention We are going to be getting the numbers weekly on the new accounts We have before the Board a proposal to get from the weekly reporting banks [data on] accounts over $100,000 that are nonpersonal accounts with seven days or more maturity That's in case some of the large CDs that are now in M3 shift right into money market accounts [Mr Lindsey,] what are you getting explicitly? Are you going to get a breakdown between personal and nonpersonal on these new accounts?   Mr Chairman, I think one helpful comment that could be made would be to explain the two alternative operating paragraphs before the Committee But before that I should make two comments One is generated by the Committee's earlier discussion The staff will go ahead and begin developing a monthly total credit series to see what its statistical properties are and how fast we can get it and how it develops I would like also just for my own professional peace of mind to go ahead and try to do some econometric work on supply and demand relationships in total credit if we can possibly uncover them, somewhat like what we had tried to do with supply and demand for money And if we got that far, I think we would be at the frontiers of the economic profession But we'd like to make that effort So, we would propose to proceed in that way on the total credit I don't know how far we'll get before midyear but hopefully fairly far Another related point on the operational paragraph of the directive, if you turn to lines 55 through 58 on the draft with the numbered lines that was passed out to the Committee--   Yes Before that it says "The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully in light of developments over the remainder of 1982" We have some language that might seem more apropos than that since 1982 has only a week-and-a-half to run We'll have it typed up and given to the Committee, but it reads at the moment "The Committee had also earlier indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983, but it will review that decision carefully at its February 1983 meeting in light of economic developments and institutional changes associated with the new deposit account authorized by the Depository Institutions Deregulatory Committee" I think that's just a technical holding-in-place It sounds more apropos than what is in there at the moment But we'll type that up and send it around  SPEAKER(?) What line is that Steve?   Lines 55 through 58   Oh, I'm sorry It would be the last sentence before the operational paragraphs   Well, we're going to type it up and send it around On the operational paragraphs, alternative one as proposed allows for a high M2 growth, something that would accommodate a shift --if you believe our 3 percentage points--of that order of magnitude But because that number for M2 would be pretty large---- would have to be, say, 11 or 12 percent really, and that may present some problem of credibility--it would almost seem to call for an early estimate of a shift adjustment factor That is, if you decided on the 11 or 12 percent but thought two or three or four percentage points of that was shift, once you go that route, then I think it inevitably involves a continuing shift While that is one reasonable approach, the staff-- or certainly I--would tend to prefer the approach of alternative two, which allows for a smaller rate of growth in M2 and also includes an M3 growth that probably, as President Corrigan mentioned, is not going to be as much affected by shifts So, that's our tentative thinking in this current period   I'm talking about directive language, President Roos, alternatives one and two of the directive language The second alternative allows for a slower rate of growth in M2 and gives an M3 rate of growth and then has language which says growth could be higher --and probably more felicitous language could be developed--if there were substantial evidence of more shifts than had been allowed for in this notional number, based on analysis of incoming data and other evidence from bank and market reports If the Committee went that way, then after the fact a range or some qualitative indication of the extent of shift might have to be given, but it would not be as committed to a definite shift adjustment It is really for that particular reason that, in terms of directive language, alternative two might seem somewhat preferable Of course, no matter which of those alternatives you choose in terms of phrasing the language, the policy issue is more on what level of borrowing the Committee chooses to start, since presumably over the next few weeks there might not be much variation around that level of borrowing unless the behavior of the aggregates is really extreme--unless it becomes clear that the shift distortions may be enough to fuzz up one's analysis of the underlying strength of the aggregates So, it becomes crucial what level of borrowing is chosen, but it is not insignificant, really, what underlying growth in the aggregates you would tend to want   Yes, if the balance of December comes out as projected If it's down about as much as the data through [mid-month suggest] it would be [down more]   The second alternative is designed as somewhat of a compromise; I think it would be somewhere in the 9 to 10 percent range You could even continue with the 9-1/2 percent you now have That would accommodate some shift--   No, some   Yes   Yes, we think--and it's just our guess--that 8 percent is not an unreasonable number without any shifts This numerology is all based on estimates   We still have a negative velocity [growth projected for] the first quarter, Governor Partee, but it is a lot less negative velocity [growth] than we had earlier   Well, that's why with the language of alternative two--if the Committee did put in something like M3 growth of 8 percent and M2 growth of 9-1/2 percent, say, and then it turned out that M2 was stronger because of evidence of shifts but M3 was on target, one would assume--depending on the Committee discussion--that we would just accommodate that because that's what the directive would literally say And one would hope that the moderation of M3 would be an obvious counterfoil to the somewhat stronger M2   None Well, there's a little maybe   That's right   We're basically assuming that bank credit demands are not going to be very strong in the first quarter And, therefore, if the banks get more money in through these money market accounts, they will not be pressing in the market as much and there might even be some direct movement of CDs into these accounts So, it's a combination of both That's what we're assuming   It's 6-1/2 percent, I think And for M2 on a quarterly average basis, which is different from the December-to-March growth, I have 98 percent here But I have to take something between 2 and 3 percentage points off of it, so it's more like between 7 and 8 percent So it's a minor negative velocity growth of something like 1 percent, let's say, as against the sharp negative velocity growth of something like 5-1/2 percent over the year   Well, abstracting from shifts, about 8 percent   There are differing numbers in those alternatives I'm suggesting that you might use alternative two, which incorporates the lower numbers that do not fully allow for the shifts If you use the M3 numbers that are there but subtract 2 to 3 percentage points from the M1 number, you would not be making as much advance allowance for the shifts as is in the text, which is our best estimate of the shifts However, the shifts may not occur   I'm sorry, I meant M2--I meant M3 actually We used the numbers for M3, but we reduced M2   Yes   To get a sense of the underlying demand, for whatever that's worth, you take 3 points off But I would suggest putting a somewhat higher number than 8 percent If you took 3 points off the 11 percent for "B," you'd get 8 percent because it seems to me  -78-    12/20-21/82  it would be reasonable to allow for some shifts And the Committee already has 9-1/2 percent for M2 on the record for October to December And that would seem like a continuance of that; that would be just one compromise between the two   It's the language in alternative two I was getting some better language [typed up]; I had hoped it would be done Yes, the language would imply that if there were evidence from incoming data and reports from the market and from depository institutions that there was a shift--and I added in brackets if underlying demands for liquidity were exceptional, if the Committee wants to say that--[stronger growth would be tolerated] So, there would be plenty of scope in the directive to allow for stronger growth  -79-    12/20-21/82   Unless we found some evidence of a huge shift   Well, if the Committee wanted 9-1/2 percent and 8 percent, I would take our M1 estimate based on that, which is pretty high--something like 8 percent--and draw a path based on the related required reserves But that wouldn't affect the money market if M2 were coming in strong because with the virtues of lagged reserve accounting we would know the required reserves two weeks later and we would simply accommodate to it   That's right If there were shifts and M2 were strong   Well, that's what this in effect does I think the issue is only whether you put down 8 percent, if that's what your underlying preference is, or whether you put down a number that's a  -81-    12/20-21/82  little higher so you give some notional sense that shifts may occur Thus far, that is what the issue seems to be   No   For the December-to-March period our best estimate was one to five I would like to make clear to the  -82-    12/20-21/82  Committee--we tried to say how we got to that estimate--that the range of uncertainty here is really vast, though the numbers weren't quite off the wall, as Governor Gramley suggested All I'm suggesting is that the Committee put in the directive a number with which it feels generally comfortable; and if it turns out to be bigger, then the market would tighten if there are no shifts; and if there seemed to be shifts--   [That would be covered in] the next sentence  -84-    12/20-21/82   Well, there could be a bit in M3 Maybe it's a mild degree of perfectionism--just guarding against all possibilities It's not clear that they are going to offset   Yes   But there are the thrifts, Governor Partee I don't know what they're--   Between $175 and $200 million used to strike me as quite frictional; [now] I would think we would be getting below that level when we get down to $50 million or so I would agree thoroughly with Peter that unless there's a big expectation of a discount rate drop, the funds rate would tend to hang around the present discount rate and would be a little more likely than it is now to be below it It isn't below it now; it has been running above it except for today  -86-    12/20-21/82   Yes, the funds rate would go up if we underestimate the demand for excess reserves We would, of course, make every effort not to; we have models that turn out not to be too bad, in fact Sometimes they have been better than our judgment on that So, we have a fairly good way of trying to estimate the demand for excess reserves And Peter makes his own estimate over the course of the week if he sees that it isn't working out right   Certainly if it's over a sustained period, it would be [counted with] nonborrowed reserves If it's a bank that just happens to be at the end of the queue and comes in for a day and is out, that strikes me as adjustment borrowing But if a bank is in for a sustained period, then it's more clearly nonborrowed   That's right But if, for example, Continental is in one day and then out and it just happened that the borrowing fell on Continental, as it would naturally--   We would certainly alert the Chairman if that were--   No, I was just muttering [about how we might] find an [unintelligible] range   M3 has been slowing down very recently and we were influenced in good part by that, of course But for the year it has been--   Yes We have estimated a very weak December coming up Whether or not that will develop, [I don't know] This is somewhat stronger than we think the average of the three months--   We go through the various components and then make some estimate of credit growth at banks and how they might finance that, given what we think of the others And this is what comes out in a sense   If there were a considerable expansion in bank credit growth, this number could well be higher Or if there were a big switch and banks decided to finance through borrowing here rather than abroad, that could affect this We have not allowed for that; we have allowed for a generally weak economy and still some--   Pay down CDs If that doesn't happen--   I think you have it right there It's what I gave you as the new language It is just typed funny   Yes We have it; it could be distributed   Norm is distributing it I'm sorry about these various forms in which the [draft] directive is being provided The relevant language is in lines 55 to 58   That's all I had in mind   Yes, no one would pay much attention one way or the other   That's right I didn't think so either    Mr Chairman, I'd like first to give the clearest thing I can give, which is where we've been For the fourth quarter of 1982, the Committee had an objective for M2 of around 9-1/2 percent and for M3 [of about 8 percent] The actual results are that M2 did grow 9-1/2 percent from September to December and M3 grew 7 percent So, in terms of the fourth-quarter objectives that were set at the beginning of the fourth quarter, those are the latest numbers We will be publishing the December figures today and they will show for M1 an increase of 91 percent, which will give us an increase for the year of 8-1/2 percent; they will show an M2 increase of 8-1/2 percent, which will give a yearly increase of 99 percent; and they will show an M3 increase of only 23 percent, which will give a yearly increase of 104 percent We believe the M2 increase in December was impacted to a sizable degree by the money market deposit accounts As of the latest specific data we have, which is the week of January 5th, these money market deposit accounts had grown to a level of $111 billion Making a reasonable estimate for the [week of the] 12th from the savings deposit figures we have, which include the MMDAs, would conservatively put them at a level of $130 billion So, they're coming very close already to the level that the staff had assumed was consistent with a 3 percent shift adjustment for the first quarter That is, if your underlying--   With this rapid growth in the MMDAs, we made a very definite attempt, based on what are rather rough data, to see how much of those funds shifted out of non-M2 sources The only way we can do it at the moment is by a residual method It involves going through the M2 weekly data, which aren't necessarily complete, and deciding what they otherwise would have done and seeing what they did, and then assuming that that difference goes into MMDAs That then leaves a residual that comes from market sources Our estimate of the amount that would have come from market sources in December would tend to raise M2 growth on the order of 3 to 4 percentage points at an annual rate So that would suggest, if that number is right, that underlying M2 growth was somewhere around 5 to 5-1/2 percent in December We've also looked at December in other ways We have taken the nonpersonal MMDAs out of M2 just to see what that would have    1/14/83 -2-  given; and that would have produced a 4-1/2 percent rate of growth in M2 in December That assumes nonpersonal MMDAs are something like large CDs; that's probably not right because they include other kinds of things such as business savings deposits, but that would have been the result for M2 growth in December We have a survey in which we began to get data on MMDAs maturing in 7 days or more that are over $100,000 That survey has not indicated that there are very many of those The first week's data show only $100 million, so that wouldn't have any effect on M2 Looking ahead, given the strength that we now have, because the growth in December was very rapid in M2--   We had, of course, more rapid growth in December in the MMDAs than was implicit in the Committee's target, or really even in the staff's estimate As I said, we have virtually reached the midpoint of the staff's estimated range now; we're very close to it Unless this slows down perceptibly or very rapidly, it's growing at least more toward the upper ends of the staff's estimates and probably well above what had been included in the 9-1/2 percent M2 growth that the Committee voted on, which included a modest increase in shifts Given what happened in December, that carries through somewhat into January because the level is being raised very rapidly; and simply carrying through that higher level raises the growth for the quarter on our estimate of the shift by about 2 points So, that alone would raise the 9-1/2 percent to roughly 11-1/2 percent without shifts being even greater from there on in than [assumed] in the Committee target So, without an ability at this point to be extremely specific, I would say that fairly clearly, for reasons of the shifts, we're running above the 9-1/2 percent To get at the so- called underlying strength of M2--[to determine] whether we're running above because of underlying strength as well--is really very difficult Given what we have so far in January and assuming over the balance of January increases in M2 that are normal, as if there were no shifts--in the $2 or $3 billion or $4 billion range weekly--we come out with a very high M2 in January To give you a rough idea of the range of possibilities, we have [an estimate] on the order of 28 percent; the New York estimator has [an estimate] on the order of 20 percent So, I think growth somewhere in the 20 to 30 percent range here is certainly more than possible, it's probable   No, gross   And 7-1/4 points of that is simply carrying through the December level that had been shifted Given our estimate of the amount that shifted--from this residual method we've assumed 16 percent of the MMDAs are shifted--and our projection for January over    1/14/83  the balance of the month, we would be reducing that 28 percent by only 116 percentage points The reason I'm that specific is that that looks way too high as a January underlying [growth rate] It just doesn't make sense So we tried to undertake some [analysis of] the numbers to see how sensitive things were And it's so sensitive that it's very difficult to guide ourselves in any very technical way If we had assumed that 25 percent shifted out of market instruments, which is not unreasonable--one could get that out of the numbers and I'm told that some market people think it's that high--then we would be subtracting 17 to 18 points at an annual rate in January from the actual growth So, [the rate of growth] is very sensitive to what one thinks has shifted, and we don't have a particularly firm way of coming up with an estimate of the amount of the shift   But, Mr Chairman, the one thing I can say to the Committee with a reasonable degree of certainty is that the 9-1/2 percent is too low relative to the amount of shift we've already seen So from that alone one would expect growth above 9-1/2 percent, and there is some growth above that that represents shift   The shift we've already seen The shift we've already seen adds 2-1/2 points to the first quarter If you had an 8 percent underlying growth, it would be at 10-1/2 percent; and I think the Committee added roughly another one in there, so that got me to 11-1/2 percent   It's 16-1/2 percent of that All I have here are growth rates that have been translated from it But it's 16-1/2 percent of that number What we worked out through January 5th was a specific number of $18 billion   For M3, we've had a considerable weakness in large CDs, so we had that weak December growth And it looks as if growth in M3 in January will strengthen considerably, largely because of this huge M2 If M2 is up in the 20 to 30 percent range, I would assume that something like at least half of the growth will be in M3 And we're assuming large CDs are not going to be quite as weak as they were So, partly from the carry-through effect on that, we get a very large M3  Mr Chairman, there's one other point I should make and that is with regard to Ml I'm afraid, again, that all it's going to show is how little we can say about these numbers We're publishing a $300 million decline for the week of January 5th But in the week of January 12th, for which we do have preliminary data--and that's the first full week of Super NOW accounts--our preliminary data show a    1/14/83  $66 billion increase One would think that that might be the Super NOW account effect, and maybe it will turn out to be that I'll get separate weekly data on Super NOWs a week from today for these few weeks But in the week of the 12th the figures show the seasonally unadjusted NOW accounts increased only $27 billion, little different from their increase in the previous week So the seasonal factor is transforming this into a fairly big increase   Yes, they are in there It doesn't look strong And the old M1-A in that week is increasing $18 billion on these preliminary numbers So it's not clear from the data that we're having any substantial effect from the Super NOWs as of now We have built some effect into the rest of January on that assumption; that's why we have a January estimate, based on what we have through the 12th for Ml, on the order of 15 percent We've assumed some further rather moderate increase in the course of the month from the Super NOWs; if the Super NOWs take off, we'd have a much bigger number   I don't have an Ml adjusted I did not work through these data, such as they are Ml adjusted is affected in another way; some of the Ml would go into MMDAs   I assumed President Roos was thinking of some sort of shift-adjusted Ml We don't have one What I was trying to say was that Super NOWs would tend to increase Ml but the shifts into MMDAs would tend to decrease it We assume very little shift into MMDAs from Ml because we couldn't see much actual change--an overt obvious effect--in the weekly figures If you had assumed that Ml was otherwise even stronger than we had in December, then you could put a lot of shift in We were reluctant to make that assumption So, I have not worked through to get at what Ml would look like if you abstracted from all these shifts, which affect it in different directions   That's [about] what our one week of data suggested   No, that's right   Well, I was looking at the large time deposits We're assuming a drop in the course of January--   In December, that's right   We don't really have weekly M3 data Well, I have sort of an experimental look and based on that they tend to go up They are very strong in the first 2 weeks largely because--if you believe what I have for the first two weeks in January--we have a $39 billion increase in M2 and the M3 increase is $23 billion It's not a bad relationship; that is, you're taking off $16 billion of the stuff in [unintelligible] That's why I said if M2 is really going to be up in the 20 percent range, M3 would be high   We have [assumed] more out of market securities than out of large time Who knows how that will work out! As I say, it's a pretty big reduction in the components of M3 But it can't offset the big increase in M2 entirely, by any means   Well, in the week of December 22nd, the rate of decline in large CDs in the net component of the money stock, after it abstracts from the money market fund holdings, was $6 billion Well, when we started this in the week of December 15th, it was $17 billion; then the [first] full-week effect was $6 billion; then in the week of the 29th it dropped to $31 billion; in the week of January 5th it dropped to $1 billion We have a much bigger drop coming up; we estimate a drop of $7 billion in the week of the 12th and then we stay with declines of $3 billion We're not really out of the pattern here at all, so it could drop sensationally more but it would have to be quite a sensational drop   Yes, that's right There could be a much more rapid runoff than we've had, which would lower the growth of M3 some But I think we'd still have a fairly big M3 growth here--bigger than December for sure   Yes   Well, it's very sensitive to these percentages   Do you mean on Ml?   Yes, probably We have assumed very little shift, but I'm sure whatever little shift there was could push it closer to the double-digits   Our figures on the shift out of Ml came nowhere near yours, Bob Our estimate is really below 5 percent; it's more like 2 or 3 percent   Well, we have been going along with the $200 million assumption that the Committee had set on borrowing So, we've been accommodating the nonborrowed to whatever changes in reserve requirements and aggregates have been involved in these figures    Well, we are changing it every week to accommodate what happens in light of the--   That's right, and also the drop in required reserves on M2 We're not letting that ease, for sure   I certainly didn't intend that I intended it in a--   If I may, Mr Chairman, I also thought that by the time the year's over--and this is the difficult thing--if it turned out that the fourth quarter were high and we happened to be over on that basis but year-over-year it looked very reasonable, that's the better way to look at it And almost vice versa   I wasn't intending to suggest that the Committee would set 6 different ranges   We set the path on the assumption of borrowing of $200 million, Mr Chairman    It's hard to [comment] without looking into your projections, President Black We did the same thing; we lagged Ml and M2 one and two quarters and compared the velocity behavior of the past 5 or 6 quarters with the history of these things measured that way With, say, M1 lagged 2 quarters--to develop M1 against GNP 2 quarters later--in the 6 quarters ending in the fourth quarter of 1982 we get an average decline in velocity of 11 percent even on that basis And if you go back before 1982, you can't find any negative numbers; you can find an increase of 05 percent, but you can't find any negative numbers If you do it for 5 quarters, it's the same thing We did this for the same reason that you're bringing it up; the question was raised to us by others We did the same thing for M2 and it shows a bigger increase in demand, even on this lagged basis So, it's perfectly true that with lags you don't get these negative relations between money and velocity--that a rise in money this quarter generally gives you a rise in velocity 2 quarters later But allowing for that over time we have the same kind of change in pattern on a lagged basis that we do on a concurrent basis so far as these data show us   I was not projecting 1983 I was just looking at the past   Are you referring to the so-called underlying growth rate?   Yes, we now think the first quarter is more like 8-1/4 percent, given the growth rates we got with the new seasonals and the definitional adjustment So for the year it is somewhere close to 8-1/4 percent, or a little over 8 percent   Well, the statement will certainly be shorter   I might say well in advance, because it relates to a question that was just raised about credit, that throughout this all of our money assumptions and our credit assumptions are in some sense high in terms of rates of growth It came through in President Black's question about velocity and its lagged effects They are all, over 1983, high relative to what one might have expected looking back at historical patterns in previous cyclical periods That carries through to Ml To a degree it carries through to M2, though it's hard to interpret that extracting from the shifts because M2 is such a different animal, given interest rates For that matter it's hard to interpret Ml It carries through to M3 and it carries through to total credit So, we're getting a somewhat smaller increase in nominal GNP relative to the increase we're expecting in all of these aggregates And, of course, that is what happened last year We got enormous drops in the velocity of all these aggregates last year We don't have anything like that [projected for] this year, but there's some sense of a little less lift in GNP relative to the aggregates that carries through into this year [Statement--see Appendix]   Mrs Low will pass out some charts that the Committee could look at [See Appendix]   Governor Teeters, old Ml last year grew 3-1/4 percent; new M1 grew 8-1/2 percent Our quarterly model equation would have predicted a growth of 5-1/2 percent, given interest rates and GNP So, [the model result] is in the middle It was no more accurate--well, the difference is small--on old M1 than it was on new Ml It just underpredicted one and overpredicted the other   It was 3-1/4 percent, Q4 1981 to Q4 1982   Oh, the velocity of old Ml! I'm sorry, I thought you [meant growth] The velocity of old M1 would have been a little plus  SPEAKER(?) It went up a little   Zero with no change But I was [addressing] the question of whether our model predicted it That's another way of getting it   Well, I can only answer it at the moment for last year If you get beyond that, old Ml went to pot with the NOW accounts and all that I still have in mind what happened a lot earlier when there were no differences between old Ml and new M1   Last year seems to me the only relevant year   One easy way to get at that is to say we have an equation based on the whole history and that the infamous, in a sense, quarterly equation in our model just says there has been a downward demand shift in M1 since the mid-1970s That equation, given income and interest rates in the last year, said Ml would have increased 5-1/2 percent The old Ml increased 3-1/4 percent So, the equation overpredicted for the old Ml The new M1 increased 8-1/2 percent and in that respect the equation underpredicted I find little to choose by the time I put myself in that framework Now, of course, Governor Gramley is right that it probably doesn't take into account this special effect of OCDs and NOW accounts and the fact that maybe the behavior is a little different They have a somewhat different elasticity The elasticity of M1 with respect to income and interest rates may be changing as the composition changes We have a problem there, no doubt   Mr Chairman, we on the staff here tend to look at velocity with interest rates taken into account And there was a sharp drop last year in interest rates So that's why we tend to look at the model, which enables us to look at both the impact of income and interest rates together That's why we did it the other way   We expected some drop in velocity   There's some--   Another thing to observe, Mr Chairman, is shown in chart 5 in the way that we plot the growth rates; they are obviously highly variable for both The standard deviations are a measure of variability There is little to choose between the standard contemporaneous and the alternative, which is to use a lag on these In all cases the alternative is a hair better than the standard, but the difference will not be of any significance None of this means that velocity isn't going to turn around in '83, lagged, unlagged, or any other way But it--   A general point I made earlier in the evening, Mr Chairman, was that whether you look at velocity contemporaneously or lagged, there is a marked change in the behavior of velocity in '82    2/8-9/83  relative to historical experience Lagging it doesn't change that And that's the only point I wanted to make   Yes We only went back to where we had quarterly data   The MMDAs?   It has been down to about $20 to $25 billion a week   Well, we've assumed, given what's in that long footnote, [the upward bias] to be about a point of growth   From February-March to the end of the year And that's assuming that [MMDA growth] slows down to $12 billion a week [on average in February] and to $8 billion a week [in March] and all that   Virtually It's very hard to read We assume, though it's hard to make any assumptions, that it was somewhere on the order of 3 points in January and with this slowdown in MMDAs that whatever they want to do with CDs they will do   That's right But we feel quite uncertain about that because we're not sure why banks have behaved this way with regard to Super NOWs There is some idea that it could take off once they start competing actively for MMDAs That's in the back of our minds as a possibility   It wasn't clear, Governor Partee; they may want a lot larger share than we have in here We still have a relatively low share   We have an increase of around 8 or 9 percentage points in the market share of banks and thrifts together of total credit and then some cutback in money market funds If they want a lot larger share, then I think it would be difficult to cut M3  -40-    2/8-9/83   Right   No I would say that we have a fourth quarter- to-fourth quarter growth on the order of 6 percent So, a slight positive is what's in my mind; it's right here in the Bluebook on Ml That, as Governor Gramley mentioned, would imply a slowdown from here  -42-    2/8-9/83  on out, on a quarterly basis, to something on the order of 5 percent or a bit under in growth rates Our quarterly model, for what it's worth, given the interest rates and income, would predict about a 7 percent growth in Ml That was one of the reasons I thought that a higher growth than 5-1/2 percent was likely; I couldn't see this downward demand shift we've been experiencing occurring this year because we're not ratcheting up interest rates and all that So, I would say 6 or 7 percent seems to me about the right Ml   Or, we might get more GNP with the same money, higher velocity, and not much interest rate change, if everyone decides to undo their liquidity That's a possibility   Yes, that's right   Yes, that's right That's why it would be a slowdown from now on   But it is of interest, Mr Chairman, that a lot of the slide occurred when interest rates were going up cyclically  -43-    2/8-9/83  And in '71 when they didn't go up cyclically, the increase was 29 or something like that on velocity   Well, we're not projecting [that] as part of this whole projection   That's right; it would be about 8 percent plus around 1 percent   Well, for the top in a mild sense it is Our point estimate [on the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter range], such as it is, is 118 percent, within the 9 to 13 percent range So, it's 12 points from the top of the range Our point estimate on the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range from February-March is 89 percent So, relative to the 9-1/2 percent it's 06 point from the top of the range With a 7 to 10 percent range, it would be more comparable in terms of distance from the top of the range   But that's only in that arithmetic sense   From February-to-March, that's right   Our technical reason for narrowing it when the base is February-March is that just a little more of the year is done and the more of the year that is done, presumably the more you know So, you could have a narrower range Also the argument is that the bulk of the shifts is behind us, and the reason for the wide spread was to take account of the uncertainties about the shifts Of course, it's highly uncertain in any event But that was the reason for suggesting a slightly narrower spread   Yes Our thought was that most of the shift would be done Now, to the extent that isn't true--   Mr Chairman, I might say that when we put the ranges that way, they weren't centered on the midpoint And the reason was that in the previous year the FOMC had established a range and said it expected growth around the upper end For that reason we simply didn't suggest ranges that were set on midpoints on the thought that the same range would then accommodate lower growth if possible So, these were not set at midpoints for M2   Yes, that's right   That would be leaving that same gap, Governor Partee, of a little over 1 point above the expected--   I'm afraid, President Morris, that we have not really worked it out in detail that far ahead I really don't have any comment on that   Mr Chairman, a partial answer to Governor Partee and President Morris As a percent of total credit our projections in the flow of funds at this point assume that thrifts and commercial banks together take 35 percent of the market in '83 and 30 percent in '84 I haven't worked that through to M3 as such, which would have to take account of money market funds and shifts from raising money abroad through CDs and that sort of thing That [share of the market] going back from 1980 to 1952 has generally run in a 40 to 60 percent range So, [our projection] is well below the norm if the norm can be thought of as the previous 30 years And, as Governor Partee has suggested, we may be too far below it if the depository institutions get very aggressive   We have it rising from '82, which was 27 percent; and in '81 it was 30 percent Those were all low years   But before that, numbers in the 40, 50, and 60 [percent area] are what you would have seen That's [higher] because we think much of that money is being raised through the bond markets--   Again, Mr Chairman, that range is not centered on the midpoint [of our forecast] We left everything along [the lines of] the Committee's previous decisions that growth would be running toward the upper ends of the ranges   In my view, the midpoint [for Ml] consistent with the 8 percent underlying M2 growth would be in the 6 to 7 percent range unless one thinks in some model sense that there's a downward demand shift   And that assumes that the DIDC doesn't do anything on the business demand deposits   It doesn't give much room for Super NOWs and assumes that we don't experience again the downward demand shift that we had from 1974 on   It's about 5 percent for the rest of the year It's roughly the same as in February-March I should add that our monthly model would say around 9 percent at current interest rates, somewhat similar to what President Balles mentioned Our quarterly model at around the current interest rate gives the quarterly average that we have here, around 8-3/4 percent Take your choice on which model you go by We put a little more weight in this case on the quarterly model, which gives this slowdown Of course, it could be somewhat higher in the coming months   Yes   Yes, that's the domestic nonfinancial debt   Yes, that includes the government   Well, another way to look at it would be that GNP [growth] is very low We have a bigger percentage increase in this debt aggregate than we do in GNP And our past experience in recoveries was that that wouldn't take place So, one other way to look at it is that your GNP number might be a little low Of course, that would then lower that ratio that's troubling Governor Gramley   Mr Chairman, we don't feel extremely confident about all of these numbers--and Mr Prell may be able to make some comments on how he got to here a little more elaborately--but if we attempted to have a lot more private credit, we believe that interest rates would be a lot higher in that process and we wouldn't get the GNP because the rise in interest rates would begin to cut it back So, this is where we came out with a consistent set of relationships We didn't think that there was room for any more private credit within the monetary targets and given the government's [needs]   Yes, [with rates] stable and maybe edging down   These are sort of fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter   $48 trillion is the stock    2/8-9/83   Ten percent of $48 trillion is $480 billion   I think, Mr Chairman, we have a very modest growth in nominal GNP here and we're getting [rising] economic activity only because we have very low growth in prices Our problem, we thought, was to explain why total credit growth was so small with this kind of nominal GNP, given--   I meant so large, pardon me   Part of our answer was that we weren't getting enough strength in economic activity to generate a substantial cash flow to businesses, so we weren't getting them able to finance as much, relatively speaking, internally The character of this expansion is somewhat different from the character of earlier expansions It's slower It's dominated by government   Well, the number for bank credit that falls out of this whole consistent set of data is 78 percent   Did you want the narrowing to apply to the M2 range as well?   In the summary we could indicate what the total credit would be of which we think bank credit would be about so much That would take care of it   Mr Chairman, the benchmark revisions, which were put in the appendix to the Bluebook, lowered the growth in M2 from 98 to 92 percent, largely because of the exclusion of IRA/Keogh accounts for the year; they had no effect on Ml, which grew at about 8-1/2 percent, and reduced M3 growth for the year as you see from 103 to 101 percent However, for M1 within the year there were very sharp changes in the seasonal pattern, which changed the months and quarters to a substantial degree The growth for Q4, which on the old seasonal pattern had been 161 percent, changed to 132 percent The January growth for Ml was reduced to 9-1/2 percent from the higher    2/8-9/83  number, 12-1/2 percent, that it had been before the seasonal revision These changes in the seasonal pattern were reflected also in the weekly data You may remember that the last week published, the week of the 26th [of January], showed an increase of $27 billion for Ml Now it has a decrease of $26 billion but the preliminary data we have show substantial increases thereafter for the weeks of February 2nd and February 9th, suggesting that we're on track toward a higher M1 in February whereas we had revised down the January growth by 3 points and thought it would continue at the lower growth rate The data for early February on the revised benchmarks and seasonals suggest that we're on a higher track for February than the estimate of around 6 percent we had in the Bluebook I don't have additional data   13 percent   9-1/2 percent   It makes it difficult, Mr Chairman, on the face of it to think that Ml is going to slow substantially in February and March on average from January   Not at this point   I can't in the operating paragraph   We've had weakness in bank credit   That was meant to refer to December-to-January   That only refers to January, because of the problem you raised So, if that isn't clear--    2/8-9/83   Well, as to the strength of Ml, Mr Chairman, I'm not sure how much is Super NOWs at the moment I don't have any added data It might be desirable to leave it more general   Well, the credit aggregates aren't slowing, Mr Chairman    2/8-9/83   That's right   Any time we've constructed a reserve path it has been with $200 million of borrowing [consistently]   I would say not, President Guffey The funds rate has averaged between 8-1/4 and 8-1/2 percent steadily, which is what one would expect aiming at $200 million of borrowing There have been variations around it, but they haven't been accompanied by much variation in the overall constellation of money markets   What I meant, Mr Chairman, is that unless told differently we would construct a nonborrowed path based on the required reserves that are evident that week, assuming that borrowing will satisfy $200 million of the total of excess and required And that's how it will be constructed until we're told differently   It depends, as Peter said, on what you thought anything would have been doing otherwise Our rough estimate was something like 10 percentage points in January It had been reduced by that amount because of the CD drop--   --and the 1 percent out of the saving deposits But that has some rough assumption of what it would be otherwise   Yes, largely because of this sharp drop in required reserves because of shifting into the--   I'd have to look it up, but I think it's February where we are going to have a decline   We have a total reserve growth of 1-1/2 percent roughly at this point for January A sharp drop is projected for February    Yes, but we do have a ruling from a lawyer who says that that overdraft is not lending to the Treasury but is performing a normal banking function   I think they would have to extend their ruling a bit [beyond] one day I don't know that they would--   Mr Sternlight   [Statement--see Appendix]   It seems to be   For the depository institutions, we don't put the money funds in there, so--   It doesn't have as big an effect If it were to explain what happened, the rate effect would have to be bigger than in fact is built into the equation at the present time   The deficiency in our equations, or the ones that fit through 1974, is rather obvious The staff experimentally has been dealing with one fit through 1981, which tries to track OCDs separately So far we haven't been able to get a variable in there that reflects the saving behavior very much It has a sort of technical assumption that it behaves like a transaction account and I don't think it's working quite right I have some sympathy for what you're saying Our equation doesn't quite give that result yet; maybe it should, but it doesn't yet So, we have to explain this as a demand shift   Yes   That's right   That's right   Governor Teeters, if I may I don't know if Mr Sternlight agrees or not, but I would assume given our past experience that if $250 million were attained, and assuming excess reserves came in on a somewhat normal track, that it is more likely than not that the funds rate would edge back down from this recent level It might not get below 8-1/2 percent, but I would think it'd be more likely to be edging to an 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent range or somewhere in there I don't think that would tend to confirm recent experience as much as, say, $300 to $350 million would Maybe Mr Sternlight can--   That had grown out of the previous paragraph, which discusses the long-run targets   Yes, it's still there But I think "in the short run" fits very well also That had just grown out of the previous language   Do you want to use the word "objectives" there?   Only about 1 percent    Thank you, Mr Chairman I really can be very brief and give a short summary of where the evidence seems to lead It's very hard to come to any conclusion that M1 is behaving more consistently with historical patterns than it has been in the past We feel that it is very probable that the so-called interest rate responsiveness of M1 has gone up, largely because of the increasing role of NOW accounts, which have a savings component and probably a bit more interest sensitivity in relation to that savings component But we have not seen any sign of a usual cyclical increase in the velocity of Ml; and in fact we are thinking, of course, that in the second quarter we are still seeing a decline in that velocity Looking at the range itself, the odds seem to favor Ml not coming in within that range I would suggest that it may be a little premature, if the Committee were inclined to change the range, to do so There will be a full review in July and a lot may depend on where we happen to come out in June--whether in fact we get a huge reversal of this May upsurge or whether it's beginning to tell us that we really are on a much higher track than we expect  -17-    5/24/83  With respect to M2, it seems to me that the assumptions that the Committee made when it established the February-March base have held up The bulk of the shifts do seem to be well behind us, though the increases in MMDAs recently have been running a little higher than we had assumed But, of course, they are very far below the pace of January-February and even below the March pace In some sense, the oddity in M2 now is the weakness of the non-transaction component But assuming that does return to something closer to normal, there would seem to be little problem at this point in the longer-term M2 range Thus, that too looks as if it is certainly sustainable pending the full-scale review that the Committee will be making in July   Well, it's hard to read that [unintelligible], Mr Chairman, which pertains particularly to Ml and M2 So we had interpreted that as the Committee's main focus of attention M3 and credit are running well within the ranges We wouldn't see any particular problems at this point with those ranges   Yes We have not seen any return to normal historical patterns yet, which is one of the Committee's criteria for giving it more weight   [Statement--see Appendix]   One thought we had in reference to President Ford's question was that as you get into a noninflationary period or you become convinced that inflation is down, cash in some sense becomes more valuable It's not going to lose its value as fast And in any event, interest rates come down and the opportunity cost of holding it [declines] And that would affect Ml On the broader aggregates, what I was trying to say here--and it may hold in Europe, though I haven't examined it closely--is that we could also begin to see people moving into longer-term assets before their rates drop too rapidly   Oh yes   I'm not sure, but I think that's right   Ours is 5 percent or 5-1/4 percent on NOW accounts I was not assuming Super NOWs as a very important factor   It would be a little higher if you went from the fourth quarter It would really be within a 6 to 9 percent range; I think it is somewhere around 8 or 8-1/2 percent If you went from QIV to May making those adjustments [rather than from] January- February, it would be a bit higher   The funds rate/borrowing relationships have been quite variable One week in late April we had borrowing of $678 million and the funds rate averaging 858 percent; the next week we had lower borrowing, of $435 million, and the funds rate was averaging 880 percent And then last week we had $550 million borrowing and a funds rate averaging 859 percent   Well, there have been lower weeks of borrowing To make it a complete story, Mr Chairman, we had $232 million of borrowing with a funds rate of 8-3/4 percent and $252 million with funds at 870 percent   Well, borrowing in the week to date is averaging $350 million and funds are trading at 8-5/8 to 8-3/4 percent generally Who knows? The relationship to borrowings has been quite variable, so I don't think one can really be extremely precise   It was at 880 percent yesterday It's on this sheet; I'll give it to you in a second It's 8-3/4 percent, roughly   Yes   Mr Chairman, as a technical comment on market reaction--and, of course, no one can assess market reaction with any precision--if $350 million were where the Committee wanted to put borrowing, I'm not sure that would be noticeable at all in the market We've been running very close to it We hit it exactly The free reserves number that's implied after you take out seasonal borrowing, which the markets tend to do, is slightly positive [Unintelligible] The odds on missing it on the high side are somewhat lower than when we're working with a minimal number because with a minimal number it's hard to get below it and it's easier when we miss to be on the high side because banks' borrowing tends to be higher So, technically, I'm not sure with $350 million that hardly anything would be noticed   Yes   I was mainly trying to change your Ml to an "anticipation" instead of "desirable"   I don't mean to press it, Mr Chairman, but there is some advantage to having the expectation of a pickup, or some such wording, because then if it doesn't occur, we could say it implies something    President Balles, even some years ago short rates and long rates tended to move together in differing degrees In the very recent period, actually, long rates have moved up about as much as short rates I myself think it's somewhat surprising, and I think that [reflects] an anticipation or fear of further monetary tightening I would dare say that if the short rates went down in a sustained way, there would be a very sharp drop in long rates I don't think at this very moment that this is reflecting a change in inflationary expectations Now, the level of long rates--being high in real terms--might have something to do with the budget deficit and the fact that you need higher real rates when the government is the propelling force than you do when private expenditures are the propelling force, with the same level of real GNP At least most of our big models would give that result So, private spending wouldn't be so high at this level of real rates, independently, without the government stimulus   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, there is some question, at least in my mind, that the rate of real growth might not be as high as we have projected   To lower the level of real rates--   If velocity were lower? Well, I think velocity then would be higher, if we have higher price increases   Lower real growth than projected and more inflation than projected   No, I was making an assumption that the real interest rates in our forecast and the real GNP in our forecast might be inconsistent and that to make them consistent I would have to lower the real interest rates I could lower them in one of two ways either by raising prices, which might be a very reasonable outcome, or by lowering the level of nominal interest rates to make this level of real GNP more sustainable if prices are indeed as low as projected   That was in Mr Lindsey's [memo]; let me just track it down It's an average of around 2-1/2 percent   Oh yes, it's much lower, but it's still a lot stronger than in the first half of this year   You did; for the fourth quarter you saw a 5   Yes And I would say, if anything, that would tend to be high That assumes a very low growth rate in the fourth quarter and assumes some considerable responsiveness to somewhat higher interest rates, which is built into our forecast   Well, I think the fourth quarter, which Governor Gramley was focusing on, may be a little high   President Solomon, we don't really project nominal GNP by making assumptions about velocity and tying that into money We tend to do it somewhat more judgmentally and then see what velocity results we have and see if that makes a certain sense to us We have a large range of tolerance around the variations of velocity   Well, on balance, we don't think the measured level of Ml has been distorted by the Super NOWs and MMDAs We think there generally have been offsetting flows in that respect We think that M1 was distorted by the introduction of regular NOW accounts at the beginning of 1981 on a nationwide basis; they introduced a savings character to Ml that it didn't have before And seemingly, so far as we can judge from the past year's behavior, that has made Ml in technical jargon more interest elastic The reason it has made it more interest elastic is that unlike demand deposits, these accounts have a 5-1/4 or 5-1/2 percent explicit interest rate, so the fall in market rates from 20 to 8 percent has reduced the opportunity cost of holding these to, say, at the low end, 3 percent--[the difference]  -21-    7/12-13/83  between 8 and 5 percent So, they have moved more sensitively than they would have if they had a zero explicit interest rate; one would have had a much bigger loss involved if one had held [demand deposits]  Now, what I don't know is what happens on the reverse side of this If interest rates begin going up, do we get a fast move out of these accounts just as we got a fast move into them? If we do, then we would have some hope of NOW account growth slowing and money growth slowing The second thing that has been a problem in Ml is that we simply have not forecast or made the judgment that demand deposits would grow as strongly as they have Demand deposits have grown very strongly and steadily since late last year, except in January and February I cannot offer the Committee a very strong explanation for that In large part, it might be compensating balances; and it also might be a foreshadowing of some transactions needs So, there is a large element of uncertainty about Ml because it is a new animal That's why I sound somewhat ambivalent about whether the Committee should or shouldn't go back to it as strongly as before   Well, it depends on where it goes If it goes into market instruments, no; if it goes into other accounts that are in M2, it's sort of a wash You're just left with M2--   No, not if it goes into other accounts in M2 It's neutral; it's reducing Ml   [That] reduces M2; if it goes into other accounts in M2, it has no effect on M2   Well, that get's into higher metaphysics in some sense   I happen to think that the demand curve has changed its slope and that maybe we're moving down the slope of a different demand curve Whether that's a shift or not, I don't know   Whether or not one would tend to put more weight on Ml, I happen to think that it's different from the way it was before 1981 I think it's probably more interest sensitive than it was before I would not conclude from that that I could use that same interest sensitivity in making my judgments in the future because Super NOWs have become more important And I have a vague feeling in my gut that when interest rates go up, people, once they have these NOW accounts, are not going to move as rapidly to get out of them as they did to get in Now, that's just a gut feeling But that, too, would affect these interest rate/money relationships   No, not in exactly those terms, President Morris   Well, you're right that the M2 measure does cover a large variety of financial institutions, including money market funds If they are packaging those loans and happen to be selling them to instrumentalities other than those covered by M2, we wouldn't particularly get it My mind is working in other ways I would think that they might be doing that; but if the capital controls were of real concern, we might at the margin get a little more rationing and a little less interest rate pressures I know that's not a popular view, but that is not exactly impossible if the capital controls are very effective  -23-    7/12-13/83   One could have argued in that period, equally convincingly, that it was the control of Ml also--it went to almost no growth--that got interest rates up As interest rates went up, what happened in the financial markets in the distribution of credit between banks and others was determined by the Reg Q ceilings, which were an impediment to banks competing And then that credit got pushed off into other sectors Something like that could happen with capital controls; possibly there could be some degree of rationing there But look, what causes the interest rates to rise? That might be a question one would have to argue about It might be that the control of money, somehow defined, causes the interest rates to rise   Well, we have our estimate of the amount of money that goes into the Super NOW accounts from outside Ml We put it most recently at about 35 percent The latest Michigan survey, the one we have through May--and they are very variable month-by-month given that it's a small sample--[puts it at] 40 percent; the earlier ones had a lower number So, we said somewhere around 35 percent If you take 35 percent of something a little over $30 billion and take 3 or 4 percent of something over $300 billion, you tend to get offsetting numbers That's how we're stuck  -24-    7/12-13/83   Well, you're left thinking that 65 percent of the money shifted from regular NOWs and demand deposits and sort of skimming off the top   Well, we allege that the long-run ranges for alternative II are consistent with the staff's GNP projection So, it would be a dropping of M2 roughly--   The midpoint of that, we allege, is consistent with the staff's [nominal] GNP projection of 83 percent As Jim was pointing out, the Committee's GNP projection is somewhat stronger than this 83 percent   That's right, Governor Wallich Actually, I hesitated a lot about whether to present these strategies in these quantitative terms, which are simply the model's extrapolations from a baseline forecast I had hoped they would be useful in terms of general direction but, as we say in the text, there is not much price effect from carrying on at 8-1/2 percent [for M2] And, possibly, the model also is underestimating the sensitivity of decisionmakers in the economy  -27-    7/12-13/83   Yes, if you are comparing strategies 1 and 2   Oh, sure, off the models   Well, these are model results, that's right I didn't realize you were comparing those, Governor Martin   In 1984 we're talking about 8 percent for M2 and that's consistent with alternative I   But the one row also assumes further reductions thereafter So, it's a much more restrictive policy going out   That's right   Well,--   Basically, Governor Rice, the problem with using the model--and what has always given me some pause at least in presenting the results the model gives to the Committee--is that the model has embedded in it a long lag in price effects and a short lag in output effects And it's not at all clear that that is the way the world works at this very time That's essentially why every time we present [an alternative] that says money growth is going to be stronger, [the economy] will always look better over the near-term horizon Output will always react faster than prices And, of course, the nearer we are to high levels of unemployment, in practice one would think that's the most sensible thing So, that is one of the problems in presenting these results; it always looks more favorable in the near term to raise money growth I would point out strategies 3 and 4 Strategy 3 slows M2 growth even more than any of the alternatives presented and then speeds it up in the latter part of the 4-year period That, according to the model, has a very favorable effect on prices by 1986 relative to speeding up now and slowing later   And output is no worse off by the end of '86 than [under strategy 2], which was a somewhat surprising result to me   Do you mean should you reduce it even [more]?   Well, in establishing the [M2] range for this year, the Committee had raised it a point from what the staff had [suggested] and the aftermath of it is that it looks rather wise to have raised it since we are running in the middle of the raised range [and above the midpoint of] what the staff originally had   So, I personally would recommend a bit of caution and I would recommend lowering it by the same 1/2 point that you're going along [with for the other aggregates] at this point It is running a bit strong and I have no reason to think it will drop substantially It ought to drop some   Our point estimate, Mr Chairman, for what it's worth, is that credit growth fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter in 1984 --with our assumption of nominal GNP growth of 83 percent--will be 9-3/4 percent, which follows our estimate for this year of 10-1/8 percent So you are right Credit growth is continuing to run about 1 to 1-1/2 points above our nominal GNP estimate If the Committee goes with its nominal GNP [estimate], it's much more in line   Mr Chairman, I would reiterate the point that in evaluating this it might depend on what GNP forecast the Committee chooses to go with for 1984, because by going down 1 point the midpoint would be below the present Committee forecast for 1984   No, that's right; I miscalculated or something   Governor Teeters, we do expect the growth of Ml to slow down The various models I've looked at all suggest that in varying degrees--some more rapidly than others But we had been expecting it to slow down in May and June, so I felt somewhat cautious in light of that behavior But the models--because the interest rate effect has worn out and there is some slight increase occurring and because nominal GNP growth is slowing--all would have slower Ml into an area reasonably [consistent] with these targets   Technically, yes   In response to Governor Gramley's comment, it depends on how you rebase It doesn't quite [correspond] if you use Q2 to Q4 1983, because of the high growth that has already happened The rate [of growth] from Q2 to Q4 is 8 percent--   That's right So, if you rebased and said--   Mr Chairman, a technical point, which I was struggling to say in response to Governor Gramley's comment, has to do in some sense with the psychology of rebasing Unless it turns out that the numbers we get very soon show that July is extremely weak, if you rebase you still will be starting out well above that rebased range You're above the one now, of course But in any event, if you base on the second quarter and plot July, you will be well above the range already That may or may not have some implications for the market, depending on how it's expressed and what you say in relation to it But I think it's a factor that ought to be considered in the analysis   Well, you would have to rebase right on June   That's right It's not any different in fact; it's just the question of psychology   But once you rebase, people will tend to look at it and think you're much more serious about it, I think   Well, we're projecting [July growth] well above that at this moment But even if it came in around 8 percent, I think Ml would be above [the range] given the shape of the second quarter, which was very high toward the end You are throwing yourselves into high--   Well, if you are talking about the second half of '83, but if you get into '84, the second year probably--   Mr Chairman, I made some calculations when I was fiddling with this Growth of 12 percent for the year would give you about 8 or 8-1/2 percent from June to December That's about a 10 percent rate from Q2 to Q4   I would assume it's above, but I'd have to check Oh, I'm sure it's above   For the year-to-date it's around 13 percent As of June, from a fourth-quarter base it was running 138 percent So, it's 58 percentage points above the June level   I meant above the June target level And the growth rate for Ml from the fourth quarter to the second quarter is about 13-1/4 percent Either way it's very strong Our projection for the third quarter, for what it's worth--   Well, you have very low fourth-quarter numbers [if you] believe that Growth is going to have decelerate into the 4 or 5 percent area   Yes That's what comes out of the averaging process If Ml growth is decelerating at the end of the third quarter and continuing to decelerate in the fourth quarter, you get very low numbers But I would be very cautious about [assuming] that will happen   Yes, low numbers month-to-month and a low quarterly average in the fourth quarter   We will get the more recent numbers shortly At the moment it looks that way   Last year, Mr Chairman, we thought July was going to be high and it came in weak Remember, that was the surprise last year And August and September came in high   Mr Chairman, the table on page 13 of the Bluebook summarizes the short-term ranges Alternative A retains the federal funds rate range of 6 to 10 percent, which was in the last directive of the Committee, but assumes in effect retaining the degree of restraint on bank reserve positions that the Committee most recently has allowed And those money market conditions, we believe, are consistent with a slowing in Ml growth to a 7-1/2 percent range over the June-to-September period, as you see, and a slowing of M2 and M3 growth--  -58-    7/12-13/83   Yes, that produces a 108 percent quarterly average, given a high July And I might add that I do now have very recent data and they would not suggest that July is very different from 10 percent They tend to confirm the first couple of weeks in July that we had estimated last week Alternative B and alternative C contemplate a tightening of bank reserve positions--in the case of alternative B, perhaps up to the 9-1/2 percent area for the funds rate and perhaps up to the $850 million to $1 billion range for member bank borrowing And alternative C contemplates even more tightening We believe alternative B is generally consistent with Ml growth, expressing it at an annual rate, in the 7 to 11 percent range and is more consistent than alternative A with the broader aggregates--at least M2--being closer to the midpoint of their ranges We believe alternative A to be more consistent with the broader aggregates being toward the upper end of their ranges--particularly M3, but M2 would be in the upper half of its range And for M1 we would be more comfortable, I think, with an 8 to 12 percent range for the year The greater tightness of alternative C we believe would be more temporary even than that under alternative B because we would contemplate a more rapid downward reaction of the demands for goods and services And that would tend to be reversed toward the end of the year and into early next year more than with alternative B and, of course, that would contemplate a greater slowing of M2 and M3  Mr Chairman, in view of the uncertainties, I might say that as a policy course it would not seem illogical to me to contemplate higher growth rates of the aggregates, such as those in alternative A, even if the Committee wanted also to contemplate some little tightening of the money market If the Committee did not wish to contemplate any tightening, it certainly seems as if the higher growth rates of alternative A, or maybe even higher rates, would be necessary so far as we can see at this point   If the Committee wanted to contemplate no more than a modest tightening, then I think it would be more certain to get that result to be consistent with the [growth rates it adopts for the] aggregates if it raises them If the Committee were willing to have much more than a modest tightening--quite a tightening--then, of course, a lower aggregate [figure] would work more to assure that that would develop naturally   Well, I'm not sure that that would get you a lot of tightening   Probably, although this week borrowing is running around $400 million Of course, in earlier weeks it had run much, much higher very steadily   I was associating alternative B with some tightening, Governor Martin--perhaps I misspoke--and alternative A with about the present degree of reserve restraint, which would be a validation [of the modest recent tightening]   No, I was assuming further tightening would mean a funds rate moving up at least to 9-1/2 percent   That is somewhat tighter than we contemplated in alternative A and I would say between $600 and $850 million   Borrowing has fluctuated so much that--   We thought that would be more consistent--again this is judgmental--with the alternative that isn't here; we had more like an 8 to 12 percent range for the year Alternative B, which is the basis of the staff forecast, we thought was more consistent with a 7 to 11 percent range   The way we had written "B," it assumed a funds rate probably up in the 9-1/2 percent area or somewhat higher Again, it depends on what borrowing level the Committee adopts The one President Guffey suggested would be somewhat lower What we have in here is 9-1/2 to 10 percent; where it would fall in that range depends a bit on how it's toned up   No, that would eliminate the need to make that assumption in advance If you gave us a net borrowed assumption, we would have a required reserve figure; under lagged reserve accounting that would disappear later and then we would know the nonborrowed reserve number by subtraction Whatever excess is involved and  -61-    7/12-13/83  however net borrowed chooses to distribute itself between excess and borrowings, we'll work out We will have a lot of borrowing and a lot of excess, or a little borrowing and a little excess, for the same--   Mr Chairman, I should have commented that the proposed directive alternative on the short run does include a bracketed proposal that the Committee may want to consider as consistent with this discussion If it were included, it would imply a degree of automaticity in reaction that has not been attained for some time; if not included, we could not have the automaticity that had been in place before last October That's another point the Committee may wish to consider  SPEAKER(?) Where are you?   I had not thought that those necessarily followed, Governor Gramley This would be in case the Committee wished to give a little more weight to Ml and a little more automaticity, whether or not the bracketed part under the long run-- Oh, I'm sorry! You mean the second paragraph on page 21 That's right; it would go more logically with the last paragraph   That's right But if you adopt the 6 percent and July is correct, that alternative would necessarily imply a sharp drop in August and September to about 4 percent That would give you a high quarterly average but August and September would have to come down quite a lot to get there   Yes   It was because of that sharp drop implied in August and September that I suggested with a bit of caution the possibility of higher growth rates [even] if you had some modest tightening   I would think a rise   But "B" is going to a funds rate of 9-1/2 to 10 percent If the Committee were only going to a 9-1/2 percent funds rate, things would become a little more iffy; it becomes a sort of struggle between the banks   Well, we were writing alternative A as if it implied bank reserve positions that would keep the money market about where it is It's probable that short-term rates and long-term rates have anticipated a further tightening, so there is some real possibility of a little drop in rates under alternative A if it works out that the money market just doesn't tighten up from its recent degree of restraint   That's what we were intending The market is anticipating further tightening, as far as we could construe up to yesterday But, that's what we were intending   Evidence comes in later In terms of the statistical evidence available, it's shakier and comes in later [than numbers] for M2 and M3   We couldn't put that in   Yes, it's hard to get out of that range   By the fourth quarter?   You have to give me some time to make that calculation   Yes, it should be around 11-1/2 percent If it grows 9 percent Q2 to Q4, just extrapolating from what I have here, that ought to be about 11-1/2 percent for the year Is that what you're asking? If it grows 8 percent, it looks like it's about 11 percent for the year So, if it grows 9 percent, it ought to be around 11-1/2 percent for the year   You have indicated no change in the range for next year You could say "extending 5 to 9 percent over the balance of this year and indicated no change for the range for next year"   Yes, indicating that its base is wherever it ends up   No, not with the short-run policy; it's not consistent That was just in case a different short-run policy--    Mr Chairman, I might note that a good part of my briefing is devoted to these questions   [Statement--see Appendix]   The quarterly figures, starting with the third quarter of 1982 are 24 percent; 78 percent; 56 percent--held down by shifts, I think, but I don't know the exact amounts--and 67 percent And it looks like Q3 1983 will be 69 percent   It's around 2 percent or that order of magnitude for current M1   Well, if you use Ml without NOW accounts, which is what we used to have, the history is that in the fourth quarter of a recovery, its growth is around 7 percent or something like that Take out [unintelligible] and it'll be lower--more like 6 to 7 percent   No, that's what I was trying to say I don't think it is I don't think you would then reason that the 2 percent is too low  -16-    8/23/83   What I meant was, if you go back to history when Ml had a different composition, the numbers in the fourth quarter of a recovery run around 5 or 6 or 7 percent What we have now, based on our current estimates, is something on the order of 2 percent, which will mean GNP doesn't pick up and Ml doesn't pick up with it If you use the old M1A, you'd have something like 4 or 5 percent, which would be more in line with past cycles It just says it's some sort of a residual transaction element if this keeps up and old M1A is moving like it used to One conclusion I drew from that is that the new Ml does have this additional element, which is holding down its velocity So, one might not want to extrapolate from that to higher nominal GNP a few quarters ahead Velocity is behaving a little differently; that could change   I think they are probably not unrelated I was assuming that the large capital inflow we've had this time, without a sharp depreciation in the dollar so far, reflected a willingness of the foreigners to put their money here not [wholly] independent of interest rates but more or less independent of interest rates--that is, there is a wide range of interest rates that wouldn't have mattered But that willingness really meant that the exchange rate stayed higher than it would otherwise be instead of depreciating That kept our prices from being higher than they would otherwise be and it was the price effect in my mind that kept the interest rates from being higher It's somewhat like in the olden days of fixed exchange rates when we could run big balance of payments deficits and lose [foreign] exchange reserves and in some sense have bigger domestic purchases without getting right away the inflationary impact of the purchases And in my head, subject to Ted's contradiction, something like that has been going on--   Well, yes One would think so   It has been running, generally, quite a lot higher This week it's running over $1 billion; even taking out a couple of what I think are special cases it would be running $800 to $900 million And the federal funds rate is at 9-1/2 percent It seems that the demand for borrowing is running a little higher than we thought   I was looking at the $350 million; I was not necessarily assuming that, Governor Wallich I assumed that the range would encompass some variation in excess reserves   I would say somewhere between $700 and $900 million on borrowing, but one can't be absolutely certain Mr Sternlight?   That was one of the two models I referred to that did run higher   Much or most?   I would say it is more than a large part, Governor; in many cases they're within 5 basis points It really is the bulk or something--    The only thing I would add is that to the degree foreign private investors are less anxious to be in dollars and their dollar holdings that are in the money supply, like overnight Eurodollars, are replaced by foreign government purchases of US Treasury securities--if that's the form of the capital inflow--then, of course, we get minor effects on M2 and M3 But they would be relatively minor, I would think And they might be replaced by banks getting that money from domestic [sources]   15 to 20 minutes on this special presentation   There's a package of material--charts on velocity, in which chart 1 is the Ml velocity--and I'll be referring to those charts I'll be giving a special presentation on velocity without necessarily any implications for current policy Mr Chairman, I have no more than a very few comments on current policy, but I would delay making them if I--   Yes, on velocity for around 15 to 20 minutes   [Statement--see Appendix]   No, I do have a lag in the middle panel on chart 1 and there is a scaling difference and they start in 1969   No, I don't have the lags in chart 1   Yes   No, they're both quarterly They should be exactly the same except that it's lagged on one chart and contemporaneous on the other and I shortened the time period and put M2 and M3 down for reference   There is a difference in scale but there should be no difference in the numbers   Mr Chairman, may I make a comment? President Balles did refer to a staff paper which actually had been sent, of course, to your staff in the spirit of professional economic discussion The bulk of it was the technical analysis of the econometric methods used in the estimating procedures There was a small part of it in which the people went on to provide some tests about whether M1 or M2 would be better I would not read those results--and I'm not sure that that paper would be circulated in exactly this way to the FOMC--as indicating in any way that Ml was good over the last year and a half The part that you were referring to was a set of theoretical, not empirical, estimates of various kinds of elasticities and what one would have to have for Ml relative to M2 for M2 to be better I think the econometric evidence that I referred to here does show that the prediction values of M2 and M3 were no better than M1 in predicting GNP in 1982 In 1983, from some perspectives perhaps it was a little better; it turned out quite well, maybe by accident, because on average M2 and M3 don't do as well as Ml But M2 didn't miss the first-quarter and second-quarter predictions by [much]; on average, it was less than 1 percent at an annual rate The [predictions] went far off in the third quarter because of the first-quarter distortion in M2 So, I think it's quite right that M2 and M3 didn't become better as Ml got worse, but they didn't get nearly as bad as Ml relative to their past experience in this particular period This is a transition period   Well, I think Ml demand may be highly interest sensitive at this point The alternative estimating methods can give you somewhat different results over the long run than obtained in your excellent staff paper I wouldn't doubt that in this transition period Ml elasticity is a lot bigger because I think the NOW accounts have introduced that because of the ceiling rates and the related movement of market rates and ceiling rates So, it appears we have that The main point I was trying to make for the Committee was that if indeed it is true that the Ml demand is highly interest elastic-- and I don't think it is over the long run though I think it may be now--to the degree that's true the value of Ml as a target, even if you can predict the demand, is reduced It is not such a good target for you any more   Then, when interest rates go down, because the economy is weaker than you have projected, you have to let money grow a lot faster than your target So, it isn't serving the function of a fixed target   Right Intuitively, if there was no interest elasticity to money demand and income was weak, then you could hold this fixed target and income would be dragged back up There would be a lot of interest rate variation That gets to be the problem if money is as highly interest elastic as your paper makes out   I think there are some technical disputes   Well, Mr Chairman, it's very brief since the aggregates are so comfortably within their ranges We really had a hard time thinking of alternatives for the Committee to consider Alternative B, of course, was based on current reserve conditions, which we've interpreted as borrowing centered around $650 million, and an associated funds rate probably around 9-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent Alternatives A and C are somewhat easier and somewhat tighter, respectively But even so, the degree of ease and tightening as presented there is not so much as to push the aggregates outside their long-run ranges; Ml, M2, and M3 remain within the ranges from now to the end of the year The logic of presenting alternatives within our usual structure--where aiming at a higher money growth leads to lower interest rates and a lower money growth to higher interest rates--to my mind yields somewhat anomalous results under current circumstances unless there are vast differences in opinion about the staff outlook for the economy or about the demand for money For instance, given the economic outlook, there is no apparent need to force money up or down in the ranges by significant changes--at least premeditated or fore-ordained changes--in reserve restraint or reserve paths The question would seem to be more whether if money were moving up in the range, or even above it, the Committee would wish to tighten And if money were moving down, would the Committee wish to ease and to what extent? It's somewhat opposite from the way the specs are presented and the logic of it Given as much uncertainty as still prevails about the meaning of the aggregates that are the focus of policy, it seems to me that the answer to the policy question still involves an assessment of the economy and emerging financial conditions Thus, the directive as structured at the last two meetings, with a sentence that in effect serves as a proviso--permitting reserve adjustments to faster or slower money growth depending on the economic outlook and financial conditions--seems appropriate assuming that whatever option is adopted is an option that keeps money growth comfortably within the range   In the past three weeks   Borrowing since the last Committee meeting, as we said, varied between $650 million and $16 billion And for practically all of that time the funds rate on a weekly average basis was within 5 or 6 basis points of 9-1/2 percent Then one week it dropped to a little over 9 percent So, the relationship has been quite loose   The October 1st deregulation is enough almost to explain a 1/2 point, I would think   The lowest week was way back on September 9th when we had virtually--   Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing for the August 24th week, which was the week of the meeting, was $11 billion; August 31st it was $12 billion Then it was $757 million, $647 million, $1,589 million or $16 billion, and then this past week $739 million And this week they're probably going to be somewhere around $800 or $850 million   The net borrowings, doing quick subtraction in my head, would be $600 million August 24th; around $700 million August 31st; then close to zero; around $220 million; $13 billion; and last week $317 million   Now, the market takes out the seasonal though This week?   This week we're aiming at $200 million Yes, it's $450 million and $650 million, so probably we're very close to $200 million We may hit it with higher borrowing or higher excess   The other fact, Mr Chairman, is that in July nonborrowed reserves dropped about 03 percent and dropped 9 percent [in August] In September, based on the data as of the end of last week, they will rise around 4 percent because there's a small drop in borrowing So, the nonborrowed is turning up in September after dropping   Well, you could say "the slight easing in reserve positions" and point to the nonborrowed going up as was reflected mainly in drops in short rates other than the funds rate, which was affected by all these other things Because the other short rates are down   No, I mean it was reflected in other short rates apart from the funds rates   No, I meant the easing in reserve conditions was reflected--   There will be indicators of somewhat lesser reserve pressures on the net borrowed--   Yes, if we look at September and August on average, net borrowed is a little less than--  -37-    10/4/83   The latest figure published for the 21st is just barely above the August level On September 28th a further increase is what we would forecast and, for what it's worth, a rather strong increase on October 5th There's some doubt about all that But that would give you an October level well above--by about $5 billion--the September average level, which would suggest a strong October growth of a little over 10 percent   But we're not projecting that   Most of the forecasters don't believe it and the rest of the projections assume a drop after the October 5th week But if that [unintelligible]--   I think $1 billion a week--   Yes, I'm sure it would be I'd have to work it out   Yes, that would be very high   We'll just make the calculation  -39-    10/4/83   Mr Chairman, in answer to your question If we were so unfortunate as to have those $1-1/2 billion [weekly]  -41-    10/4/83  increases--you remember $1 billion is to the top of the range, 9 percent--   On the assumption that there's a further increase in the week of the 28th, it would get you 14 percent growth if it steadily grew $1-1/2 billion through the course of that month   We're not assuming that You might say the fourth quarter we have there is consistent with what our local money market model would be projecting and roughly, not very far off, what the quarterly model would suggest We've allowed for a bit of shift out of NOW accounts or demand deposits   I'd have to find that nonexistent sheet I'd have to go through the same exercise M2 has moved up steadily over the course of September, so that would be starting on the high side of the average And similarly for M3 Roughly, the early October level that we're estimating is [unintelligible]   We put M2 and M3 a little high, again just allowing for the brief effect of this deregulation But our models suggest growth in nontransactions balances in the 9 to 10 percent area--not really exceptional on a monthly average basis   Well, as I was trying to say, in October we've allowed a little We started allowing nothing and then after seeing some of the newspapers where there has been some advertising, in New York and other places like that, we've allowed some   Well, we pushed down Ml a bit in [October], not much more than roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point on our estimate in either case It's a very small effect, but some effect   Mr Chairman, a further technical clarification on M2 That nonexistent kind of weekly M2 has not been rising as fast in the most recent weeks relative to a normative weekly growth as Ml So, if after the week of the 28th it grew at a rate which if sustained over time would give you 10 percent for a year, it would give you an October of around 9 percent So, it's not biased as much toward an upward thrust in October    I can spare them an answer I don't think these people have been involved in the rates You might want to wait for another 20 minutes or so   I was a little [reluctant] because there is a large group of people here who don't attend the regular meetings   I don't think it was distributed generally   [Statement--see Appendix]   It's right after that part of the sentence   That's what we are projecting but with regard to 2-month projections for Ml, as the Committee knows, the results can be highly variable   Well, we assume that the market conditions associated with this level of borrowing--I'm not sure I'm answering your question--would result in roughly a 7-1/2 percent growth in Ml Now, the market conditions can be a little variable with this level of borrowing, depending on other things, and the demand for money can be a little variable But that is our best estimate at this time   No, it's a careful study of various models with judgment applied!   And I might add, Mr Chairman, just in the context of what was said before about business activity being strong, that it's not clear to me from the recent performance that that necessarily means stronger Ml It could be that people are just writing checks on their NOW accounts, which is sort of stored up savings, and we could get lower Ml with strengthening business activity   They are edging up, but essentially--   It really isn't worth making a federal case, but with respect to the alleged pickup in activity in September and October, if that occurred, the component of M1 that showed the strength was currency, where growth picked up to 10 percent It's probably a coincidence, but right in that same period the NOW account growth virtually stopped   I'll get the figure here in a minute That grew very little In September and October it picked up to around a 2 percent annual rate of growth, which is slow, and it declined slightly in August   That's right   Well, we've had for three months this sort of unwinding of the build-up in demand deposits, which we were somewhat at a loss to explain We really expected that to start coming down earlier in the summer We've had that in August, September, and October And now we're anticipating that that will stop and will start going back up    I'll say a few words and Mr Sternlight might also We really have very little to add, Mr Chairman, to our eight- page note The memorandum takes the opportunity to explain how, under present procedures, one would construct paths under contemporaneous reserve accounting and review the paths in the course of the two-week reserve period The memorandum then goes on to suggest possible additional procedures or alternatives the Committee may wish to consider, which introduce [various] degrees of automaticity to take advantage, so to speak, of the contemporaneous reserve requirements These, in effect, would let misses in deposits, strong or weak relative to the path, be reflected In the case of strong deposits we would have somewhat higher borrowings, and in the case of weak deposits somewhat lower borrowings within the reserve period--to some degree automatically, depending on the limits the Committee may wish to set, if indeed it wants to go in that direction We suggested a couple of rather arbitrary procedures, that the Committee may want to consider, in a somewhat limited effort to get at this under current conditions, where there's some uncertainty about the meaning and the use the Committee may wish to make of Ml, the variable to which contemporaneous requirements are tied I don't know if Mr Sternlight would like to add a word or two   We have two problems to look at We have a longer reserve period by one week; we have a two-week period Right now within the reserve period we have some variability, particularly on the last day of the week or before the weekend on special holidays or something like that What we can't tell is--and we've surveyed a number of banks--[how banks may change] their reserve management procedures under contemporaneous reserve accounting The answer generally is that they don't plan to change anything they have been doing, and they were doing different things They're going to estimate their required reserves; I think they're going to be off to a degree And then they're going to continue doing what they have been doing Those who tried to play the funds rate within a one-week period are going to continue that and try to play it within a two-week period And those who wanted to stay in balance day-by-day are going to try to stay in balance day-by-day With a two-week period there is a greater opportunity to run bigger deficiencies or surpluses in the course of the period That means there's more they have to make up later So, it seems to me there is some possibility of a lot more variability in the funds rate within a period if banks happen to allow big deficiencies to pile up and then wait until the 14th day, so to speak, and have to make up twice as much as they previously did That's one factor On the average, in a two-week reserve period, our research suggested we missed on our required reserves estimate by $100 million or so, after some revision in the course of the period And that would have almost an unnoticeable effect, I would suspect, on the average funds rate variability Of course, if the Committee were to permit a more deliberate miss, that might add a little to it and there could be some more effect I'm not able to quantify it to any great degree, but I would suspect we would have somewhat more variability within the period and from period to period   Well, I was thinking of a miss in general when I gave that $100 million figure--$100 to $200 million is what I think I have in here as the [average] miss I don't have it refined at the moment between what might be so-called multiplier misses on government deposits and interbank deposits and what might be just Ml itself   I think probably with some detailed looking we might be able to break it [down]  Partee  Yes   The reserve maintenance period begins Thursday, the 4th and for deposits it's Tuesday, the 2nd of February   In sum, the problem we had in analyzing M2 is that if you are thinking of an automaticity in response, there is none on M2 except to the degree that its Ml component moves The only required reserves that move contemporaneously, after adjusting for    12/19-20/83 -5-  multipliers, are those on Ml So, anything the Committee wants to do with M2--that is if M2 were weak and the Committee wanted to move borrowing or whatever--could be done quite independently of contemporaneous reserve accounting You wouldn't need contemporaneous reserve accounting to do that We were trying to think of things that were in some sense uniquely related to contemporaneous reserve accounting And with a lag we could observe M2 and make whatever adjustments in response to changes in M2 the Committee wished to see made But the question that arises with contemporaneous reserves is automaticity--letting it happen if we aim at a nonborrowed or total reserve figure What happens is pretty much purely Ml, if we make the proper multiplier adjustments in a contemporaneous way M2, to the extent it is affected, is only [affected] by Ml   Sure you can There's no question about it My only point was that that wasn't uniquely related to the contemporaneous reserve accounting That could be done either way   That's right And we did have in there at one point a paragraph that I took out about the various things to do if the Committee wanted to put some weight on M2 But that didn't strike me as uniquely related to the contemporaneous reserve accounting We always have done that   Well, if we had every multiplier adjustment right, that would probably be the case We don't normally get the mix even in money supply type deposits--those at small banks and those at large banks--exactly right So, that tends to throw us off   Yes, that's right; they might average through But on the technical side, the study we did a couple of years ago-- before we had contemporaneous reserves, but even after we tried to allow for it--seemed to suggest, surprisingly, that nonborrowed reserves were probably better in controlling Ml on a month-by-month basis than total reserves so long as we didn't have exactly the same reserve requirement on all types of demand deposits We have reduced those variabilities We only have three classes now zero, a small one, and a large one Still, I would suggest that you would be surprised that total reserves would [not] do quite as well as you think it would    12/19-20/83   We were pained, Mr Corrigan, to leave options for the Committee and not make a recommendation that would sound as if we were certain about how we're going to approach it   Mr Chairman, there is one thing--   Yes, but I thought in the context of this discussion that there is one thing that perhaps is not clear enough [about] the automaticity in response to Ml For example, if M1 were weak by an amount that said borrowing would drop, say, $50 million in that week, we did not necessarily concede that the next week we would start off at a lower level of borrowing That would be a matter of decision for the Committee So, for example, if M1 were weak and M2 were on track or strong, with any automaticity in there, borrowing    12/19-20/83  might be $50 million [lower one] week but the next week we could start off with borrowing where it was earlier   That's right! And the next week if Ml were strong, borrowing would be up $50 million and it could fluctuate; we wouldn't make judgmental adjustments of borrowing unless the whole bunch of the aggregates seemed weak or strong relative to the Committee's anticipation or whatever rule the Committee might want to use   Well, suppose we started off a week at $650 million, as we have been doing, and we got all the multipliers correct and all that and by the time we were through the two-week period, Ml in fact was weak to the extent that borrowing dropped $50 million and ended up at $600 million Then the question comes up What level of borrowing do we start the next week with? I'm saying, unless the Committee says otherwise, we would start at $650 million again and then if Ml is strong that makes up for that and we would be up to $700 million of borrowing   Well, that's [an issue] we are raising The Committee can decide whether it wants to cumulate, which would be to go up to $650 million [in this example] or stay at the $600 million as the way to take account of M2 and M3 and everything else   If we took the full 100 percent; at 25 percent we'd be better off   We have our estimates You're right that there is always going to be the noise from the errors in the estimate  -10-    12/19-20/83   Well, Governor Teeters, our best guess has always been, that we get 20 to 25 basis points per 100 It seems a little less   A hundred million dollars of borrowing We thought [a change of] something like $400 to $500 million in borrowing would result in a one percentage point [change in interest rates]  -11-    12/19-20/83  Now, we've gone through $400 to $500 million of borrowing with virtually no movement in the funds rate in the process of which we've declared that there were shifts in the demand for borrowing, shifts in the demand for excess reserves And making those judgments has tended in some sense to moderate these movements, or the banks have just not cared We haven't gotten those kinds of movements So, I would not really want to swear on a stack of Bibles that a $500 million borrowing change will give you 1 percentage point But I would say that with a $50 million change in borrowing within a week one is not going to discern the effects relative to the noise It has to accumulate to begin to move the funds rate in some sort of trend way   I meant the variation [at the end of a statement period] Mr Sternlight aims at a nonborrowed reserve path constructed from some borrowing assumption and some knowledge of the demand for excess reserves The noise that I meant was what happens to it on the last day of the statement week when the factors affecting reserves other than his actions vary by $2 billion, say, or when required reserves relative to expectations change by a lot   Yes, and changes that we hadn't allowed for; we were estimating but we missed And that will either add to that $2 billion or subtract from it; they could be offsetting To the degree that it adds, there is going to be a result in the relation in free reserves or nonborrowed--they are the same--that is different from what we were aiming at That's a kind of noise in the system, I would say The additional noise is how banks decide to manage their reserves over a two-week period If they suddenly get it into their heads that the funds rate is going down when it isn't, they are going to get themselves into a deep hole and at the end of the statement week they are going to have to borrow a lot Over a 14-day period they might have to borrow, instead of $3 billion on the [last] day, $6 or $7 billion That will put a lot more pressure on the funds rate than they have been used to So, over a two-week period there is a little more capacity for noise, depending on how banks manage their reserves and what [rate] expectations they have for one reason or another   I didn't mean that as "noise" I meant what seems to me to be the product of the controls of--  -12-    12/19-20/83   Probably   We publish them weekly Yes, [they look different] In terms of absolute variations, though, be aware that the average absolute variation of the experimental, both monthly and weekly, is just about equal to the average absolute variation of the regular series   That's right   Very different [timing]   And the weekly changes in the experimental series are sometimes larger than in the regular series   Well, my memory is that if you look at the two series on a quarterly basis, the pattern doesn't look very different There are small differences, but not big ones There is somewhat slower growth, I think, in the experimental [series] I'm not sure of this in the second half, quarter-over-quarter But month-to-month, if you look at the second half, the growth rate in the experimental series drops somewhere around July--I may be off by a month--and then with the exception of one negative month where it's -05 percent, it fluctuates between 3 and 7 percent So, it tends to look as if it has dropped down to a new 5 percent or so growth rate   Whereas the other series looks like it was going along strongly and suddenly it dropped to 2 or 3 percent for four months It gives a slightly different look to Ml Up to that point I had been getting prepared to recommend to the Board that we drop the experimental series, mainly because it wasn't showing any less volatility I had the feeling, therefore, that it was just proving that weekly and monthly seasonals are difficult to get at and that Ml is an inherently volatile series That's how I would interpret Ml But now it looks as if the experimental series has made a comeback It seems to me that it still has some value and I would tend to recommend that it be continued, but certainly only experimentally It hasn't demonstrated--and we haven't found--a way to make the weekly seasonal variation less   As a technical point, Mr Chairman, a two-week reserve period has the advantage of averaging through a little, in some sense; it has the disadvantage of delaying [us] ever so slightly   I don't have much, Mr Chairman I could very briefly point out what we were trying to do there As you mentioned, in the first instance we were trying to discuss the tentative ranges in terms of their consistency with regard to inflation objectives Obviously, the 1984 tentative ranges are consistent with further progress in reducing inflation assuming, as is clear there, that the Committee is looking toward lower rates of inflation than the 5 percent that is currently projected for 1984 And that, of course, would have particular relevance for anything the Committee might want to say, qualitatively or not, for 1985  On some more technical points with regard to the ranges For 1984, the Ml range of 4 to 8 percent is a reduction, of course, from the range for the second half of 1983 and we think it implies, given the 9 percent nominal GNP, a velocity increase on the order of 2 percent without any interest rate rise--somewhat lower than the trend for the postwar period years, which is around 3 percent or so but it has occurred in a period of rising short-term rates Now, the velocity of Ml, as everyone knows, is going to be very uncertain and probably will be very different if there are significant interest rate movements up or down from the levels projected But given this projection of very little interest rate change, we think an Ml increase around the middle--or more likely in the upper part--of the 4 to 8 percent would be the likely outcome, consistent with the projected nominal GNP  I ought to point out two other things As noted in the Bluebook, the [tentative 1984] M3 range was decreased to 6 to 9 percent The problem may be that it would squeeze M3 down pretty much if a considerable part of the credit flows continue to go through financial institutions We had two reasons for thinking it would be possible to get M3 growth at 9 percent or below One had to do with the continuing efforts by banks to raise funds abroad through Eurodollars and not domestically through CDs, which would tend to hold down M3 growth, particularly if foreigners put their money in dollars abroad With regard to M2, I would also point out that a 1/2 point reduction in the range from 7 to 10 percent to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent might not be considered an effective reduction since the 7 to 10 percent range included 1/2 to 1 percentage point of further shifts  -33-    12/19-20/83  related to the money market deposit accounts And so far as we could judge, the amount of shifting in that 7 to 10 percent probably was on the order of 1/2 to 1 percent, but those estimates are always very difficult to make Thus, a reduction of 1/2 point to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent is not, in a sense, an effective reduction Counterbalancing that, of course, is what we observe to be a normal reduction in velocity growth of M2 in the second year of a recovery, which would for any given nominal GNP require somewhat higher M2 than might otherwise occur I think those are all the preliminary comments I would have   Yes I have not made that calculation; I was planning to make it for the Committee at the February meeting when we knew the actual outcome   Yes If the center of the 5 to 9 percent range were where you wanted to start from, I'm not sure what the rate of growth would be We can calculate it while we're waiting here, but it would be a higher rate of growth than from where you are now   I don't have the rates of growth at hand; I have the velocities at hand They are almost impossible to analyze, of course, because of ceiling rates and all that In the second year of expansion velocities of M2 were negative That is, there were drops in velocity on the order of 3 percent after the first quarter of '61 in the second year of that expansion, 1 percent in the early '70s, and about 3-1/4 percent after the '75 trough And 1980 is irrelevant, of course Before the '60s, in the '50s, there were increases in velocity of about 1 percent And those were all decelerations so to speak from the first year; some of the decelerations turned into negative velocity We have assumed also a deceleration in velocity of M2 So, it's not inconsistent with this kind of cyclical experience But we have the velocity continuing to be positive, which I think is probably also reasonable given the changed institutional circumstances It also happens to be generally consistent with what  -35-    12/19-20/83  we can make out of our models; both the Ml and M2 changes are generally consistent with our new Ml demand equation and the estimates that come out of our model for time and savings deposits   Mr Chairman, my briefing will focus on M1--not because I want to overstress it, but because Ml is the aggregate recently showing the most variable behavior relative to norms, so to speak That's what is perhaps most in need of analysis, particularly since in the recent past its variations over a period of months have often provided good signals to follow [Statement--see Appendix]   Yes, for December [in] the regular series we have 23 percent, a drop from 67 percent in November That compares with our projection of 81 percent So, there is a big difference in seasonals in November and December   Yes, it's about a 5-1/2 or 6 point difference There's a very big seasonal The seasonals, month-to-month, are very different, as you can see in the series    Well, I'm not sure my presentation deals directly with it, since I go even in the opposite direction to President Morris' question But it will certainly come up, either as a question now or as a question after my presentation   Mr Chairman, at the end of my prepared remarks, I would like to make a few unprepared comments that relate to the issue President Morris raised I interpreted him as saying that he thinks M2 ought to be higher for this GNP and, if anything, my prepared comments go somewhat in the opposite direction, although not necessarily for this GNP but for interpreting M2 [Statement--see Appendix]  I would add, Mr Chairman, partly in response to President Morris' question, that there may be a certain amount of uncertainty  -19-    1/30-31/84  with regard to the velocity of M2 In the second year of the expansion following the cyclical troughs of 1961, 1970, and 1975 the M2 velocity declined, which would argue that for a 9 percent GNP growth M2 ought to grow more like 10 or 11 percent We have an M2 expansion less than the GNP growth [for 1984], though not as much less as shift adjusted M2 grew in 1983 I think that ought to be interpreted against the actual behavior of interest rates and ceiling rates in the earlier recoveries of 1961, 1970, and 1975 In the second year of the expansion after the 1961 trough the ceiling rate was raised from 3 to 3-1/2 percent So, despite some little rise in [market] interest rates continuing on into the second year, the spread remained favorable to deposits in M2, and money continued to shift into those deposits In 1970, in the second year of expansion the ceiling rate remained around 4-1/2 percent but interest rates tended to edge off in the early part of that second year and not rise very much thereafter and the spread again remained favorable and in fact became more favorable in the first two quarters of the second year So, again, I think it was the structural reason affecting that Following the 1975 trough, the second year was a period when interest rates began declining and by the end of that second year during which the system continued an expansive policy, market rates fell below Regulation Q ceiling rates, which again jazzed up M2 and led to a drop in velocity So, now, with M2 having very little of ceiling rates in it and a policy of edging down money growth to restrain price increases, we believe that the M2 we have forecast is reasonably consistent with those objectives, with a slight caveat--that to exert additional restraint in a somewhat mechanical sense it ought to be 8-1/2 percent or even a point lower   Yes I can't find that piece of paper offhand but there is an assumption of large capital inflows, on the order of $30 billion, at the banks in '84 That's more than in--   Well, that's the assumption--that what comes through the branches so to speak that isn't in CDs issued here would [not] get into M3 It comes in as a liability to a branch If a foreigner invests directly here into a CD, it will get into M3 But if it's invested in a Eurodollar abroad and then it comes in as a liability to a branch, it won't get into M3   You raise interest rates   Well, our work suggests that there is some interest elasticity to M2 demand although less than M1 now Secondly, of course, it comes out of income At some point income has to adjust   I don't mean to sound editorial but in many of those periods when we had this negative velocity you are mentioning-- such as in '72 and '76 and '70--the M2 growth you had to get was 12 and 13 percent and that was followed by substantial price pressure Now, whether those upward price pressures came from the M2 with a lag or came from the associated M1 with a lag, we could discuss; but I think that's the problem you get into It isn't so much what you do this year but what the lagged effects of what you do this year happen to be   We haven't rerun the experimental model yet, so I'm not sure what that will show It is being checked   Yes, except with a caveat that I don't know what the experimental model will show when that is rerun We simply haven't had the time   Yes, the benchmark itself does some raising--   Yes   Debt was up 10-1/2 percent last year   They both increased exactly the same   It has been between 2-1/2--   When that happens, we believe after some time that it would reduce the interest elasticity of M1 with respect to market rates   It's lost in here, Mr Chairman The language the Committee had adopted before didn't have the word in It said "In implementing policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the broader aggregates"   Well, Mr Chairman, I really have very little to add to the discussion in the Bluebook Alternative B essentially continues the path that was adopted at the last meeting of the Committee, which had 8 percent growth in M2 and M3 from November to March and 6 percent growth in M1 [We have projected a very strong] M1 increase in January, which is still subject to doubt because we  -51-    1/30-31/84  don't have the figures for the last week of January yet and we are assuming that that is a very high figure If that is a high figure, then we would expect M1 growth in January to be quite strong and to help sustain growth over the four months at the rate suggested there-- around 6-3/4 percent So, we would have suggested that a somewhat higher growth than 6 percent would be consistent with the 8 percent [growth in M2 and M3] However, I think there's enough doubt about that to suggest that there is no particularly strong technical need to change the Committee's specifications from the 6 percent that is now in there for alternative C   [Yes] But I don't think there's any strong technical need to change that 6 percent even though [6-3/4 percent] is our best estimate, based on an uncertain January The other two alternatives, Mr Chairman, are simply alternative A, which is for more rapid growth in the aggregates; and alternative C, which is for less rapid growth in the aggregates We believe that alternative B, continuing on the same path, would be about consistent with the same constellation of restraint on reserve conditions But, of course, there is some uncertainty given the introduction of CRR and what that might mean specifically In particular, there is the possibility that in a transition period we might place excess reserves even higher than we've had in recent months recognizing, though, that there is a 3 percent carryover in two weeks So it's not clear that excess reserves would stay higher for very long periods Our exploration with banks as to how they are situated would suggest that possibility, at least in the transition period   Well, they in particular were the ones that said they thought their excess reserves would be higher The big banks mostly said they would be a little conservative to begin with, but believe they will be close to where they were fairly shortly after CRR is initiated So, over a sustained period it might be mainly the smaller banks The borrowing relationships--   Our information is that the Reserve Banks are in varying states of preparedness, but we expect everyone to be on the starting line tomorrow or the day after   That may very well be, President Corrigan The reports that we get from the banks indicate that they are as ready as  -52-    1/30-31/84  they're ever going to be And, of course, they have a strong incentive to be able to monitor their deposit flows There may be problems as there always are in a switch-over in the reporting systems I would assume that there will be and that we will miss maybe the first Thursday publication or the second and have to delay them a bit And I would not doubt, Mr Chairman, that in the first two weeks the money supply figures will be subject to much more revision than normal But our information is that the banks are reasonably well prepared and the Reserve Banks are reasonably well prepared I have no doubt, however, that there will be some glitches in the first two or three weeks   Mr Chairman, the only other technical point I wish to make is that we assumed that alternative B was consistent with continuing a borrowing level of $650 million There are uncertainties about excess reserves There probably also are some uncertainties about borrowings because we can't really be sure exactly how banks are going to decide to manage their positions If they make mistakes, they may be forced into more borrowing than they are otherwise thinking about; or they may have an excess of caution and so much in excess reserves that they're not going to have much borrowing; or the level of excess reserves will show more variation because of the switch-over But I think a degree of uncertainty can be attached to both excess reserves and borrowing in thinking about reserve positions   That is true   We will do so in the first two weeks But then there's a 3 percent carryover and after that I'm not sure how we will end up But certainly in the first two weeks we'll put in more excess reserves than normal, not merely because of this but because there is a reserve requirement reduction of $2 billion in the phase-down for member institutions That in itself ought to add $100 million or so to excess reserves   Yes, but that's built into the transition   We have not seen much of an increase in vault cash related to that in the aggregate numbers We've looked at it, and it doesn't seem that the banks are behaving very differently   For M1--I have to make a few [calculations]-- it's 73 percent   There are two comments I could make, Governor Gramley One, it was just simpler in presenting the alternatives not to have to present a lot of numbers--the November-to-March numbers and the equivalent December-to-March numbers That is one minor factor The other is that the November base happens to be pretty close to the fourth-quarter average So at 6 percent, M1 is at the midpoint of the 4 to 8 percent range But that's happenstance to this period   Yes, they are all based on the revised series   Yes, close to $4 billion   Our projector is often right!   Yes, Governor Gramley is reading from page 4 of the draft directive, which is the same as page 18 of the Bluebook   Well, the language you're talking about--that particular sentence--is exactly the same   If we were ordinarily putting in about $400 million, at least $600 to $700 million   It may run higher and then borrowing may run a bit higher We just don't know what the pattern of borrowing is going to be over the course of the two weeks If they borrow an enormous amount early--   Recently, that's what we've had   I don't contemplate that going on for 13 days   Well, it's twice as much, in effect, on the last day That's right   In the first two weeks if you're in deficiency or surplus, you can carry over 3 percent into the next two weeks   Oh You mean from now   No   Yes I'm not quite sure how we worded that transition, now that you mention it   If they have a carryover, it would be the 2 percent of the [unintelligible] Last week they carried over 2 percent   I think they would carry it over into the two- week period I don't think it would be carried over into the first week I would think the proper interpretation is that they carry it over to a two-week period    You use "persons" on Class II   It would have been impossible before the money supply started coming out on Thursday night It's more possible now to do it Thursday night, but I would say it runs the somewhat needless risk of errors But it's certainly possible now, whereas it wasn't possible before   Normand knows better than I do, but my impression is that distribution of the Bluebook is a continuing, miserable problem And I think Cannonball Express is probably only the latest in the efforts to find a reliable delivery service   We were very close, Mr Chairman, to having it ready this Thursday night With a little more experience and if we don't have last minute data that would involve [revisions], it may prove possible But I would--   Well, we'd never make the Thursday night pouch We could make the Friday night pouch if that would get it delivered any better But I doubt that it would   Yes, I know As I said, I don't think that will help one bit But if we tried for Thursday, we'd be through  -13-    3/26-27/84  about midnight As it is we could get it out in the course of the day on Friday earlier than we used to get it out   Well, that's what we do now We have an express service special that goes out whenever it's ready on Friday   We could try that, Mr Chairman   We have gone through that, Mr Chairman, with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in getting comments from Mr Sternlight The transmission has been terrible   I don't know The new one may work It's the old one that doesn't work so well   Mr Chairman, do you want to decide whether there should be a length of time between indicating to the market that we're not going to be in and actually not being in?   After five years  SPEAKER(?) Except for the parts discussing foreign banks   [Statement--see Appendix]   It assumes a funds rate--well, it says 10-1/2 percent, but I'd say on the order of 10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent We had a 10-1/4 percent funds rate for a few days We don't have that today and we didn't have it yesterday, so I think that really assumes a further rise in interest rates Today funds are--   I would say from the average of the last two weeks   That was a small estimate of the distorting effect on the seasonal We might have gotten some of the seasonal but it could be more; I really don't know But that was an estimate of how much we thought the seasonal might be off in some reasonable way   Well, a quarter to a half [percentage point], but I would take all of that--   Yes We don't think it is very large, but that's just another way of saying we don't think we made a big error in the seasonal   We have IRA accounts at banks; unfortunately, we don't have them outside banks No, we don't have very good data and that's a big problem   Don may have [numbers on that]   Our problem was not only the IRA and Keogh accounts but we had to make an estimate of how much the MMDA shifts early last year in January should be allowed for in calculating the seasonals so as not to distort the seasonals That, as much as the IRA/Keogh accounts, was a problem to us in estimating the seasonals We tried to make some sense of how far we could be off if we made different assumptions and we came up with this rather minimal number But that doesn't say that the IRA/Keogh accounts didn't have big effects in and of themselves   Yes, that's right   As a matter of fact, the excess reserves seem to be running high in this two-week period in the latter part of March as well But we think the excess reserve build-up has been accompanied by a high funds rate, so it isn't as if people are taking excess reserves and have gotten rid of them aggressively into market instruments or things like that I don't think that the build-up of excess reserves is pushing loans out or pushing money out I think it is really rather transitory   Yes Our estimates indicate a relatively low [or slightly negative growth] and assume excess reserves a little lower than I think is going to be the case at the end of this month For March we would have a drop in total reserves but I think it is best to assume that reserves are about unchanged following the 19 percent increase And the monetary base is falling to only a small increase of 2 to 3 percent   Well, we have a drop there also, and it may even have dropped a little more than [our estimate] We have a drop of around 7 percent, but I think a lot of that is the distortions of the excess and required reserves in March It looks as if they are increasing about the same as they increased in February--at about an 8 percent annual rate So this variation is largely the variation in excess reserves and some variation in borrowing It's a sort of sustained expansion in the reserves that is providing the base for the deposit expansion   On M1 do you mean?   Well, it's about 8 percent over the 3 months as against [a projection of about] 7 percent   Mr Chairman, maybe I answered Governor Teeters wrong We are within the long-run cone The weekly figures we're going to publish will be below the weekly figure consistent with the [target] If the number that we're not publishing--the one we have a tentative estimate for at the end of March--holds up, it will be above the long-run cone But month-to-month, on average it's just below   No, it's all right on the month; the end of the month is ticking up, if that number holds up It's just another way of saying that it's very near the top   We think a billion and a half will get a funds rate close to 11 percent, with all the uncertainty   Without a change in the discount rate In the Bluebook, we said borrowings of $1 billion or a little more get a funds rate of 10-1/2 percent If you look at the experience in the last couple of days, with the funds rate dropping off fairly substantially, that will change market attitudes a little and I would be inclined to say--Peter may disagree--that it might take a little over $1 billion to get 10-1/2 percent And if you used $1 billion in borrowings, I would feel safe in thinking of a wider range in the funds rate--10-1/8 to 10-1/2 percent or something like that   Yes, that's what we said 11 percent or over   In this two-week period I think the market created them on its own, not knowing they were doing it in effect That is, they borrowed We were somewhat behind the NBR path much of the time Now we're actually slightly over it and the market borrowed and generated excess reserves in addition to the nonborrowed reserves; and now if they end up with excess reserves they don't want, those reserves have to come out Before, the level of excess reserves of around $600 to $650 million was probably fairly close to what they wanted, given the prevailing market conditions   I think it was a little higher than that   That's the idea, but we haven't seen much effect   No It seem to have more to do, Governor Teeters, with the fact that country banks now don't have with us the required reserves that they need to hold They leave their reserve balances in there for a while for whatever reason Some even hold excess clearing balances, which get into our excess All that is a little irrational, but we can account for $50 to $100 million dollars of those sorts of things   I should be clear, Mr Chairman, when we said a billion dollars or more borrowing gets you a 10-1/2 percent funds rate that we were, of course, assuming excess reserves on the order of $550 to $600 million That was the assumption within that We were assuming net borrowed reserves of $400 to $500 million   Yes Actually, I'm assuming it could even be lower   As a technical point, I should mention that quarter-end and mid-April we could get some fairly high rates relative to even this average That's just in passing   It is less than we've had in quite a while That's a shade below the October-to-December average   Given the gap we now have [between the two rates], I would think it might have less effect than maybe Peter is inclined to believe, but we will find out if the change occurs   I think it got to 10-1/2 percent on the expectation of a 9 percent discount rate So it may be that you will have 10-1/4 percent and it will move a little   Mr Chairman, the funds rate in this two-week period so far is averaging just over 10 percent That's how it's going to come out tomorrow--say, 10-1/8 percent or somewhere around there We only had a 10-1/2 percent rate in passing for a couple of days I think if borrowing of $1 billion with normal excess reserves gets you a funds rate of 10-1/2 percent, that will be viewed as a significant tightening because it's sustained   Mr Chairman, the rule says that the directive should only go to the President, so the other people who would have been here won't know the specifications Unless they see the directive, they will not know the specifications  SPEAKER(?) Unless the President tells them  -105-    3/26-27/84 -106-   What I assume you're saying is to act--    I happen to have, Governor Wallich, a rough measure of the yield curve 18 months into an expansion from the trough I'm not exactly sure but I think it's from the trough of the recession, not the trough of the yields The spread was about 1-1/8 percentage points and is now 32 points, so the yield curve has gotten [steeper] Looked at on a ratio basis, which is relevant because a ratio takes account of the higher level of rates, it's not so marked It goes from 122 to 132 Now, that's not very different from what occurred after the 1970 recession going out 18 months In terms of the absolute spreads it's much different; but in terms of the ratio it's hardly different from the preceding troughs in the '70s It is different from the experiences earlier; before the '70s the yield curve did flatten more noticeably after 18 months But it was not so much the case in the 1970 recession, except that in absolute terms this is quite different   [Statement--see Appendix]   There's another point to add I don't think we know what is going to happen in the banking system in the next several weeks, in the wake of this Continental business It may be quiet and it may not If it isn't quiet, I think there is some possibility that banks will become more conservative in the management of their own    5/21-22/84  reserve positions, conserving access to the window and maybe holding a few more excess reserves We could find holding [excess] at $600 million and [borrowing at] $1 billion gets us even higher funds rates because the banks' general attitudes have shifted, in which case I think some allowance ought to be in there for that   --that would handle that situation   Mr Chairman, just for clarification, I assume that still somehow implicit in all of this is a sense that there is some leeway for carrying out operations under "existing" if something disorderly occurred or if financial strains developed That's what was bothering us when we put this in   So, I think we need some sense here that--   The existing directive has had in it since February at least "The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets" All that modifies policy implementation   Forever It's only--   That's in the existing directive, in the long- run part of it   Yes, it's proposed to follow the last sentence on the discount rate We used the word "recently" to get away from the discount rate    Well, we have only a small rise in interest rates in the forecast   It would be a lot higher if you don't want the dollar to go down   We think we have a mutually consistent set of relationships It entails somewhat higher interest rates, the sharp drop in the dollar, and the projected rate of inflation We would argue, I guess, that if you think the dollar isn't going to go down, you need a lot higher interest rates I don't know quite how to answer the question otherwise If you believe that people don't want to hold dollars to the extent that we implicitly are saying, you're forced to argue that you have to pay them a lot more to do it   But these are high real interest rates still-- very high relative to the rest of the world   [Statement--see Appendix]   I don't remember Maybe Norm has the history in front of him to see if it was I don't remember that   It was never 4 to 9 percent   Well, in the earlier part of this year, the staff generally had been working with something around the midpoint for M1 because that was what was indicated at the February meeting As M1 began being much stronger, we interpreted "around the midpoint" as being 6-1/2 percent instead of being specifically 6 percent But we would assume that it's somewhere around that midpoint at the moment unless the Committee were to say that it was expecting growth to be around 8 percent, in which case we'd change our assumption   Yes, in terms of the midpoint But whether it's going to have the same effect on the markets and the policy or actual operations followed by the Committee is yet another question At 4 to 7 percent, if M1 is running at 6-1/2 to 7 percent, I can't say in advance whether the Committee is going to feel that more work is needed to restrain it than if the range were 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent That is the issue, it seems to me   In the projection we have very modest interest rate increases  -33-    7/16-17/84   It's a little higher than that recently, but it's very erratic   Well, we keep saying it's zero, but I would take that with a grain of salt   If my memory's right, historically, the growth of M3 runs a little higher than that of M2 so its velocity growth would run a little lower, and that has been our very recent experience It might be worth giving our point estimates for 1985, Mr Chairman On an assumption of M1 growth on the order of 5-1/2 to  -36-    7/16-17/84  6 percent, we would have M2 growth around 7 to 7-1/2 percent, M3 growth on the order of 8 percent, and debt [growth] declining to around 10 percent for 1985   On 8 percent nominal GNP growth   We've assumed 5-3/4 percent as a point estimate; 5-1/2 to 6 percent seems to me the area--   I averaged it out for the past 22 years The average is close to zero But there is hardly a number in any year near zero   I was talking to President Balles I didn't hear you   Mr Chairman, I can be very brief Alternative B is the alternative that assumes the continuation of a billion dollars of borrowing We believe the general constellation of money market and other conditions that go with that reserve increase would be consistent with rather moderate M1 growth from June to September-- on the order of around 5-1/2 percent That growth rate would bring the growth in M1 from Q4 to September down to 7 percent and we believe that would be on a reasonable track, hopefully, if the Committee so wished, to end the year close to around 6-1/2 percent growth We would expect, and of course it's only an expectation, that that particular constellation would involve about the current level of interest rates and that this level of interest rates has some restraint in it that would carry forward into the fourth quarter Alternative A suggests dropping the level of borrowing initially, by about $250 million or so from the $1 billion, and borrowing under Alternative C is commensurately higher If attitudes with respect to the federal funds market and bank markets in general stay as they are,  -54-    7/16-17/84  we would expect Alternative B to involve a funds rate around 11 percent or a little higher; Alternative A would have funds moving down closer to 10-1/2 percent and Alternative C moving up closer to 12 percent As Mr Meek suggested, these attitudes could change If they did ease off and banks were viewed more favorably, or if the money supply came in on what the market interprets as the reasonable side so that expectations of a monetary policy tightening edged off, or if the GNP data were weak, then the funds rate [pressures] could also probably subside some In any event, Alternative B does have a funds rate range of 8 to 12 percent and Alternative A has a range of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent The present range is 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent We've suggested that somewhat higher range in connection with the billion dollars of borrowing, simply to reflect the shifts in attitudes that have occurred in the past two or three weeks   Yes, and we'd need an increase in the second half of July   You gave the M3 growth That was 102 percent; M2 was quite a lot lower than that   Yes, the figure you gave was for [M3]   Yes    We had reports that one or two banks--for sure one New York bank--were told by their executives to stay out of the window   Unless things have changed, by law at the moment a loan to a Home Loan Bank--unless it's secured by something interpreted as government securities--would require a 5-man vote of the Board and a declaration that it is because of unusual and exigent    8/21/84  circumstances It's technically possible by law but it would need at the moment to be within those confines   Governor Wallich, do you think interest rates will rise in that scenario?   [Statement--see Appendix]   One of my problems in answering your question, President Morris, is that I really would not ever have thought of running policy on total credit But I would--   I would tend more, if I were looking in that direction, to be looking through it to the economy   If we do get a 6 to 7 percent growth in August and September, the monetary aggregates--according to our always shaky equations--will be running about as we expected based on the quarterly model; on our monthly model, not quite The quarterly model would have predicted for given interest rates and GNP enough money demand to create this much money growth without much different interest rates So, that wouldn't be far off What is far off, as you're suggesting, is the credit growth I had in my head two reasons that I haven't quite been able to demonstrate statistically One is that with the government being such a large element in borrowing--when the government is spending more than it's taking in--it has no real option to reduce assets It really has to borrow So, I think its borrowing propensity is [virtually] one for any amount of deficit spending Whereas if other sectors are spending in excess of what they're taking in, they have the option of cutting down on assets, which doesn't get reflected in our credit figures So, I have a feeling that the large persistent role of the government is raising credit relative to GNP Also, and I think Governor Gramley mentioned this at a discussion earlier here, we're in a period where we have much more freedom for credit to flow at any price relative to earlier periods; there is more deregulation And that may then be permitting a greater flow of credit at the high [rates], and the higher interest rates are exerting the pressure more than the restricted availability Those are the only two factors I have, particularly   Well, right One other is the stock market I'm not forgetting stock market   We've had a difficult time isolating these various circumstances, but we could go back and look at it But those are the elements I could think of so far   Well, that would be one way to do it Clearly, another way would be not necessarily to change it but, as we observe what is happening in the course of operations, to adjust in the way we might adjust if we observed more excess reserves and a change in borrowing attitudes We would be more willing to oversupply nonborrowed reserves to accommodate it We would end up with a little less borrowing than was plugged into the path There would be two ways of going at it and getting the same result one prejudging and one not prejudging   Well, pretty close I think it might be more like 8 percent with the compounding, but it's right in that area   Our experience has been, Governor Partee, that when that has happened it has tended to put upward pressure on the funds rate--[recently], in any event   Well, we run concurrent seasonals just to see how we're tracking once the revision is in I don't have the figures in front of me but my memory is that the current seasonal through July would change that rate of growth from minus 1/2 percent to plus 2 percent and would change some of the others There's a little evening out So, it's still relatively low but it was--   It doesn't change the trend    President Black, we have done some empirical work, and it doesn't seem to show much difference between the two And I think as Peter mentioned, in the jargon it is essentially an "intercept" problem You would have a lower level of borrowing on average for whatever funds rate you would be thinking of As far as the volatility in the relationship, day-to-day, between borrowing and the funds rate, I don't think it makes one iota of difference   [Statement--see Appendix]  [Coffee break]  -22-    10/2/84   It will be below 2-1/2 percent and could be as low as 2 percent The numbers are variable   September could be as much as 1-1/2 points lower than we had, so that takes off 1/2 point for the quarter   Please remember this is Tuesday and borrowing on Wednesday--   "Growth substantially more rapid"   Add "inflationary pressures" I wrote "indications of significant strengthening in economic activity and inflationary pressures"   Did you want to put "financial and exchange market conditions"?    If it wasn't in the wire, it should have been It must have been an oversight   It was right after that first week of the two- week period We ended up at $700 million right about that time for the average borrowing level and it seemed sensible to make it $700 million, given all that had happened It should have been in the memorandum of the call If it wasn't, it was certainly an oversight   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, President Boehne, say the Committee wanted to achieve something like the alternative B path or, say, 7 percent growth in total reserves in November [While] it's technically not impossible to conduct operations in an effort to achieve that if the Committee wanted it, it is impossible to tell you with any certainty, other than the way we do it in the Bluebook, what is likely to happen to the level of member bank borrowing If the demand for those reserves doesn't happen to be there, we would have to keep throwing nonborrowed reserves out there until we force the demand on them--force the banks to create the required reserves And that could take a very substantial drop in interest rates if the demand doesn't happen to be there Our best guess, as is in the Bluebook implicitly, is that it would not take a substantial drop in interest rates, though I would [modulate] that a bit if the latest money supply figures I have seen hold up after a day or so   No, I think you have to look at the relationship between interest rates and velocity Obviously, there would be more money out there, if we put in more reserves and there would be less money, vice versa The way I would look at it would be to try to explain velocity That is what I was trying to do Does the fourth-quarter rise in velocity indicate that people didn't really want the money and that they are quite happy? Or does it indicate that people simply didn't get the money they really wanted and we had a temporary --in effect, arithmetic--rise in velocity and we're going to see that reflected later in income as they have to adjust to the fact that they don't have as much money as they want? I don't think just looking at the reserve-to-money relationship can tell you much about that   Yes   MMDAs were rising in the first four months of the year at a slightly faster rate than they were rising in October And then they stopped rising as market rates went up and banks didn't follow them all the way up Then, with this recent very sharp drop in short rates, banks have lagged in the extent to which their MMDA rates have dropped And, according to the figures we have for MMDAs, after declining for several months they started rising At the same time we are observing in the figures--although we have problems with seasonal adjustments because we don't have them seasonally adjusted--a drop in NOW accounts and in the very recent figures also a drop in Super NOW accounts  -20-    11/7/84   The level? The level of NOW accounts is $140 billion approximately   I think I have that number They're about $45 billion   That's included; so there is $100 and some odd billion--   Well, [we were] reaching for hypotheses to explain this back in the second half of 1982 when interest rates dropped sharply and there was a sharp rise in NOW accounts At that time there were no MMDAs MMDAs have a lower reserve requirement than NOW accounts by a lot   Well, I was thinking of these as monies that are in the market now that shift back into bank deposits as rates go down And what bank deposits do they shift back into?   And instead of going back into NOWs, as we experienced in 1982--   Well, there are other things going on at the same time, obviously But I was thinking mainly of shifts from the market and not using NOW accounts   Well, that I really can't give an answer to The banks' MMDA figures were running negative between 5 and 6 percent and then minus 1 percent in September Then they rose to an 88 percent rate of growth in October    11/7/84   But why banks have chosen to lag their rates at this point is hard to answer   What I have readily in mind is that for the second half of last year the rate of growth of M1 was raised 1-3/4 percentage points at an annual rate, of which 1 percentage point was seasonal and 7 was benchmark figures This year, we've run through it assuming that money grew 7 percent in November and December and that changes the configuration somewhat in that the slowdown occurs more gradually over the course of the year But you still would get, of course, a much slower growth in the latter months of the year than in the first several months of the year But it will raise July, August, and September and make October less negative, say, by 4 percentage points depending on November-December There's no doubt about that; it goes in that direction   I assume it would I assume a lower growth rate would tilt a little more of the growth into the second half But I didn't run it for that   The only thing I would add to that, Governor Gramley, is that apart from the fact that the model [unintelligible] relationships, one could also argue that interest rates are higher  -22-    11/7/84  than they otherwise would have been, obviously, if you had really forced in the money now That's pretty much what I had in mind   Well, that's what I was trying to deal with Reserves did drop somewhere around 15 to 18 percent   Or drop a lot more to get the money in   The other hypothesis that I tried to [test] was that if the demand was weakening in any event and if you supplied more money, interest rates would go down even more   Even before these figures, we had been forecasting a fairly big increase in the second week of the month But that is an unusual time for that to occur   That's what we had before the very latest figures I feel confident it will be lower now   Yes, the level is roughly $3-1/2 [billion] lower than we were assuming  -27-    11/7/84   50 seasonals!   Well, my thought would be that some of it would drop Seasonal borrowing is running well ahead of where it runs with even much more total borrowing We don't know for sure how much of it is going to stay because it is seasonal or distress borrowing and how much really represents the response to the rate I think it will end up a little higher than one would normally think in any event  -35-    11/7/84   That [borrowing] will drop   Well, alternative II is only focused on the two months for M1   "A" had 8-1/2 percent   Yes, it's about 8-1/2 percent   Well, our numbers are 3-1/2 percent for September to December and 8-1/2 percent for October to December   No, I am sorry That's with the old October [unintelligible]  -43-    11/7/84   Oh heavens, I don't remember   I can't imagine that they will   I don't know I can check   Yes   That is, we are projecting to be within that; we are not actually--   Well, the October figures are quite different 6 percent for M2 and 10 percent or so for M3   Yes, that's right   You could say "continue to be consistent"   That's better   From September   We think that borrowing of $400 million will keep the funds rate slightly above the discount rate And it might go below that; I don't think it will A lot depends on how we manage operations and the signals given In general, that's probably right   Well, I ought to add a caveat, Governor Partee With this two-week reserve period what President Solomon mentioned is perfectly right If we have to push reserves in aggressively to get the borrowings down or if some big bank comes in early and creates a lot of excess reserves and the funds rate tends to go down, anticipations of a discount rate decrease will come into play and the actual funds rate may actually fall below the present discount rate Now, I can't imagine that the borrowing will be particularly high in those circumstances, but there is some give there   Yes, not for any sustained period But it has been for a few days; it was on Monday and Tuesday   The reserve period starts tomorrow   It may be a big factor this year Normally it's not a big factor because the variations in the other borrowing and the errors in their relationship swamp it But we're getting so close to it now that it may very well be a factor and we would certainly want to look carefully   Well, it's a factor technically in the intercept, not necessarily in the slope of the relationship   Maybe Normand has been writing   The staff sees no difference, but--   Looking back, the Committee has accepted pretty much staying there when the expectation was within a percentage point    We'll know better tomorrow when we get some confirmation or not of the data for the last week At the moment we expect a fairly great rebound, though maybe not an entire rebound And yet, having looked it over very carefully, I think there was a seasonal problem having to do with days ending with threes compared with four or five and the timing of the Social Security payment, which I'm not sure was properly allowed for So, I would expect a rebound in the week of the 18th and I'll be surprised if it isn't pretty big   As I mentioned in the paper, a question that is somewhat but not necessarily related to the Committee's decisions is the importance the Committee may or may not wish to place on M1 which obviously is the aggregate most closely related to reserves But the first issue is much more an operating issue; the other two are partly operating issues but partly [address] the policy thrust The operating issue was mentioned by President Morris at the last meeting when he raised the question of the behavior of the funds rate and borrowing when the funds rate got higher [than expected] The Committee, of course, voted with knowledge that the rate tended to get higher than at the least the staff was projecting at the beginning of each period--except for the last [unintelligible] Later on there seemed to be some drop in the funds rate as borrowing stayed the same In trying to explain that [behavior] we raised the possibility that shifts in the demand for borrowing could have occurred in the wake of the Continental problem and the problems with Latin American debt negotiations I'd like to point out two aspects of this borrowing targeting that do create problems One occurs when the money supply is weak, not because of these kinds of shifts in the supply function but because of what is going on in economic activity and transactions demands I do believe that we did get a higher funds rate in the summer for any level of borrowing because banks became more protective of their positions in order to conserve their access to the discount window; they didn't really want to be seen at the window or to have rumors floating around the market that they were in there In the paper I made an effort to estimate the extent of this effect We ran through our money market model holding the funds rate at the May level, which was around 1030 percent, through September The borrowing level was about $1 billion In doing that, we found that we could account for 2 percentage points [less] M1 growth at an annual    12/17-18/84  rate We also got 2 percentage points less growth at an annual rate over that period because of the gradual rise in the funds rate from 1030 to 1175 percent, given the level of borrowing I would say that was a supply constraint, given what was going on in the banking system and the way we were targeting but, as I say, a constraint that the Committee accepted Subsequently, I think another factor was at work That, of course, was that these higher rates worked through and affected the economy, weakening the transactions demand for money But it might have been weakening in any event So, I can't isolate whether it was from that or from other factors that were working--the [unintelligible] working or the inventory cycle, for example And that also tended to weaken money growth for any given level of borrowing  Now, the Committee does allow for all this in its operating procedures because as money supply weakens or strengthens there's room for judgmental adjustments in borrowing But there is not [a provision] for any automatic adjustment in the [current] period The actual judgmental adjustments in borrowing that have occurred are pretty much on track with what almost 100 percent automaticity would have given in the last month But they are nowhere near on track with what 100 percent automaticity would have given, for example, prior to the last month So, if there were any automaticity--as in the period from '79 to '82--borrowing would have been lower well before last month In light of this, and partly because looking at the data in various ways it seems that M1 is nowhere near as bad a variable as it was in the period from '82 to the first half of '83, I do make a suggestion It actually is somewhat like the suggestion Mr Sternlight and I made earlier this year, which was not greeted with open arms by the Committee That suggestion is to permit a certain degree of automaticity in the level of borrowing, should M1 weaken The suggestion that I made [in the paper] is really rather moderate--a very small-scale automaticity--because I'm assuming that the Committee would prefer to continue essentially a judgmental approach But within that general approach, it strikes me as possible to let borrowing fall by a very small amount if M1 is weak The suggestion there is [to limit an automatic change in borrowing to perhaps] 25 to 50 percent of the deviation in M1 from what is acceptable That would give you a [typical] deviation, I think, on the order of $35 to $70 or $100 million Some weeks it would be down; some weeks it would be up I'm suggesting that we permit that kind of variation and then lever on top of that the judgmental adjustment, should there be a persistent trend weakness in M1 or persistent weakness in the economy or persistent movement of the exchange rate away from what is considered desirable in light of the Committee's overall objectives  In addition, I think another lesson to be drawn from the experience of the summer and fall is in the area of judgmental adjustments Traditionally, of course, for judgmental adjustments we look at interest rates, the economy, overall credit conditions, and other similar things What has happened very recently, of course, is that the dollar has remained high on exchange markets longer than most people expected With the international sector now becoming such an important element in changes in GNP, it seems to me that under present circumstances among the judgmental factors that might be given a little more weight than perhaps the Committee is used to thinking of would be the value of the dollar Another I mentioned is, of course, indications of price pressures; one could add almost any indicator to    12/17-18/84  help in assessing inflationary expectations and the degree of restraint that we might be getting from any given set of credit conditions Those were comments that had to do mainly with the implementation of operating procedures, Mr Chairman  But, of course, the degree to which the Committee either judgmentally, or even to a degree automatically, would want to respond to M1 depends in part on the reliability of M1 as an indicator of the behavior of the future variables about which the Committee is really concerned--which are obviously economic growth and the price level Dick Porter and others on the staff did some work over the last few weeks in that respect and we're still in the process of evaluating it But in substance, it seems to indicate that [the reliability of] M1, just looking at its velocity and its predictability to GNP, more or less disappeared over the 1982-1983 period; it was not a variable that one could put any confidence in Now, when evaluated in relation to other variables such as M2 and M3, it is probably no less reliable in some sort of absolute sense than it was in the period before '82 to '83 From what we can discern statistically, it might be giving roughly the same average amount of information, but the degree of confidence we might want to have in that average amount of information ought to be a little less That is, the range of variation around what it's conveying is a little wider And I think that is not an unusual finding, given the kinds of institutional changes that have occurred since we entered this new era of deregulation with different kinds of deposits such as Super NOWs and MMDAs People are still getting used to them and we're not sure how they're going to behave under various circumstances So, I would judge from this that if you thought M1 was reliable in the '79-'82 period, with a caveat in a sense that one should be a little more uncertain now, you could think it is fairly reliable now But I would emphasize that you ought to be more uncertain; that's what the data seem to be suggesting  Finally, Mr Chairman, I discussed an issue that has come up in many years--target basing I focused on the base for M1 because the market and everyone else seems to focus on it as the principal or key variable for the Committee The question becomes whether to base on where M1 actually ended up the year or whether to base on the midpoint of your target or some such other point of your target It happens that at the beginning of February at least, the Humphrey- Hawkins Report did suggest that the Committee thought that with velocity behaving somewhat normally M1 might come in around the middle of its target It was mentioned in the report that if velocity were weak M1 could come in higher; it was silent on the question of velocity being strong In the event, velocity growth in the year was about 4 percent, which is a shade higher than the average for the second year of expansion in the postwar period--but not enough higher, I suspect, to make a lot of difference in how you look at it analytically I don't think I need to detail the analysis that is laid out in the paper, Mr Chairman I tended to conclude that presentational considerations in some sense argue against rebasing M1 It is a bit difficult to get clear the difference between an actual growth and a hypothetical growth based on your target But even more importantly, I think it may be difficult to explain, if the Committee wished to rebase this year, why this year and not earlier years In the past we have often considered a result within a percentage point of the midpoint as success, by which I mean well within the range of variation of ordinary M1 movement It is probably well within the    12/17-18/84  range of really unrandom shocks of velocity that probably should be compensated by M1 movements Further, of course, it has to be noted that the Committee can indicate--and has done so in the past--that it may wish growth to be in the upper, the middle, or the lower portion of the range that it does adopt, depending on what it views as [a desirable] path in coming years So, that option is open In essence, this paper tends to be somewhat negative on the question of shifting the base, largely on practical grounds [relating to the difficulty] of explanation On the economic issue of whether there has in fact been a demand shift that accounts for 1 percentage point lower growth, I tried to remain somewhat agnostic There is evidence that says there is You can look at our quarterly model But I think "within 1 percentage point" doesn't seem like a very good practical argument to be making if growth were 2, 3, or 4 percentage points off If there are [major] institutional developments we can point to, then I think the argument has practical weight But I don't think it's a very good practical argument when you're only 1 percentage point off your midpoint It seems a bit like [unintelligible]   No, I don't think the Committee is ever locked in, but I think you would have to explain why you rebased this year and not in earlier years when there may have been even bigger misses And then, of course, you would have to explain why not rebase the next year I don't think it locks you in to doing that each time at all   In that sense, yes I thought Governor Martin was asking the practical question of whether we could be forced in some sense to make the same decision   In July, Mr Chairman, the Committee and your report were silent on M1; it was in February when there was a [passing] mention that [growth around] the midpoint [would be appropriate], depending upon velocity   They're sloped on the midpoint--5-1/2 percent   The relevant meetings were July and August   The degree of automaticity we're suggesting is so minimal that I suspect it would hardly be seen in the market at all except that to a minor degree it might temper the timing, at the margin, of Mr Sternlight's operations Therefore, it is really more of the second kind of indicator--that your judgment ought to be in this direction and here's a small step in a way that might even be reversed in the next two weeks if the aggregates pop back up At least I have in mind more of the second kind of approach, in spirit It wasn't that you would stop it, but it's so small that it isn't going to have any very significant effect until it really accumulates substantially   There's a small step in that direction but one that I do not think will be noticeable in the market, given the variations we've had in the borrowing/funds rate relationship   Well, it gets you started and it tones up your thinking, I think The word that comes to mind is "excuse," but I don't mean it in a bad sense It gives you a reason to be thinking in that direction--to start something so that you don't say it's just a feeling in my gut that's moving me It's a reason, in some sense   That's all I had in mind   Well, I was assuming a 7 percent reserve requirement on transactions accounts   I used as an example that a $2 billion change in M1 produces--   --$140 million on required reserves Half of that is $70 million and 25 percent of it is $35 million   What I had in mind was [Suppose] you had a nonborrowed path based on $1 billion [of borrowings] and in this two- week period it began to appear that M1 was running $2 billion below [path]; M2 and M3 were not behaving so differently to override it-- that, of course, would be in there And the Manager wouldn't reduce nonborrowed by the full amount [implied by] the shortfall in M1   I don't know if it's of interest, Mr Chairman, but I did work out--I couldn't do it dynamically--what the hypothetical borrowing at 100 percent in "automatic" adjustment would have been between Committee meetings starting over each Committee meeting and not assuming any adjustment in the figure And what this shows is that in June and the first half of July this hypothetical level of borrowing would have been about $100 and some odd million above the $1 billion that was used consistently in that period for the path The actual turned out to be a shade under $1 billion But in the last half of July and the first half of August, with a 100 percent adjustment the hypothetical level of borrowing would have been on average $350 million less   No, the billion--always carrying it at the billion I didn't know how to assume what was going on And then in [the second half of] August and September we began lowering the level of borrowing judgmentally, so the last half of August was $1 billion and then September 12th it was $900 million and September 26th, $850 million The [respective] hypothetical levels would have been $870, $680, and $760 million--so, running a little lower still And then in October when we had been running with $750 or $700 million, the hypothetical would have varied between $65 and $505 million And then in November--   Practically no borrowing, yes And then in November, they're very close   That's with 100 percent That's just the whole drop in required reserves against Ml   Yes  -22-    12/17-18/84   Well, I guess what would have happened is that the funds rate, instead of rising in the course of July and August, would have been back down closer to the 10, 10-1/2 percent area, but that's--   I assume the judgment would override   If you get more economic activity and prices with the same money supply, we'd have to say you'll get somewhat higher interest rates than you're thinking of   Well, Mr Chairman, the three alternatives that we presented to the Committee in the Bluebook all encompass some recovery of M1 growth from the reduced pace we've had, at least [based on] these present and concurrent seasonals for the second half of the year The middle one, alternative B, as the chart following page 7 in the Bluebook shows, would aim at getting M1 to a place that's relatively high in the tentative range adopted in July for 1985 Alternative A, which has an 8 percent growth for M1 suggested, would tend to move M1 above that cone But the parallel dotted lines are intended to show a range of variation around a 5-1/2 percent growth rate over the year 1985, and it would be well within those parallel lines  We view the specification of alternative B, which is about a 6-3/4 percent rate of growth in M1 from November to March, with an assumption for December on the order of 7 percent, as roughly attainable with current money market conditions And I might add that those current conditions when we were doing the Bluebook were a bit tighter than the present money market conditions That is, we viewed that M1 growth as attainable with borrowing of around $400 million and the funds rate around 8-3/4 percent In the last several days the funds rate has been below 8-1/2 percent; yesterday it was below 8 percent and this morning it is very close to 7 percent, just about 7- 1/16 percent So, in fact, alternative B calls for somewhat tighter money market conditions than those that have evolved in the last couple of days, given market attitudes and expectations We think the driving force behind the increase in M1 demand that would lead to this growth under the specified reserve and money market conditions is the fact that we expect growth in the economy to be a little more rapid in the first quarter than it has been in the third and fourth quarters And we are expecting, finally, to get some effects from the drop in interest rates that has occurred in recent months, which work with the usual lag At the same time, Mr Chairman, we expect growth in M2 and M3 to slow from the recent pace under the conditions of alternative B, largely because we expect a drop in interest rates on money market deposit accounts and money market funds as they finally catch up with this drop in market rates So, we would expect a substantial slowing in growth of those aggregates in the MMDAs and money market funds Alternative C is an effort to put the Committee at the middle of this 4 to 7 percent range It is our view, given the projections we have    12/17-18/84  of the economy, that this would require a somewhat higher fed funds rate and tighter reserve positions than alternative B  I ought to add, Mr Chairman, that I do have some additional monetary figures for the week that we haven't published, the week of December 10 I don't have any data for the following week now, but I will have some later We had expected an increase of almost $5 billion in M1 for that week and it now appears to be $36 billion, somewhat less of an increase So, it looks like December will be lower unless the figures for the 17th, which we'll have later, turn out to be stronger than our expectations It is a somewhat more moderate M1 picture for December as of this moment than we had at the time this document was written   Well, I'd really rather wait until a little later when I get [some data for] the 17th   The only other thing I should mention, Mr Chairman, is that we did suggest some bracketed language in the operating paragraph of the directive because the Committee had in the last directive wanted to take account of the shortfall in M1 growth in October and in the fourth quarter relative to the 6 percent it had decided on early in the quarter We have suggested language that would continue [to convey] some of that concern If you adopted alternative B, for example, it would permit more rapid growth in M1-- above the 6-3/4 percent--from November to March should you want to continue to take account of the fact that M1 did come in quite a lot lower than the original [objective of] 6 percent Alternative A in some sense tends to allow for that more than alternative B and we wouldn't consider that language necessary if the specifications were as high as those of alternative A   Yes, but that meant both adjustment plus seasonal borrowing It may not have been clear, but that's what we had in mind   Yes   Mr Sternlight may have a different view, but I myself think that there's very little chance [of that] at this particular junction, looking over the next four or five or six weeks But I really ought to say that if you're thinking of $250 million of borrowing, the funds rate is going to rise from the 7 percent area; it's likely to be somewhere around 8-1/2 percent, given the present discount rate It's not the money market specs we worked out for alternative A In our own minds [that entailed] an even lower level of borrowing and somewhat higher excess reserves to drive the funds rate further down I thought I would add that minor point for clarity   Well, the fundamental [issue], I think, is one's view of the basic strength of demand for goods and services and inflationary expectations Among the staff, views differ very widely on that If you view our judgmental projections and compare them with straight model projections, things will differ Our forecast implied, essentially, as Governor Gramley mentioned, velocity of about 1-1/2 percent for M1 next year That is something like trend, probably Taken literally, that would mean very little change in interest rates over the course of the year--maybe up a little or maybe down a little If your view of inflationary expectations and demand for goods and services is even weaker than the staff forecast, then I would think interest rates, in a sense, would be lower than that It seems to me very difficult to come to a judgment at this point on whether they are going to go up or down  -62-    12/17-18/84   It's hard for me ever to view it independently of how the economy goes I really can't answer it independently of that, Governor Wallich   Just as a technical comment, Mr Chairman, none of us is an expert on what the market is thinking, but it is not at all clear to me, under current market conditions--the way they were the last two days--that a drop in the discount rate of 1/4 point wouldn't be followed by some backup in market rates It would be viewed as a disappointment relative to market expectations I am not certain where this complex of interest rates and borrowing would end up, but I would think it is possible that it could be 8 percent or a shade higher, depending a bit on how operations are conducted, as well as the 8 percent or a shade lower that you suggested It's just not totally clear to me   Certainly--or possibly as [far as] they are going to go for a while   We might have been being excessively specific here but we were referring to the current quarter, the fourth quarter, in all this We really were referring there to the substantial slowing that we're now projecting for the fourth quarter, taking account of the upward revision in the third quarter That was revised up to a 16 percent rate of growth from the 8 percent we had earlier So, this is really [a substantial slowing in] the fourth quarter from the third quarter   Well, on the assumption that M1 in December was going to be 7 percent, we re-ran [the seasonal adjustment program] and the second half was raised by 1/2 percent at an annual rate and the first half was lowered by 1/2 percent at an annual rate I think I put in a footnote in that document for yesterday But I should mention that this is well before we have any benchmarks and you can't    12/17-18/84  tell what the variable month-by-month benchmarks are going to do to this So, I don't have any evidence at this point that it would be nearly as large as President Guffey mentioned But the weaker it gets in the second half, the more [the seasonal] goes up a little But that leads you down a very funny road   Mr Chairman, I should have added in response to President Guffey's question that of the 1/2 point increase 1 percentage point was in the fourth quarter So it's concentrated there But again, I don't know how it would work out   On Thursday, presuming our numbers are half-way near correct, the borrowing level we're going to publish will be more like $500 or $600 million for that one-week period that ends on that Wednesday   I was only technically concerned with the specifications between "A" and "B" and I was trying to find the M2 and M3 between "A" and "B"    Governor Wallich, if I may add a [different] and maybe minority view on that operation I would tend to deny its success I think it was rather a hit and run operation and that the failure of the dollar to go up--if that's a failure--subsequently, had a lot to do with the drop in interest rates in this country through the winter And I think the expectation that that [decline] was coming to a halt was instrumental in the dollar turning around When it turned around and got to that point it just went right through it; it kept going, as there was no intervention of significant size and determination forthcoming at that time   [Statement--see Appendix]   No, I thought they based it on the fourth- quarter average   Well, the growth for 1984 year-over-year was 69 percent; fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter it was 52 percent, rounded I could get you the level, but these things just tend to offset each other; as you go back over the years they tend to average out   The staff was tempted to suggest throwing away the debt variable as not being useful   President Morris mentioned one thing In some research we've done, the debt does seem to run a little better relative to total spending than it does to GNP So that gives you a percentage point Last year we thought the mergers and acquisitions added about a point I threw in a quarter of a point for the acceleration of state and local government borrowing   I think you can throw in another tenth or two for those HUD notes that came at the end of the year I didn't throw that in there I personally believe that the government deficit does get you greater credit growth relative to GNP, though it's a little hard to find it in the data Of course, we haven't had so many years with these big deficits You can base it partly on the grounds that the government does [not] really have the option to finance itself by (a) issuing equity or (b) drawing down assets Now, the private [sector] can't draw down assets forever, but they have that [option] as well So, we really have reduced the credit growth by roughly the same amount as we reduced nominal GNP When we worked through the whole flow of funds, we had a hard time getting any less credit growth than that, going through it sector-by-sector and taking all these things I've mentioned into account I think we have about 1/2 point or so in there for mergers and acquisitions That would be my response I don't know whether Mike or Jim has anything to add to that   117 percent  -33-    2/12-13/85   Roughly   I think the difference in our point estimates is trivial Our point estimate for M2 is around 8 percent and our point estimate for M3 is close to 8-3/4 percent I would say that the best way to think of it is that M3 looks a shade closer to the upper end than M2, but I would have some doubts that M2 will run quite that low--   That's right We have a slight drift up in interest rates, which was--   Yes I would say that's equally important to M2   We have changed the tentative ranges We have to check back; we can do that   We'll check back on it   As it turns out, Mr Chairman, it's more usual to change the tentative ranges than to adopt them Of the four relevant years--1981 through 1984--only in 1982 were the tentative ranges agreed on [in July] adopted [the following February] In 1981, 1983, and 1984 they were changed in varying ways In 1983 there was a substantial change in M1 that's when it was reduced to a monitoring range and was raised to 4 to 8 percent as compared to the 2-1/2 to 5- 1/2 percent tentative range In other [years] the changes were in M2 or other broad aggregates   As far as I can tell, I think that's right   Well, Mr Chairman, I will be referring, of course, to the table on page 10 [of the Bluebook] Most of these alternatives, depending on what you perceive the Committee is willing to do for the rest of the year, would be consistent in the long run with the range of alternatives that the Committee is now discussing In a sense, I suppose alternative B would be viewed as most consistent since that alternative assumes, if we're right about our estimates of M1 relationships to reserve conditions, very little change in underlying short-term interest rates and reserve conditions, typified by a level of borrowing in the neighborhood of $300 million over the next several weeks We expect that that would be doable with an 8 percent growth in M1 I might add, although I don't know if the chicken's entrails are [of interest] to the Committee, that our monthly model would suggest somewhat higher growth of M1 over the balance of this period--perhaps a couple of points higher On the other hand, the quarterly model, left to its own devices, would suggest that growth over the quarter would be a lot less than we're estimating here The growth implied here would give you a negative velocity--on the order of [minus] 1-1/4 percent--assuming GNP is about as we have projected now for the first quarter That would be, in a sense, a partial offset to the positive velocity on the order of 3 percent in the fourth quarter and would be, on average, obviously close to 1 percent We expect also a substantial slowdown in M2 and M3 growth in February and March largely for the reason given earlier that the drop in offering rates on MMDAs and money market funds is catching up with the drop in market rates Indeed, market rates have risen about 25 basis points recently so they are accelerating that catch-up So, we would expect M2 and M3 growth to slow substantially All this is assuming funds are trading around 8-1/4 percent and not the average of about 8-1/2 percent of the last two weeks But those relationships, as the Committee knows, are rather loose and depend very much on how the market perceives money supply and business conditions and how that might feed back and be affecting Fed policy over the very short run Mr Chairman, that very briefly sums up the essential points contained in [the Bluebook]  -48-    2/12-13/85   What we present, of course, always assumes a normal seasonal in a sense   Yes, we have that   Not really We get hung up with maintaining differences among the alternatives consistent with what our model tells us   Well, it slows to 9 percent and then to 7-3/4 percent to get 10-1/2 percent   January was 14-1/2 percent   Oh yes   If the cone is 4 to 7 percent, it comes out as a projection that by March the level is something like $3-1/2 billion above it   About 6 percent   About 6 percent or [just] below that   Yes, it's more than with parallel lines   Mr Chairman, I think Governor Wallich is saying that if you reach the top of the parallel line you have to grow 5-1/2 percent, no more than that; if you reach the top of the higher line you have to grow 4-1/4 percent or something These are rough numbers   Yes, we did   Our point estimate of M2, which may be a little low, would only be a half point above the midpoint of that 6 to 9 percent It could well be 8-1/4 percent or higher   Yes As I say, it's only a half point above the midpoint   Well, yes   8 percent at the moment That requires quite a slowdown in the subsequent quarters    [Statement--see Appendix]   It should probably be mentioned, Mr Chairman, in that context that the amount of borrowing related to these thrifts has risen Counting yesterday, when it rose another $4 million, the amount outstanding is $405 million   That's right   Another way to look at it, President Keehn, is that implied free reserves, so to speak, with $600 million in excess and $350 million in borrowing, are $250 million In the first two- week period those free reserves ended up at $230 million but with $800 million of excess and $570 million of borrowing In the second two- week period--the one that just ended, not the one we're in but the previous one--free reserves ended up at $110 million with $641 million of borrowing and $751 million of excess When that period ended we thought the excess was $932 million It has been revised down So in that sense, we've been right around the path but borrowings came in high early and tended to stay up there [because of] occasional days of large borrowing   It's very hard to control the distribution of reserves--other than nonborrowed--between borrowing and excess It's very hard to control the distribution of free reserves The market will tend to do that Now, one can observe it as it comes; but if the market has the slightest idea that funds might track up for one reason or another [unintelligible] the borrowing will tend to come in early in a two-week period And if it's high enough early enough, it's hard ever to get it down to target and that will manifest itself eventually in the excess reserves Some of it we will take out in hitting our nonborrowed target but we won't take out all of it So, to a great extent we're at the mercy of the market in that distribution And I would think that the funds rate recently probably has been a bit higher than either Peter or I would have expected early in the period   But it's not that much higher, I think, than if you had $350 million of borrowing and the same free reserves If you had $500 million of borrowing and the same free reserves, it may be a  -33-    3/26/85  little higher--perhaps an eighth of a point, I would guess--but it isn't very far off   That's something Mr Sternlight can gauge in the course of the two-week period All he can do is see what's happening to excess reserves and try to gauge a sense of the demands using whatever information we have, including how the funds rate is moving and what we think is governing the distribution of reserves   Well, Governor Seger, let me make just one more point on that As I think was explained in the Bluebook, when money was running high, the borrowing assumption was thought to be in the $350 to $400 million range, so there was the merest little tilt in that sense It probably got a little tighter--a shade marked up-- [but] that has been reversed   Well, in 1984 and 1982 the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate was much higher than it is now And in 1983 it was considerably less So, the tendency of seasonal borrowing is to rise, obviously, from February to March but the level around which it fluctuates is affected by that spread   It's hard to answer, but I would say that we would use whatever borrowing assumption the Committee arrives at to construct the path and we will make an excess reserves assumption Let's say it's a little higher than $600 million--suppose it were $650 million We will use that excess reserves assumption no matter what level of borrowing the Committee arrives at So, if the Committee arrives at a level of borrowing at $500 million and we're assuming excess reserves of $650 million, in my mind, that would be a tighter reserve position than we have had over the previous period, comparing say, $350 to $400 million and $650 million And that probably would lead to a funds rate somewhere above 8-1/2 percent, maybe 8-3/4 percent rather than one possibly below 8-1/2 percent or maybe 8-3/8 to 8-1/2 percent, which is my rough guess in relation to alternative B Mr Sternlight may have a somewhat different view   Borrowings thus far this week, the week that we're going to publish--the week, not the two weeks--in the most recent Fed statements is running very close to $400 million, for whatever [that's worth]   Well, Governor Gramley, that is where we are in terms of borrowing; it's not where we are now in terms of implied free reserves I'm not arguing for a free reserves target All I'm saying is that it is a shade tighter than we've been aiming to be, because on free reserves in the same way, it will be a shade tighter   Oh, yes   Of what?   That's right You have left in the phrase in brackets that's in the first sentence?    Mr Chairman, if we do send it, I think probably we should add those few words to our present memorandum [on rules regarding confidentiality] because at the time of that GAO investigation, it was crucial whether the procedures we were following were consistent with the written documentation   Then there's the question of sunsetting it   I guess we could   [Statement--see Appendix]  [Coffee break]   I think what you're observing is the interest sensitivity of M1 This is why the models have been predicting large growth in M1 This was somewhat of a phenomenon in earlier periods Part of the growth of the Super NOWs, of course, is related to the switching out of NOWs when the minimum went down from $2500 to $1000 at the beginning of this year But if you go back for six months, there has been a $10 or $11 billion increase in regular NOW accounts,  -22-    5/21/85  including Super NOWs, so that they have been--as they have been in the past--a large part of the increase in M1 That is the reason we have been contending that M1 cannot have the same degree of weight it had in 1979-1982 There are a lot of reasons for that, but one is that one cannot be certain how M1 velocity is going to behave under different circumstances I think President Morris rightly points out that the interest sensitivity has increased with the Super NOWs and NOWs in M1 and the sluggish behavior of their rates was indeed quite a phenomenon in 1982 and early 1983 But after a while we are not sure what is going to happen to that interest sensitivity If the institutions begin moving their rates with the market rates, then to a degree that interest sensitivity will diminish Our own uncertainty in that respect is one of the reasons that we are a little reluctant to advocate M1 strongly at this point We just haven't had experience in varying kinds of circumstances as we go through all of these transitions   Well, on other figures they don't behave differently--the velocity behavior and the growth rates behave very similarly Give me a second and I can round those figures up here   In the first quarter, growth in M1 was 10-1/2 percent and growth in the old M1A was 68 percent In the second quarter, growth in M1--this is with certain assumptions--would be around 67 percent and M1A would be 53 percent If you look back since 1981--omit the year 1981--in 1982, 1983, and 1984 growth in M1A was running anywhere from 1-1/2 to 5 percentage points below growth in M1 So the relationships that have emerged in the first and second quarters are not that different The velocity of M1A declined 03 of a percent in the first quarter when velocity of M1 declined about 04; in the second quarter the velocity of old M1A was about unchanged, or down a little now given our revisions, and it was down 02 percent on old M1 So they are behaving roughly the same But the greater growth in M1 relative to M1A is a function of the greater growth in the NOW account component But the structural relationship--   Fourth quarter of 1984? M1 grew 32 percent and M1A 14 percent; the velocity [growth rate] was around 3-3/4 percent for M1 and 5-1/2 percent for M1A M1A has had a steadily higher velocity [growth] for several years now The reason is that NOW accounts have low velocity [growth]   Mr Chairman, I did ask some people to run some--Mr Garbarini will excuse the words "simple-type"--simple-type St Louis model predictions from M1 That had been something we tested back in 1982-1983 to see if there indeed had been some sort of demand shift In that period M1 had been predicting a lot higher nominal GNP than actually developed We were in a discussion with monetarists [unintelligible] would be needing, and indeed the nominal GNP came in lower than the monetarist-type models would predict M1A in those days was not predicting so badly for 1983 Now, simple predictions on M1 underpredicted in the first half of 1984 and overpredicted in the second half Looking into 1985, they would predict in the first quarter a 9-1/2 percent nominal GNP, which is almost 3 points or so higher than we got; and they are predicting double-digit nominal GNP, of course, in the second and third quarters The old M1A is also predicting nominal GNP higher than our staff is predicting, although not as high as the M1 So, if the nominal GNP comes out about as our staff predicts, it looks as if we are going to see a pattern somewhat similar to what happened in 1983 in terms of these predictions   We will provide some   Well, that's what I was assuming   The Ohio thrifts are on extended credit and the bulk of those in the Richmond District are on extended credit at the moment Some additional ones may be put on   Not that dramatic If you put in all of the IRA increase seasonally unadjusted, that would add 4 percentage points to the growth rate And assuming that our seasonal on the nontransactions component--   Yes, at an annual rate, for one month If you assume that our seasonal on the nontransactions component caught at least half of that--which strikes me as a reasonable assumption--you'd add a couple of points, which would leave growth still very weak You'd need other explanations   Well, it may It looks like it would tend to rise a little in May naturally, although in 1984 the spread between the funds rate and the discount rate was about the same as in April-- maybe a tad higher It looks to me at least that if the spread between the funds rate and the discount rate is unchanged, that it probably would be running, say, $30 or $40 million or so or maybe a little more above what is "normal" for seasonal borrowing given this spread and this time of year So, implicitly, the $350 million was allowing for that And that probably would give you a funds rate of 7-3/4 percent shaded on the down side I would guess rather than shaded above I don't know if Mr Sternlight agrees or disagrees with that   Well, that's how we wrote the Bluebook I think what's unpredictable, essentially, is the relationship [of borrowing] to the funds rate There has been a lot of looseness in that relationship And I don't think any of us can guarantee any particular funds rate for any particular level of borrowing We can guarantee sort of an area, but not any particular level  -33-    5/21/85   I excluded it That's right; I took out all of the special situation borrowing   In the same sense that it was wrong to take out all the borrowing by Continental last summer Some fraction probably should have been left in there; I assume that some of it was not extended credit   Well, yes, with this particular week's situation   No, no It's going to be high with the--   It was high with all the thrifts in They are not all in extended credit yet So we're running high with them in   Well, I calculated that average--   For the period, but the week will be a little high   Maybe you could say "prevailed over recent weeks" or something   Another alternative, Mr Chairman, would be to use the three months for M2 and M3 and maybe lower the number a little from the 7 to 8 percent or lower it a lot and indicate the possibility that it might be more because of the shortfall in the--   That would do it That would be in the spirit of the last--   You could say "M2 and M3 may grow slower than the 7 to 8 percent rates expected earlier because of" to allow for that possibility   Yes, "in light of that--"  SPEAKER(?) "April performance"  SPEAKER(?) "In light of April"   "The sluggish April"   The bulk of it is now extended credit and perhaps more of it will be But I would say that Mr Sternlight has made a mental adjustment even for some of it that might not yet be classified as extended credit, at least recently   As a technical point, Mr Chairman--   Well, the first half-hour it was down 2 points, [so] it may be down [now] I might mention a technical point If, because of a wire failure, a large bank borrows $1-1/2 billion or something like that on a Friday--which often happens to us--the level of borrowing can easily be $600 to $700 million with money market conditions very little different from a borrowing level of $300 to $350 million So there has to be--I hope--some sense from the Committee that there can be wide swings here in borrowing   Yes There may be slight differences in judgment among the staff here I had $300 to $350 million; there are other people, and I think Mr Sternlight is one, who would say $350 million or maybe a shade above for that I don't know how one could possibly be certain on this   The stock market, Mr Chairman, is unchanged at 100 pm   7 to 8 percent   It was 7 percent for M2 and 8 percent for M3   No; it was 7 percent for M2 and 8 percent for M3 And more slowly--   "Anticipated for M2 and M3, respectively"    I'm afraid I may not shed any more light than was in the 40 or so pages of various documents dealing with this problem that were circulated to the Committee   It will be more condensed [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, as a minor point, I think you have to anticipate it in the third quarter, given what has happened It's not impossible to have it, but it would take a very sharp drop in demand deposits in July or August to produce a third quarter that isn't as high as the roughly 10 percent that we are projecting That assumes 5    7/9-10/85  or 5-1/2 percent growth, month by month So I think you have to anticipate an unusual looking third quarter in terms of velocity unless the GNP comes roaring back Over the long run, Governor Wallich, it is true that the paper implies that this could be a one- time drop in velocity It didn't say for certain, obviously And that was really on the assumption that the present level of nominal interest rates would not be reversed and that inflation wouldn't occur, which would bring them up--or in effect that the economy wasn't so strong that that would drive them up either way In that case, there would be no reason to reverse this velocity We would go back to trend and not to 5 or 6 or 7 percent velocity to offset that I don't think that the trend will occur if you did that until the fourth or first quarter or some time like that; it wouldn't occur right away  But there are two other points I would make, one on both sides One is that it is not absolutely clear that this present level of real and nominal rates will be sustained on the high side It could very well drop; it is hard to think of real rates of return as high as these present real market rates seem to be On the other side, however, we have done various charts using various lags relating money to GNP showing that they correspond reasonably well; and we have had times of large money growth followed by large GNP growth That did happen in the 1982-1983 period, but we were operating at such a low level of the economy that we had more in real GNP and very little in price Now we are operating at a much higher level of capacity, as you mentioned or implied If this were going to be followed by a burst, one would expect it to have a little real effect but a little more price effect So having looked at those charts, I felt somewhat ambivalent I would not in any way want to think that it was an absolute dead certainty that we had a one-time drop in velocity that was not going to be at least somewhat reversed I just don't feel that certain about it in my own mind   That right The models don't explain everything In fact, if you read the residuals, you could say to yourself that there's a 2 or 3 percentage point upward shift in demand for money But I wasn't stressing that I was stressing the impact of the interest rate decline itself in relation to the elasticity   That's what I was trying to say   Well, I am not sure it looked that dramatic I really haven't checked it out in the detail that you are suggesting We saw it to a minor degree in late 1983 the movement in velocity was somewhat higher because of the interest rate increase, and it was rather consistent with what our models were saying If you look over the whole postwar period, where I feel a little more secure than the models, we tend to believe that about a point or more of the trend velocity over that period of 3 points or so is explained by the rise in interest rates over that period They enter the model with those sorts of effects In any particular period we'd be off because of the model misses and the shifts But I can't really respond to the very particular period of the 1970s and early 1980s   I think there probably is   Yes, the model is symmetrical I was trying to think of history The basic issue is that if you go from 10 percent price inflation to zero and the interest rates go from 13 to 3 percent consistently, you would expect a big increase in the willingness to hold cash The question is how to satisfy those cash holders who now feel that the opportunity cost is such--3 points instead of [13]--that they might as well hold cash It seems to be happening lumpily as we phase down So, if we ever get to price stability--it may not happen but if we ever did--I would expect another instance or two of this kind as the nominal rates dropped down, unless in 1986 when we free up the ceiling rates on NOWs and super NOWs we get just parallel movements in those rates They won't ever be just exactly parallel rates because of reserve requirements But if you had actually parallel movements in the offering rates and the market rates, you might not get this phenomenon It's that possibility that makes us think the interest elasticity will become less as you go on, so that this phenomenon might not be so pronounced when you get into that period   Well, we were closer to the account innovation that affected M1 at that time but it had gone on for some time In  -20-    7/9-10/85  any event, now we are a little further away except for the drop from $2500 to $1000 in the minimum balance, which we don't think had a significant effect I think the economics of it are roughly the same; whether the public relations of it are the same is [another question] I am not sure that it is all that different, even though you probably can--   We had that February-March base for M2 and M3 and we said that we now had a build-up of nationwide NOW accounts and it was beginning to have this effect This wasn't the introductory period; it already had been built up and, being there, it was having this effect But, of course, the very latest strength in M1 is in currency and demand deposits   That is the point of this paper it wasn't the [current] innovation per se that might have increased the elasticity; it was the impact [of declining interest rates] on the elasticity that could do it   Yes, that is in large part a carry-over of the second quarter   I found it impossible to try to discern a big difference in public psychology I think the main risk is in doing either and not hitting it Just to remind the Committee In 1983, the [range] at the beginning of the year was 4 to 8 percent; growth in the first half was 119 percent; it was rebased to QII to QIV to a 5 to 9 percent growth rate and that was hit By the time we reseasonalized and everything, the growth in the second half was 84 percent and for the year was 104 percent Then, the next year, the range of 4 to 8 percent was hit So, the Committee wasn't repeating the experience after the mid-1970s where it was rebasing every quarter and the range was missed every quarter To me, the main problem wouldn't be whether to raise the range or rebase; the problem would be that it would be very desirable to hit it if you do [either], so that it does not set in motion--   Yes, but it was hit nonetheless   Well, we're in some sense talking about the long-run not the very short-run elasticity In the very short run, there are obviously lags Secondly, they have been adjusting the rate downward even though they don't adjust it upward and I don't know what point they are going to get Thirdly, they are adjusting it and that is different from the NOW account ceiling rate, which isn't adjusted, so you get a bigger impact on that, which compares to super NOWs   I do not know what would happen if market rates began rising from the current level I suspect that might be   11-1/2 percent from December to June   Well, our estimate--and it is subject to quite an instant revision because we are getting more data here very quickly--is on the order of 7 percent A range of 6 to 7-1/2 percent or something like that is a good way to think about it, given what I know about the very first week But I will know more shortly   Our point estimate for credit for the year is 121 percent The range is 9 to 12 percent   Whatever it turns out to be by the time the year is over; it may be less   What would the growth for the year be?   The second half would be close to 7 percent-- 6-3/4 to 7 percent   What we have here is Q2 to Q4, assuming a 5-1/2 percent growth from June to September--and we think that is consistent with July coming in around 7 percent and growth phasing down from there Then growth goes down from September to December to 3-1/2 percent, and that would only be if interest rates didn't go down any more and the effects of the drop since May had worn out Then the growth for the year, Q4 to Q4, would be 88 percent; and the growth for the second half, Q2 to Q4--on that kind of averaging basis--would be 69 percent That then assumes that the average growth, month by month, is roughly 4 percent over the balance of the year   Yes, something like 7 percent for July Now, if we had a very weak July like we did last year when we had almost zero [M1 growth] in July, and these demand deposits came running off-- we have no evidence that that's occurring yet, except a little in the very first week of July--then you could get a more favorable picture, in a sense You would get a much weaker third quarter than we are assuming, as the demand deposits unwind, which would make the fourth quarter look a bit better But we have no basis for that yet So our median assumption is the one I just gave you   I might add, Mr Chairman, that all the models that we look at would say that growth in the third quarter, month to month, will be more like 7 percent We have taken 1-1/2 points off that because of the thought that this bulge of demand deposits in May and June simply has to unwind So if that doesn't happen, there's more danger of greater growth   Well, a thousand dollars   Recognize that a lot depends on the pattern of the months Assuming essentially a straight line after whatever happens in July, for 8 percent for the year you would have month-to- month average growth of roughly 2-3/4 percent--not much   Growth from June to December, as I said, would be 2-3/4 percent; on a Q2 to Q4 basis it would be around 5-1/4 percent, again depending on how the months bounce around That, by the way, given the staff GNP projection and the way the quarterly averages work out, still would give you a negative velocity in the third quarter and then a very strong positive velocity in the fourth quarter   1983   No, I don't think so   I think you made a statement in September or October of 1982 to indicate that that was happening   That's right   That retains the ranges for this year for M1 and M2 and reduces the range for M3   That's right It reduces credit and I would think--   --you would reduce M1 if you move up the range or rebase   Well, the main rationale is that this tracks the nominal GNP The rationale is that there would be less debt expansion because the increase in spending is lower in '86 than in '85 because of the turn in the balance of payments But that may or may not happen And secondly, we expect that there will be less merger activity That's the rationale   Our point estimate for 1986 is 104 percent   Well, as I say, one of the questions raised is Does the Committee like the GNP? If they don't like the GNP--   That was our idea, Mr Chairman Alternative II in some sense gives a little looser fit, which would provide some room if the Committee wanted to express a view of wanting more nominal GNP than is in the staff projection Alternative III is tighter   Well, let us get the figures; I just want to check my memory   Mr Chairman, in response to President Balles' question, we really do change the ranges at the February meetings from what was adopted tentatively Only in one year, 1982, were all the  -56-    7/9-10/85  ranges tentatively adopted maintained In four other years--this is going back to 1981--there were substantial changes   Sometimes there were changes in M1 The most spectacular, of course, was in February 1983 when M1 was deemphasized to a monitoring range and that monitoring range was raised substantially from the one that had been adopted the previous July   Yes   Yes, that is right The upper limits would be roughly--   Well, 8 percent is roughly 9-1/2 percent and 5 percent is roughly 8 percent for the year   That gives you approximately 7 percent for the year   It makes it approximately 7 percent, 68 percent, for the year   The 3 percent lower limit   Yes Therefore, this involves no change--  -66-    7/9-10/85   That's right   It means after July it would be negative   "At an annual rate" [should be added] after the 3 to 8 percent   That would be followed I assume, Mr Chairman, by that paragraph that we didn't repeat on the top of page 20? "The Committee understood that policy implementation would require" and all that   It's on the top of page 20 That's the next paragraph in the structure of the directive   You can take it out with the new wording   I think the way this is reworded, you certainly can   In '81, we sort of ignored it    [Statement--see Appendix]   I think it is semantics as to whether you call it a shift or not I suspect at the moment that there is a change simply in the distribution of savings flows And it could have a relatively simple explanation If time deposits that are now maturing were put in a year ago--we don't have adequate data on when they were put in--they were earning 10 percent Now they are earning 7 or 7-1/2 percent; I have forgotten the exact rate And people may just simply out of psychological disappointment say "Well, I will just put my money in this account where I can get at it rapidly and maybe rates will be a little higher later I am used to earning a higher rate" There may not be any actual sense of real uncertainty or doubts about the economy in that context I tend to think something sort of simple like that may be occurring at this point And there is no way that the models pick up something like that--whether you call it a wrong elasticity or a demand shift The surveys of consumer confidence are not so weak as to make you think that people are making a big broad shift in their pattern of saving I don't know whether that kind of money behavior will in the future lead to the kind of strength of GNP that these models--this rather simple look at lagged money versus GNP --would lead you to think One would say "no"--that that kind of saving behavior doesn't necessarily entail strong growth    8/20/85   Well, I think it wouldn't so far If you were to ask me after it had gone on for four to six months, I would have to say that I think there is enough in monetarism to say that the risk is very strong that it would And I am not so sure that I wouldn't think that there is a little risk at this very moment   A drop from what we had assumed Well, we are going to get some data very soon and it is hard to say before that; but I guess the risk is probably that August might be a little lower and September higher That's how I would tend to guess it, but my instinct is that we could be there or a shade higher as of now I don't expect any great weakness This NOW account behavior seems to me a little difficult to explain The rate spreads are widening and are making time deposits a little more attractive and market rates a little more attractive, so I expect some shifting away from that soon It is hard to say exactly when that will occur, but that ought to occur Whether it will occur now or in September or October is hard to say   We did the survey after the demand deposits stopped   Old M1A, or old M1--currency and demand deposits--in July rose 33 percent, so it is much less And if our projections are right for August--we still have [data for] less than half the month--it would be rising 5-3/4 percent So it has dropped [from the rapid pace in the spring] The quarterly average, given that and a very reasonable September, would be about 8 percent It grew 68 percent in the first quarter and 8 percent in the second; and on a quarterly average basis it has [unintelligible]    8/20/85   Well, it was 68 percent in the first quarter and 8 percent in the second quarter--a couple of points below current M1 But it is much more below in July and August; it is decelerating more at this moment Old M1 was 13 percent in May and 18-1/2 percent in June   Well, I did for that paper that I sent to the Committee before the last meeting I did it in an excessively simplified way and it did not look very much different one way or the other That is the conclusion I drew from it In another approach, looking at it since 1982--not using the sort of model that I used, but in a simple way just looking at lagged M1 and lagged M1-A versus GNP-- the deviations between M1 and GNP and M1A and GNP favor M1 They are narrower in M1 than in M1A   No, there is a special issue   I think we did mention it the year before last as one of the factors causing credit to be strong along with the mergers and the drop in equity   No I was just doing what some people do in town here It was the short run, looking at M1 versus nominal GNP with various quarterly moving averages--3, 6, and 9 months It was not a very scientific study of looking ahead through models No, the price effect, we still think, would take longer; this was just to nominal GNP   If it were helpful, partly for purposes of understanding the process, I could offer a scenario coming off of this money supply that would lead to maybe not much increase in real GNP but more in nominal and prices Assume a little further decline in interest rates, which probably would be needed to start it, and suppose the natural rate of unemployment is more like 7 to 7-1/4 percent and that the productivity growth over time isn't going to be much more than 1/2 to 1 percent--taking some extreme assumptions--and that the Committee makes a strong effort to have real GNP grow 2-1/2 to 3 percent in that environment Assume further that foreign countries loosen up a bit--and interest rates have declined in a few It may very well be under those circumstances that the present good behavior of wages would begin to unravel as people would have to bid a little harder to get some decent labor Commodity prices around the world, instead of dropping, could begin rising a bit more and we could get some rise in inflationary expectations in that environment Because the restraint is being undone in other areas, we could at some point begin to get more upward pressures on prices and maybe a little real GNP, but not as much as many think is potential It would be reflected more in the price element than in nominal GNP somewhere in the fourth quarter or in the first or second quarter of next year; that wouldn't be terribly inconsistent with the strong money growth that we have had, assuming that continues for a couple of months ahead But all that is predicated on very weak productivity growth and attitudes in the labor market that would say the present rate of unemployment is something like the natural rate, plus an effort to push the economy beyond what its productivity would permit  -13-    8/20/85   I don't know that a slight--   Well, I would think that if short rates came down 1/2 point or so with some definiteness, in the short run the long rates could come down It would be helpful in the mortgage market and would probably be on the stimulative side Whether it would be sufficient to get more than 1/4 or 1/2 point on real GNP over time, I don't know, but it is certainly in that direction   That's the projection, but the projections have been consistently wrong   Governor Partee, we have to write down a number, so we wrote down $400 million But I think, in essence, it has been $350 to $450 million   We would put it in the policy record   It requires extreme delicacy this time since the level of borrowing unfortunately has been dropping as we have gotten slightly tighter   You had 7-1/2 percent last time, Mr Chairman And our present estimates are 8-1/2 percent for M2 and 6-1/2 percent for M3, so--   I should change my definition of success in projecting, Mr Chairman, because I always thought within a percentage point was success   Mr Chairman, I just want to point out that a difference between alternative II and alternative I was that the two sentences are reversed At the last meeting the lesser restraint sentence was first and the greater restraint sentence was second In alternative II, I reversed them; I don't know how that will be read by the market or how the Committee would feel about that Also the words "somewhat greater restraint would be sought" in the previous directive were "would be acceptable," but for better English language I changed that because I used "acceptable" in another sense later on   Where it now says "somewhat greater restraint would be sought in the event of" last time it said "would be acceptable in the event of"   You're leaving the other out?   I took it out because I had another "acceptable" in there   I'm hung up on--  -47-    8/20/85   Yes, that's right So you can put the "acceptable" back in That's what I'm pointing out  SPEAKER(?) Yes, the "acceptable" we can   That's right    [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, we think it's largely behind the strength of the NOW accounts over the past several months--that is, the strength above what "normally" occurs At the same time, of course,    10/1/85  we have had large increases in old M1A, the currency and demand deposits component It's conceivable that some of that money could be flowing into demand deposits, but I don't think much Or it could be flowing in for a very few days as people make up their minds what to do with it So I'd say it has been a strong element, but I can't put a percentage on it I'd say it's not 80 or 90 percent dominant, but maybe a little less than that From June to September, for example, old M1A moved [up] around 8 percent while the present M1 grew 137 percent It's not as if it's all in the NOW accounts; a substantial part is in currency and demand deposits   Oh, I doubt that it's very much in there I could conceive of some going into demand deposits for a while but not for very long   Yes I would say that it's only conceivable for a transitional period while one is making up one's mind what to do with it   That's why it could affect the average for a very short while   Well, it has It has its ups and downs   But starting in May, we had growth rates in three months that were 10 percent or more and in two months that were 6-1/2 percent It's on average a little faster, but I don't think it's extremely noticeable   The same period--   That's the exercise we engaged in, actually This was a three-quarter period of an acceleration--these are accelerations not levels of growth rates--in M1 that has occurred through the third quarter of this year; it's an acceleration of 9 percentage points, essentially, at an annual rate At the same time the nontransactions component of M2 has decelerated by 3 points And M2 itself measured over the same period [decelerated] by about two tenths; it certainly has not accelerated Now, when we looked back, the other period of exception in some sense was back in the first quarter of 1966 Then the nontransactions component dropped 1 percent and M2 went up 1 percent--small increases relative to M1, which had gone up 4-1/2 percent There were some other periods where there were similar drops in the nontransactions component and small increases in M2 In a couple of them money and nominal GNP went up together But by and large where M1 has been strong and nominal GNP has been correspondingly strong, M2 also has been relatively strong And the only thing I can make out of that is that we were getting shifts into M1 and out of the nontransactions component of M2, which doesn't affect M2 as a whole but does affect M1 And in that case, M2 might be given some weight because of the conflict of the two; and it was tending to say that nominal GNP isn't going to move quite as much The simplistic formula would be that if M1 is strong and M2 is strong, the odds are better that nominal GNP is going to go up than if there are conflicts between the two [aggregates] And I think that's--    10/1/85   Well, I have a whole list of variables here, like the rate of change in commodity prices, the dollar None of them worked--   I have, yes I have the nontransactions component of M3, but not M3 itself And that doesn't do very much for you I have debt as a whole here And that isn't consistent enough; it has scattered minuses and pluses   We have some work in process   From another perspective, Mr Chairman--and this supplements Mr Truman's data--we've been working on this also, partly using the quarterly model and partly using some judgment And with the same assumption that we get the current account balanced, the question is whether interest rates go up and whether it reduces fixed investment and all that But the model ended up with a very high personal saving rate in that process, which we judgmentally reduced over a four-year period By the time it was all done we were ending up with a personal saving rate of very close to 8 percent which, as you know, is very high historically That sort of cast into doubt the practicality of all this short of other measures, such as a weakening economy, which themselves would bring the current account in balance And that same exercise, to verify it in the sense of capacity, did require capacity utilization rates in manufacturing rising--depending on [an assumption of potential] capacity growth on the order of 2-1/2 to 3 percent--to the area of 85 to 87 percent If you thought [potential growth] was 3-1/2 percent, it'd be a little lower than that But it certainly is on the order of 5 percentage points added--   Well, I could add that one example we were working out would imply the dollar would go down, but I don't know by how much But suppose you said you're going to move to current account balance over a four-year period--and this is relevant to what Mr Boehne was mentioning in a lot of ways Just say you're going to do that, but if you do it you've got to press So, apart from what happens to the dollar, you have to have over that period gross domestic purchases--consumption plus investment plus government expenditures--growing less than GNP And there has not been a four- year period [like that] in the postwar period There have been some periods where it has grown less but not [for so long] On one estimate we've worked out, if you went to current account balance and GNP was growing 3 percent in real terms--yes, your potential may be a little more because you had a little slack in unemployment--you would have had to had gross domestic purchases growing 2 percent over that four-year period So, it's 1 percentage point less year after year    10/1/85  The public has to be willing to sacrifice output, in effect, to abroad   I mean to sacrifice their consumption relative to output   Yes To make it difficult, we were assuming that didn't happen That's not the experience of the postwar period It has been less than that, but not for so long I don't think--and Mr Cross and Mr Truman [may think differently]--that the market has yet moved to the point where they think the dollar is going to drop 40 percent But that's the danger, I think   Yes   We had projected about equal, given the ups and downs in the month The latest figure would suggest that the month- end is quite a lot lower; but that figure revises   It started quite high   The first sentence is meant to be the same, yes There may be typos; that's different   Well, I assumed--   Well, I assumed we hit the $500 million In the past we have used "sought" when we didn't get what we were aiming for But whichever way, it doesn't matter   The next two sentences may be expressed differently, but they are meant to be the same in that there is an M2 and M3 sentence and an M1 sentence The difference comes after that    10/1/85   That's right The difference is that the "somewhat greater or somewhat lesser restraint," instead of being confined only to the monetary aggregates and viewed in the context of everything else, pertains to the monetary aggregates and everything else all the same And there is a little change in the last sentence   Yes, that's right   I took the words "monetary objectives and related reserve paths" out of the last sentence and substituted "reserve conditions" since that's what the Manager is operating on   We meant that to apply to both variants; that was the--   Well, Mr Chairman, a technical reading of the first variant says that the Committee will tighten or ease depending on what happens in the aggregates and they'll assess that in the context of the other things The only slight substantive difference I can see is that a technical reading of the second variant says you could tighten or ease even if the aggregates were on track, depending on what happens to other things I think that's what the Committee pretty much has been doing recently and this was just a sentence that attempted to say that You have to stretch your reading of the first variant a bit to have that in, but of course it encompasses it The only other difference was that in the last sentence it says "pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a funds rate" and I short-circuited that to just "reserve conditions" because the monetary objectives were cast in with other things--for obvious reasons    Mr Chairman, I can be quite brief It seems to me that the alternatives presented--not alternative C, but alternatives A and B at least--are generally consistent with the growth path adopted by the Committee for the fourth quarter at its last meeting One is toward the bottom end of that range and one, in a sense, is toward the middle or upper end I should point out a  -17-    11/4-5/85  technical point that M1, for example, under alternative B we have 5 percent; the Committee said 6 to 7 percent or lower The hurricane effect raises M1 growth in September by 3 percentage points and reduces it in October by about the same amount So in some sense that 5 percent under alternative B could be construed as 6 percent with the hurricane allowed for That's a minor bit of expertise It does tend to buttress the point that the differences between "A" and "B" relative to the growth path adopted by the Committee are small The only other point that perhaps one might make in a general way, Mr Chairman, is that the weakness in the economy is in those areas most susceptible to long-term rates, and one could advance very gingerly a proposition that in providing reserves as they will have to be provided over this period perhaps there is some usefulness in providing them through acquisitions of coupon issues, at least to a degree, to do whatever could be done to keep pressures on long rates from going up or encouraging them to go down even while short rates might need to be sustained for international reasons or for reasons of monetary growth rates   Well, that was essentially a difference we thought was roughly consistent with a drop of a half point in the funds rate, and presumably to a degree in other short rates The--   No But I feel absolutely certain that if the Committee leaned in the direction of alternative A, expectations of a discount rate decrease would shortly begin to dominate the market And I think the risk, as we tried to indicate, would be that short rates--at least in the short run--would fall more than is specified   Well, one model gives you 25 basis points per $100 million [on borrowing], and we tend to think judgmentally more like 20 basis points per $100 million These relationships are quite loose, so I think that is consistent with what we have there   Well, I didn't mean to be very--   We are coming to a period of reserve need, and I guess I was bitten by fears of the dollar dropping sharply Working through that chart show, I think that the dollar is probably sensitive to both short-term as well as long-term rates in some degree So in providing reserves over this period, I was trying to think of a way that would minimize the possibilities of adverse expectational effects on the dollar So I didn't really mean a substantial operation twist, but that when the opportunity came it might be desirable to think about buying coupon issues rather than bills, depending a little on the circumstances at the time and how people were thinking in the markets   You see that was not checked with the Chairman!   Well, it's calm, largely because of the averaging of the zero to minus one that we are projecting for October Growth would have broken out--whether it's "A" or "B"--in between 8 and 9-1/2 percent over that last two months of the year Those are fairly substantial growth rates in and of themselves and, as we mentioned, if rates went down and particularly if expectations carried them down more, we could get a powerful surge in M1 as rates moved  -20-    11/4-5/85  closer to these NOW account ceilings So there is a considerable risk of a very substantial growth, particularly under "A," I think   "About"?   You could say "somewhat greater reserve restraint might and somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable, depending on" behavior That makes it very clear   On Friday, when the directive of the previous meeting comes out, it will be clear, as everyone knows, that the Committee was not aiming at hitting this target, given the September- to-December [figure] I believe we could put it in the policy record as you suggested, Mr Chairman, and just say that the Committee, in its discussion, recognized that given the--   This letter?   Yes    Thank you To provide background to the Committee's discussion of the role the monetary aggregates might play in policy formulation, Mr Lindsey will summarize the analysis of the aggregates and their characteristics contained in the recently distributed staff paper of which he was the chief author I will then briefly outline the possible implications for the usefulness of the aggregates in policy implementation next year   Mr Chairman--   Well, we were surprised at how low interest rates got If we had known in advance that that was going to happen, we would have been less surprised   Thank you Well, we have been examining these various weighted measures--Barnett's measures, Paul Spindt's measures, and this one that Dave just mentioned that is in effect velocity weighted rather carefully And we are trying to think of ways we might be able to get even more academic input into the process, although some of this material has already been published in the academic press, and a rather large literature is developing It has a certain appeal as a way of at least supplementing the unweighted measures of the aggregates because there are various ways of taking varying degrees of liquidity or moneyness into account One thing to keep in mind--and these are the early days--is that it doesn't really tend to solve economic problems That is, it might help in the way things look If, for example, there is going to be a big shift out of market instruments or some lesser kind of money-type deposit into other deposits, that shift is going to appear in more rapid money growth relative to what the Committee said or what it expected In an unweighted average, growth will be even more rapid growth; in a weighted average, it will be a little less rapid But the economic problem in interpreting the deviation will still be there You're not going to change the necessity of interpreting the aggregates [by using] a weighted average Instead of the difference being between 6 and 10 percent when there is a shift, it might be a difference between 6 and 7 percent So [the explanation] will seem easier, but in effect the economic issues are the same Should you offset the 7 percent? Should you offset the 10 percent? But, there is something to be said for the weighting--in my view in any event   Well, Mr Chairman, I fear the conclusions that I have will be gravely anticlimactic I believe one of the clearest conclusions from Mr Lindsey's analysis is that the aggregates are still in a state of flux--   --in the sense that there has not been enough time to get a reasonably certain handle on the impact of past deregulation and on the behavior of depository institutions and their customers under varying economic and financial circumstances And, of course, there will be an additional and final deregulatory step early next year that will provide even more flexibility and choice for banks and depositors Thus, it is very difficult to suggest at this time that more weight should be given to the aggregates as a whole in policy implementation next year than was given this year On the other hand, I would tend to argue that we do not have compelling evidence that even less weight should be placed on the aggregates as a whole We do, I think, have some evidence that under current circumstances the weight on the aggregates should be redistributed in some degree among them--or at least that M1 should be judged in light of what's happening to M2 and M3 While uncertainties abound, it does seem to me that we're in the process of moving toward an M2 with an interest responsiveness that is low relative to M1, as Mr Lindsey has pointed out That in itself would tend to argue for giving the broader aggregate a bit more weight than it has had in the past, particularly in periods when market interest rates may be changing substantially In those circumstances, there could be large effects from interest rate changes on the demand for narrow money, given the sizable amount of savings funds now in that aggregate that shift readily between M1 and other components of M2  I certainly do not mean to suggest either ignoring M1 or quickly reacting to small changes or large potentially short-lived changes in M2 relative to path M1 cannot be ignored because it does, of all the aggregates, contain the highest proportion of transaction balances and to that degree is sensitive to future GNP I think that was borne out in Mr Lindsey's analysis of the difference between the concurrent velocity and the lagged velocity, which is smoother than the concurrent M2 cannot be relied on completely because it contains large elements of savings that in turn depend on attitudes toward wealth and other factors affecting the propensity to save The relationship between M2 and GNP thus is not all that tight or predictable either, as compared with M1 Perhaps I'm really suggesting no more than what the Committee has been doing implicitly, under one interpretation at least, over the past year Over that period the relative moderation in M2 growth--at least its moderation relative to path--as well as in M3 can be viewed as having been a significant, but not necessarily decisive, counterforce to the strength of M1 in the implementation of policy In that sense, policy responds more to the aggregates when all are relatively strong or all are relatively weak than when any single one goes off course If it is right that M1 is in process of becoming subject to significantly more interest sensitivity than M2, at least at around current market rate levels, then it may be desirable for the Committee to consider adopting a 1986 range for M1 that is wider than for M2 The tentative ranges currently have the same width; a wider M1 range would allow for larger swings in M1 in response to potential interest rate changes over the year It would also be consistent with our view that forthcoming deregulatory changes, apart from their long-run structural impact, would affect M1--either up or down--mainly depending on bank strategies with respect to NOW, savings, and money market deposit accounts, if indeed they have any significant effect at all Whatever the numerical specifications of the ranges, though, and whatever the weight of the aggregates relative to each other, it's hard to see that    12/16-17/85  the Committee can implement policy next year with any less judgmental interpretation than in recent years Uncertainties about the aggregates are inherent, given the rather long period over which banks and depositors adapt their behavior to a deregulated environment and given the perhaps longer period it may take before the new regularities in their behavior can be detected and relied on with confidence for policy purposes   We will do this work and, of course, present it as it develops, Governor Martin I would like to stress that the work is really quite experimental in the sense that the statistical basis for the weighting is not that strong We have done surveys in the Research Division to develop data and, while it's as good as we think we can make it under present knowledge, the statistical basis is not that strong Secondly, I would like to stress that, at least in my own view--and it's probably important to get more input from others in the profession--I don't think it solves the policy problem It may have certain presentational advantages but I don't think it solves the policy problem of whether or to what degree the aggregates are a good guide to [the Committee] That, I think, is not solved by this  -10-    12/16-17/85   Yes, that's among the issues   Well, that index has a problem, Governor Partee That's why I really would stress again the experimental [nature] of both of these The way that was initially measured--and one has to try to deal with it--when interest rates got to 17 percent the degree of moneyness in the RP became less than when they were at 5 percent   And that seems counterintuitive So that was a big difficulty in that particular measure So, both these measures have certain statistical properties in them that are difficult, as well as the fact that the analysis of the economics is just barely beginning   We will do that   One other way of looking at it, Mr Chairman, is that a lot of these NOW accounts are simply, in effect, the old savings accounts re-designated And all of this volatility that we are observing as interest rates go up and down, would have occurred only in M2 and not at all in M1 So it is simply transferring--   Well, that was the disintermediation time I haven't checked back, but my impression is yes In the last two years M2 has been reasonably stable while M1 has been quite volatile I stopped myself short of saying directly [that the Committee might want to] put a little more weight on M2 I thought I was implying it very indirectly   Mr Lindsey has some data on L, which is M3 plus commercial paper plus Treasury bills   Anything that grew less than M1 is going to have had a better performance   Mr Chairman, a slightly impressionistic answer--   Could I, Mr Chairman, offer one hypothesis to your question of why the velocity of everything has declined, which it has Velocity of M3, debt, and liquid assets all declined in the period since the early '80s One thing you could think of is that in a deflationary period, financial assets become more "valuable" than physical assets, whereas in an inflationary period it's vice versa And in addition to the outstanding amounts of financial assets going up, of course, you are evaluating stock at a [spurious] rate, so in terms of market values those prices are going up Although it is an impressionistic view, it strikes me that there is something to that There is just no hurry at the moment to dispose of paper and to get into physical tangible assets that are going to go up in value like a house or plant and equipment That will eventually come It explains all the velocities   Well, when the interest rates go down and the stock prices go up to a point where it is cheaper to build the plant and equipment than it is to buy it, then it seems to me that we ought to begin getting the normal expansion I didn't mean inflation; I meant a normal expansion in plant and equipment It seems to me that you have to get that kind of "equilibrium" At the moment it seems to me much cheaper to buy a piece of plant and equipment--   We do have a decent economy, but probably if what I said is right it's implying at some point [unintelligible] as prices go up to a point where it becomes economic, given the low level of inflation, to invest in physical assets--assuming inflation isn't going to revive   Well, we have tried to get a handle on that by surveys of what they intend to do and I think the results are rather diverse There may be simplification; I wouldn't doubt that there would be some But there seems to be a view that they are still going to try to pay relatively low rates to smaller accounts and then move more to market rates with larger accounts, which was the basis of some of our analysis Maybe some will begin tying them to demand deposits That has happened a lot more slowly than we would have expected some years ago, but maybe now this will develop more Perhaps Dave could add a little more to that; I don't have any sense of it beyond that   I have a vague feeling that a certain amount of complexity will tend to make people feel that they can maximize their profits a bit   [Statement--see Appendix]   With a $400 million borrowing assumption, under current discount rates--I would not put too fine a point on it--it would take a funds rate somewhere on the order of 7-7/8 percent or a tick higher, something like that So that's just [over] the discount rate And at least in my judgment, the funds rate has not reflected expectations of a discount rate cut to any significant degree yet in the sense that other market rates have I'd expect that if the discount rate were 7 percent, the funds rate would be almost, but not quite, half a point lower than that 7-7/8 percent   Given the same borrowing It's hard to say, but I would put it at 7-3/8 or 7-1/2 percent--in that range I defer to Mr Sternlight   I would think very close to 7 percent, if the market sensed there was an easing No, I mean right around 7-1/2 percent--roughly equivalent [to the discount rate] I don't think that you can ease bank reserve positions without setting up considerable expectations on the discount rate I am not sure where but I think the interaction would drive rates down; it could drive the funds rate pretty sharply at first   Well, I would think it would get down If the discount rate were reduced to 7 percent--depending on the timing and    12/16-17/85  direction of these--you would get the fed funds rate pretty much down from the discount rate You would get not the minimal but close to the minimal   In that context, President Guffey, it might be useful to add that a combination like that--again, depending on how it's done--would have, in my view anyhow, a rather powerful effect on exchange rates   The last 1/4 point [discount rate change] I see was September 22, 1978 when we increased it from 7-3/4 to 8 percent   That seems reasonable   Yes, but that to me would mean as a practical matter that it would be under $350 million most of the days of the 14- day period It's a funny business You can't quite tell where--so I think you just have to be guided by the interaction of the funds rate and the movement of the borrowing   Yes, the Committee has mostly used the November-to-March rates; it did last time One thought that the staff had was that if the November-to-March period wasn't used, in some sense the aggregates look ignored in the last part of December But the Committee may wish to do that   I don't feel strongly at all about that, Mr Chairman The special circumstances are that we think there might not  -60    12/16-17/85  be many municipal issues suddenly after the beginning of the year and banks may not participate, therefore, as actively But for all we know they could start buying governments instead   To me, Mr Chairman, it would be sensible to give a small range for both   I think that that would be reasonable   You could put it on the line after the first sentence, Mr Chairman, saying "taking account of the impact of the a discount rate action should one be taken," or something like that   "The existing degree of reserve pressures, taking account of--"   It indicates the area   I think that the Committee ought to recognize, Mr Chairman, that a lot of those high numbers of $600 and $700 million do come from that sort of thing Even a $2 billion breakdown can--   Yes It gives a little more credibility to our 8 percent under "B"   We have a little more confidence that M1 might make the top of the 6 to 8 percent range over the four months   14-1/2 percent--something like that   That's right   Well, we wouldn't have changed--or I wouldn't have, in any event--our December-to-March estimate given the more recent December figures I would view that not entirely but slightly independently It would be lower under alternative [C]; our December- to-March estimate was around 8 percent, with December 14-1/2 percent I wouldn't be tempted to change that because of this number   You could use 7 to 9 percent for M1, Mr Chairman, which would not be too inconsistent with all of this-- indicating it's slightly higher   Well, you don't absolutely need it We could put it in the policy record, perhaps It's just a little safeguard, since we don't quite know what's going to happen    They're roughly where they closed yesterday, so they have been essentially flat this morning   [Statement--see Appendix]   Well, as you know, we have a $20 per barrel imported oil price The spot price varies but it has been around $1675 or $1660 recently I was assuming a little further decline from that spot price and the spot price itself getting reflected finally into the imported price of oil So, I was thinking [of a decline of] $4 or $5 more on the imported price of oil   I think so, depending on how slow a growth you anticipate in the second half We might begin to get relatively rapid M1 growth if interest rates were to decline substantially in the second half and that would begin pressing the upper end of this range more, unless it was widened a little Generally the answer would be yes, but it depends a little on the pattern of rates one expects to be consistent with that kind of projection   Yes, for debt we would be projecting--   No For M2 and M3 we are very close to the middle of the ranges   Yes Our forecast for M1 is between 6-1/2 and 7 percent Jim says near 7 percent In the model we rely on most it is literally 68 percent We have others that are a little lower and one that is higher   In a large sense, Governor Angell, the unknown portion last year was basically the demand deposit behavior And I don't think that had anything to do at all with deregulation The question in our minds was whether it had something to do in a broad way with the aftermath of EF Hutton, with banks and corporations beginning to look much more carefully at their cash management practices and banks their overdraft practices A question also was whether it had to do with some of the failures that occurred in terms of clearings and whether banks began looking at overdraft practices and began to take the Board's policy seriously in terms of daylight overdrafts All those things together could have added a bit to demand deposit growth--that which we can't explain through normal interest rate and income relationships And that is the sort of thing we were thinking might not be repeated this year Of course it may, but we think it will not; therefore, we were thinking demand deposit growth would be considerably less than the 8-1/2 percent [in 1985], absent a very sharp drop in interest rates Those are our conjectures on that   Yes   That's fine   The Committee has changed M1 quite a lot   Or thereabouts We had put some language in that said [the Committee would] continue to examine it in light of velocity, which by implication would take care of the need--   We substituted   Yes   We tried to cover it by implication on both sides on the--    2/11-12/86   --"the Committee agreed on the following ranges" period "With respect to--"   Mr Chairman, in light of the discussion on the long run and the narrowness of the ranges I should mention, as the Committee members surely know, that the width of the alternatives is narrower than the likely range of error in the outcome   The Committee at its last meeting had established wider [short-run] ranges for Ml, M2 and M3 than had been the practice for some time Because of the width of the ranges, and    2/11-12/86  given the fact that December turned out to be pretty close to projections and January is coming in low--lower than we had projected --two of the alternatives, A and B, are consistent with those ranges that had been established As you can see, alternative B is predicated on no further change in bank reserve pressures from what had been adopted at the last meeting Under Alternative B, we expect growth rates to be close to the lower end of the 6 to 8 and 7 to 9 percent ranges adopted--   Right And that assumes that January growth in fact will be about 1-1/2 percent by the time we put out the new numbers, which are virtually completed Alternative A assumes some further easing of bank reserve pressures and would have an accelerated growth, we think, in Ml and M2 in February and March But over a four-month period, the average would still be at growth rates within the ranges adopted by the Committee at the last meeting I think alternative C is not particularly relevant, if the Committee accepts the staff view that that was predicated on adopting a tighter alternative long-run target than that adopted Although, of course, in some sense, those ranges are not inconsistent with the long-run ranges that the Committee has adopted--except possibly for M2; [the aggregates] just move down in those ranges faster  Mr Chairman, I really don't have much more to add I should mention that, in the past, the Committee has sometimes moved to a December base at this point in the first quarter We have suggested leaving the November base because the likely growth is not too far out of the ranges that the Committee already has adopted So there is a possibility of simply leaving [unchanged] the directive and the ranges covering the period through March whether or not the Committee decides to keep reserve pressures unchanged or to ease them The alternative would be to move to a December base; but in that case I think some of the numbers would have to be lowered from what had been adopted   I should say in that context, Mr Chairman, that generally we attempt to review at the mid-quarter meeting whether the targets set at the beginning-of-the-quarter meeting are feasible Our general feeling was that they seemed feasible; it is just this matter of the November or December base We didn't see a great need to change it   That's what I was [thinking]--rounding in my head a bit   In the two weeks ending January 29, Mr Chairman, we had borrowings of $374 million and in the preceding two- week period they were $143 million And, as you mentioned, for this period they probably will be somewhere between $200 million and $300 million or so by the time we are done For the latest week that was published, the first half of this two-week period, borrowing was $240 million in that one-week period   It was $300 to $400 million and there was an outside range of $250 to $450 million, depending on--   I'd defer to Peter, to a degree If you lowered it down to $300 million, I think the odds on it being at 7-3/4 percent are increased and it might occasionally fall below that   We'd use whatever the Committee told us to use   I don't think it would be interpreted that way at all, Governor Johnson Conditions may [unintelligible] the market to react and they don't, as Peter said But I would--   It might be useful to note, Mr Chairman, that the funds rate, which had averaged 8 percent in November and 8-1/4 percent in December, since mid-January has averaged on the weekly numbers 794, 787, and 783 percent And up until very recently it has been at 7-3/4 percent So most of the time, in a sense, it has tracked down since the last meeting   And when the Treasury balance was especially high, it was at 8 percent, too There were a couple of 8 percents    [Statement--see Appendix]   I mentioned the monetary aggregates in passing   It is uncertain Also, it has risk potential but I think it is very possible If the oil price continues to plummet down to $8 or $7--it's below $10 now already this morning-- then of course long rates may continue down But to some degree, they probably have by this time some lower short rates in the future in them than we now have in the market I suppose   Well, I think the long rates built into this forecast are actually somewhat higher than we now have in the market   That's right   My view is very simplistic because when you get sophisticated the reality tends to get a little lost in this, I think It is something like the long-term real growth potential of the economy, about which there's great doubt now In my own mind I'd put it somewhere between 2-1/2 and 3 percent, give or take a margin of error around that So the Treasury yield at 7-1/4 percent is very low, if you think the rate of inflation expectations, as in the Hoey survey, is 5 or 5-1/2 percent [Unintelligible] between Treasuries and corporate bonds opened up here If you think the rate of inflation expectations isn't properly represented by the Hoey survey-- and I don't think it is--[unintelligible], then if you put the inflation expectations down lower than that 5 percent, of course, your real rates relative to corporates still look somewhat on the high side relative to the expected rate of return It seems to me it's a very "right on the edge" kind of judgment   Well, that's why I did mention the aggregates in passing It's a very important element   It is around 4 percent   That's right, compounded The quarterly average is higher than the month-to-month   Around $70-$85 million on average roughly We would expect it to pick up maybe into the low hundreds or something like that over the next month or so Without much pressure on the funds rate, we would not expect much of a pickup   My memory is a couple of hundred million or so   That's right   It was $630 million the week of the 19th and [unintelligible] the week of--   That's right 9 percent quarterly average as against the--   We're suggesting the possibility of--   We said 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent; that gets a little closer to centering it
