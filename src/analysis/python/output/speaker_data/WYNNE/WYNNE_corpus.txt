5  Thank you, Mike Mr Chairman and members of the  Committee, in recent years, a number of monetary policymakers have addressed the  question of whether greater global economic integration, or globalization, has had a  significant impact on inflation in the United States  One dimension of this integration  is trade in goods and services, and, as figure 1 in your handout shows, imports as a  share of GDP have gone from just over 4 percent during the 1950s and 1960s, to  more than 18 percent at the most recent peak  While there appears to be broad  agreement on the importance of globalization as a real phenomenon—that is, as a  phenomenon that affects the location and pattern of real economic activity, along with  relative prices and real factor returns—there is less agreement on what globalization  means for inflation dynamics and monetary policy in a country as large as the United  States On the one hand, there are those who argue that the gap concept that is now  relevant for thinking about US inflation is a worldwide measure rather than a  domestic one  On the other hand, there are those who argue that, with a flexible  exchange rate regime, the effect of foreign price developments on US inflation is  minimal    Whether greater openness has implications for inflation over the medium  to  longer term depends very much on how monetary policy responds to these  developments  Globalization does not alter the fact that, at longer horizons, inflation  is ultimately determined by the actions of  monetary policymakers  Our remarks this  morning will focus on the so-called global slack hypothesis, the notion that, as a  result of globalization, the concept of slack that is most relevant for thinking about  short-run tradeoffs between inflation and real activity is global rather than local  We  argue that the global slack hypothesis has analytical content even under a floating  exchange rate regime in the context of at least one widely used framework for  thinking about inflation dynamics in open economies and, furthermore, is consistent  with what we see in the data The evidence is fragile, to be sure, but it suggests that  the hypothesis cannot be dismissed outright   In an open economy, as can be seen in slide 5 of the handout, the final  consumption basket will consist of both domestically produced and foreign produced  goods, and consequently the overall rate of consumer price inflation will be a  weighted average of the rates of increase of the prices of these goods  When price                      December 15–16, 2009 149 of 247  changes are infrequent and asynchronous, the rate of change of the prices of  domestically produced goods can be written as a function of the expected future rate  of change of these prices and the real marginal costs of producing them  The rate of  change of the prices of foreign produced goods sold in the domestic market can be  written analogously   Substitution of these relationships into the domestic consumer price index then  gives us a general expression for the open economy Phillips curve  Domestic CPI  inflation is related to expected future domestic CPI inflation and a weighted average  of domestic and foreign real marginal costs  By invoking additional assumptions  about the labor markets and firms’ pricing behavior, it is possible to rewrite the  Phillips curve in a more standard form in terms of domestic and foreign output gaps   And here we need to consider two cases   Suppose that firms that engage in international trade set prices in their own  currency and adjust them infrequently Under what is referred to as producer  currency pricing, the law of one price holds and exchange rate pass-through is  complete  In this case, there is a relatively straightforward mapping from real  marginal costs to output gaps that allows us to write the domestic Phillips curve in  terms of an average of the domestic and foreign output gaps, as can be seen in slide 6  in the handout The foreign output gap matters not only as a proxy for foreign  marginal costs and their effects through import prices, but also because of its  influence on domestic pricing decisions In fact, theory suggests that domestic  marginal costs (and, therefore, domestic producer prices) will in general depend on  the foreign gap as well because (a) domestic firms export their products abroad, so  higher foreign demand will force them to pay higher domestic wages; and (b)  variations in the terms of trade will affect their domestic market share and  consequently their domestic costs  Likewise, foreign marginal costs will depend on  foreign as well as domestic output gaps   What if, instead, firms that are engaged in international trade set prices in the  currency of the market to which they are exporting, which is arguably the case for  most foreign firms selling in the United States?  Under what is referred to as local  currency pricing, the law of one price no longer holds and exchange rate pass-through  is incomplete  However, we can still derive an expression for domestic CPI inflation  in terms of domestic and foreign output gaps, but the Phillips curve now includes an  additional expression reflecting the impact of deviations from the law of one price on  inflation dynamics  These deviations, in turn, can be tied to the easily observable real  exchange rate (net of terms of trade effects)   Under both assumptions about pricing behavior, the composite coefficients on the  domestic and foreign output gaps are identical functions of the underlying structural  parameters of the model  Most importantly, as we show in our background paper, the  coefficient on the domestic output gap declines as imported goods become more  important in the consumption bundle, while the coefficient on the foreign output gap                   December 15–16, 2009 150 of 247  increases; that is, as foreign goods become more important in the consumption  bundle, the strength of the relationship between the foreign output gap and domestic  inflation will increase, while the relationship between the domestic output gap and  domestic inflation will become weaker   Turning now to slide 7, even prior to the recent flurry of work on globalization, a  number of Federal Reserve economists had looked into the potential effect of foreign  slack on US inflation These earlier analyses generally found that the estimated  coefficients on measures of foreign slack were not statistically significant in  traditional backward-looking Phillips curve regressions  In these earlier studies, the  “rest of the world” was usually assumed to be the “rest of the G–7”  Borio and  Filardo revived the debate in a widely cited paper, and they found a statistically  significant role for the foreign output gap in explaining US inflation and a declining  role for the domestic output gap  Subsequent work by researchers at the Board of  Governors, however, cast doubt on the robustness of these findings   The New Keynesian analytical framework that we use provides an account of  inflation dynamics around a possibly time-varying steady state  Hence, when looking  for patterns in the data, it seems appropriate to focus on the cyclical components of  the variables If we define the world as consisting of just the G–7 economies, as  much of the older empirical literature had done, ordinary least squares estimates of  simple open economy Phillips curve regressions suggest that there is a more  significant relationship, in a statistical sense, between slack in the other economies of  the G–7 and the cyclical component of inflation in the US than there is between  slack in the US and inflation in the US  But while the G–7 group still accounts for a  significant share of world GDP and of US imports, these shares are declining, as  shown on slide 9 in your handout A more comprehensive empirical evaluation of the  hypothesis would look at a larger group of countries  Slide 10 in the handout reports  some of the results we obtain estimating simple versions of our Phillips curve  specifications  For three of the four specifications, the estimated coefficient on the  foreign output gap is statistically significant at the 5 percent level and exceeds the  estimated coefficient on the US output gap in magnitude  The evidence is far from  overwhelming, to be sure, but it suggests that the idea is worth taking seriously and  exploring further   There are a number of possible reasons for the fragility of the evidence, mostly  having to do with the conceptual and measurement challenges associated with  estimating Phillips curves in terms of domestic and foreign output gaps  But we  should note that it is possible to completely eliminate foreign slack variables from the  Phillips curve  That is, the effects of foreign slack on domestic inflation can be fully  captured in principle by movements in a terms-of-trade gap  Interestingly, when  written this way it turns out that the slope of the Phillips curve with respect to  domestic slack is exactly the same in the open economy and closed economy  specifications of the model, as can be seen in slide 11 in the handout  The  equivalence between these two approaches to capturing the relationship between                                                                         6 The materials used by Mr Fuhrer are appended to this transcript (appendix 6)   December 15–16, 2009 151 of 247  foreign slack and domestic inflation also means that much of the earlier empirical  work on this issue, including our own, probably needs to be reconsidered   To sum up, there are sound analytical and empirical reasons for believing that  globalization—and, in particular, the greater openness of the US economy to trade—  has had important implications for inflation dynamics  However, there are well- known conceptual and measurement issues associated with the use of output gaps  A   terms-of-trade gap can, in principle, capture the effects of the foreign output gap on  domestic inflation developments, but it remains to be seen how well a global slack  perspective can improve our ability to forecast inflation and understand the tradeoffs  that monetary policy faces  Jeff will now continue with the staff presentation     On the question of the pricing to the US market, we actually do   consider this case One of the contributions in our background paper is to push some of the   existing literature forward by explicitly incorporating the so-called local currency pricing   assumptions as opposed to the producer currency pricing assumption   If you go back to exhibit 6 in our handout, that’s what gives rise to these complicated   additional terms in the Phillips curve expression to capture these deviations from the law of one   price If you don’t have people pricing in dollars for the US market, you’re just going to have   to worry about the domestic and foreign output gaps, or domestic and foreign real marginal   costs This is what makes it very tricky to test this idea that foreign influences matter, because   you can also just write down a Phillips curve where all the foreign influences come in through a                 December 15–16, 2009 181 of 247  terms-of-trade-like term  But it’s a gap—it’s a deviation of the terms of trade from its   frictionless level   A lot of very subtle econometric issues come up then in trying to figure out why the   terms-of-trade variable is in the Phillips curve expression  Is it to capture deviations from the   law of one price, or is it some sort of a summary statistic for all foreign slack?  I think it makes a   big difference to the validity of the hypothesis This was what motivated our final remark about   why we really need to rethink some of the earlier econometric work, some of the good work that   was done here at the Board of Governors, the work that the researchers at the BIS have done, and   some of the earlier work we did on this question  However, these terms-of-trade variables look   like some of the variables people have traditionally included in Phillips curve regressions  We   know that oftentimes you’re going to need to put in energy prices or import prices or food prices   in your traditional Phillips curve to get the fit to work  And the theoretical framework we have   laid out explains why these things may, in fact, matter  But a lot more work needs to be done   before we could actually apply this to some of the policy issues Jeff and Mike have addressed in   their presentations
