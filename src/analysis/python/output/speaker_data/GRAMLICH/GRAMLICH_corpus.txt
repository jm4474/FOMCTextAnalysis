 Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to break my remarks into  a comment on our overall policy stance and another on the question of timing  On the issue of the overall policy stance, I have become persuaded that, if anything,  the present federal funds rate is a little on the low side I say that for three reasons One is that  in the staff forecast the unemployment rate is low and inflation is heating up It is heating up at a  very slow rate that is hard to observe, but it is heating up The direction is clear I believe  monetary policy should stay ahead of the game in cases like this Secondly, this is the first  opportunity that I have had to listen to a go-around of the Reserve Bank presidents, but I think  most of you were supporting that conclusion Now, I know enough about the law of averages to  realize that what the national statistics indicate will be reflected on balance in what Reserve  Bank presidents say, but a lot of you were providing anecdotal evidence that is not necessarily  apparent in the aggregate statistics at this point I think there are indications in that evidence that  some overheating may be on the way Thirdly, I want to refer to some calculations that the staff  has done on the Taylor Rule As I understand at least the fitted version of that rule, it, too,  suggests that the funds rate is a bit on the low side  Having said that, let me turn to timing There I find a real quandary because from the  standpoint of domestic management alone, I think that the proper course would be to raise the  funds rate promptly by--I don't know the amount--3/4 percentage point or whatever and that  would be that But then the international issue creeps in There I think there are two  considerations--one that a number of you mentioned and another that I have not heard mentioned  too often The one that a number of you have mentioned is that there are some risks that things  could turn out to be a little worse than we have seen so far, and that might argue against a funds    11/12/97 86  rate increase The second is that I would be a little worried in terms of a concept that I will call  "international citizenship" We are trying to "unruffle" or stabilize world currency markets, and  if the United States were to raise its short-term rates at this time, that might put even more  pressure on some of these struggling currencies I worry about that both from the  macroeconomic point of view and also in terms of what it says about international leadership and  responsibility  These considerations define what I consider to be a difficult balancing act, but I would  join most of my fellow Governors in saying that I think this probably is not a good time to act  even though we might favor some action from the standpoint of domestic management alone  So, I would be on the side of delaying a bit I would also like to have the directive say  something about international events because that is a major reason why I am coming out with  this suggestion Thank you   I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting, I felt that from the  standpoint of domestic considerations alone, it was time to raise the funds rate I was dissuaded  from actually voting to do so by the worrisome situation in Southeast Asia While I still favor no  change this month, my reasoning has changed On the one hand, events in Southeast Asia have  become much more worrisome Last month's worse case scenario has now become the best  guess scenario, and this month's worse case scenario has gotten quite bad indeed The impact of  the Southeast Asian crisis on the US economy already generates all the demand restraint that  anybody should want More tightening, I think, would not be called for Moreover, there is still  the question of what I will call international leadership The United States does not want to be  taking monetary actions that will drive up the dollar and drive down Asian currencies any more  than at present or actions that reduce the growth in overall world demand any more than at  present    12/16/97  Domestically, too, conditions have changed While the economy may still be on the  inflationary side of the NAIRU, that is not quite as clear to me Recently, the Board revised its  capacity utilization figures showing much more productive capacity than was apparent earlier  Evidently, the respondents to the survey do not feel that much capacity tightness, and the overall  utilization rate is now close to its historical average It is not clear whether the state of demand is  best measured by labor market statistics or by the capacity statistics Indeed, the capacity  statistics seem to be explaining price and wage changes better at present Moreover, other  leading indicators of price increases, such as commodity prices, gold prices, and term-structure  spreads, are remarkably quiescent All that refers to where the economy is now If the staff is  right and we are looking at a weakening economy as we peer ahead, it may be even less wise to  be tightening now Hence, I would favor no change in current policy  Several speakers around the table used the word "flexibility" and I think that is a very  good word for the present time It is frankly quite hard for me to know where the predominant  risks are, whether they are up or down Thank you   I am for "B" with symmetry I say that both from an international  standpoint and a domestic standpoint The one thing that gives me pause is that if we wait to see  evidence of inflation, given that there are lags in monetary policy, it could be too late I think  that is a cost that we need to keep in mind, but I still conclude, given the current data on the    12/16/97 84  economy and the international situation, that "B" with symmetry is the most logical course of  action   Thank you, Mr Chairman This is my fourth meeting At the  previous three, I felt rather confident in my advice, and I'm afraid I am now joining the cold feet  crowd Let me first make a few comments on the Greenbook forecast and then a few on policy  strategy  On the Greenbook, there is a big change in the forecast from last time that many of  you have noted A second comment is that at least one of the projected sources of the slowdown  is and has been questionable to me I think that if any of us really knew what we were talking    3/31/98  about with regard to stock market values, we would not be here We would be doing something  else I have always been troubled by the forecast of a stock market decline in the sense that the  stock market traders know everything that we know They presumably know about the earnings  forecasts So, I have been troubled by the assumption that in effect we can see something that  they cannot see Mike Prell has conveniently done an alternative forecast that does not assume a  stock market decline In that forecast, growth in real GDP does not moderate to a pace below the  trend rate of long-run economic growth It gets down to about trend or maybe even a bit above  it, so part of the slowdown in the staff's baseline forecast is based on the assumption of a stock  market decline There is another way to look at the stock market If we compare price/earnings  ratios to interest rates, those ratios do not necessarily look out of line So, the market decline  source of the slowdown seems a little shaky to me  The third point I would make about the forecast, and a lot of you brought this out with  your questions, is that even core inflation is not really "core" There are already a lot of positive  supply shocks in that measure Inflation could be heating up a little even as we speak, though  that is not apparent if we just look at the CPI excluding food and energy  I also want to make a few comments about policy strategy Actually, Larry Meyer  made the first when he talked about the reaction to good news The point is that while it is great  to have low unemployment, we cannot overemphasize it in relation to inflation We have to be  very careful that we know what we are doing Other than that, Larry said it very well and I will  not repeat his comments  A second point on policy strategy is that I am among those who think that we can  operate on the basis of a federal funds rate target But the point of that target is that we have  tried to work out, or others have tried to work out, the way the federal funds rate replicates or    3/31/98  would respond to economic events had we been following a money standard It is as if we are  following a money growth standard, but we are somehow putting aside all the supply shocks or  the velocity shocks that give us so much trouble in interpreting the monetary aggregates I think  it is perfectly possible to operate with such a modified money growth standard, but we should  remember that if we do so, the federal funds rate will bounce around The risk in following a  funds rate target is that we can get a target that is too rigid, and we ought to keep that in mind as  well  The third policy strategy comment is about lags Economic conditions are great now  As Alice Rivlin says, we may be seeing the best performance of an economy ever I am not  enough of a historian to know about that, but it certainly is as good as I can remember As we  look around the world, we see that we are uniquely blessed, but we do have to look ahead We  have known that there are lags in monetary policy and we should not be conducting policy on the  basis of what we see out the side door as we drive but on the basis of what we see ahead As I  look ahead, I must say that the inflation risks are beginning to get a little more threatening and  the aggregate demand risks from Asia are beginning to get a little less threatening  The last point I would like to make relates to something that to my surprise nobody  has mentioned in all the meetings I have attended I get a periodical on my desk called Fed  Watch Probably all of you get it Every time some new statistics come out, Fed Watch says the  Fed is going to have heart palpitations about this new set of numbers, but it will not do anything  at this meeting or at its May meeting I am reluctant to be that predictable [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I will support a no-move, asymmetric directive  To see if I have mastered Fedspeak, if somebody had proposed that we raise the fed funds rate by  25 basis points, I would have supported that, too! I am worried, as I said, that we could get  ourselves in a position of being too rigid on the funds rate I do not see that 25 basis points is  that big a deal It is not going to have a fundamental effect on the boom or put a lot of workers  out on the street So, I think that a 25 basis point increase could be justified, but I will support a  no-move, asymmetric directive  I do think we ought to discuss releasing the directive at the earliest opportunity I  agree that if we were to change our procedures now, it would cause a lot of uncertainty and  turbulence, and there is no reason to do that But we ought to discuss that issue as soon as  possible We would be in a little better shape, as Governor Rivlin suggested, if we had a  precedent for announcing an asymmetric directive today So, I think we should prepare for the  future  Let me say one other thing about this issue I believe, Mr Chairman, that when you  give policy speeches--and I read a lot of those before I became a member of the Board--there is  some feeling, at least I had it, that you are speaking for yourself Maybe that was naive on my  part But I think one advantage of getting the word out sooner is in a way to take the heat off  you by indicating that all of us stand behind the policy or at least that the FOMC stands behind  the policy In my view, that would be an advantage of getting the word out sooner So, I would  like to discuss that proposal at an early date I wish we could do it today I accept that we  cannot, but I would like to see that change   Do we have to have the "slightly lower" phrase? Am I out of  order? [Laughter]   Yes, but--    3/31/98   On that advice, I vote "yes" [Laughter]   Just on this point alone, of the identifiable biases in the CPI, more  than half of them are still there BLS has taken out 06 percentage point, but that is less than half of  even the identifiable biases   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think that we are approaching  crunch time, and there are several arguments for tightening There are several arguments for sitting    5/19/98  tight as well Since by and large the tightening arguments already have been made around the  table, let me give some of the arguments on the other side of the question  The first is Asia It seems to me, and I think it seems to others, that the Asian  situation has worsened again There are two countries that are especially problematic in very  different ways, Japan and Indonesia I think the spillover effects in the other Asian countries are  also a little more disturbing than they were when we met in March So, there could be a bigger  impact on the United States than I felt there would be the last time we met  Secondly, let me talk a little about price movements There is a slight acceleration of  inflation in the forecast In a way we should be expecting a slight acceleration because we have  had some positive supply shocks Simply as these wear off, we will get some acceleration The  Greenbook mentions a few shocks on the other side, one of them being tobacco I do not quite  know how to interpret the rising rent shock That may be a shock or it may not be one In any  event, there are some shocks on the other side In my view, the basic message from the price side  is that on their face these price movements seem quite minor Why do we worry about them? That  brings up the third point; it is the NAIRU We worry because of the unemployment gap  Some of that unemployment gap goes away in the Greenbook forecast I gather from  the comments that some of you made that the gap goes away in your own forecasts as well I  personally think that some of this gap will go away when future econometricians reestimate their  equations for the 1990s This does seem to be a relationship that is shifting, and time series  analysis is not a very good way to analyze that kind of shift  Let me also put on the table a new uncertainty about NAIRU that I have just begun to  think about I have not heard too many people mention it, but it does strike me that compared to  earlier times, firms that need additional labor are increasingly farming out their production to other    5/19/98  countries Labor conditions are not tight in other countries, especially in to which the production is  being farmed out This may be a new trend I do not know, obviously, if that is the case or if we  could ever demonstrate it in any rigorous way, but I think it is possibly important  Let me also talk about the bubble issue First, it is mentioned in the Greenbook that  M2 growth has slowed and is wending its way back to within what I will call the Kohn cone On  the stock market, of course the price indexes are high But when we compare the earnings/price  ratio and long-term real interest rates, we find that the equity premium is still positive by about 1  percentage point None of us knows what the equity premium should be, but I personally do not  find it surprising that this equity premium has dropped slightly The reason is that one of the things  that financial innovation has done is to make it possible for average people to buy a more  diversified portfolio of equities The upshot of that is a lower equity premium  I am still, as I have been all along, uneasy about this situation, and it makes policy a  very tough call But I think that the uncertainties are great enough for us to make a strong  argument for holding steady for now What that does mean, as many others have noted, is that  when and if we do make a change, which might not be too long from now, we may have to move  sharply I think we take that cost upon ourselves but for me it is a cost worth bearing Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation for  the reasons that you and others have given Let me make two points on the other side One is, as I  mentioned last time, that in focusing on a funds rate target we may make the funds rate too rigid,  and we should be mindful of that The second can be summarized in a comment that Yogi Berra  made in a year when the New York Yankees were falling far behind the leading team early in the  season He said it was getting late early that year [Laughter] I think we should recognize that this  is a political year, and it might get harder to make changes later in the year We should be mindful  of that and perhaps think hard about it at our next meeting Having said all that, I would still  support your recommendation   Thank you, Mr Chairman The expansion clearly is weakening  Real GDP according to the Greenbook is already below the trend growth rate in this half year, and  it falls even shorter in the next half year Unemployment rises in all of the Greenbook scenarios  Depending on the stock market, the rate of unemployment may at least arguably get close to my  definition of NAIRU fairly soon As one listens to the Reserve Bank presidents, one hears much  more commentary than a few months ago using words like "slowing," "negative psychology,"  "less positive," etcetera  Let me bring Asia back on the table The Asian forecasts are being progressively  downgraded I believe the staff already has moved about one-fourth of the way to its so-called  pessimistic forecast of the last meeting in this forecast The process probably is not completed  Even in the present forecast, as Ted Truman commented earlier, foreign growth is very weak  I will talk a bit about the strategy of policy I am a believer in conducting policy on the  basis of the funds rate as opposed to using other indicators such as the monetary aggregates, gold,  or any of a number of other indicators that have been suggested A problem with the funds rate,    8/18/98  as I have mentioned before, is that a lot of attention gets focused on it and it becomes very  difficult to change it It may even become difficult to change any adjectives we use to describe  our approach to it, such as symmetry I think the remedy is to make more changes in the funds  rate, and the world will get used to the fact that that is the way we operate A good driver does not  apply steady pressure to the gas pedal but rather tries to keep the car going at an even speed  A few months ago, I felt that it was time to raise the fed funds rate a bit I now think  that the time is coming, perhaps very soon, when the right thing to do may be to lower the funds  rate a bit Whether a lower rate is needed at this meeting is very debatable, but the way things are  going, I believe we could be confronting this issue rather soon In all the staff documents that I  read to prepare for this meeting, the paragraph I liked best was on page 9 of the Bluebook That  was the justification for a lower funds rate  Having said that, I cannot question the current stance of policy very much either If the  real interest rate is about 3-1/2 percent, steady inflation is arguably about 2 percent, and both  inflation and unemployment are reasonably close to their target values--this is my own mental  version of the Taylor Rule--policy is roughly about right at this point The economy may not be  well balanced in Jerry Jordan's sense, but I do think that in terms of the level of the federal funds  rate, it is hard to argue that we are far away from where we ought to be That means that there is  no significant harm in waiting a bit before we move in either direction But having said that, I  would like hereby to announce that I have joined the small but growing band of those who think  that there probably are more downside than upside risks at the present time   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will support alternative B As I have  said before, I would like to see us move to a regime where we could move the funds rate more  often--not randomly but more often [Laughter] I don't think that would look silly or needs to  look silly, and I will go back to my example of using the gas pedal to control the speed of the car   A highway with hills On the directive, if we cannot move the  funds rate around, I would certainly like to move the symmetry clause around I think the risks are  roughly symmetric now, so I would definitely support going to symmetry   Thank you, Mr Chairman First, I am for releasing the tilt  sentence or the entire directive paragraph promptly after the meeting and the minutes as soon as  possible thereafter On the language of the directive paragraph, I am for Option 1 Let me point  out one difference between Option 1 and Option 2; Option 1 states the Committee's goals in the  first sentence and goes on to say what the Committee did; Option 2 reverses that order However  we describe the tilt, I would like to preserve that aspect of Option 1 That is, I would state the  goals first and then indicate what we did    9/29/98  I agree with Bill Poole that we should adopt these changes today, although they may  make us a little less aggressive about changing the directive language I agree with what Tom  Hoenig said, but unlike Bob McTeer, I would like to retain the tilt in the directive One thing I  have been worried about, and I have said so in the past, is that the way we make policy could  allow us to get too rigid on the federal funds rate If we keep the tilt, we can be a little less rigid,  and I would like to retain it for that reason  On a last point regarding our credibility that Ed Boehne made and Gary Stern  seconded, I have been impressed since I have been here at how short people's memories are Six  weeks is a fairly long interval in terms of monetary events, and there is a great deal of  speculation about what we are going to do today and not too much is remembered about where  we were six weeks ago I'm not too worried about the credibility issue because if we change our  position or change our minds I think that would be viewed in the context of whether it is a good  thing to do in light of the most recent events I don't think we would lose any credibility So, I  am inclined to downplay that argument   Just to follow up on Alice's question, tell me again how we know  that there are not a lot more large hedge funds like LTCP out there, accidents waiting to happen   We do not know!    9/29/98   It goes to your bedazzlement effect   Thank you, Mr Chairman Coming late in this discussion, there  is not too much to say that has not been said many times already That is the good news I  would point out that there has been a quite important change in the general comments of the  Reserve Bank presidents in the past several meetings, though maybe not a sea change My own  forecast, such as it is, is fairly close to the Greenbook; I am roughly in agreement with the  Greenbook scenario While it is true that more is influencing the slowdown than the stock  market, I think there is an important point to be made about the stock market that has not been  brought out today That is, if we look at forecasts of earnings by the so-called stock market  analysts, they would still be on the high side by all measures What seems to happen in the way  these forecasts are put together is that as disappointing numbers come in, as they have recently,  the current quarter is downgraded but not the future quarters There is still a lot of that going on  I think the Greenbook is on solid ground in anticipating a further decline in stock prices and a  feedback on the real economy through the consumption wealth effect  One concept that we have not talked about much this morning is NAIRU I think that  if we are coming out in the direction of an easing move, as it seems to me most people are, we  should at least go through a mental test on why we are doing so when we have an unemployment  rate that is sitting at 4-1/2 percent Many of you have addressed the fact that you see very little  evidence of accelerating inflation On the TIP premium that we talked about earlier, my view is  that while liquidity preferences and transaction costs may account for some of the TIP premium,  I think there is some information there as well, namely that it reflects a general downgrading of  inflation worries So, with regard to the NAIRU, I guess the story on inflation would be a  combination of things On the one hand, those who think the NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent or  thereabouts may be a little off on that estimate The other aspect, however, is that even in the  Greenbook forecast there is projected to be a rise in the unemployment rate    9/29/98  All of this together adds up to a recommendation on my part for easing as we have  previously discussed I think the main question is whether to ease a lot or a little The  arguments are actually nicely made in the Bluebook, and I will not repeat them I will just say  that where I come out on that issue is that I am for cautious ease One reason is that I believe we  are still ahead of the curve in terms of managing the real economy I don't think there is a sense  in which, if we just look at the real economy, we can be described as being too late or behind the  curve Dave Stockton pointed out that there still are upside risks and we should keep those in  mind I think that Al Broaddus made a good point when he said that if we go too far at this  meeting, it might look as if we have become distracted from what should be our fundamental  goal of dealing with inflation We certainly would not want to send out that message The last  point, which others have made, is that a big move at this point might be misinterpreted as a  degree of panic on our part It would be at a minimum very un-Fed-like, and we certainly would  not want that [Laughter]   I also support both proposals Given all that we have discussed, I  believe some rate cut is important, and I think 25 basis points is about right I am not  embarrassed about basing this policy move on the forecast I think the forecast has it about right  We may find that we have to do more than 25 basis points, and therefore I would also support  asymmetry toward easing   That is just what I was going to do! [Laughter] First, I am for  Option 2 I was all set to support Bill McDonough on keeping the sentence in question just to  point out to the world that there could be changes in the funds rate in the intermeeting period  But I think your proposed insertion of "in the intermeeting period and the coming months" in the  previous sentence does that It makes it clear, in Roger Ferguson's sense, that we are talking  about symmetry or asymmetry into the future, but it also calls attention to the fact that there  could be changes in the intermeeting period If that modifier is in the tilt sentence, then we can  in my view take out the other sentence, as Mike Kelley and Ed Boehne suggested So, I am for  Option 2, adding "in the intermeeting period" to the sentence on the tilt and deleting the next    11/17/98  sentence I also hope that we will get a chance to discuss the issue of immediate release because  I would favor the immediate release of this paragraph   I am happy to wait another month, but when we reconsider the  language can we also have on the agenda the issue of the immediate release of the operational  paragraph?   We cannot immediately release something we have not agreed on  [Laughter]    11/17/98   I think I support Peter Fisher and Bill McDonough on that I  polled the chairman on this, but I couldn't quite tell where he was coming out [Laughter]   I will not pretend that I know much about New York money  markets, but it is true that these securities have a liquidity problem, and that does make it hard to  interpret their inflation signals Peter and Bill are arguing that our present behavior has actually    11/17/98  distorted the market a little, and I agree with them It is not that we would be taking these  securities out of the market It is that we would be trying to make the TIPS market function like  normal securities markets  Let me also say something that I have said before on other aspects of what we do If  this does not work, we can change it This is not something that we will be doing for all time  So, at least on an experimental basis, it makes sense to go along with Peter, and so I would  support it   Thank you, Mr Chairman While the most extreme  manifestations of the credit crunch have abated, risk spreads are still high, and the real federal    11/17/98  funds rate is still high also I think the period of the credit crunch is not entirely behind us I like  Ed Boehne's metaphor on that It's probably a little too soon to go off the medication  On the forecast, I have no complaints with the Greenbook The numbers show that  final sales already have gone down to below trend, and the Greenbook forecast has the GDP  falling below trend I think we all recognize it, but let me repeat that that is with an assumed  further cut in the federal funds rate Even then, there is a fairly prolonged period where GDP is  below trend, with unemployment rising above 5 percent  There are not as many risks on the downside this time around, partly because of  actions that we already have taken But I think there are still two One is the stock market  Even though the Greenbook forecast does program in some decline in the stock market, it is not  that great a decline and it could be more significant if the likely effects of the earnings forecasts  come to pass The second is the foreign troubles, about which we have talked a lot Karen  Johnson gave the pessimistic Brazil forecast a significant probability; as I remember it was 30  percent or so If we look at that forecast, we do have a fairly soft GDP situation  On the inflation side, I am beginning to feel as if I am in the audience of the play,  Waiting for Godot We have had steady unemployment at below 5 percent for seven quarters  now, and the signs of acceleration of inflation still are not much more visible now than they were  then I don't know what is going on here; it is possible that the natural rate model should be  amended, and it is possible that 5-1/2 percent is the wrong estimate of the NAIRU I don't know  what the latter is, but I think the paucity of signs of accelerating inflation this long into a period  of unemployment under 5 percent is really quite striking  We rarely discuss fiscal policy at these meetings In fact, I don't think I have ever  heard it discussed But let me bring that up because there is increasing talk in Washington of    11/17/98  dealing with a recession, if it comes, either on the spending side by having some more spending  or on the tax cut side My view of what macro textbooks used to call the assignment problem in  an era of flexible exchange rates is that the proper role of monetary policy should be to stabilize  the economy and the proper role of fiscal policy should be to worry about the overall national  saving rate, which is very low in this country and should not be lowered still further by  expansionary fiscal policy At this point, I will switch to Bob McTeer's analogy and say that the  right course is for us to keep control of the firetrucks  My last point is that one very clear advantage of monetary policy is its flexibility It  strikes me that things are still a little soft I would still like to see a little more adjustment,  through the "use of water" in Bob's analogy This may prove not to be the right thing to do, but  if it proves not to be right, we can observe that and act accordingly So, I believe the flexibility  of monetary policy gives us a degree of freedom here, and I would like to see us use it Thank  you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of both the 25  basis point cut and the move to a symmetric directive I don't have much to add to the  discussion, but I would like to emphasize the point that it is important for us to stay ahead of the  game, and I think this does it    11/17/98   I support it I would like to compliment some combination of you  and Don Kohn I believe Mike Kelley raised some good, sobering thoughts, but I think the way  to deal with his concern is to use this new tilt announcement procedure only in rare  circumstances In my view that is how it should be done   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our job all year has been to try to  bring about a soft landing In the first half of the year it looked as if we might never have any  landing at all In the second half of the year a crash landing seemed more likely Now, for one  of the first times this year, conditions look about right One can take either the Greenbook  forecast or the Blue Chip forecast and it is hard to write down a better scenario for a soft landing  In that sense, I am relatively comfortable with the present stance of policy There are risks  Others have talked a lot about the risks and I don't have anything in particular to add except that  it seems that the risks will become more evident over time and we will have time to act against  them, provided that we are willing to use monetary policy in a flexible way  Others have talked about the money supply and I don't have much to add about that  either, except to note that there could be a variety of special factors influencing the rapid growth  of the money supply Those who worry a lot about money supply have to admit that the money  supply would have been a particularly poor guide to policy this year That doesn't mean it will  be from now on, but if we look at it in retrospect I think it would have been    12/22/98  I would like to take the opportunity to talk a bit about monetary policy strategy and in  particular about a memo that we all get called "Monetary Policy Rules," which I hardly ever hear  referred to It relates to the Taylor Rule, which is actually quite a favorite among the academic  economists I have been looking at that rather hard this year and, in my view, it has not been that  helpful For most of the year, if one looked at its various predictions, it could have been  interpreted as arguing for higher or lower interest rates, depending on how one estimates the  equation and some other technicalities Now it seems to be saying that we should be raising  interest rates when one could make a case that interest rates are about right I think the problem  here is the output gap term And the deeper problem is that to apply this rule, we must have  point estimates of our targets for both inflation and unemployment At the very best I think we  have bands; we do not have point estimates  As one listens to the way all of you talk about monetary policy, you seem to have  different approaches to how to think about it Suppose for the sake of argument that inflation  and unemployment are reasonably within their target bands if not at one's point estimates As  long as inflation is neither accelerating nor decelerating, we seem to be striving to maintain  existing conditions Partly this involves watchful waiting on acceleration or deceleration, not  necessarily on inflation as such but on leading indicators of inflation such as those on the output  side And in part this involves aiming policy so that future growth in aggregate demand equals  the trend growth in aggregate supply, which is roughly 2-1/2 percent under most models At the  last meeting, I said that the trend growth in aggregate demand was too low and that the economy  needed some further stimulus At this meeting it looks about right--at least to me, maybe not to  some others But I think that most of us have this more informal way of keeping things on an    12/22/98 46  even keel for stable noninflationary growth I believe this is what most of us do and I think it is  working Thank you   I support "B" symmetric I would just like to make one point  about something that Alice Rivlin said about the short lags, which I tend to agree with The  implication is, I believe, that it gives us a little time We can wait until we see some brown spots  before we have to do anything We don't have to eat the banana when it's still green!  [Laughter]   Actually, given that Larry Meyer was so convincing, I will stand  behind him Option 3; retain "in coming months;" and drop the last sentence   Thank you, Mr Chairman Before I comment on current   events, I would like to step back to another interesting time, the 1960s At that time we   thought the rate of productivity growth was high and the NAIRU was low, though we   didn’t call it NAIRU then It turned out we were wrong on both counts Both variables,   which one might expect to change at rather glacial rates, seemed to change rather   abruptly--the NAIRU in the late 1960s and productivity growth in the early 1970s It is   difficult to proclaim that now is another era of abrupt shifts--the truth only becomes   known many years after the fact--but there is some evidence in favor of that hypothesis   The staff has done calculations of productivity and it looks as if there is   enough evidence to suggest an upturn in productivity growth rates of about ½ percentage   point beginning in about 1995 The staff has also done NAIRU calculations While these   are much more speculative because the NAIRU is not directly observable--and many   things could be responsible for the good price behavior--at least one interpretation of the   data is that the NAIRU shifted down by about ½ percentage point also in about 1995   One could make a justifiable case for an even larger shift in the NAIRU The evidence is   still murky But this could be a time when the unfavorable shifts of the late 1960s have   been reversed and, as then, the shifts could have taken place rather abruptly I won’t get   into causes There could be many, and a number of you have raised interesting   hypotheses But the implication is important If we have had this dual shift, the   implication is that output could grow at a rate of nearly 3 percent a year without sparking   new inflation and that unemployment could stay in the neighborhood of 5 percent or   perhaps even a bit below that, again without sparking new inflation   One apparent casualty here is the Taylor rule, which is now telling us that we   should be raising interest rates significantly As I have noted before, and others have     3/30/99 45   also, that rule needs precise point estimates of the inflation and unemployment targets If   the estimates are off, the advice is off We could get around these uncertainties by   supplanting the Taylor rule with what I will call a speed limit rule That we should target   growth in aggregate demand at about 3 percent, or perhaps a bit less, and stay with that   policy as long as inflation does not accelerate   On the demand side, conditions look about right The current Greenbook   forecast for 1999 is exactly 3 percent, with some slowdown forecast after that I will not   go through all the forecasting uncertainties; they have been talked about at length But I   will point out that most Blue Chip forecasts are in a very similar neighborhood and, as   many of you have said, most Reserve Bank forecasts are as well   On the inflation side, the Greenbook does forecast a moderate pickup, but it is   partly due to special factors such as oil, with only a relatively small amount due to tight   labor markets The latest evidence, after stripping out various kinds of shocks, seems to   suggest a slight deceleration, not acceleration, in the trend of both prices and wages   Surveys of inflation anticipations do not show much evidence of acceleration There has   been a very slight increase recently in anticipated inflation based on a comparison of   long-term nominal and real interest rates But this increase is more likely explained by   the reversal of flight-to-quality factors that had previously lowered nominal interest rates   more than real rates The Blue Chip forecasters continue to write down their inflation   forecasts even as they write up their real output forecasts   Putting it all together, it is hard for me to find much evidence of accelerating   inflation right now But this all involves guesses and estimates What if we are wrong?   In that regard we may benefit from another welcome change Monetary policy may work   more quickly than we had thought previously There is lots of uncertainty about that as   well It is a good area for research But in addition to the reasons that Alice Rivlin   brought up earlier, another factor is how anticipatory credit markets have become The   Chairman could change long-term interest rates by 25 basis points, if he wanted to, by   just frowning in a certain way! [Laughter] So, if the lags are shorter, being wrong does   not trouble me quite as much as it did a while back We should look at the evidence     3/30/99 46   carefully, particularly on inflation and demand growth, and change rates quickly if we   need to But as others have said, I don’t think we have to be preemptive now This all   adds up to an argument that our present policy stance is about right Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation   for “B” symmetric I am asymmetric in my head but, as long as there is the luxury of   time, I think we can afford to move against an acceleration of inflation or super rapid   economic growth when we see it Otherwise, I don’t think we should act because we are   sure to be misinterpreted While I do think we have the luxury of time, I will also say   that it may be necessary to move sharply later, and we should recognize that as well    Thank you, Mr Chairman For the last few meetings, I   have been trying to determine rules of thumb or guides for how we should be making our   decisions The Taylor Rule, a favorite of many academic economists studying monetary   policy, does not work well when it is difficult to define operating targets for inflation or   unemployment As we have discussed often in this room, this difficulty may now be   showing up particularly with respect to the unemployment term, given the problems in   identifying the NAIRU One could make a case that the NAIRU is 6, 5, or 4 percent   There are several substitute approaches One is just to drop the unemployment   term from the Taylor Rule, in which case the rule becomes an inflation-targeting rule   Under this modification, the Fed would move against inflation deviations or in the   present circumstances accelerations of inflation Another approach, which I have   championed here, is to go to a change rule Assuming both inflation and unemployment   are in their desired band, the Fed would try to lead the growth in aggregate demand to be   equal to the long-term growth in aggregate supply This rate used to be about 25 percent   per year, but now may be as high as 325 percent if one is a productivity optimist A third   approach is Bob Parry’s nominal GDP standard I haven’t thought about that thoroughly,   but I think most of the time that would give the same suggestion as my change approach     5/18/99 46   Whatever the approach, I felt we were in policymaking equilibrium up to our   last meeting As long as inflation was not accelerating--and it did not seem to be seven   weeks ago--the inflation-targeting approach called for no change in the funds rate As   long as the forecast rate of growth in aggregate demand was under 325 percent, as it was   then, the change approach did not either But seven weeks can make a difference The   recent bad news on the CPI, even if one adjusts for special factors, suggests a possible   acceleration, as do the balance of the Reserve Bank anecdotes  But the news on inflation   suggests only a possible acceleration because the numbers are for only one month and   anecdotes are anecdotes  Yet, there is a definite new inflation threat in the data The   change rule is also pointing differently because the Greenbook growth forecast now   averages slightly above 325 percent until this growth is contained later on by a rise in the   funds rate included in the baseline forecast and by Y2K The Blue Chip forecasters are   even more out of line Their forecast rate of growth is 38 percent, even further above the   long-term trend We focus on the disturbing CPI numbers, but in fact it is true that a   number of additional signs are beginning to point in the direction of a tightening of   policy This reasoning is either based on very recent information or on forecasts, so I   suppose there is some time before we have to act, but not too much As has been pointed   out often in this room, the good recent performance of the economy is no doubt due   partly to a feeling that the Fed will move against inflation We risk losing this credibility   if we tarry too long There are strong arguments for doing something pretty soon,   perhaps a modest step but a clear step The market seems to expect us to and we’d miss   Jack Guynn’s window of opportunity if we didn’t   Let me address one final matter Suppose we move; does this box us in?  If we   were to take the modest step of introducing a tilt, in more than half the recent cases an   upward tilt was not followed by a rise in rates So I don’t interpret that as boxing us in   If we took the more drastic step of actually raising rates, we might find that a bit harder to   undo; but I would still repeat an argument I have made here before, which is that a huge   policymaking advantage for monetary policy is its flexibility We could take advantage   of this flexibility So, I personally do not find the box-in argument very persuasive   Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I’ll support the notion of   instituting a tilt and announcing it I am very glad we established this disclosure   procedure because I think it gives us the ability to communicate more clearly I am   sitting four-fifths of the way from you to Al Broaddus both geographically and   policywise [Laughter] I have something like four-fifths agreement with him and also   with Bill Poole, Cathy Minehan, and Jerry Jordan that we should be raising rates Four-  fifths is not 100 percent so I won’t dissent, but that’s where I am    Actually, Mike Moskow already asked the first half of my   question The second half is--and given your answer to Mike, I’m not saying it’s   necessarily a bad thing--whether there is any risk that we're going to be the insurance   provider of last resort for the whole world if other central banks don’t do something like   this?    What would be the implications of that?    Thank you, Mr Chairman My bottom line today is that I think   the FOMC ought to do what it has to do at this meeting and then leave financial markets   alone for a while, at least until the end of the year What do we have to do?  I would argue   that rates are a bit low from three standpoints Even if labor markets and inflation were in   balance, for the longer run the funds rate might be a bit too low The real interest rate based   on the TIP bonds is now 4 percent; adding a reasonable amount for target inflation puts the   equilibrium funds rate in the mid-5 percent area Even if we assume that there is some   * Secretary’s note Subsequent to the meeting Mr Parry indicated that the 24 percent is the increase in  medical plan premiums and the 238 percent refers to the increase in the dental plan premium  The  weighted average increase for the San Francisco District is 58 percent     8/24/99 65   liquidity premium in the TIP rate, we still get an equilibrium funds rate that is a bit above   the actual funds rate   But labor markets may not be in balance The Greenbook gives scattered, early   evidence of accelerating wage gains The evidence is not only scattered and early but each   particular piece of evidence is debatable Nevertheless, wages do seem to be rising more   rapidly than earlier We can look at labor markets in any number of ways We can compare   NAIRU with actual unemployment rates; we can add in discouraged workers; we can take   all the Beigebook anecdotes I even heard several anecdotes on National Public Radio the   other day They all seem to suggest that labor markets are very, very tight and that wage   gains may finally be accelerating   Even if labor markets were in balance now, they might not stay that way In the   constant funds rate forecast of the Greenbook, which is my favorite, the rate of growth in   aggregate demand after the Y2K quarter averages about 4 percent I think that would be   greater than anybody’s estimate of aggregate supply growth, however enhanced by the   productivity changes And if the forecast is accurate, there would be a further tightening of   labor markets To me, therefore, a number of indicators suggest that the funds rate is a bit   low   Let me make a quick digression on a point that I raised last time about leading   indicators of inflation The ever-responsive staff has looked into this and written a nice   memo--nice, but I must say from my point of view disappointing Indices of leading   indicators had more or less worked up until 1990 but did not predict well at all in the 1990s   Moreover, many of the actual component series are already labor market indicators And   when controlling for these structural model variables, leading indicators are not even close   to being significant predictors of inflation At times a particular series may have predicted a   phenomenon, but as a general rule I must reluctantly admit that that approach doesn’t seem   to help us any   So, to get back to my earlier point, I think we ought to make some adjustment today   But after that--Peter Fisher’s memo thoroughly scared me as I think it probably scared   others--we probably want to have as few moving financial parts as possible as we go toward   the end of the year    I support “C” symmetric, truly symmetric I’ve never studied the   statistical discrepancy and I don’t want to get into the question of whether we ought to be   looking at the income side or the product side; I take no position on that But I do like it   when you talk about this because it makes me less worried about inflation, and I hope   you’re right [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting, I argued that we should   do what we’re going to do with interest rates and, absent jarring new information, leave them alone   until the turn of the year Markets pretty much expect us to do that and I’m reluctant to dissent   from this happy consensus Nevertheless, while the information that has come in since the last   meeting may not qualify as jarring, it is at least disconcerting, and I fear that we may be close to the   time when we have to think about changing policy Most of this disconcerting information is on   the demand side and some of it is based on theories of how the economy is supposed to work Let   me run down the list   First, because of gridlock problems on Capitol Hill, government spending is likely to be   stronger than we had thought Second, consumption seems to be rising at relatively rapid rates and   consumer sentiment is very high, even with a fairly significant stock market correction Third,   investment soared in the third quarter The staff has responded to that development largely by   shifting investment out of the fourth quarter, making the overall forecast only a bit stronger But it   may be that investment demand is just simply stronger than we had thought Fourth, there’s an   increasing upward drift in core inflation That’s partly tied to an unreliable estimate of NAIRU, I   know, but it is augmented by increases in commodity prices, the minimum wage, autoworker   wages, health care costs, and other such factors Fifth, the unemployment rate is forecast to get to a   pretty low level I recognize what Bill McDonough said and I agree that the downward trend in   unemployment is great, but reduced unemployment has to be sustainable And sixth, after the Y2K   quarter, the flat funds rate version of the forecast now has demand growth averaging about 3½   percent, which is rather strong for an economy that begins with already extremely tight labor   markets, even with a change in productivity trends   But in some ways the biggest concern of all is the dollar Let me spend a minute discussing   that Previously, when the United States was growing at healthy rates and most of our trading   partners were dealing with recession, the US trade deficit rose sharply Then we didn’t worry     10/5/99 38   about imbalances After all, our trading partners were getting extra aggregate demand and the   United States was trimming aggregate demand Or from the capital account standpoint, our trading   partners were investing their savings at higher rates of return and we were getting a foreign-  financed investment boom   But now all that is changing and our trading partners are beginning to recover The goods   and services deficit, which is analogous to the primary deficit, is $272 billion this year, 3 percent of   GDP In the Greenbook forecast it rises to $345 billion in 2001, 3½ percent of GDP If we make   the reasonable assumption that foreigners will want to limit the ratio of their assets here to GDP,   this goods and services deficit must at some point drop to zero Actually, it may be even less than   zero if our real interest rate exceeds our GDP growth rate and/or there is modest dollar   depreciation But 3½ percent of GDP is a long way from zero What can bring the US trade   deficit into balance?  The happiest scenario is for foreign GDP to grow more rapidly, but   unfortunately that scenario cannot help much The staff already has trade-weighted foreign real   GDP growth at a 34 percent rate over the forecast horizon and realistically it cannot grow much   faster than that I asked the staff to simulate an extra ½ percent of foreign GDP growth and that   only cut the goods and services deficit by $10 billion in 2001--essentially peanuts That’s not   enough even to eliminate the rise in the ratio of the goods and services deficit to GDP   Another happy scenario would be to get there by low US inflation In the forecast our   inflation rate averages ½ percent below the trade-weighted inflation rate of our trading partners   That does limit the growth in the trade deficit, but it doesn’t restore the balance And it will not   help at all if our inflation rate increases Unfortunately for this calculation, our trading partners   either have had serious recessions or have been very good at fighting inflation, with the   consequence that their inflation rates are already low enough to largely close off this channel   Then we get to less happy scenarios We could reverse the Asian crisis by having a   domestic recession, which I doubt anybody wants The only reasonable and effective way to right   the balance, I’m afraid, is for the dollar to decline by quite a lot--far more than the staff has already   incorporated into the forecast We may consider this a ticking time bomb or merely the inevitable   after-effect of the healthy, stabilizing move in our trade deficit during the Asian crisis   But there are two implications for monetary policy The first is that it’s even more   important than in normal times to stabilize prices  The best way to get the desired change in our   prices relative to foreign prices is price stability here, and we should promote that especially in   adjusting to the international imbalance The second point is that we should remember that the     10/5/99 39   Asian crisis kept a headwind on the US economy That headwind was a force that tended to push   down rates of growth of both aggregate demand and inflation--a nice safety belt should the   economy overheat Now that is over, or at least changing The world economy is rebalancing and   for the next few years that headwind is likely to be replaced by a tailwind that will tend to push up   real growth and US inflation Just when we need low inflation more, it will become harder to   achieve   All of these factors are on the demand side and in principle there could be a productivity   boom sufficient to handle all that demand without rising inflation But for that to happen, the rate   of productivity increase must increase That is, the second derivative of productivity must be   positive, which is a difficult requirement And if it is not met, the economy is in danger of moving   to higher, perhaps accelerating, rates of inflation    Thank you, Mr Chairman First, my students back at Michigan would   be delighted to know that the term “second derivative” has crept into policy discussions   [Laughter] I compliment you on that!   On your criticism of models, I’ll plead guilty to thinking for a long time in terms of   matching aggregate demand with fixed or predictable levels of aggregate supply There is nothing   engraved on a stone tablet that says that’s the way to do it I believe you’re right that we ought to   get out of the box, if you will, and think about new ways to view the economy I will try to do that   It’s possible that we are on the verge of some kind of shift not only in economic outcomes, but also   in the way of thinking about economics That’s a reasonable point to put on the table   In terms of more immediate policy considerations, I’m not totally against waiting to see   what happens I would make two points One is that it is harder to raise the funds rate than to   lower it Secondly, in my heart--even with what I just said about new ways of thinking about   economics--I would be more comfortable with a higher funds rate than the one we have now, in   case we’re wrong about the second derivative issue I make no bones about that I’m delighted to   see that there seems to be a growing consensus that if we have to act, we could act in November   It’s important to get that on the table because I believe we might have to act in November   In terms of what we do today, I have a preference for what I’ll call straightforward   asymmetry I’ll give three reasons for that The first is that these are the rules that we agreed to   live by and it’s not a good idea to change the procedures until we’ve gone through the process of   considering various alternatives, which is a process we are going through I don’t think that boxes   us in It has been pointed out statistically that asymmetry has been followed by rate increases less   than half the time in the recent past So I really don’t accept the argument that asymmetry boxes us   in As a general matter, I think we have a tendency to try to do too much with language and I   would prefer the more straightforward approach of “B” asymmetric     10/5/99 62    And announcing it    I yield What’s your suggestion?  [Laughter]     11/16/99 60    You all are getting the impression that this was a very divisive   group I would note to start with that we did all agree on each of the first nine points [Laughter]   On the point where we had trouble, I’m with the majority I favor alternative I I think the point   about keeping the finger a little farther from the trigger is a factor but, as several people   mentioned, since the market knows how to read these statements, in the end there isn’t a whole   lot of difference between the two alternatives I suppose I favor alternative I because this   sentence will usually be a part of a broader discussion about what we are up to and why--of the   sort that we just talked about today It strikes me that when there is a choice in language, we at   the Fed always go for the understated, terse form and I would like to continue in that tradition   There is slightly less risk of misleading people the fewer words we say I like the understated   approach and I would like to keep the distinction between how we see the balance of risks and   what we are likely to do So, I’m more comfortable with alternative I    Thank you, Mr Chairman Using orthodox reasoning, I think a   case for tightening policy at this meeting could be made fairly readily The flat funds rate   version of the Greenbook forecast has aggregate demand growing at a rate of nearly 5 percent in   this half year and nearly 4 percent for the next two years Starting from a position where labor   markets are already very tight, this demand growth is even more than the upgraded estimate of   potential GDP growth It represents a little too much demand pressure even for our new   economy and would seem to call for a tightening of policy to trim some of this pressure   But at the last meeting, Mr Chairman, you challenged us to think about the economy   in new ways I’m afraid I don’t have a new way of thinking about aggregate demand and   aggregate supply, but there is a new way to think about monetary policy--one that we have not   talked about much in this room but one that is sweeping the globe outside of this room It is   inflation targeting, a monetary approach that I’m told is now being used in 44 countries In most   of these countries inflation targeting has seemed to be successful in controlling inflation And in   many of them it has seemed to be successful in limiting output variation as well     11/16/99 35   First, on inflation targeting itself, one can get to it through a fairly logical progression   The idea of monetary targeting ran into difficulty because of shocks in liquidity demand These   shocks made it difficult to interpret the growth of the monetary aggregates Did growth mean   that the economy was overheating or simply that there was an upward shift in demand for   liquidity?  The next step was to move to nominal income targeting, an approach that many still   favor But again there are shocks, this time from productivity If nominal income is growing   rapidly, does that mean that the economy is overheating or simply that productivity has risen?   Given these shocks, one might reasonably conclude that the central bank should target inflation   directly Inflation is what we are trying to stabilize, so we should just stabilize it   One could use either a model or a non-model approach for inflation targeting In the   present circumstances, the Greenbook model approach clearly suggests tightening policy   Acceleration of inflation occurs gradually in the flat funds rate version of the Greenbook forecast   and it would take a fairly emphatic tightening of policy to stop it As we all know, this occurs   because the economy is now operating below the Greenbook’s estimate of NAIRU To be sure,   there is growing professional doubt about this estimate In early 1997, Staiger, Stock, and   Watson had a piece in the Journal of Economic Prospectives in which they estimated a   confidence band for NAIRU that ranged from 43 to 73 percent so that unemployment was not   found to be a particularly good predictor of future inflation Recently, a paper by Brainard and   Perry built in coefficients that follow a random walk through time and are not constrained to   revert to any particular level This procedure gives estimates of NAIRU that are even below   present unemployment rates These papers are controversial, but that’s just the point It may   make sense to look for other ways to target inflation   Turning to nonstructural approaches, these can be preemptive if there are lags in   monetary policy In that event, nonstructural approaches would involve finding leading   indicators or other forecasts of inflation and having the Fed move on the basis of their signals   Unfortunately, there are not many good leading indicators One that I will call the “pipeline”   indicator is the core PPI The latest numbers for that index are not very reassuring; the core PPI   is growing at an annual rate of about 6 percent Mike Prell cautioned us earlier not to look only   at the core but at the total PPI I don’t have that figure here, but it would similarly be not very   reassuring Given the likely fall in the dollar and the strength in world commodity prices, not all   of which are reflected in the core PPI, there could be even more price pressure in the pipeline     11/16/99 36   It’s always risky to generalize from a few monthly numbers, but I would still consider these data   as suggesting that policy should be tightened   A further approach might be to look at the inflation forecasts of others The   Greenbook Part II has useful information on this on page II-34 For the past three years now, the   consumer surveys by Michigan have expected a rise in inflation, meaning that their forecast of   inflation has been above current rates On the other hand, their median forecast of inflation is   now no higher than it was two years ago, indicating that they may not be fully current on the   impact of supply shocks, tight labor markets, and so forth It’s hard to know whether to read this   as a forecast of rising inflation or stable inflation  Things should be clearer for the professional   forecaster, but they are not Those surveyed by the Philadelphia Fed also have expected more   inflation than actually occurred for the past few years Again, these forecasters have not raised   their forecasts in recent months It is sometimes argued that that is because they expect the Fed   to stabilize inflation But these forecasters have also built into their forecasts only a very slight   rise in short-term interest rates, as have the Blue Chip forecasters, which could be a partially   overlapping group The Blue Chip forecasters do not look for a particularly big rise in inflation   and they seem to be forecasting that the Fed will only have to tighten policy very slightly to   prevent this rise In the end the forecasts of inflation do not help us much, though there may be a   very weak vote for tightening policy   Where does all this leave us? To me, the structural model approach to inflation   targeting suggests rather clearly that we ought to tighten The pipeline approach suggests the   same somewhat clearly, and the approach of consulting other forecasters gives only a weak vote   While the intensity varies, all indicators do point in one direction, however, and I am inclined to   think we should point that way, too    I support your recommendations of a 25 basis point increase and a   symmetric directive Let me say one thing about process At the November meeting Bill   McDonough mentioned the awkward timing of our regular December meeting and Bob Parry   just intimated a concern about that also So, at some point we might look at the meeting   schedule The late December meeting doesn’t seem to help us much and there might be a better     11/16/99 54   way to arrange our meeting schedule so that we wouldn’t be making policy for such a long   period of time I think that’s something that whoever does the schedule might take into account   Let me also comment on your economic model, which I liked because it’s a good way   to tie together two imbalances that we often talk about, the labor market imbalance and the   saving/investment imbalance It strikes me that there are at least two implications from that   One is that given the saving/investment imbalance, there is a very natural reason why we ought   to look for increases in long-term interest rates even apart from what we do at this table The   Greenbook touched on this, and I think it’s something that we ought to talk about more The   second is that tying together the two imbalances may actually uncover a reason why we haven’t   seen more inflation There are two ways that the steam can escape Until now we’ve had a   situation where the steam could come out in a very high level of imports and trade deficit As   that becomes less true, we might have to worry even more about inflation But going back to the   issue on the table, I support your recommendation    I’ve been for Option 1 by a close margin all along and I still am   I think Bill Poole and Larry Meyer have put their case very well, but I still like Option 1   Let me make three points   To me the biggest point all along has been what we are calling the “trigger” issue   That involves our standing back from policy changes a bit--being understated and letting the   market make its interpretation but not predicting future developments that will not   necessarily materialize That has been the major issue to me throughout these deliberations   On Bill Poole’s point 2, regarding an implied Phillips curve framework, I don’t think   this language means at all that the FOMC is a captive of Phillips curves The wording that   Mike Kelley worked out, which is on page 5 of Roger’s memo, tries to make it a little     12/21/99 67   clearer that the issue is not so much that we believe the Phillips curve but that price stability   and sustainable economic growth are our mandates   On the “talking in code” issue, I don’t consider it speaking in code if we say exactly   what we’re thinking at any particular point In fact, that’s one thing I find attractive about   the balance-of-risks language So I am still in the Option 1 camp, though Bill and Larry   have weakened my resolve a bit    I think it might be helpful to take each of the matters separately    Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me use my time to make some   longer-term suggestions about how we should be operating, elaborating on some comments   that I made earlier Herb Stein once said something that comes close to capturing the   essence of economics “Things that can’t go on, won’t” What economists are good at, if   anything, is putting together different logical postulates demand, supply, arbitrage   conditions, relationships between stocks and flows, and predictions of the way economies   are likely to operate In the end, economic forecasts rely on interactions between such basic   logical assumptions   As I think about my two years on this Committee, much of what has happened   refutes Stein’s quote Things that couldn’t go on, have gone right on! [Laughter] They   may not do so forever, but they have continued much longer than anybody has forecast The     12/21/99 35   first example is labor markets Since I’ve been here we have been talking about very tight   labor markets as indicated by the unemployment rate, other measures of labor tightness, and   Beigebook reports We have all felt that at some point wages would start to accelerate but   as yet they really haven’t--apart from some of the caveats that Mike Prell gave earlier The   second example is the stock market Again, it has been seemingly overvalued since I’ve   been here, but to this point stock prices have risen on balance The third example is the   dollar, which for a while now has seemingly been overvalued, if there is any limit at all on   the accumulation by foreigners of dollar-denominated assets But it is not yet falling At   the intellectual level we should, of course, keep studying these matters to see if we can   improve our understanding of how the economy is operating But studying and learning   take time and in the meantime we have to know how to set monetary policy   As I mentioned last time, an approach that may help us in these particular   circumstances is inflation targeting, which is being adopted on a pervasive basis around the   world Last time--I suppose in a fit of exuberance--I reported being told that the number of   countries now using inflation targeting was 44 I have since tried to verify that total and   could only come up with 30 And even that number counts the EU as 11 [Laughter]   SPEAKER(?) So, it’s only 20!    That’s right Perhaps it’s only 20 The adoption of inflation   targeting is not as widespread as I said earlier, but it’s still widespread And it has worked   well where it has been tried, as documented by a number of research papers Perhaps more   telling, no country that I know of has tried inflation targeting and then abandoned it   What many academics like about inflation targeting is that it gives policy a nominal   anchor and improves transparency and credibility Those are important values But I’d like   to put inflation targeting on our table for a different reason It seems to me that it would   work well when we are facing just the sort of economic uncertainties that I mentioned   above First of all, when there are either productivity or competitive shocks in labor   markets and wages just don’t seem to be rising in the way forecast, inflation targeting   permits us to follow the policy of watchful waiting we often talk about Just what are we   waiting for?  It is really to see signs of an acceleration of inflation, in which case we can   react by making appropriate policy changes     12/21/99 36   Another uncertainty that inflation targeting permits us to finesse is that of deciding   just what our target rate of inflation is Around the world, most inflation-targeting countries   do have fairly specific quantitative targets I’m not sure that this group could agree on a   precise inflation target, but I don’t think we have to agree What I think we can all agree on   is that we should move against an acceleration of inflation In effect, this pragmatic form of   inflation targeting, where we move against an acceleration of inflation, may provide us a   reasonable framework for thinking about monetary policy in the presence of either   productivity or competitive shocks   But even this pragmatic form of inflation targeting has one important difficulty The   big difficulty I see is in acting preemptively, which I think is necessary if we really are to   stabilize inflation at present low levels In order to act preemptively we must be able to   forecast inflation, and that can present a problem We could rely on modeling approaches to   forecast inflation, but these have not been very successful precisely because of the supply   shocks that have made the inflation-targeting approach attractive We could rely on leading   indicators, but there aren’t many reliable leading indicators that are not already considered   in models We could rely on the forecasts of inflation of others, but those other forecasters   may have the same trouble with their models or their leading indicators that we have   I do think we could make some headway here, but it’s not easy to do so If we were   to go through a pragmatic inflation-targeting exercise today, I think we would find that   some added tightening might soon become necessary, though we might be able to delay for   a short time But stepping back from these specifics, I think an important early challenge   for us is to learn how to deal effectively with the economic uncertainties, perhaps by   inflation targeting or perhaps in some other way Thank you    I’m for asymmetry It is a close call and I could live with either   But I think asymmetry is a more honest description of where the Committee is at this point   I find the grammar of the asymmetric language a little simpler There are fewer words like   “however,” “nonetheless,” and so forth It’s a little more direct and I like that I’m also   persuaded by the fact that it is more in line with what economists think we will do And if   our objective is to not change markets, that wording is telling them that   I know you said we shouldn’t make wording changes, but let me suggest just one I   would say a smooth transition “into” rather than “to” the year 2000 to show that we are not   holding steady only for another nine days     I think it is more than several weeks for me!     I am in favor of a thorough study, overseen on a consultative basis   by a subcommittee of the FOMC  I think we are in a difficult position  Frankly, I have nothing   wise to add on this, but I do have a question  As I understand it, the problem with getting more   into the repo market, which gets us into the agency market, is that we do not in any way want to   reinforce the so-called federal subsidy  That is the real risk  And, as I understand it, that’s the   Treasury's problem  There is municipal debt out there, which apparently is part of our legal   authority to purchase  But if we got into that market, either through outright purchases or using   such debt as collateral for repos, wouldn’t that generate a similar kind of subsidy for the state and   local market?  There is already a tax subsidy in that area, so doesn't that make the whole problem   a lot worse?  Am I missing something?     In the end the amount of subsidy we give depends in part, I   presume, on the size of the market, right?  If we're buying or holding as collateral just a tiny   proportion of a given type of obligation, the subsidy is much less     So, when you and Don and whoever else get into this, I think a   relevant number to determine and consider might be the amount of the subsidies--if you can   convert them into basis points--given that we cannot be total purists and we're going to have to   subsidize something  What I am a little at sea about is exactly how important the subsidy is,   given that there is going to be some subsidy  As I say, I have no answers  But I think that is the   question unless somebody can persuade me otherwise     I have no problem with that  I think it is a good resolution of the   issue  But I have a question, and that is  Who says what to the public about this?     Could I interrupt?  One of you is looking at the difference   between the simulation and the baseline; the other is looking at the year-to-year changes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the past few meetings I have run   through an inflation targeting exercise to see what that would show  Today I will give just a   quick summary  The model approach from the Greenbook clearly indicates that a tightening of   policy is necessary to stabilize inflation at present levels  The pipeline approach, focusing   mainly on unit labor costs, is ambiguous because the sharp recent rise of productivity has   actually caused unit labor costs to decline  In the past I have referred to the PPI as another              - 64 -     pipeline measure but I have had some communication indicating that that measure actually does   not forecast very well, so perhaps we should not give it much focus   As was true at the time of our last meeting, the Blue Chip forecasters are not   predicting much increase in inflation  But, as with the Greenbook forecast, they get to that by   assuming higher short-term rates, showing that they really think monetary policy has to be   tightened to avoid accelerating inflation  For the first time in a number of years the Michigan   consumers have begun expecting higher inflation, but that change may not be wholly indicative   because these consumers may be ones who have just filled up their SUVs with expensive gas!    The Treasury bond market has also revised its outlook for inflation and is now indicating   somewhat less future inflation, as measured by the spread between the nominal and 10-year real   Treasury rates  But this declining spread may not be wholly indicative either, because nominal   rates have been influenced by the Treasury’s buyback program, perhaps more than real rates     The overall story is roughly the same as it has been for a while now  Some inflation   targeting approaches suggest that policy should be tightened; some do not  In the end I suppose I   favor a model approach, and for about a year now that approach has clearly suggested that   tightening is in order  That carries the day for me  One can buttress the case by looking at what   I will call an equilibrium approach  In a true equilibrium growth model with real interest rates of   about 4 percent and stable inflation at about a 2 percent rate, nominal interest rates, short and   long, should be in the vicinity of 6 percent  A bit more tightening would get us to that level    Were we to lean against the wind because of the upside inflation risk, we would have to do more   tightening than that   To me the real question is  How much more?  Are we looking toward a whole series   of rate increases as in the Greenbook scenario or just a few more?  Yogi Berra once said that              - 65 -     predicting is hard, especially about the future  [Laughter]  Ignoring Yogi’s caution, let me   hazard a few comments   As far as I can tell, the amount of leaning against the wind we are likely to have to do   depends on the answer to three questions  One is whether the economy's unemployment rate is   now near NAIRU  The second is whether the productivity shock will be sustained and, indeed,   whether there will be increases in the rate of increase--the second derivative issue to which the   Chairman has often referred  The third is whether the supply impact of any productivity change   will outweigh the demand effect  If the answer to each question is “yes,” we may not have to   raise rates much more to stabilize inflation  And I actually think there is a chance that the   answer to all of the questions is “yes”   We have talked about NAIRU a lot here and I have nothing to add this morning other   than that if the economy’s unemployment rate were seriously below NAIRU, I think we would   have seen more acceleration in inflation by now  The second question involves the S curve that   the Chairman has talked about  While I’m certainly no expert in that area, it is obvious that the   combination of computers and the Internet does open up vast new technological possibilities    And the economy could very well be at the bottom foothill, or whatever we want to call it, of the   S curve, with more positive productivity shocks to come  Governor Meyer raised the third   question about demand and supply at the last meeting, and while I don't have any verdict on it, I   have been thinking about that issue  It strikes me that any productivity shock should, if foreseen,   raise expected earnings and actual stock valuations before the shock is felt in real output   changes  Hence, I would think that any particular productivity shock would be greeted by an   initial rise in the wealth/income ratio, followed by a reversion to normal as the shock raises the   growth of income  Therefore, it seems likely, or at least possible, that the demand effect could              - 66 -     be large relative to the supply effect right away, but that the supply effect would dominate over   time  If we have S curve productivity and at least some market forecast of this productivity,   things get much more complicated because demand keeps on shooting up and supply may not be   able to catch up  Pessimistically one could read this as saying that S curve productivity really   will not help inflation even in the short run  Optimistically one could read it as saying that soon   the supply impact will catch up and dominate the demand effect   This uncertainty more than anything else brings me around to the merits of what I will   call our “tip-toeing strategy”  As we sit here today, policy should be tightened, perhaps fairly   noticeably  But there has been both rapid and increasing productivity change and that on balance   has seemed to damp inflation in the recent past  Should the favorable trends continue, we may   not have to be raising rates for very much longer  Should they not continue--and, of course, we   have to be alert to that possibility--we may have to raise rates much more  What we have to do   in the short run seems pretty clear to me  What we may have to do in the long run does not seem   clear at all  Thank you     I support the recommendations  I'll admit to Bill and others that I   have had private mental dalliances with 50 basis points, but I'll get over it  [Laughter]  On the   other hand, I have to say to Don that he was so convincing about the case for moving 50 basis   points today that I actually thought for a moment that he might even believe it!  [Laughter]     You're obviously not a Catholic!  [Laughter]     I have two questions for Peter  First, on page 15 of his   handout, what is the difference between the $178 billion and the $887 billion?  In effect is it a   reserve in case the surplus is larger than we think?  How do we interpret that gap?     So this really should be interpreted as a measure of how long   you can follow the policies you are describing?     My second question relates to the on-the-run/off-the-run issue    Is there some reason we haven't done that before?  It seems like a logical idea      18    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Some members of the Committee   have discussed our monetary policy in terms of real interest rates--that if productivity shocks   raise real interest rates, we must raise nominal interest rates a like amount to avoid flooding   the economy with liquidity  While I cannot quarrel with this argument qualitatively, as a   quantitative matter I think this line of thinking can mislead us  If we follow this line, as I   work it out we have already raised nominal interest rates more than is necessary to contain   inflation  Since I don't believe that, let me argue against that particular way of rationalizing   tighter monetary policy     To see what the real interest rate reasoning suggests, one needs a model of how   productivity shocks affect long-run real interest rates  It is a bit complicated to work that out    And since Governor Meyer and I are both getting a little old to solve equilibrium growth   models, we farmed out a request to the staff to investigate the matter  The memo the staff   prepared in response showed that in a closed economy in long-run equilibrium there is indeed   a relationship in theory  The most familiar case is where consumers are farsighted and   rational and can anticipate future income growth  In these circumstances consumption is   sensitive both to real interest rates and expected growth rates; and in the long run real interest      58  rates do in fact rise one-for-one with the expected growth rates  The rationality assumptions   in such a case are strong  The memo also worked out the model with more simple-minded   consumers following either a Keynesian consumption function or that function augmented   with a net worth term  In these cases consumption is relatively inelastic with respect to   interest rates but the growth shock shifts up investment demand and still raises interest rates,   this time slightly more than one-for-one, though in these cases the outcomes depend on   empirically estimated parameters   While these results seem clear enough, they are long run and assume a closed   economy  As for the long run, it does take a long time to establish these equilibria, perhaps a   decade or more  There could be many dynamic movements upward or downward in the   meantime  In an open economy, equilibrium real interest rates have to be the same around the   world  Suppose the productivity shock is not shared around the world, as by and large it does   not seem to be currently  In that case, the United States will just import capital and see its   own real interest rate eventually driven back to the relatively fixed world level, unless the   United States is important enough to raise interest rates throughout the whole world   The   result is much less change in domestic real interest rates than in the closed economy case--  indeed, perhaps no change at all and a big importation of capital     For what it is worth, actual data seem more consistent with the open economy   scenario with the importation of capital that we have talked about often in these meetings    The behavior of current account deficits without the depreciation of the dollar is perfectly   consistent with the productivity shock occurring mainly in the United States  On the rate side,   since the beginning of the productivity shock the TIP rate has gone up by only about 40 basis   points, much less than we would be predicting in the closed economy model  Some measures      59  of inflation-corrected interest rates have changed more, but I think that is because the nominal   part of the Fisher equation has responded more than the lagged inflation part of the equation    That's Irving Fisher!  [Laughter]   The point of going into all of this is a negative one  As I said above, I don't think   the real interest rate link is a good line of reasoning for us to use in our present deliberations    Whatever the case in equilibrium closed economy models, the Committee is confronted with   an earlier challenge that of stabilizing inflation  If we tried to justify our action in long-run   terms, some theorist out there would find us out and blow the whistle, especially since we   have already raised nominal interest rates more than would be predicted by these theoretical   conditions  I think we should instead focus on the narrower short-term goal of stabilizing   inflation, letting nominal and real interest rates eventually find their proper long-term levels     This line of thinking leads me back to the inflation targeting approach I have   trumpeted for the past few meetings and one that you are probably getting sick of hearing   about  From this point of view, we want to keep the inflation rate stable and we should just do   whatever it takes to achieve that  In this regard, I would note that the situation has worsened   in the last month because inflation may actually be beginning to increase, implying that our   inflation fighting policies will have to be more forceful than would otherwise be the case    This reasoning is reinforced by the Greenbook analysis  Because of the amply discussed new   momentum in both consumption and investment, now we have to get the funds rate into the   mid-7 percent area fairly quickly to stabilize inflation  Even the baseline forecast where the   funds rate is rising to 725 percent does not quite do that   Many of you have doubted this forecast because of skepticism about the Greenbook   analysis and forecast  There are grounds for such skepticism but other indicators are not      60  much more reassuring this time around  The pipeline measure of inflation, unit labor costs, is   now beginning to rise partly because the first-quarter productivity change was a bit soft and   partly because wages also seem to be growing more rapidly  The lack of a further   productivity pickup in the first quarter was mildly disappointing, but that might also serve as a   reality check because we have been relying on productivity to rescue us from scattered   inflation warnings and maybe now we should take these warnings a bit more seriously   Unlike the case at our recent meetings, other forecasters also have inflation   increasing at least in the short term  The Blue Chip forecasters are predicting a rise in short-  term inflation and have raised that forecast in recent months  They also get that forecast by   assuming higher short-term interest rates, showing that they really think monetary policy has   to be tightened to avoid accelerating long-term inflation  The Michigan consumers have   recently begun expecting higher short-term inflation, as have the Philadelphia Fed forecasters   and various NAPM, NFIB, and NABE surveys  The Treasury bond market has also switched   and is now indicating somewhat more future long-term inflation as measured by the   increasing spread between the nominal and real 10-year Treasury rates  All approaches   suggest that tightening is needed and all have changed from a month ago in the direction of   expecting higher inflation  I think there is more pressure on us than there was a month ago   Lastly, a strong argument for our policy of gradualism has been that it was expected   by financial markets  Now that, too, may be changing  From the fed funds futures market one   can compute a two-thirds probability that we will abandon our gradualist policy at this   meeting  These results are confirmed by direct surveys of Fed watchers  Unlike the recent   past, financial markets seem to be expecting us to move more forcefully against inflation,      61  which opens up a window of opportunity for us to do just that  From all of this you can   probably tell where I would come out on policy today  Thank you very much     I support both parts of your recommendation as well, Mr   Chairman  I think we have to get rates higher and that aggregate demand and aggregate   supply are just not balanced  There is still tremendous momentum on the up side and I think   the balance of risks is still on that side  I do believe that at some point, perhaps not far from   now, that Jerry Jordan will be right and the risks will begin to tip toward our overshooting    But if we have to respond to that, we can  For right now, I don't see it  I still think we have to   go 50 basis points, with asymmetric language       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Usually at these meetings we are   appropriately forward-looking, but today I would like to try something different  I want to look back   into the past to see if we can learn anything, and in my comments I am going to refer to a table that   is being passed around 2   The great American inflation started in mid-to-late 1966  While policymakers and   analysts did not have a core PCE index at the time, we can construct one in hindsight  It shows that   the core PCE was quite stable until the first part of 1966 before beginning a stair-step upward pattern   where it rose for a while, stabilized, and rose more before the climb eventually ended in double-digit   levels  Other indicators of inflation that were then available followed a roughly similar pattern     We know from Orphanides’ work that both policymakers and analysts generally felt that   the unemployment rate target--in deference to Governor Ferguson’s wife, this was before the   NAIRU concept was invented--was around 4 percent  Basically, policymakers felt the NAIRU was   4 percent; it turned out to be a lot higher, and policy proved to be excessively expansionary  One   could make a superficial comparison to today  Today the FOMC is behaving as if NAIRU is around   4 percent despite warnings that it is higher from the Greenbook, from some private economists, and   indeed from some members of this Committee  The question then becomes whether the FOMC   might now be making the same mistake that it made back in the 1960s  I for one have consistently   had private guilt feelings that we could be  Hence I want to look backwards and see what the   evidence says                                                       2 A copy of the table used by Mr Gramlich is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 2)       59  The table that you should have by now gives some numbers that compare the change in   various key inflation indicators between early 1965 and late 1966 in the first column and between   Q2 1999 and Q2 2000 in the second column  In making this comparison I do not mean to criticize   the FOMC of the 1960s  We have several important advantages today  We have better diagnostic   data, we have fiscal policy working to fight inflation, and we don't have presidential criticism of   interest rate increases  I make this comparison simply to examine similarities and differences from   the earlier period when we know that inflation took off    The table suggests the following  In the earlier period the core PCE, which as I said has   been reconstructed from hindsight, went up by about a point in about a year’s time  Now it has risen   by just one-third of that  We have discussed the reasons for the recent rise, and at least at this point I   think there is agreement that relatively little of this rise reflects true acceleration  Unit labor costs   rose sharply in the earlier period largely because of a sharp rise in wages  Productivity actually went   up slightly at that time  In the recent period, we know that unit labor costs have been dropping, with   a slight rise in wages more than offset by a sharp rise in productivity  In the Michigan survey 1-year   inflation expectations rose by two points in the earlier period and by one-fifth of that now  But even   these 1-year expectations could be misleading for the recent period because long-term 10-year   inflation expectations have been very stable, a series that was not available back then  Nominal 10-  year Treasury rates rose by 8 basis points then and 20 basis points now  But a more meaningful   measure is the spread between nominal and real 10-year yields, up just 10 basis points in the recent   period  Again this nominal-real spread could not be measured back in the mid-1960s  This   backward look shows that in many respects the earlier period looked just as one would expect in a   world where inflation was gradually increasing         60  In each of these respects, the recent period looks very different  The FOMC may be   making a mistake now  We obviously can’t yet claim the contrary, but the risk that inflation is   accelerating seems far less now than it did back in 1966  My policy advice follows from this   analysis  Our earlier rate increases, along with other factors, seem to have slowed the growth of   aggregate demand to roughly acceptable levels  Whether we should be tightening further depends   on whether we think the unemployment rate is below NAIRU or that product and goods markets are   too tight  Markets clearly seem to have been too tight in the mid-1960s  If we should see evidence   indicating that situation now, in anything like the form that existed during the mid-1960s, I’d be the   first in line to argue for tightening policy  But at this point I feel the evidence is simply not there    For now, as at the last meeting, I’m comfortable just watching the situation until we see more   evidence that inflation is accelerating  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation  I think   Larry Meyer made a useful cautioning remark that given the productivity shock, we are benefiting   from a little good luck, if you will, on inflation  It is different from the good luck we had in 1998 but   it is good luck  And we should keep that in mind and be alert  I have always argued for being as alert   as we can possibly be  But luck comes in all shapes  I don't want to overdo the nostalgia bit, but I   can remember times when oil prices went up about as much as they have in the last couple of years   and the inflation situation was far worse than it is now  I can remember investment booms like we          81   are having now and the inflation situation was far worse  So, if we really take this situation apart, we   might see that we also have some forces working in the direction of high inflation that we may be   under appreciating  I don't want to push that theme too hard and I think we should remain vigilant    But when we talk about luck, it is easy to count the things on one side of the fence and not the things   on the other side of the fence     Could I just raise one point?  I think the statement is fine  I don’t want   to talk about that  My point is that increasingly on TV programs we are seeing comparisons of what          85   we said at the last meeting and what we are saying today  I wonder if it’s possible, since some of us   don’t remember exactly what the press statement said after the last meeting, if we could have a little   reminder of the changes made in the statement?     I don’t know if anyone else feels this way, but if market observers are   going to start looking at exactly how we change a comma from last time, I guess I want to know   about it     I may just not remember     Tom, on Exhibit 2--and let me stick to fiscal policy B just for the sake   of simplicity--in the top panel you basically worked that off the budget forecast and the 25 percent   limit to compute our Treasury holdings?     Then in the bottom two panels you put that together with your   estimates of currency demand to compute what other assets have to be on the balance sheet to   finance the currency demand and make this all work  So it is a combination of your fiscal policy   assumptions and your currency assumptions, right?      89    Okay  Anyway, these two things are going on  We have declining   Treasury debt, of which we are taking a share, and we have rising currency demand  So then we   have these alternative assets that have to get huge in a few years  I take it what you're telling us is   that we don't yet know what these alternative assets are  Is that for other parts of the study?  That   was my question  I kept looking for that [laughter] and I assume that's your next installment     The fun stuff is still to come!     I know!  I think we all know it's a big animal  I just wondered   whether it has stripes or spots     I’d like to second Bill Poole’s compliment of the Greenbook, not only   on the material on oil prices, but also on the simulations with alternative NAIRU and productivity   assumptions  I know you’ve done these before in the Bluebook and elsewhere, but with the potential   shocks that are possible now I think it makes sense to put these types of exercises in the category of   things that are done all the time  With the simulations now being elevated to page I-15 of the   Greenbook, I think we’re getting closer to that  And I think that’s good     Also, going to half years doesn’t seem like a big deal  We’ve always been able to flip   over to the green pages and get the quarterly numbers, but only for the baseline  And if one is   interested in the effects of a set of assumptions, it’s much more informative to have half years than   full years  And thirdly, I liked the extension of the forecast horizon  We know that it’s hard to   forecast two years out, but a lot of what we worry about here is in the drift  And often we really   can’t see that if the forecast just goes ahead another six quarters  This extension makes the drift in   the forecast very apparent  So in all senses--both the oil price analysis and the productivity/NAIRU   simulations--this Greenbook was to me much more informative than some of the earlier ones     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Using what I’ll call a level test, I think   that overall monetary policy is roughly in balance  With real interest rates in the neighborhood of 4   percent, minimal term premiums, and a core inflation rate of about 2 percent, the equilibrium funds   rate should be in the neighborhood of 6 percent  Adding in a slight premium to cover the balance of   risks leads to the present funds rate of 6-1/2 percent, a rate that seems about right for today’s   conditions  Perhaps the biggest question is whether we should eliminate our upward bias  One   could argue for that by noting that the prospective growth of final demand really has slowed quite   sharply from earlier in the year  At this rate, it may not be too long before I join Tom Hoenig in   thinking that the risks have become evenly balanced  Yet at this point I think that such a change in   our posture is still premature  I still believe that the fundamental risks of inflation are on the up side   and I would like to retain our present policy stance at least for a while   I have reached that conclusion for five reasons  Let me try to give them quickly  One is   prudence  In this day when fiscal policymakers seem to be throwing prudence to the wind,   somebody has to stress limits and the importance of stable prices  That may as well be us  The      65  second is NAIRU  I have often mentioned my suspicion that NAIRU could be as low as the 4   percent featured in the Greenbook simulation  I do like the outcome of that simulation and I think it   is at least somewhat likely  But a suspicion that NAIRU is low is not the same as proof, and the   better part of valor says that we should move cautiously before effectively rejecting the standard   estimate of NAIRU  Third is investment  There is still a very strong investment boom in progress    Historically when investment has been this strong for this long, inflation has ensued  I suspect it   may not this time around for reasons we have often discussed, but again suspicion is not the same as   proof  Fourth is productivity  To the extent that wages have lagged the productivity change, there   has been downward pressure on unit labor costs, upward pressure on the dollar, and downward   pressure on import prices  But as wages catch up to the productivity increase--an event that seems   likely at some point--many of the inflation-reducing benefits of the productivity shock could erode    The last reason is energy  We’ve talked about that plenty and I won’t elaborate, but it’s certainly an   upside risk   In all these ways I think the fundamental risks of inflation are still on the up side  In the   long run I believe our operational answer to this set of circumstances is forward-looking, flexible,   inflation targeting, a type of approach I’ve tried to describe in previous meetings  In the shorter run,   in terms of what we should do today, I have a shorter answer no change     I support the recommendation     I have two technical comments about the simulation occasioned   by the last discussion  I’ve had trouble since I’ve been here with the baseline assumption on the   federal funds rate  It’s not quite a flat funds rate, though that simulation is presented  It’s not   quite anything, and it is hard to know just exactly what it does mean  One thing Dave just said,   which I probably should have thought of before now but hadn’t, is that this assumption may   essentially be a flat real funds rate  It may not be far off from that  So one thing that might help   us understand this could be an explanatory footnote--I’m not necessarily going to ask for another   simulation because there are a lot already--on how the baseline funds rate assumption compares   with a flat real funds rate  That might be helpful in just understanding what the monetary   assumption is   My second comment is that I don’t know if you’ve ever actually done a funds rate   assumption that features the market’s assessment  Have you?  I don’t know                 24        But again, maybe if you have an easier policy simulation, or   something like that, there could be a footnote on just how this set of assumptions corresponds   with the funds rate path from the futures market     But, of course, it’s the same market that is generating the futures   market and the stock market  In a way that kind of problem makes it more difficult to interpret   the present baseline     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are times when it is relatively   easy to be a central banker and times when it is relatively hard  It is easy when there are positive   supply shocks and we have the luxury of choosing between lower inflation and lower   unemployment  It can also be easy when all the world knows what should be done and all we   have to do is to follow through  Unfortunately, we seem to be approaching a time when neither   condition is filled  First, as wages catch up with productivity, this source of positive supply   shock could soon start to wane  To that is added the significant negative supply shock of the rise   in oil prices  And while the dollar is high now, almost every logical consideration and every               63      other forecast has it going down  This means that while the earlier positive productivity shocks   are petering out, the economy is forced to digest higher oil prices and could get hit with another   negative supply shock in the form of a dropping dollar  That in turn leads to a set of   unfavorable, or certainly less favorable, policy choices combined with considerable uncertainty   about the underlying risks   On the one side, we are by no means out of the woods on inflation risk  The economy   is still digesting the sharp rise in oil prices  And some combination of that, the wage response to   productivity shocks, and tight labor markets is giving faint signals that inflation is worsening    The current-method core CPI has risen noticeably in the last year and the core PCE has picked   up slightly  While some pickup in these indices might be expected since the rise in oil prices   cannot be entirely purged, these developments are still worrisome   On the wage side, hourly compensation from the ECI has picked up and average   hourly earnings have risen slightly  Some increase might be expected here as well because our   more productive workers will at some point get paid more  But these developments are   worrisome too  Thankfully, long-term measures of inflation expectations have not worsened, but   short-term measures have to some degree  We might summarize all of this in medical terms by   saying that with labor markets this tight there is a continuing chronic risk of higher inflation     But on the other side, the economy is slowing quite noticeably  The staff has cut its   forecast growth of demand from last meeting, particularly investment demand, which has been a   very important factor in the expansion  It is possible that the investment boom could soon be   over  Consumption is holding up but the stock market has been flat or down for a while now, the   personal saving rate is negative, and it would not take much for consumption to begin softening                64      Moreover, stock prices could decline further, as earnings levels continue to fall short of   expectations   Internationally, Argentina is a looming trouble spot, and Japan seems once again   unable to escape its prolonged recession  As Bill McDonough pointed out, there are a lot of   downside risks there as well    On the monetary side there has been a sharp rise in borrowing costs for low-rated   borrowers, and the survey of senior loan officers reports a widening of credit spreads  The real   federal funds rate continues at a high level     These downside risks are of a different character than the inflation risks  Most likely   there is some probability that rising unemployment will become a problem, but there is a small   chance that it will become a serious problem  It is my impression that most past recessions have   arisen rather suddenly  We might summarize all of this in medical terms by saying that the small   probability of an acute problem has increased    This sets up the kind of quandary we do not like and should not like  How should we   balance the risk of a chronic problem against a slightly increased but small risk of an acute   problem?  How do we stay ahead of the curve when we can’t even see its basic direction?  I’ve   been changing my mind a lot on this in recent days  I don’t always feel this way, but this time   around I am very happy that there are 16 others around to help make the decision! [Laughter]  In   the end, our best answer may be to expand our statement to say just what we are worried about     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The last thing I want to do is   to inspire a bunch of lectures from the other side of the table, [Laughter] so I will support   the statement  It is indeed a close call for me               96      At the same time, let me make two points  I think we are getting very close to   the point where the risks are nearly balanced if not perfectly balanced  And I think there   is an Occam’s razor principle with respect to these press statements  They get so   thoroughly parsed by everybody that in my view there is a lot to be said for the simpler   the better  You have come up with a nice approach that I'll call the downside/upside   approach, and I think it will work  But I think we have to be pretty careful about this and   at some point I'd like to go back to a strategy that if the risks really are balanced, we   ought to say so  I have four friends in this argument—Bill (Poole), Tom (Hoenig), Roger   (Ferguson), and Bob (McTeer)--and I would join that list, though supporting your   statement   My other point is on the markets  I'm not sure we understand very well what   the market reaction to all this will be  It is certainly possible that this would spark a rally   and I don't think anybody wants to see that  But as Don said, there are a couple of   scenarios that go the other way  One is that this could all be factored in, in which case a   move to a balanced risk statement won't do too much to the markets  Another possibility   is that markets may think that we see something that they don't, and markets could   actually go down  I have no idea which of these scenarios is the most likely  So I think   we have to be a little careful about being locked in irons, if you will, by the market   reaction  At some point we just have to do what we think is the right thing to do and try   to explain it, and I think the markets will come around     Peter, on your page 5, there is a very visible spike in the lower left   panel Was there some particular event that caused that?     Could I suggest a change in one word?     The seventh line begins with "financial markets suggest that   economic"--it says "growth" and I’d like to substitute "activity"  The reason is that we are, I believe,   still arguing and are mainly of the view that we continue to be in the midst of a productivity shock  I   think this is more about activity than growth     I'd rather be redundant than misleading     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the last meeting I said that the   situation was sufficiently unclear that I was glad there were others to participate in our decisions    This time around conditions have changed enough that the picture is coming into clearer focus for   me  To get right to the bottom line, I think monetary policy has become too tight   A simple argument for arriving at this judgment is based on a standard I've used before    The real interest rate from the TIPS market is about 38 percent now, and if we build in an   anticipated inflation rate of about 2 percent, the equilibrium funds rate should be slightly less than 6   percent  The actual funds rate is more than that, indicating that monetary policy is on the tight side    It made perfect sense to tighten monetary policy to this level last May when we were leaning against      51  the inflation rates, but things have changed now and I no longer believe it makes sense to keep the   funds rate this high   The second standard is just to examine the Greenbook baseline forecast from a normative   standpoint  I’ll raise a few questions about that forecast in a second, but for now let's assume it is   perfectly accurate  It shows a period of below-trend growth, with the unemployment rate eventually   rising to 5 percent  I am not one who believes this outcome is desirable or necessary to control   inflation  If we can avert some of that rise in unemployment by cutting rates--and I believe we can--  I think we should   As for risks, on one side I think the inflation risk has become relatively quiescent  The   core PCE bounces around and we make a lot of the fact that it has risen recently, but it’s still below   its levels of 1996 and 1997  Long-term inflation expectations have been very stable in this whole   period and indeed have dropped to historical lows in both the Michigan and Philadelphia surveys    The nominal/real spread has dropped sharply recently to about 15 percent with or without the staff's   adjustments for the timing of interest payments  It is possible that special factors could be   influencing very recent movements in this spread, but it still has declined noticeably this year  Trend   unit labor cost increases have come back up a bit but are still low  All wholesale price measures are   very stable and commodity prices have stabilized  There may always be some chronic risks that   inflation will accelerate, but these risks seem relatively low right now   Indeed, given these numbers, I doubt we’d be worried very much at all about inflation if it   weren't for what I'll call NAIRU guilt pangs  Estimates of the NAIRU have always been weak   econometrically in the sense of having high standard errors  Moreover, point estimates of NAIRU   are bound to be reduced the longer the economy goes without accelerating inflation  We are now   nearing the end of the fourth year where the unemployment rate is less than the conventional      52  estimates of NAIRU, with very little evidence of accelerating inflation  Sure, there have been   special factors, such as the rise in the dollar and the productivity shock  But as time goes on, I still   become less and less convinced that unemployment is below the imperfectly estimated NAIRU   level   On the down side, as I’ve said above, I see a case for lowering rates even in the baseline   Greenbook forecast  Given the slowdown, that forecast has the economy settling in for a period of   below-trend growth, eventually taking the unemployment rate to 5 percent  Unemployment will   probably rise some from its present level  That seems almost inevitable given the circumstances    But I do think we should try to avert some of that rise  I think we'll get very little added inflation   credibility by letting unemployment increase more than is necessary to control inflation   But that slow growth scenario is not the only downside risk  As the Greenbook freely   acknowledges, there is a downside risk in the Greenbook forecast itself  I talked recently to a noted   economist who has been studying recessions since the first postwar recession of 1949  [Laughter]    He reports that they seem to develop in three steps--an inventory buildup, followed by a crumbling   of the pillars of the expansion, followed by some unforeseen break in confidence  We already have   at least a mini inventory buildup  As for the pillars of the expansion, the stock market has been level   to declining for 18 months  Foreign real growth is tapering off and has already been downgraded a   few times in our forecasts  The critical Japanese economy is a continuing source of forecasting   malaise  Auto sales are weak and future production levels are being cut back  Manufacturing output   beyond auto sales is turning down  Consumer confidence has just taken its first hit, and it is known   to be related to unemployment  Even high-tech investment is beginning to weaken   Some of these types of spending are bound to slow from their rapid earlier growth rates,   and some of these other signals may prove to be false positives  But the list I cited still represents a      53  lot of crumbling pillars  While the odds, I think, are still against an out-and-out recession, a broader   break in confidence is certainly becoming more possible  Given the suddenness with which these   forces can accumulate, we definitely don’t want to get behind this particular curve  We don't want to   be in a position of waiting too long, seeing the economy deteriorate, and then having to respond too   vigorously   Adding all this up, I see very few costs in cutting rates soon and very many benefits    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know, the policy you suggested is   not my first choice  Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty out there, but I share the view of a few   others around the table who think that we've seen enough to ease fairly soon  On the other hand, if   we all agree to stand by our telephones, [Laughter] the policy you suggested "morphs" into what I   would prefer, so I will support it on that basis  But I think we ought to be alert and stand by our   telephones     I’ve been worried about the saving rate, too  Dave, you   said something that at a minimum may cause me to revise a comment I was about to   make in the go-around  The personal saving rate is now negative 8, and by the end of   the simulation period it goes up to plus 16--a 24 percentage point turnaround  Is any of   that a change in the data or is that all behavioral?     The change is all behavioral?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A number of you have made   the point that the picture is mixed  I'm reminded of a statement that an old-time baseball   manager, Paul Richards, once made when his team was in the middle of a losing streak    He said, “No team is as good as it looks when it’s winning or as bad as it looks when it’s   losing”  There is a sense in which that statement can be applied to the economy  Last   year when the economy was on what I’ll call a winning streak we--or maybe I should say   I--took great pride in the growth of high-tech investment  That growth now appears to   have been somewhat excessive and the so-called overhang of high-tech goods may be   leading to problems now  This year, when the economy seems to be on a losing streak,   things may not be as weak as they seem either   One gets a very different picture from looking at different sources of data    There's a kind of hierarchy of optimism out there  The strongest readings come from the   labor markets where at this point the changes in unemployment and other measures of   labor demand have been moderate  Using the unemployment numbers to infer GDP   growth leads to an estimated real growth rate in this quarter of about 2-1/2 percent  Next   in the hierarchy come final demand markets where the picture is more mixed  Auto   spending, as you know, contracted sharply but has turned back up  There is still some   real growth in high-tech spending  Housing construction and overall consumption   spending have held up fairly well  This all leads to an estimate of real growth in this   quarter, I'm guessing, of between 1/2 and 1 percent  The terrible picture, obviously,   comes from the stock market  And part of the difficulty involved in interpreting that is to   determine whether the recent declines in stock prices are just a stock market phenomenon   or whether they foretell a deeper real message that we should be heeding     3/20/01 66  As for the Greenbook, the optimistic side of me can actually find two ways in   which the baseline forecast is too negative  First, as the Greenbook acknowledges, the   monetary assumption underlying that forecast is that the Fed cuts rates 50 basis points at   this meeting and then stands pat  If the fed funds futures market is any guide, that is not   the most likely outcome  The futures market has the funds rate dropping to 425 percent   by this fall, with current long-term rates presumably incorporating this expectation  The   simulation labeled “easier monetary policy” more closely incorporates the assumptions in   the futures market, and the outcome in that simulation is slightly more positive than the   baseline   The second reason I may be slightly less bearish than the staff involves the   wealth effect  We've talked about that a lot this morning  My own concern about it is   that in the past few years as stocks were rising we attributed the strong growth in   consumption largely to the wealth effect  I’m not questioning that attribution, but it   strikes me that the wealth effect is not working as powerfully on the down side  Stock   values are barely higher than their levels of two years ago  The wealth-to-income ratio   has been declining for a while, yet consumption is still very high relative to disposable   income, with the personal saving rate this quarter declining further to 08 percent  The   saving rate may rise from this extraordinarily low level, but the staff has it turning around   --I would say reasonably sharply--to 16 percent by the end of the simulation period   Basically I am a cheerleader for high saving and I don't necessarily approve of its   currently low level  But if all these consumers who were led to consume more by earlier   stock increases are now locked into a higher consumption lifestyle, personal consumption   may hold up better than the staff is forecasting  Call it a “habit formation” consumption     3/20/01 67  function  I don't know how much weight to put on this, but I put a little weight on the   Greenbook simulation that is labeled “strong demand”   Having made these positive points, I still favor easing monetary policy today    One reason is that we can hardly take solace in low federal funds futures rates and   associated long-term rates if we are not prepared to take the steps necessary to validate   that expectation  Another reason is that there still are very, very serious downside risks    And a third reason is that even in the more optimistic forecasts, the unemployment rate   rises more than I think is necessary to control inflation  That is a point that nobody really   has made yet  Even if there is no recession, even if the economy bottoms out at a slow   rate of growth, I personally think we should still worry about the growing output gap    And yes, Cathy, I am a productivity optimist in saying that   Another way to view all this is to look at the funds rate in real terms  The staff   has done an exercise that corrects the nominal funds rate by expected core PCE inflation   derived from a regression model  This leads to an estimated current real funds rate of   about 38 percent, which is close to its average for the past five years though still above   the average for the past 15 years  Alternatively, in a forward-looking calculation the   present real rate of 38 percent is about equal to the tax-adjusted real forward rate from   the TIPS market  Whether looking backward or forward, by these calculations monetary   policy is roughly in neutral posture right now, and I feel strongly that in this environment   we should be leaning against the downward risks  So I agree with Paul Richards’s   dictum in that the situation may not be as weak as it appears, but I do think we ought to   be easing monetary policy  Thank you     3/20/01 68    Thank you, Mr Chairman  For a while now I've been   stuck on the same question that I think the meeting is stuck on  I have felt that from the   basics what I'd like to do at this meeting is to move the funds target down 50 basis points   and retain the bias, but if there were some way to do a little more, I felt that was   appropriate  There are two ways to do a little more  One is to go down 75 basis points    Some have talked about that; I would have gone down 75 and retained the bias toward   weakness  The other way is what you suggested, Mr Chairman, to go down 50 with a   hint of more  Let me try to do a benefit/cost analysis on this     I see two advantages in your approach  One is that it is flexible and decisive,   as Bill McDonough described very well, and in that sense more effective than going   down 75  Also, it can be more targeted to the real economy and not the stock market, and   I think that's an advantage as well   As for the costs, you've all been very eloquent about the cost side of it  The   cost that a number of people have mentioned is the heightened sensitivity to the Fed and   what its next policy move might be  I think every one of us feels that there is already   way too much sensitivity out there  By hinting of an intermeeting move, we are not   making that problem any better, so I do see that as a cost  But I will still support the   approach you recommended  Among unsatisfactory alternatives I think it’s probably the   best     Excuse me  Could I ask a question of Don?  Do you   happen to have the language of the similar sentence in December?  People are going to   compare the two     Was adding “especially” the whole difference?     No     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Earlier in the year, there were various   indications that the economy could have been on a sharp downward slide  By this time, we’re   probably past the time of greatest risk, but the economy is still in a very fragile state  The high-  tech sector is in a state of over-capacity, with PC sales down, communications orders down, and   fiber optic equipment sales down  Overall industrial production is down, capacity utilization   rates are at 10-year lows, and inventories outside of transportation and high-tech are building up    As yet, consumption has not dropped much and the personal saving rate is still negative  The   baseline forecast has personal saving turning around, in which case the growth of consumption is   likely to soften  The scare stories may be over and there are certainly points of strength, but the   domestic economy is still in a very fragile state     I’d like to join Bill McDonough in talking about the international economy, but I want   to focus on the relatively healthy economies  There is a haunting similarity between what is     5/15/01     67   going on in this country and what is happening in the euro zone countries, Canada, and the   United Kingdom  Each country is in the midst of a significant inventory correction  Industrial   production is dropping, there may be a capital overhang, and business and consumer confidence   is off  In each country the forecast is pretty much the same  Excess inventories will be worked   off, the capital overhang will be worked off, and growth will resume  But what if that doesn’t   happen?  What if some countries cannot quite achieve the growth toehold and then drag others   down?  And this story refers only to the healthy economies  The outlook, as you’ve heard, is   much more problematic for countries like Japan, Argentina, Turkey, and the high-tech exporters   of Southeast Asia  Again, the message is not necessarily one of overwhelming weakness, but   rather one of fragility and significant downside risks     On the other side of the ledger, since the start of the year the FOMC has already   lowered the funds rate by 200 basis points  Isn’t that enough?  Not necessarily; that depends on   where the funds rate was when we began lowering it  It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking   about policy in terms of changes and not levels  In that connection, I’d like to join several others   in referring to the Bluebook analysis showing the real funds rate in comparison to a number of   alternative measures  As compared to the long-term historical average, the real funds rate right   now is just barely below this benchmark  As compared to a forward-looking tax-adjusted   measure of expected future funds rates, the margin is greater  The same is true in comparison   with a number of indicators designed to measure the full employment funds rate derived from   model simulations  The basic message I take from that is that even though we have lowered the   funds rate a lot, in real terms monetary policy is not yet leaning against a recessionary wind by   all that much  In view of the risks mentioned above, a further downward adjustment could   certainly be justified       5/15/01     68   One arrives at the same conclusion from the Greenbook model simulations  The   baseline case assumes a reduced funds rate at this meeting and still has unemployment rising to   51 percent at the end of this year and to 5-1/2 percent at the end of next year  These   unemployment rates are well above the rates necessary to control inflation, in my view  The   simulation using the federal funds futures path arrives at essentially the same results  Those   simulations have built into them a reasonably strong response of spending to interest rate   changes, contrary to many arguments we’re hearing that question that response  The lesson I   would take from these simulations as well is that there is still a strong case for monetary policy   easing     On the inflation side, as everybody is well aware, the news has not been very good    Energy prices have risen sharply and various measures of core inflation have risen slightly,   perhaps reflecting difficulties in measuring and filtering out the energy prices from the overall   price index  Productivity is down and unit labor costs are rising more rapidly, again perhaps   reflecting nothing more than the drop in capital spending  The TIPS nominal/real spread has   risen rather sharply  But I would still argue that long-term inflation risks are basically well   contained  Commodity prices are stable to down  Inflation expectations in the Michigan and   Philadelphia surveys are stable  The Blue Chip forecasters are anticipating a slight dip in   inflation, as is the Greenbook  Inflation measures in other countries are stable, well within the   target zones for inflation in Canada and the United Kingdom, and for core inflation at least in the   euro zone  There is still deflation in Japan  One can never be sure, but on the whole I would say   that the inflation pattern we are observing is a series of blips largely related to energy prices and   not a damaging trend       5/15/01     69   My bottom line is that I am aware that we can’t forever keep on easing monetary   policy in large steps  I’m aware that if we get the real funds rate too low we will have to raise it   again at some point  I’m aware that measured core inflation has crept up  But it also seems to   me that the economy, both domestically and internationally, is currently in a very tenuous state,   with still significant downside risks  Both from a short-term and a longer-term perspective, I   think we can safely lean harder against these recessionary winds     Bob, that’s a tough act to follow!  [Laughter]  I was planning to   make a speech     First, I support both of your recommendations, Mr Chairman  At   the same time, I agree with many others around the table that we can’t continue to ease monetary   policy in such large steps  I see the wall looming out there  I don’t see it quite yet, as I said   earlier, but it’s out there and we should be aware of it  There are lags and we should be mindful   of that    As for the press statement, I think my views are closest to Mike Kelley’s  It’s too soon   to go to a balanced risk statement  In my view--if this makes any sense--we should have a   relatively unobtrusive statement today   The last comment I want to make is that a lot of us found the Bluebook exercise with   the real funds rate computed in various ways very useful, and I would like to propose to Don and   others that they continue to provide that analysis  In my view it’s a good way to think about   monetary policy  If we keep looking at it, we’ll get used to it and we’ll get a sense of when we   ought to be wandering out of the gray band and when we should not be wandering out of the gray   band  So, I would propose that the staff keep that exercise       I basically support the statement  I might note that there are   actually three changes from the previous statement, as I remember it  First, we dropped the   “alert” sentence  Secondly, as Tony mentioned, fewer Banks are listed as having put in for the   discount rate reduction  And third, unlike the last statement, this one at least mentions the word   inflation, and that is a significant change as well  I like that sentence  So I’m essentially happy   with the draft  Perhaps we could make some changes in the adjectives on that last sentence in   the second paragraph  But, as I said before, I’d like to keep this statement fairly unobtrusive and   generally in the pattern of our recent statements  We have changed it in a few important ways   already     Maybe you’d like a punch card ballot!  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A few meetings ago I made the   comment that the economy was susceptible to chronic and acute risks--the chronic risk of rising   inflation and the acute risk of recession  The comment drew some chuckles and people told me   afterwards that they liked the analogy  The only problem is that now, with the wisdom of   hindsight, my statement doesn’t look so good because the recession risks are also proving to be   chronic For some months now both official and private forecasters have been projecting that a   turnaround in demand growth is imminent, that the economy will recover, and that economic   growth will get back on track While there have bright spots this year, for the most part that   turnaround just has not materialized  Overall conditions seem roughly as weak now as they did   earlier in the year, despite significant expansionary doses of both monetary and fiscal policy and     8/21/01 52   a cut in energy prices The forecast recovery has been pushed back and pushed back again; it   always seems to be just around the corner but never quite here  No doubt at some point there   really will be a turnaround, but our patience is being severely tested     We’ve talked about these points of weakness for several meetings now and there’s no   need to belabor the issues Probably the most serious question is the profits outlook  Until profit   expectations recover, it’s hard to see a strong turnaround in business investment  Indeed, the   staff showed yesterday that the profits outlook for technology shares in the S&P index has   dropped so rapidly that that portion of the S&P is again showing high price-earnings ratios,   possibly foreshadowing more declines in stock prices     The international sector is also growing increasingly worrisome  There seems to be no   demand growth driver anywhere in the world  The standard international forecast does show a   recovery But the main source of future strength--if we can call it that--in the world economy   seems to be that the United States has such a high income elasticity for imports that if our   economy recovers, it will pull up demand for our trading partners  One can be forgiven for   considering this a rather weak reed     The steady beat of disappointing news is taking its toll on expectations--so much so   that the Beige Book got lots of play in the press a couple of weeks ago, with reports that   economic malaise was beginning to spread from manufacturing to sectors such as office space,   trucking, and shipping services In some sense these reports were not all that remarkable; after   all, slowdowns would be expected to spread  But the negative expectations have become so   pervasive after these reports that the Beige Book had much more impact than it normally does    Even the GDP revisions had an impact  As David Wilcox pointed out earlier, the GDP revisions   did not change inflation or the output gaps, so there was no first-order impact on monetary     8/21/01 53   policy But the BEA did write down growth in recent years, taking a big slice out of both capital   investment and profits  The profits change could indirectly cause problems on the demand side,   given the prevailing weakness in profit expectations  The investment change hurts on the supply   side, lowering the capital deepening component of productivity change and estimates of potential   growth over the next few years  This is not, to be sure, a true structural productivity change   because the alteration was due to capital put in place, which we already knew was cyclically   weak But it’s still disappointing to see this productivity growth spurt that we all took such pride   in being partly undone with new data   Let me say a word about lags; a few of you have mentioned those  Lags for monetary   policy are long They are also variable  It strikes me that at this time in this cycle it becomes   very difficult to read exactly where we are in the process of monetary lags  Long rates--and this   is similar to what Bill Poole just said--actually went down last fall before we started lowering   short rates So if the drop in long rates was going to have some effect, it should be working   through the system already  Another channel through which monetary policy works is the dollar    And as was reported earlier, the dollar hadn’t really gone down until a couple of weeks ago  The   third channel is equity markets  If anybody knows how to interpret the equity markets, please   come forward and say your piece!  So I think that the question of exactly where we are in this   monetary lag cycle is after all rather complicated  I think the notion of just saying “Well, we   started lowering rates eight months ago, so the effect ought to be coming through now” is at best   oversimplified  On the fiscal side, we have talked a lot about the tax cuts  But there is an   offsetting factor involved because a lot of states have gotten into fiscal difficulties as a result of   the developments that are going on throughout the country and some states are actually raising   taxes, offsetting the Federal tax cut     8/21/01 54   There are still bright spots Housing has been consistently strong  Price-earnings   ratios on most stocks have been reasonably stable  Consumption, as has been noted, has held up   well The turnaround could still be right around the corner  Moreover, in my view this has not   been a time of policy mistakes  Monetary policy, as I think most of us would agree, has   followed roughly the proper path, getting rates down early and significantly  But given the   prolonged slowdown--which any day we might begin to call chronic--there does seem to be a   need for a monetary booster shot Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I agree with   those who think that down the road--in a few quarters or maybe a year--having moved the funds   rate down today might complicate our problems  But I think we have to do it  I would also   underline something Don said, namely that right now we’re in a position where both r and r* are   dropping So we’re really not getting as far out of balance as it might seem     Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ve often spoken about the   value of confidence in economic relationships  Confidence is a variable that is a direct   term in no economic equation but is a key factor in almost all of them--consumption,   investment, employment, stock markets, risk discounts, foreign trading, capital flows, and   on down the list The macroeconomic implications of a serious loss of confidence could   be enormous  So what is the evidence?  It has only been three weeks since the attacks   and already there is a great deal of evidence that confidence is eroding  If you hadn’t   called a break, I was going to go through this list really quickly  I will still go through it   quickly but a little less so now  [Laughter]  One piece of evidence is travel demand,   which is definitely down Another is consumer confidence and Dave Stockton talked   about that Layoffs have risen We see evidence in financial variables--the stock market,   risk spreads on lesser-rated bonds, early signs of implied credit market volatility  There’s   some evidence that even housing demand and auto sales may be down in the period since   September 11th     10/2/01 74   There are two indicators on which I’m not quite sure about the timing  One,   which Karen Johnson spoke about already, is the foreign sector  It’s a little hard to tell   what occurred before and after September 11th, but it’s clear that the news there isn’t   good Another is commodity prices, which have dropped sharply  I’ve often spoken   about those before as a precursor of inflation  The staff has been persuading me that they   may be an even better precursor of output demand, but whatever the case they are down   sharply   A last issue is the forecasts of others  The NABE took a survey of their   forecasters since the event  Eighteen out of 21 of them had a significantly more   pessimistic outlook  I’m not sure that they know any more than our forecasters, but all   forecasters seem to be moving in one direction     This all sets up what I see as a difficult policy problem  The attacks could be a   major demand shock or a minor one, for a long period or a short period  Just how do we   respond?  On the fiscal side I think there are at least two things that fiscal policy should   do There should be expenditures for military and other security measures and   compensation for the direct victims  Whether fiscal policy ought to do anything beyond   that, I find a difficult question But if more stimulus is required, I’d like to see it   provided in a way that doesn’t dissipate the long-term budget surplus, national saving,   and the low long-term interest rates that have been a hallmark of the recent period   On the monetary side, I also see the need for action  Monetary policy can be   changed quickly It can be used flexibly and it can be reversed just as quickly should   circumstances change  As a number of you have said, this latter property is very   important right now, given the massive uncertainty  The combination of short-term fiscal     10/2/01 75   easing and monetary easing I think is our best hope for keeping the economy as strong as   possible in both the short run and the long run  Thanks     Actually, I was going to ask about what you just   discussed, so I withdraw the question in the interest of moving things along     I support it     10/2/01 84     Thank you, Mr Chairman  An important theme at our last meeting   was uncertainty We were meeting reasonably close to September 11th and it was still hard to sort   out the data It’s easier to do the sorting now To paraphrase Murphy’s Law, almost everything that   could go down, did It’s pretty hard to find sources of strength in today’s economy     The list of downward-pointing indicators is long and getting longer  the Beige Book,   employment, the NAPM survey, durable goods orders, consumer confidence, industrial production,   commodity prices, foreign demand growth, and on down the list  What seems especially   troublesome is that former sources of spending growth are beginning to weaken  Housing   expenditures are beginning to slip and consumption is starting to fall relative to disposable income    As Governor Ferguson just noted, auto sales spurted but that could imply weakness ahead if the sales   just reflect an immediate bunching of expenditures in response to the zero interest rate deals       11/6/01 63   The stock market is surprisingly high, but that could be problematic as well  The   earnings-price ratio is now virtually the same as the real AAA bond yield and this with analysts’   earnings forecasts that are still implausibly optimistic  When and if more prudence strikes the   earnings forecasters, or if more normal risk spreads assert themselves, stock values could fall as   well   Many commentators are now arguing that because all of this has happened as interest rates   were cut, monetary policy must be impotent  Perhaps I’m preaching to the choir here, but since I   think it’s relevant for our decision, let me spend a minute taking on that argument  To be sure,   monetary policy has been fighting very powerful downward forces this year, far more powerful than   I think any of us imagined at the start of the year  Policy easings may not have had the curative   effects that we had all hoped for, but I think the impotence argument takes things much too far  The   essence of monetary policy is through the interest rate-cost of capital channel  In the Goldman   Sachs financial conditions index this interest rate channel gets 90 percent of the weighting  In the   FRB/US model its weighting ranges from 76 percent to 90 percent, depending on whether one takes   one-quarter impacts or long-run impacts  And that channel has worked well this year  Short rates   obviously have dropped sharply Even longer-term, 10-year Treasury rates have come down from 4   to 3 percent in real terms since the start of their easing cycle last year and from 6 to 4-1/2 percent in   nominal terms  These changes have held up final spending  This year the easing of monetary policy   clearly seems to have held up spending for housing and consumer durables, especially autos  It’s   possible that it has even had some positive effect on investment, though it’s obviously hard to make   that case given the powerful downward impact of the capital overhang   I will agree with the critics that there are both theoretical and empirical questions about   some of the other ways that monetary policy allegedly stimulates the economy  One suspect channel     11/6/01 64   involves the foreign sector It seems that a drop in interest rates doesn’t necessarily lower domestic   currency values, perhaps because it raises expected profits or perhaps because conditions might have   become even weaker in other economies    The other suspect channel involves the wealth effect  There seems to be no doubt that a   rise in future productivity will raise equity values and consumption, as people try to consume some   of their future anticipated income up front  But whether falling interest rates and rising relative   house prices, which do raise computed net worth, should also raise consumption has always been a   matter of some theoretical ambiguity     So monetary policy is perhaps not as potent as some believe, but it still can have powerful   impacts, still can be used to fight downward movements, and still has been effective in maintaining   spending this year  In the face of the powerful downward momentum that seems to come with each   day’s economic news, I think we have no choice but to use our instrument as emphatically as we   can   Finally, let me say one word about reversibility, something about which I am not very   worried Much of the Greenbook recovery hinges on additional fiscal stimulus, which is somewhat   in doubt for political reasons and is perhaps even economically treacherous  It’s not so much of a   stretch to say that the world recovery hinges on the US recovery, which hinges on fiscal policy,   which hinges on politics That is an exaggeration, I admit, but not too much  It’s easy for me to   imagine a very slow recovery here and in the world and that should give us plenty of time to reverse   course But if conditions are such that we have to reverse more quickly, that would actually be   fantastic news and we should be delighted to do that       Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  The good news in   what you said was that you came out with a policy that I support  But the bad news is that you   actually scared me a bit more than I was already  Nevertheless, I do support your proposal   Let me also address Tom’s question  I’ve had a little trouble with this myself because   changes of 50, 25, or even 75 basis points aren’t that huge  And as Tom points out, if there’s an   argument for getting the funds rate down, why don’t we get it down?  The way I would rationalize   what we’re doing is that there is a sense in which we are speaking in code here  We’ve been   operating under a procedure for a while where 50 points is viewed as a big change and the Fed being   responsive A move of 25 basis points is viewed as a little change and the Fed not being very   responsive Seventy-five basis points is language we’ve never used So I think it’s particularly   important to be clear in our communication, as many people around the table have said  To me   that’s a powerful argument for continuing the dialog that we’ve already been having     11/6/01 83    May I vote also?  [Laughter]  I believe I’m entitled to     I didn’t think I was that transparent!  I vote “yes”    Well, let me first comment on the broader point and I’ll also talk   about the words used  Continuing with Bill McDonough’s whistling in the wind argument, I think   we also have to show that we recognize this phenomenon, whether we call it a reallocation or a     11/6/01 94   diversion of resources So I think we actually have to tie that in there  “Necessary” is fine with me    Also, there’s a double clause in there with “and protect against disruptions”  We might not need   that A lot of words are devoted to that sentence and it could be stripped down  But in my view we   have to recognize not only that it will be a while before productivity comes back, but also that a   diversion of resources is occurring  Otherwise the message just doesn’t look real     Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For some months now the economic   statistics have been very negative  All year the Greenbook has been responding to these statistics by   revising down its forecast, as have the Blue Chip and other forecasters  But we now find ourselves in   a more ambiguous situation  Some indicators still look weak but others are turning up  We may be   approaching an important crossroads for monetary policy      12/11/01 58    The list of indicators that are beginning to show signs of strength, or at least stabilization, is   long In the last month the NAPM durable goods orders, personal spending, and construction   spending have all turned up Consumption of semiconductors has risen as have computer shipments    Nonfuel commodity prices have increased lately, perhaps indicating future strength in demand  And   oil prices have dropped, which paradoxically could be an expansionary force  Bond and stock markets   are both indicating that credit markets think better times are ahead  But welcome as these signs are,   one should not get carried away Fans always feel good when their team’s losing streak has ended but   this does not make their team a strong team  [Laughter]  As the recent employment reports indicate,   the economy is still soft and it will take a long run of good news before we can declare the recession   or the soft period over   Perhaps because of the imminent signs of strength, it now seems less likely that Congress   will pass an economic stimulus package  My own most likely Greenbook forecast has become the one   labeled “no fiscal package” An important boost in the baseline Greenbook forecast is given by fiscal   policy assumptions, specifically the acceleration of depreciation loss  If I assume that the fiscal   package doesn’t pass, I can sidestep this debate between Jerry Jordan and the Greenbook forecasters   on the exact impact of that package  The forecast in that no fiscal package scenario shows another   year of sub-trend economic growth, with growth not returning to trend until sometime in 2003 and   with the unemployment rate peaking at 64 percent, which is a long way from full employment by   anybody’s definition  Moreover, it’s almost too gruesome to mention, but the economy is still   vulnerable to negative shocks, whether from further terrorism or just plain negative economic shocks     For whatever reason, short-term anticipations of inflation by those responding to the   Michigan survey have taken a sharp drop  When combined with the high unemployment, the low oil   prices, the incipient drops in measured inflation, and the fact that productivity is holding up     12/11/01 59    remarkably well for a recession, there are solid grounds for projecting lower inflation as the   Greenbook has done Indeed, there are solid grounds for projecting lower inflation than the   Greenbook has forecast  Given all this--the still weak economy, the still vulnerable economy, and   possible reductions in inflation--I think one can make a very strong case for a further easing of   monetary policy more or less in line with what the Bluebook has called “a perfect foresight policy”    That’s a self-congratulatory label, though one that suits my present purposes!  [Laughter] But in   contrast to my feeling for most of this year, the case for further ease is not quite as compelling today    Thank you     I didn’t necessarily want to follow in this order!  Let me first say a   word to my good friend, Larry Meyer  I don’t always agree with him, but he always makes us think    And I believe he has done that today I’m frankly a little too tired to think about disclosure and   transparency at this particular moment, but I agree that perhaps we ought to consider that issue again    However, I would say that lately the Fed seems to me to have been very well understood by markets    When a data series comes out, everyone says here is what the Fed thinks about that and they’re usually   not far wrong So I think somehow or other we are communicating fairly well already  That’s not to   say we can’t do more, but I don’t think communication is a huge problem at this point   Now, back to the Chairman’s recommendation I agree with going down 1/4 point and with   continuing the bias toward weakness I think that’s about the right policy in level terms  As I’ve said   many times over the year, I’m not too worried about the reversibility issue  If we have to, we can do   it We have done it  Also, in line with what Bill Poole said, this small step paves the way for an     12/11/01 93    orderly repositioning of policy, which I think all of us want to do  The final thing I would say about   the policy recommendation is that, if I’m not mistaken, going down 1/4 point today would be   following exactly the strategy built into the Bluebook forecast in which the staff imputed the so-called   perfect foresight policy I think it would be pretty close to the way they’ve got us in their equation    Thank you     I think we’re all going on memory here  First, I would say that I   don’t have a particular preference for foreign RPs versus Ginnie Maes; I could go either way    But on the Ginnie versus Fannie/Freddie issue, I believe the distinction is that at one point Fannie   and Freddie were explicitly privatized  They were supposedly taken out of the government and   were not supposed to receive any public subsidy  So we are adhering to that line  That   privatization decision, as I understand it, was not made for GNMA  So I see a clear distinction   there One might argue that there are going to be pressures, and that may be so  But I think that   argument could be turned around a bit to say that, if we explicitly operated in Ginnies and not   Fannies and gave the reason, it might actually clarify the distinction between what is supposedly   privatized and what is not The last point is on Al’s idea of talking to Peter Fisher  I’d be happy   for us to have a conversation with Peter Fisher But even though Peter is wonderful, he’s not a   magician  The only way the Treasury could issue us more securities or put more securities out in   the market for us to buy is for them to run deficits or buy assets  And I don’t find either option   attractive We can have a paper on this, but what else is it going to say?  So I guess, Al, I do   hope that this is the last conversation we have about that!  [Laughter]     But that means a deficit  That’s the deficit option Whatever you   think about deficits, I believe that ought to be part of an overall fiscal strategy  And I don’t want        March 19, 2002 Page 18 of 117  to have the Treasury changing that strategy just so we can do something that’s a second-order   improvement in monetary policy  I just don’t think it’s worth that     Or the Treasury could buy them and issue us a security  [Laughter]   That I might go along with!     Well, I would make just one point  The group was in agreement and   Roger summarized the issues well  But there was a question of whether the dissents would   actually be put in the press release or would merely be available to those in the press who   happened to ask our Public Affairs staff for that information  I think our committee felt it was   fairer to everybody, and particularly to those who do not inquire, just to put everything right in   the announcement and also to modify the way we announce the discount rate votes as well     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There’s a sense in which turning points   present the biggest challenge to monetary policy  When economic activity was strong as in 1999   or weak as in 2001, the required direction of policy was clear  The balance of risks was clear,   and market expectations were clear  When policy has to turn course as in late 2000 or now,   things become much more delicate     First, there can be little doubt anymore that we are at such a turning point  Throughout   the past year the fundamental forecasting question was whether housing and consumption could   hang in there until the inventory and capital overhangs got worked off  This was a question until     March 19, 2002 Page 74 of 117  about two months ago But at this point the string of positive data releases for both consumption   and investment seems to have settled the matter rather decisively  On the consumption side,   consumption itself has been stronger than forecast  The stock market is coming back  Tax cuts   have helped Layoffs were not as bad as feared  And now consumer expectations are beginning   to rise On the investment side, the inventory overhang seems to be working off very quickly,   perhaps reflecting the warp-speed economy that a certain person here is always talking about    There could still be an overhang in communications equipment, but even new orders for that   category are leveling Orders and shipments for computers are rising again, as are other   shipments  And now, like a fire truck arriving late at the scene after the fire is out and spraying   water all over the place, the Congress has entered the fray with investment inducements, possibly    magnifying the next boom  Reflecting all this, the Blue Chip forecasters are revising their   projections upward in a pell-mell process—so much so that one wonders whether these   forecasters are really forecasting or just looking out the window  [Laughter]   This all sets up a difficult issue for monetary policy  It has always been true that once we   hit the end of an easing cycle we would have to tread delicately  We would not want to raise   rates too quickly and risk snuffing out the turnaround, nor would we want to tarry too long with   rates well below equilibrium and risk inflation down the road  That dilemma is still there  But   with every day’s news I find myself worrying less about the first side of the dilemma, premature   rate rises, and more about the second, tarrying too long    In late 2000 when we had the reverse of this dilemma we were able to turn policy around   fairly quickly, going from a positive bias to an actual cut in rates in about six weeks  The time   pressures on us may not be as great this time  We begin the process with high unemployment,   low capacity utilization, and relatively quiescent inflationary pressures  But things have changed     March 19, 2002 Page 75 of 117  quickly in the past two months, and they can change quickly in the next two months  For   example, if investment suddenly came roaring back or if the productivity spurt raised profits and   stock values, we would have to be ready to negotiate a turnaround and possibly a quick one    Thank you     Yes, I have a similar comment and question  I’m typically a stay-  ahead-of-the-curve guy, but I rather like the outcome depicted by the blue line  So you’re   shaking my preconceptions a bit  However, I think a strategy that a number of us might be   comfortable with is to start tightening fairly soon but to go a little more gradually—not quite so           March 19, 2002 Page 82 of 117  abruptly as you have in the black line in the upper right panel  Hopefully that might produce an   end result somewhere between the black and the blue outcome shown below  [Laughter]   Actually, I think that would be my choice—the bruised choice      I wanted to echo what Dave said  To reflect the properties in this   model, the long-term unemployment rate has to be the NAIRU, which is 52 or 53 percent  And   if we should be lucky enough that the NAIRU is below that, we could redo this exercise  We’d   get the same basic pattern, but we wouldn’t end up at the same precise rate of unemployment    However, we do have to end up at the NAIRU, even though there is statistical uncertainty about   what that is     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I’m    typically easily persuadable by simulations, but I think I like the scenario that you laid out—   where we get started relatively early with smallish steps, feeling our way—better than the black   and blue choice [laughter] that Vincent gave us  The latter might be black and blue in some    different ways I would recall a point that Jerry Jordan made earlier, and that is that if we raise   nominal rates slowly, if the real rate is rising, we’re still being pretty accommodative  So that   might be another argument for getting started on a rate increase relatively soon  But the one   point I would note about the simulations is that they lowered the cost of delay below what I   would have thought, coming into the meeting  And that’s an interesting point  I’m not sure I’m   ready to believe it, but it’s worth thinking about     You took the words right out of my mouth!  [Laughter] I’m going to   be brief, too, and I have no metaphor or Aggie jokes or anything of that sort  In some sense, very   little has changed since our last meeting  There is still the tension between consumption and   investment, still the tension between the CEOs and their business economists, and still the   delicate question of whether to raise rates quickly and risk snuffing out the recovery or belatedly   and risk inflation A short time ago I was actually thinking about arguing for a positive bias on   the grounds that the funds rate will have to rise at some point  But the run of weak or uncertain   real output data in the meantime has pretty much scared me off  I’m aware of lags in monetary   policy, but I feel that we can still deal with the timing and path of rate increases later on, when   the recovery looks more firmly entrenched     The most interesting piece of news since our last meeting is the eye-popping productivity   number for the first quarter, now pegged at 86 percent  In the long run, the fact that productivity   has survived the slowdown so well is, of course, very good news—the best single piece of   economic news a country can have  In the short run, the remarkable productivity number does   raise several questions One question for the staff is the forecasting issue  The level of   productivity is now well above their trend estimate  They have eliminated about a third of this   gap by raising the trend estimate, but they wouldn’t want to determine the trend completely from   one or two quarters’ data So they still leave a substantial gap and a question of how quickly the   economy reverts to the productivity trend  In this reversion period, productivity growth will be         May 7, 2002 57 of 81  inevitably quite slow— perhaps implausibly so—with implications for employment, for profits,   for unit labor costs, and possibly even for demand growth     Another question that may engage us shortly involves monetary policy  This is similar to   a scenario that has been laid out by several presidents and also by Governor Ferguson, who   called it the water torture approach, though I didn’t think it was quite that bad If productivity   continues at high rates and there is not a full adjustment of spending on the demand side, we   could soon have a situation where demand growth is healthy, the funds rate is well below   equilibrium, and yet the unemployment rate stays high and perhaps even rises  What we should   do then is—well, it’s rather complicated     However all this plays out on the forecasting side and on the policy side, for today I think   our choice is clear The economy is recovering  We shouldn’t be lowering rates  But it’s not   recovering all that rapidly, so we shouldn’t be raising rates either  Thank you     Bob’s question was about chart 4, and I’m on chart 5  If you told us   a priori that you were going to get the equilibrium real rate by various kinds of simulations of   models and using the TIPS rate, I think we all would have said fine, that’s the way to do it  But   one thing I’ve been observing—it has been true for a while now and has become more so this   time—is that all of the equilibrium funds rates in the model simulations are on the order of   2 percent And the TIPS rate is 37 percent  There’s an increasing gap there  Do you have any   wise things to say about that, [laughter] or should we just view that as a random event?     I concur Often when you talk I find myself hoping you’ll be   prophetic, but not this time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy seems pretty clearly to   have suffered a relapse since our last meeting  Equity prices have dropped sharply, and various         August 13, 2002 58 of 92  spending, employment, and confidence measures have been weaker than expected  Even the   GDP revisions have lowered the recent growth numbers  There are some bright spots, notably   autos and housing But even these bright spots could be tainted if they imply lower future   spending The staff, for example, has auto production dropping in the fourth quarter after a   robust third quarter Housing is less likely to follow this pattern, but there are uncertainties about   housing Since homeowners are both consumers of housing services and wealth holders, there   has always been a question of why increases in housing wealth should stimulate other types of   spending The answer to this puzzle seems to be cash-out refinancing But this cash-out   refinancing may not last if either mortgage rates or house prices stabilize, and in any case it’s a   very weak reed to support the whole recovery   One way to measure this weakened sentiment is to follow the changes made by the Blue   Chip forecasters  As I’ve said before, the Blue Chip forecasters as forecasters do not particularly   impress me  What they seem to do is to react to the recent economic data and give an aggregated   measure of what these data are saying  Last fall these observers dropped the consensus forecast   for 2002 very sharply as the economy weakened This spring they brought the consensus   forecast for 2002 up fairly sharply as they found signs of strength  But now they are lowering it   again In the August poll their consensus forecast for 2002 was reduced a full ½ percentage   point, a huge change for people forecasting a year that is almost over  Clearly, these forecaster   observers are seeing plenty of negative signs   Another relevant indicator is the perfect foresight simulation exercise in the Bluebook    As the Bluebook explains, this is not really a perfect foresight simulation because the model is   used as it stands now But again, it does aggregate all the latest information on equation   variables and residuals to show the path of monetary policy consistent with NAIRU and with         August 13, 2002 59 of 92  various suggested inflation targets This perfect foresight simulation suggests that the economy   could use additional doses of monetary expansion even if our long-run inflation target were as   low as 1 percent   Turning to policy, I’m sitting between Roger and Don, so let me go about halfway   between them in terms of what I say about policy  At our last meeting the signs of weakness   were still incipient  The Blue Chip forecasters, for example, had not written down their forecast   at all And it was argued that if the Fed recognized these signs of weakness by changing the   stance of monetary policy, it would in effect enshrine those signs and spook markets    Apparently the signs of weakness are so pervasive now that they are already enshrined  Now the   argument is that if the Fed does not recognize those signs, it will look as though the FOMC is out   to lunch and that will spook markets  What a difference a month makes!  [Laughter] But   whether all this market talk makes any sense at all—and I don’t know if it does—in the last   month we probably have crossed an important recognition threshold Therefore, it probably does   make sense in developing our policy stance to show at least some cognizance of the spreading   signs of weakness Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support both parts of the recommendation  I think it   would be premature to lower rates, though I have some sympathy for those who have some   affinity for that position On the balance of risks, I’ve been mulling this over for the last week or   so and changing my view every few minutes!  But in the final analysis I think I’ll just describe   my position by using a very homely statement  The bias toward weakness does reflect our   discussion and in my view is an honest assessment of what we think, so in the end we probably   ought to go with that   Let me also say one word about housing  I’ll try to be quick about it  I agree that there is   no bubble I agree that there is no productivity change in housing construction  So the relative   price of housing is rising compared with income and other prices for what we’ll call real reasons    But I am still puzzled by why, since people are both wealth holders and have to buy housing   services, those whose homes have risen in relative value should spend more on other goods   because of that The only answer—the one that you’ve suggested and the one that seems to   work—is the conversion of unrealized capital gains to realized gains  But it makes me   uncomfortable to base so much on this conversion, of just switching the gains to money  I   realize the empirical studies go against me  But I am just uncomfortable that the refinancing of   housing should be the source of so much of the support for our recovery  In any case, I do think   it is a weak reed So, I’m not going to quarrel with anything you said, but I’m just puzzled by it   and uneasy with it     Either that or a true idiot!  [Laughter]      Ben was saying earlier that he had read the transcripts of some recent   meetings and there was a lot of laughter but he didn’t hear much laughter today  I said it comes   later in the meeting!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m gradually changing my mind about   the economic outlook  For most of the year that outlook has been moderate to weak  Monetary   policy has been accommodative, and we have felt that this accommodative policy would be              September 24, 2002 61 of 115  sufficient to restore economic health  For most of the year the recovery has been sputtering, with   some good data and some bad data  But we have persuaded ourselves that we are, in the end, on   track for a complete recovery  Perhaps so, but the recovery date has been pushed further and   further into the future In the Greenbook, for example, even though the near-term spending data   were a bit stronger than anticipated, the staff actually lowered the forecast slightly  The high   spending for autos and housing was not enough to make up for the lingering and perhaps chronic   weakness in nonresidential structures and communications equipment  The international   economy is weakening—again not dramatically but steadily—in places such as Europe and   Japan On the anecdotal side there is plenty of negative evidence in the Beige Book and in other   reports we’ve received from the Reserve Banks, including what almost every President has said   today   One implication of this mixed picture is that the Committee may have gotten lulled to   sleep We have been looking for the smoking gun of a double-dip recession  We haven’t seen it,   and we have contented ourselves with a moderately performing economy for a longer and longer   time  Evidence in favor of this claim comes from an examination of successive Greenbook   forecasts In March the Greenbook baseline case was for a 2003 unemployment rate of   53 percent It was raised to 54 percent in May, 55 percent in June, 57 percent in August, and   now is over 6 percent in this month’s Greenbook  The date of return to full employment has   gone from 2003 in the March forecast until sometime in 2005 in the current Greenbook  We   have been tolerating a longer and longer period of less than full employment  Of course, the fact   that the forecast output gap has changed suggests that we can’t forecast it perfectly  Indeed we   can’t But how should we interpret this fact?  We know that output is at less than full   employment levels by most reasonable measures right now  Do we see anything on the horizon         September 24, 2002 62 of 115  that restores full employment in any reasonable period?  The staff certainly doesn’t, except in   one of their simulation scenarios  Almost every speaker today didn’t seem to see anything, and I   don’t either   The evidence is less dramatic on the inflation side but still points in the same direction   The forecast in March for the core PCE in 2003 was 14 percent  That has been written down   only slightly to 13 percent this month  But the future forecast for the core PCE shows a steady   if small reduction in core inflation in the next few years, arguably ending up below some   reasonable inflation-targeting level  This leads to a situation in which unemployment is high   now and does not seem to be getting lower while inflation is low now and seems to be getting   lower still Believing, unlike Jack Guynn, that lower interest rates would stimulate spending, it   seems to me that if a 175 percent funds rate was appropriate earlier in the year, as we all   believed then, it is too high now Our basic dual mandate would seem to argue for a reduction in   the funds rate This reduction would have to be explained as forward-looking policy—not a   response to this quarter’s strong growth but to expectations of future softness and a response that   is not directed at the acute problem of a double-dip recession but at the chronic problem of a   prolonged output gap We could buttress the case by invoking negative uncertainties and   insurance policies, but I would argue the case even if I felt that the baseline Greenbook forecast   were perfectly accurate, with only garden variety negatives     One could raise several objections to this recommendation  Let me briefly consider   three One is that long rates are near a floor and won’t drop  Since the last FOMC meeting, long   rates have declined 30 to 40 basis points Both the nominal and real long rates are dropping    Inflation and inflationary expectations are dropping  Why is 3½ percent a floor level to long   rates? I just don’t buy this stickiness argument; I think we could budge long rates down, and I           September 24, 2002 63 of 115  think that would help the economy  And for those who worry about the zero bound, remember   that one important lesson of the literature on the subject is that it’s important to get rates down   early and fast   A second objection is that monetary expansion raises those types of spending that are   already strong We’d all prefer it if there were some way to stimulate the laggard types of   investment spending  But outside of tax measures, and even they may have a limited impact,   there doesn’t seem to be much we can do directly about that  Short of working on investment   directly, I think we have no choice but to work on the investment accelerator indirectly   Lastly, let me say a word about military risks  There’s incredible uncertainty about those   risks We don’t know what kind of conflagration, if any, there might be with Iraq  Nor do we   know what any such conflagration would do to oil prices or whether it should force us to raise or   lower interest rates  One can come up with scenarios on all sides of this issue  But whatever the   case, a military event would be a discreet event, as was September 11  If we were to meet the   next day to size up the risks and change policy, nobody would question that  Therefore, I think   we can leave that set of uncertainties for the future and get on with making policy for today’s   situation To me that says we ought to cut rates  Thank you     Is that house for sale?     No, I’m just pointing out that there’s a bubble     I can be very patient with those who have more patience than I have,   [laughter] but I’m afraid I’ve seen enough evidence of weakness already     Could I ask Dave a question?  Suppose it’s true that there is extra   immigration?  Wouldn’t that tend to show up in the employer survey and not the household   survey?      It won’t show up in the household survey, we know that  But   whether it shows up in the employer survey is not clear to me     So it’s hard to see how it would resolve Bob’s question     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I won’t belabor the evidence of present   day weakness, but let me look ahead and ask what I think is an important question  It is, What is   going to drive the economy?  In the late 1990s it was investment; more recently it has been   consumption and housing  What’s next?  I can’t find much  Consumption has held up well until   now, but evidence of collapse lies all around us  Auto sales were high through August but   dropped sharply in September and October Non-auto consumption spending was strong through   July but has barely grown since then Consumer confidence has dropped sharply as has the   wealth-income ratio, kicking into consumption functions right about now  Personal saving rates   are beginning their long anticipated rise  Housing, too, has held up well until now, but the staff   has forecast it to drop off next year largely because of stock adjustment considerations   Fiscal policy could provide an expansionary boost, and indeed one does hear that fiscal   policy is accommodative  But what one really should hear is that fiscal policy used to be   accommodative; it’s not particularly so now  The staff computes a measure of the fiscal impetus         November 6, 2002 68 of 122  of the federal budget, cyclically adjusted, with each budget component weighted by its likely   impact on spending  This measure rose to a peak with the spending increases and tax cuts in the   first half of the year but now has dropped back about three-quarters of the way toward neutrality,   where it stays roughly through the end of the forecast period  Fiscal policy is not restrictive, but   it’s not nearly as expansionary as it was; and everybody knows that at the state and local level   budget policies will have to be quite restrictive this year   Conceivably exports could provide a boost to the expansion, but this doesn’t appear very   likely either  The staff is now projecting that foreign output growth will be less over the forecast   period They have an export income elasticity of 1, so exports should be at best a neutral factor   Perhaps the impetus to demand can come from business fixed investment; it may   eventually, but it’s not likely to happen soon  Real business fixed investment has or is slated to   drop in every quarter of 2002 before beginning to grow again next year  In terms of the forecast   for next year, it is sobering to go back and check the Greenbook forecasts on business fixed   investment; they’ve been steadily lowered by fairly large amounts since last March     None of this changes the fundamental economics of the picture  When the capital   overhang developed, capital investment spending was expected to be weak for a while, and the   length and depth of the slowdown would depend on how well other types of spending filled the   gap Housing has filled the gap admirably up to now  Consumption filled it until late summer    Fiscal policy helped for a while  But until investment comes back, there seems to be nothing to   drive the economy at this point  Hence, it seems quite reasonable to forecast, as the staff does, a   continuation of output gaps, slowly rising unemployment, and slowly falling inflation  Whether   the continued high levels of unemployment or the possible early onset of deflation are more   worrisome, I leave to the listener to decide         November 6, 2002 69 of 122  Much of that commentary would have been considered radical a short time ago but it is   now fairly standard The new question is whether at these low interest rates further monetary   expansion will help lift the economy out of the doldrums  There are inversions between short   and long rates, and maybe we have a situation where short rates can be cut without much impact   on long rates or on the economy  I think not, for several reasons   Inversions can come about from various types of market imperfections or changes in   expectations  But the usual reason is inflation  In this scenario, commonly attributed to Milton   Friedman but perhaps more appropriately to Henry Thornton—I got that from Bill Poole—   [laughter] lower short rates imply an increase in money growth and higher permanent inflation    The key link is to higher permanent rates of inflation  But it is simply hard for me to see how a   modest monetary expansion at this point could generate much inflation  Moreover, even if cuts   in short rates just lower long rates a bit—as they may, given the present low levels of long   rates—that bit may be quite important  Long-lived assets such as common stock or investment   goods are valued by dividing the stream of earnings by the long rate  And at low levels small   changes can have big effects on valuations Because of this year’s stock market declines,   forward earnings-price ratios are now back to levels well above the long-term real interest rate,   and some rise in stock values, perhaps as a result of monetary expansion, should not be   unexpected But we could also see reduced default rates, drops in credit spreads affecting lowly   rated borrowers, and further declines in mortgage rates  Even the mighty dollar could finally fall   if our short and long rates drop Reflecting a point that Don Kohn first made and that Roger   Ferguson talked about a minute ago, economists at Goldman Sachs point out that, because of the   dollar and the stock market, their index of overall financial conditions indicates that monetary   conditions actually are tighter now than when we first started easing back in early 2001  One            November 6, 2002 70 of 122  may not buy this claim entirely, but it still seems likely that at the margin further rate cuts should   be expansionary   Obviously, we’re making policy under uncertainty here  The economy is buffeted by   new and not well understood factors, and interest rates are well out of their historical ranges  We   cannot be certain that the economy is too weak, though I feel pretty strongly that it is  We   cannot be certain that further money ease would help, though I feel pretty strongly that it would    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support a cut of 50 basis points I’m   delighted to support 50 I, frankly, would have a modest preference to retain the asymmetry in   the risk statement because I think to go 50 and move to balance makes us look too confident that   we understand the situation It seems as though we’re saying about the patient, the sick   economy, that we’re going to do this, and certainly that ought to be enough for you!  And it may   look too fancy, as if we’re trying to fine-tune the dosage  But this is not a big issue with me, and   I’ve had enough of being a curmudgeon; so I’ll support the 50 and a balanced risk statement    [Laughter]     Just on that point, could I ask Bob a question?  I read somewhere last   night that, even if California laid off all its public employees, that would cut the deficit only by   two-thirds Can that be right  Have you seen that number?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting, short-term interest   rates were arguably too high and the outlook for aggregate demand too weak  There was a lot to   talk about By this meeting, there has been some adjustment on both sides  Both the Fed and the   ECB have lowered short-term rates by 50 basis points since our last meeting  The economic   outlook seems clearly stronger here and not much weaker in Europe And even the latter   development is saying something because the general pattern this year has been to downgrade         December 10, 2002 53 of 87  the European forecast pretty sharply  While it’s much too soon to tell, at this point monetary   policy might be positioned about right to induce a sustained recovery  Even the neutral bias   looks pretty good to me now  Nothing is crying out to be changed, and there doesn’t seem to be   much to talk about today This is one of those meetings that could have been canceled!    [Laughter] But it wasn’t canceled, so let me take my time to point out an interesting contrast and   to pose a thought-provoking potential dilemma involving the so-called jobless recovery   The term “jobless recovery” was introduced into the lexicon ten years ago with the   recovery of the early 1990s, largely to make a political point  But in terms of all the labor   market indicators—payroll employment, help wanted, total hours worked, the employment-to­  population ratio, and the unemployment rate—there are quite striking similarities between the   jobless recovery that began in March 1991 and the one that seems to have begun in December   2001, also with negligible job growth   While the job patterns have been quite similar in the two recoveries, there is an   interesting difference The 1991 recovery was characterized by higher inflation and a less   accommodative monetary policy than we have now  Remember, that was still the time of   opportunistic disinflation Fiscal policy actually was tightened for most of the recovery period   because of deficit fears  Productivity was strong but not as strong as it has been this year  At   least in a relative sense, the 1991 recovery now looks like one partly constrained by   policymakers who were, in turn, looking at inflation and deficits, with productivity playing a   secondary role   The policy constraints seem absent this time around  Almost everybody feels that   monetary policy should be less constrained by inflation  Indeed, since the projected   unemployment rate is in excess of NAIRU throughout the recovery, the staff is actually            December 10, 2002 54 of 87  forecasting inflation to decline  Earlier we were promoting opportunistic disinflation  Now   we’re worried that we may get too much disinflation    As for fiscal policy, as a long time fan of higher national saving, I am personally quite   nervous that long-term fiscal austerity goals may be dismissed from the policy agenda  They are   being deemphasized at least, if not dismissed altogether  This means that fiscal policy has been   and is likely to be much more accommodative than in 1991, with aggregate demand growing   more rapidly The jobless part of the jobless recovery is therefore not a policy story, as it was   last time, but rather comes from the incredible performance of productivity     This interesting contrast between the two jobless recoveries then leads to a potential   quandary for us On one side, vigorous productivity growth and declining inflation would argue   for us to be quite slow to raise interest rates as the economy recovers  On the other side, fiscal   policy might well become highly expansionary in the recovery period, in stark contrast to the   1991 pattern  In this case, overall policy might easily become too accommodative, and the Fed   might have to take on its traditional role of removing the punch bowl—a question to ponder as   we look ahead Thank you     Let me just say on this issue that I don’t think anybody has to   apologize for not using the model ultra-precisely  I always look at the perfect foresight   simulations, and the main thing I was worried about this time was what would happen if we   lowered rates now Would that be consistent with the outcome that we would like in the long   run?  So if we don’t lower rates all the way to the level suggested by the simulation, that doesn’t   worry me so much  I think our policy has been roughly consistent with this model  We’ve   lowered the funds rate, and then at some point we will raise it  The fact that we’re not right on   the button I don’t think is as much a story as is the fact that we are doing roughly what this   model would suggest     I’m glad I get at least one vote  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After starting the year off strongly, the   economy seems to have taken another stumble in February  The list of disappointing economic   reports since our last meeting is long  the jobs report, consumer confidence, retail sales, auto   production, industrial production, earnings forecasts, state and local budgets, and now housing   starts  The Greenbook authors have taken ½ point off the growth forecast for both the first and   second halves of the year  Blue Chip forecasts also have been lowered  Foreign growth has   been written down  Of course, the uncertainty about the military situation is or could be at the   root of all of this  Forecasts these days seem to hinge on a few critical exogenous assumptions,   with everything else being endogenous  In today’s situation, for example, I can imagine two   vastly different scenarios all starting from one or two changed assumptions     One I’ll call the “green” scenario after the Greenbook and Greenspan  [Laughter]  I’m   going to replay Cathy’s comments a bit here but a little muted  Lifting away the military   uncertainty, the Greenbook base case is actually rather optimistic  Oil prices are high now but   drop down in that forecast in line with futures markets  The stock market is at least in neutral    Fiscal policy is very expansionary  Consumption is reasonably strong with saving rates staying   low to normal  High-tech investment is already slated to grow in the first half of the year, and   the rest of investment soon follows  The output gap rises for a while and then starts dropping   March 18, 2003 57 of 101    pretty sharply  If one splices onto this a more ebullient stock market, which we may already   have seen some of, it’s easy to imagine a fairly bullish scenario—one in which further policy   action is probably not required and, indeed, may even have to be reversed at some point     At the same time, I can change one or two assumptions and get an altogether different   scenario  Oil prices in fact don’t come down, perhaps because of the damage to the oil wells in   Iraq combined with Venezuela not returning to full production and the apparently low level of   inventories  Natural gas prices stay high and keep electricity prices high  For whatever reason,   the stock market stumbles yet again, and wealth values don’t recover  Saving rates rise more   than forecast, and the lessened accelerator effect limits the growth of investment in the context of   continuing capital overhang  Budget deficits soar, and fiscal expansion is limited  The dollar   falls and hurts the economies of Europe, Latin America, and Japan without doing ours much   good  Monetary policy makers in these other countries are hamstrung either by real constraints   or imagined constraints    The differences between these two scenarios are not all that large—hinging on a few   exogenous assumptions about oil prices, stock prices, and confidence in general  At this point   we really can’t forecast these critical magnitudes very well, and it makes sense to sit on the   sidelines for a while  It is quite possible that the critical magnitudes will become much clearer in   a short time and we will be in a better position to act  But as Dave Stockton suggested, it’s also   quite possible that the critical magnitudes will not clear up very rapidly and we will have to go   back to making policy under extreme uncertainty  The best approach then may not be to wait   until all significant uncertainties have clarified, but I leave those puzzles until another day    Thank you     I support the recommendations  I’d like to say three other things    First, I actually buy the Knightian uncertainty analogy and using that as a rationale for deferring   the announcement of our judgment on the balance of risks  Second, as Dave pointed out, there is   a strong possibility that in fact we’re not going to know that much very soon for various reasons   that have come up around the table, and I think we want to guard against making uncertainty   disabling  That is, in my view we ought to have a call in a few weeks, and we ought to be   thinking about acting even in the presence of continued Knightian uncertainty  The situation   may not be convertible to nice probability distributions, but we may still have to act  I believe   that we ought to prepare ourselves for that possibility mentally  My third point is that the funds   rate is low; and if it goes down any more, it will get lower still  [Laughter]  I’m just trying to lay   this out in small steps! [Laughter]  If it gets down much lower, we’re soon going to have to   confront the alternative or untraditional measures that we’ve been telling ourselves we have in   our quiver that we can use in such circumstances  It’s not too soon to start thinking about what   we’re going to do and also what we will look at to know how well we are doing  I believe we   have to think about both and fairly soon    March 18, 2003 79 of 101      Now for the high moment of the day, what are you going to read?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I didn’t deliberately set out to be the last   speaker today  I was just a little slow getting on Norm’s list     One might liken the economy today to early spring in Michigan  One can see some scilla   here, some spring beauties there, and trillium over there  Ah, one says, “Spring is coming!”    True, it is coming, but there are still three inches of snow covering the yard!  [Laughter]  There   are a number of bright spots in the recent data, and previous speakers have mentioned all of   them, so I will pass over them in the interest of time  Bright spots aside, we should not forget   that we need to see many signs of spring before we conclude that warm weather is here to stay    Moreover, despite the bright spots, there are still some not-so-bright spots  Industrial production   is down again; the workweek is down; the state and local fiscal situation looks ever more dire;   and foreign growth seems to get revised down every time we hear about it     The baseline in the Greenbook forecast incorporates much of what is known about   spending demands in the near term in the framework of a structural model that has a good   forecasting record  As the Greenbook forecasters will be the first to admit, they need to see a lot   of good news to bring about the healthy growth implied by the Greenbook forecast for the latter   half of this year and all of next year  This growth is healthier than that in the Blue Chip forecast   by ½ point this year and a full point next year  But even this reasonably optimistic forecast   leaves continuing output gaps and an unemployment rate of 56 percent by the end of next year    Indeed, even if investment were to be stronger than anticipated, the output gap would still persist   May 6, 2003 69 of 115    because, the way the Greenbook forecast is done nowadays, both aggregate demand and   aggregate supply are raised in response to a positive investment shock     Over the past several years we have often had a situation where output looked weak and   inflation benign  We would typically argue that we could pursue one part of our mandate, output   growth, without sacrificing the other, stable prices  One arrow seemed to be pointed down, and   one was in neutral  Today, however, as many of you said, that is not the case  Now inflation has   fallen to dangerously low levels, and both arrows are pointed down  Evidence of the   disinflationary dangers is widespread  The Greenbook probability of deflation has risen to   35 percent, which is getting pretty close to even odds by my count  The increase in the key   market component of core PCE inflation has dropped very sharply, with the index essentially flat   for the last three months  It is possible that this high-frequency reading will not be sustained,   and it’s also possible—as the Chairman, for one, suspects—that this measure is inordinately   influenced by declines in the value of rental housing  But taking out the influence of rents,   growth in the market component is still dropping, as is growth in the overall core PCE  In terms   of my own desires, the core PCE is now growing at a rate that is arguably below the band that I   personally would be comfortable with over the longer run  Non-oil commodity prices are very   cyclical, but they’ve been moving down recently; and, of course, oil prices are way down  Both   measures of wage change are growing at low rates in the latest data  All of these are current   measures  With output gaps forecast to persist, measures of inflation are likely to drop further    As I said, both of the arrows reflecting our mandates are pointed down   So, what to do?  Many of us I think have already made a strong case for easing policy   right now  At the same time, there are market uncertainties  There is some chance that the war   was a big factor in holding down spending and some possibility that this damping influence has   May 6, 2003 70 of 115    already been lifted  So there is some chance that we will soon start to see better spending data    I, for one, would like to see much better spending data  We should never let uncertainty become   an excuse for prolonged inaction  We might let it be grounds for a slight further delay  Here I   would support Tom Hoenig in the view that a slight further delay would also give us more time   to organize our whole strategy in this new non-inflationary atmosphere  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, on inflation itself I would certainly   agree that, if asset prices are not declining, there is less financial risk than if they were    However, we should keep in mind—though I have to think more about this—that, if goods prices   are declining, then the real cost of capital is rising and I think we still have the classic zero bound   problem  So it is better if asset prices are rising as opposed to declining, but I don’t believe that   solves our problem with deflation  I do want to reflect on this more, but that’s my initial—      My second point is that I definitely don’t want to blunder about when   markets are fragile  I think we have to be very careful about this whole issue, but we should also   recognize that markets aren’t exogenous either  Markets are influenced by what we say and do    So if for whatever reason there is not sufficient expectation that we would take a policy action   May 6, 2003 86 of 115    today, that’s fine  But in my view we have to start building the case regarding what we are about   in the longer run  So I can go along with the kind of policy that you’re suggesting, Mr   Chairman, but I wouldn’t go along with you forever on this, and indeed I know you don’t want   me or anybody else to go along with you forever     Purely on the statement—and virtually everybody has commented on this today—I think   we have to unbundle the risks in the way that this draft statement does  I strongly support that   part of your recommendation  I do have to be honest, though, and tell you that I have some   qualms about the “taken together” sentence because it’s akin to adding up the risks for pears and   adding up the risks for apples and putting them together  I’m uneasy about that, but I have no   bright ideas for what to do about it today  The proposed wording is as good as anything I can   think of today  But if I were placing a bet, I would bet that the language would need to be   altered in three years when Roger’s swan gets even a little more eloquent and beautiful       Just on this debate  Al, I think the problem is that wording the   statement the way you suggest actually moves us quite a distance toward inflation targeting    Many people around the table have different views regarding the desirability of inflation   targeting  I know where you are  I know where Ben is and where many others are  We should   not get to the issue of inflation targeting at 100 pm at the end of a long meeting  I think it is a   quite reasonable issue to discuss in some detail next time  But we can’t do it quickly at this   point       I don’t have an insight  I have a question  I’ve been worried about   this increasingly as our meetings have gotten longer  What happens if we’re not done at   215 pm, the time we usually release the press statement?     We don’t commit to a time?     So it’s easier to go beyond the typical time period on that end than it   is on the other?     That’s why we need lawyers     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The criticism of the Fed over the   intermeeting period has been as intense as at any time since I’ve been here  Have we lost our   touch, or are we dealing with a complicated set of new issues?   While obviously I’m biased, my   vote is for the complicated set of issues     I see four major ones  Number 1  There has been a huge positive productivity shock    According to the NBER, the recent positive shock seems to be slightly greater than the one that   occurred in the late 1940s  To find one as large one has to go all the way back to 1917  Number   2  There has been a jobless recovery  Note that final sales actually grew 34 percent in the   second quarter, at a time when everybody was complaining about the soft economy and dropping   employment  We did have another jobless recovery in the early ’90s, but that jobless recovery   was of a very different nature  Number 3  Inflation is threatening to go below our target range    Inflation did get as low as it is currently a few times in the ’20s and ’30s, but in the modern era   that has happened only once for a brief period in 1955  Number 4  We are trying to explain   everything to the public  As far as I can tell, this has never happened in such a complicated   environment  So we have four quite rare events interacting with each other, and the combination   makes for a tricky interplay of policy and communication  As an illustration of the confusion, I   August 12, 2003 61 of 110    quote from one of the news clips that I received just yesterday “Treasury notes fell on   speculation that the Fed will say economic growth is accelerating, boosting expectations the Fed   will raise interest rates in coming quarters”  Were there to be a jobless recovery in the presence   of a positive productivity shock and declining inflation, it is quite possible that an optimizing   central bank should respond by lowering interest rates, not raising them  Other such anomalies   can be easily imagined     Apart from lamenting our fate of having to explain all of this, what should we actually be   doing about monetary policy?  I think the matter boils down to three questions we must ask   ourselves  My questions are a little different from Roger’s questions and are differently   organized  The first question is sustainability  Does the fledgling recovery need more juice to   sustain itself?  The second question is vigor  Will the recovery need more juice to get aggregate   demand all the way back to full employment reasonably soon?  The third question is inflation    Will inflation fall below our target range in the meantime?  Unlike a traditional situation in   which the issue confronting a central bank might be that of determining when to raise rates as a   recovery proceeds, in this case if the answer to any of these questions becomes “yes,” we ought   to be lowering rates instead  That said, tentatively at this point I would not answer “yes” to any   of the questions     As for sustainability and vigor, consumption and housing have remained strong    Investment is beginning to pick up steam, and inventories are thin  Government spending will be   high and rising for a while yet  At this point the recovery looks as if it should be sustainable and   vigorous, even if it has been so long delayed  Whether more juice will be needed at some point   is a question that we can’t really answer right now       August 12, 2003 62 of 110    As for inflation, core PCE inflation is flirting dangerously with what I think most of us   would consider the bottom of an acceptable range for inflation, about 1 percent a year  There   would seem to be a clear risk that prolonged output gaps will lower inflation further  But that   eventuality doesn’t seem to be in anybody’s forecast, either in the baseline Greenbook forecast   or the other fifty-four Blue Chip forecasts, none of which has inflation falling below our   presumed target range  I might note, though, that two of the alternative scenario Greenbook   forecasts do have this result  According to the staff, at these levels inflation generally responds   quite sluggishly to output gaps  And the standard forecast is that the expected narrowing of   output gaps will ward off the proverbial unwelcome substantial drop in inflation     The summary of all this is that, while the unusual combination of events makes it   inappropriate in my view for us to behave like a central bank that would traditionally be raising   rates in a recovery, there doesn’t seem to be enough present evidence of the need to lower them   either  I guess that means we should sit tight for now  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support both parts of your   recommendation  I think if we did anything other than keep the negative bias today, the funds   market would go even crazier, and long rates would back up even more  I just don’t see how we   can do that     I’m probably the only one here who is not particularly looking forward to the September   discussion [laughter] because I’m not sure I see my way through it  I guess I should confess that   it’s partly because my wife has been telling me for forty years now that I don’t communicate   particularly well  [Laughter]  So I have that adverse mental association with the whole concept     I just find this a very hard issue to address  First, on the statement itself I have expressed   my reservations before about adding up or balancing the output risk and the inflation risk  I’ve   always had that problem  Second, I think the phrase “the probability, though minor, of an   unwelcome substantial fall in inflation” may have served us well a couple of months ago, but as   the probability of this substantial fall gets more and more minor, that sentence is going to have to   be changed  And I’m not sure how to do that  The third problem is that any time we change   anything in this paragraph, even a comma, there is a huge market reaction  The way the market   reacts even to minor inflections of what we say scares me  So I think that’s a real problem in   trying to communicate and be honest about what we think   Along with many of you, I share the reluctance to pre-commit to a future policy course    However, I’m on the side of Governors Bernanke and Kohn in feeling that we probably do have   to get into this issue a little in terms of explaining our assessment of the outlook  At some point,   the way we do it now is not going to work—and maybe that point has come already—but I just   don’t know how best to change our approach  This whole process takes place in a fishbowl  So   I find the topic very difficult and depressing, and I don’t look forward to discussing it  Sorry   August 12, 2003 83 of 110      No, I think we have to do this, but I just don’t see how to do it       I’d like to say that in my previous statement I attacked the summary   paragraph, but I agree that it’s much better this time  It elaborates our assessment of the situation   in a more realistic way     I’ll suggest a compromise  A lot of people do word counts on these   statements—count how often a particular word is used  I think we can convey Roger’s sense of   the message in that last sentence but cut down the use of the word “disinflation” by one, by   dropping “aimed at raising” all the way through to “disinflation”  In other words, Roger wants to   convey that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period, and we can do   that without all these words and without raising the word count on disinflation  So my first point   is to offer that as a compromise  Second, I actually like this sentence, but procedurally I would   not be upset if we waited until next time, after we really think through all the implications, to   include it  So my first preference would be just to drop the phrase I mentioned, and my second   choice would be to hold it over until next time       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m glad that you called on me now   because, the longer this meeting goes, the more balls there are up in the air and we’re going to   have an unstable equilibrium!  First off, on the process I’m a status quo man  I think the system   we have is pretty good  We can fix it up, which I guess puts me somewhere between   alternatives 4 and 5  I would like to leave the minutes alone The one suggestion I’ve heard that   I think could improve the process is to put more of the statement in the Bluebook  I think that’s   a good idea  It could be done without cost, and we ought to start doing it as soon as possible    Indeed, it was already done for this meeting     September 15, 2003 55 of 78    On the statement itself, I view the “considerable period” sentence as a special addition   that was appropriate for the conditions at the time  Although in general we ought to have a fairly   formulaic approach to the statement, from time to time statements like that are useful  So I hope   we don’t put ourselves in a position that we could never have them  We know we’re going to   have to take that sentence out at some point—presumably fairly soon—and we’ll have to deal   with that  But I thought that statement did work  So while I basically favor being fairly   formulaic about this, I think every now and then we have to do something that is less   standardized   On the “sustainable economic growth” sentence, there may be an interpretation about   economic growth that does not create imbalances, but that’s not how the sentence reads the way   it’s written  It says, “The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the   attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal”   It’s entirely about   speed limits and not about the size of the output gap  We may think the sentence means   something else, but that just isn’t what the sentence says; and I think we can do better  I’d   convert it to more of an output gap type of sentence     I’ll make just one more comment, and that is about inflation targeting  That raises a   whole new set of issues, and I think we shouldn’t talk about it now but maybe at the meeting in   January  I will raise one issue here, however, and that is that I’m not sure it’s up to us to   announce an inflation target—even a soft range—on our own  I think we might well have to go   to the Congress for that  That does make me shudder but, on the other hand, we may be   interpreting our charter a little too aggressively if we set an inflation target  I can see how   having a clear target range could help us, but that raises a huge new set of complications, and I   think we really have to put that subject off  Thank you   September 15, 2003 56 of 78      Well, are you proposing to put economic growth and price stability   in the long run at the end of the sentence or are you proposing not to have it at all?     Right, so I think what you’re proposing is “a fostering of sustainable   economic growth and price stability in the long run,” which as President Poole points out is not   the language we’ve used up until now     Dave, you said one thing about productivity that puzzled me a little   You were talking about the apparent huge burst in productivity recently  The argument was that   there are some incentives to raise productivity, so firms have been doing it  Comparing now   with the late ’90s, labor was impossible to find—according to everybody who came and talked to   us—in the late ’90s  There was a chronic labor shortage  Now the reverse seems to be true  So   it would be a little puzzling to me if a shortage of workers were the reason productivity would   rise now  One would think productivity would have risen in the 1990s, when firms couldn’t find   September 16, 2003 23 of 106    workers and had to make do  Now there are workers all over the place  Have your people   thought about this issue at all?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as spending demands go,   everything looks good  The recovery seems to be proceeding in a healthy and balanced manner    Consumption has continued to be strong; personal saving rates have been fairly steady at around   4 percent; housing is strong—although it will be clipped some by the rise in mortgage rates—   investment in equipment and software has finally started to move; foreign economies and exports   are recovering; and inventories are lean  We all know what’s going on with federal government   spending  Virtually every forecaster seems to be revising upward these days, and nearly all of   the forecasters project healthy growth rates for the next year or so     So what’s our problem?  Two that I’ve worried about for the long run are the persistent   current account deficits and the growing budget deficits  Both in their separate ways could   severely burden or dislocate the economy down the road  But in the short run, the biggest puzzle   is the strange performance of employment  There has been much press commentary that, of   September 16, 2003 65 of 106    course, employment is a lagging indicator  In fact, that’s not true  Until the 1990s, employment   was considered a coincident indicator; and by normal postwar standards, employment growth   should have turned up several quarters ago  Employment did lag output in the recovery of the   early 1990s but not by nearly as much as today, as the evidence that Sandy gave earlier supports    As long as employment does lag, we can’t fully rest easy  Lagging employment could threaten   the sustainability of consumption, though as many of you point out, that argument is debatable    What I think is less debatable is that the implied output gaps could also pull inflation down   below our target range— the proverbial unwelcome fall in inflation     There’s both an optimistic and a pessimistic explanation for this unusual behavior of   employment  The optimistic explanation, which is more or less implicit in what most of you   have said today, is that the lag reflects a huge burst in productivity, which will benefit the   economy greatly down the road  The displaced workers will get back to work, output will rise,   and trend rates of productivity and economic growth should be higher     A potentially more pessimistic explanation has been featured recently in a JPMorgan   newsletter  The explanation focuses on high and rising labor costs  Basically, real wage rates   have grown at nearly normal rates, but benefit costs for health and retirement programs—notably   including payments to reduce the huge actuarial deficits that have sprung up in many firm   defined-benefit programs—have been rising sharply in real terms  Coupled with the generally   high level of the dollar, labor costs have also risen significantly relative to those of our trading   partners in tradable goods sectors  These rises in labor costs have damped hiring and have in   effect induced the high levels of labor productivity  If one looks at the picture this way, the   forced rise in productivity may not translate to such higher future productivity growth  But that’s   exactly what I asked Dave earlier, and he gave a more optimistic answer on that issue  Some   September 16, 2003 66 of 106    data from recent articles by staff members at both the New York and the Kansas City Federal   Reserve Banks shed some light on this issue  The authors find that, in contrast to earlier   recessions, a large share of the employment change in this recession is structural not cyclical    Temporary layoffs were not high in the downturn, and job losses from nontemporary layoffs are   high now  New hiring is sluggish, and longer-term unemployment is still rising this late in the   recovery period     I personally don’t know how much weight to put on this pessimistic interpretation  At   this point all we can really say is that hiring hasn’t picked up yet  The weight of past evidence   and virtually all forecasters, including our own, are predicting strong employment gains   throughout 2004  In this sense the smart money does seem to be on the fact that the so-called   jobless recovery of 2003 will eventually become a fleeting phenomenon  But central bankers are   paid to worry, and persisting employment reductions in the context of strong output gains do   provide at least one thing to worry about  Is there something different about this recovery?  How   long will hiring remain sluggish?  Will this sluggish hiring eventually translate to a rise in   NAIRU?  What does it really mean for productivity in the long run?  This set of worries can tide   us over until the twin deficits really give us something to worry about!  [Laughter]  Thank you     I’m about 0 for 27 in suggesting changes     I’m 1 for 27  In the last sentence, I don’t think we need the word   “considerable”  I think the sentence could be written more simply with something like this  “In   these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained until   disinflationary forces are contained”     Okay  I see your point  The complication is that this is a very   ungainly sentence, but I do see your point         I still like my sentence better, but I see your point  I’m not going to   make a big issue of that       Let me just propose another strategy here  It’s quite possible that by   next month we’re going to have balanced risks  If that is the case, then we’re going to have to do   a lot with this paragraph  This sentence could just drop by the wayside at that point, and it would   be one of many changes in the statement  So, we could leave the sentence alone today—have it   the same as it was last month—and then just drop it next month  Also, the point that Jack first   made and that others have also expressed is that mentioning disinflationary forces actually raises   the issue that you talked about last night  That is, the more we say “remote” possibility, the less   it is believed to be remote; and the more we say “disinflationary forces”—     Mr Chairman, before we talk about that, could I say a word about   my draft wording?     As I’ve said before, I’ve not fancied myself a communications   expert, so I do this a bit reluctantly  But the thing I’m increasingly having trouble with in our   statements is that our assessments of the economy are not benchmarked  As I said in my memo,   the phrase “sustainable growth” sometimes seems to mean that the economy is growing at the   normal rate, but that growth could be associated with any unemployment rate  Sometimes the   term means closing the output gap  In the top paragraph on page 10 of the Bluebook, Vincent   actually says that if the “sustainable economic growth” sentence means this, then one thing   follows, and if the sentence means something else, then another thing follows  We’re dealing   with enough uncertainties here without having uncertainty about what our own language means    I think we could clearly do better  With regard to inflation, describing it as rising or falling   doesn’t help me  I’d like to see our assessment of inflation compared with some desirable level    So I have suggested a version that attempts to put in benchmarks  That’s all it does; I   tried to stick with the rest of the language as much as possible  I have received a lot of favorable   comment on this by e-mail, though I won’t say from whom  You can speak for yourselves today,   but I think there’s a lot of interest in this  I was about to offer to host a donor’s conference to see   if we could get the language on this right  But it may be that Vincent’s procedural steps will take   care of that, and I’m happy to turn this back over to the staff  However, I think a key issue is   whether the Committee wants to benchmark the assessment of the economy  I very much do     May I respond to that?  I think the issue is not whether we get to full   employment in some reasonable period but how our policy is structured given the way we see   output relative to some objective  I see the issue as how best to say that we are trying to work in   a direction of expansion or contraction, whichever the case may be, but not in any sense   promising that we would achieve a goal  And I’d be perfectly symmetric with inflation  I would   say that we see inflation above the level we consider desirable or below it, and therefore our   policy is X  So I don’t think this approach contains a promise that we will get to a goal  But I   believe we can illuminate our actions by specifying the direction toward which we are working   and how we are trying to influence the economy  That is frankly what I do in making decisions   October 28, 2003 90 of 126    when I come to our meetings  If that’s what I do—and I think that’s what most of you do—then   it seems to me that we ought to be able to talk about it in those terms     I think so     I don’t see anything in here that commits us to any specific goal on   either the inflation side or the unemployment side  This actually replaces the statement that   growth has to proceed at a stable rate  All it says is that growth is proceeding at a rate that in our   view is consistent with the eventual—and maybe we ought to put in the word “eventual”—  attainment of maximum sustainable employment  I don’t think we have to say what that level of   employment is, and I don’t think we have to give an inflation target  We could, as Al suggested    But the way the statement is written I don’t think we have to  I intentionally wrote it in a way   that we could avoid giving specific numerical targets     Yes, that’s an issue  Believe me, I understand that   October 28, 2003 105 of 126      Yes, we’ll have just the first paragraph of the press release but not   the second paragraph     By the way, as author of the eloquent version of the second   paragraph, I would be perfectly happy to have that all supplanted by the minutes if there is a way   to do it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t have much to say this morning    We’ve planted the flowers  Now is the time to watch them grow  There are some risks that a   number of you have spoken about—for example, labor demand and where that is  One risk that   has not been discussed much is fiscal policy  The staff forecast has the fiscal effect declining   very sharply in 2004  It’s conceivable that, if our friends up on Capitol Hill get religion, some   tax cuts may not be extended and we could get some reaction even before then  It’s also   conceivable that, if they don’t get religion, we could see some adjustment in interest rates  So I   think that set of issues has some dangers   I had been a little worried about the timing because of the pattern of retail sales; growth   was very strong in July and August and weakened quite a bit in September  First, the numbers   could be revised  Second, the new orders statistics that we got this morning and the strength in   housing seem to belie any September weakness, so there may be no particular problem in that   pattern  There are some risks, but basically, to return to my previous metaphor, the flowers seem   to be growing at a healthy rate, and I don’t think we ought to change either our policy or our   approach  With that I’m going to obey Dave Stockton’s earlier injunction and cede time—  hopefully a little to myself—for the discussion on communication policy     That’s another reason for not using the term, by the way  [Laughter]     I concur       I’ll try to be quick  In terms of writing a relatively formulaic   statement with few moving parts, which as you know I tried to do last time, what happens is that   all sorts of difficulties arise  People ask, what are you going to do about this problem?  What are   you going to do about that problem?  I don’t want to be so clear on this issue or on that issue    And the statement just gets more complicated and murkier  So, frankly, I don’t think that kind of   statement is going to work   My second point is that this group should not think of the minutes as a panacea  It’s a   separate issue  We might get them out sooner, but even if we do, we’re still going to have to   issue a statement on the day of the meeting  The world is going to want a bottom line, and either   we can give it, or somebody else will give it  So I’d just propose, as Roger suggested, that we   treat that as a separate issue and deal with the post-meeting statement as best we can   Third, there may be an attractive alternative to the options in the material Roger passed   out  It is exactly what we did today—to issue a short statement after every meeting  We vote on   it and go forward  What happens is that the situations we face are so checkered and tailored and   different that it’s hard to design a formula with few moving parts that will work for every   meeting  If we want to give a statement, it has to be reflective of what we think  That’s the type   of statement we agreed on today—a short statement that describes what we think is going on in   the economy  If we were to do that, I would say that the statement should be short—no more   than seven or eight sentences  I personally would recommend that we have a compulsory half-  hour period to read a draft of the statement and think about it  We shouldn’t rush and just ram it   through  We can actually try to do something democratic and then talk about it  This will result   in longer meetings, and that’s all right with me  I don’t have any more tolerance for meetings   December 9, 2003 115 of 133    than I think most of you have  But we are setting interest rates that will have an influence   throughout the world economy  It just may take us another two hours to do that       Thank you, Mr Chairman  It can be very frustrating when one’s   intuition does not square with the results of one’s models  College football has this problem   right now  [Laughter]  It should be obvious to everybody that USC is the best team, but when   the model builders try to develop a system that weighs whom each team beats, the strength of   opponents on the schedule, and other variables, they get the wrong answer  I can see a similar   problem coming up for us, if not today then fairly soon     Compared with most of 2003, the economy seems clearly to have turned  Almost every   forecaster is now quite optimistic, and for two months the data have consistently exceeded   expectations  Even Friday’s labor report, viewed as lukewarm, could be interpreted as fairly   December 9, 2003 70 of 133    strong with the rise of self-employment and the rise in hours  And the slight decline in   manufacturing employment coupled with strong manufacturing productivity implies a sharp rise   in industrial production  Given all this and given my feeling that at the previous turning point,   November 2000, the FOMC may have been a bit slow to recognize a downturn, it is important   that we stay ahead of the curve  It is way too soon to start raising rates, but it may not be too   soon to change some of our rhetoric and even go toward a neutral bias That’s what my intuition   says     As for the models, let me use the output and inflation building blocks the way the   Bluebook does in the chart on page 10  For the output side, the staff forecast shows an economy   clearly pointed in the right direction  Over the next few quarters, growth should proceed at a rate   that exceeds the trend level, enough to be ultimately consistent with maximum sustainable   employment  Note the familiar words  There are both upside and downside risks, of course, but   overall output risks seem balanced   On the inflation side things get trickier  My own preferred target range for core PCE   inflation, for which I cited my reasoning in a speech I gave a few weeks ago, is from 1 to   2½ percent  By that standard, inflation is now near the bottom of the target range  Will it   increase or decrease?  On the one side, output gaps are large, imparting downward pressure  On   the other side, output growth is rapid, imparting upward pressure if there are speed limit effects    To compare these pressures, one can first look at historical data  In the early 1980s we had   almost exactly the same situation, large output gaps and rapid growth  Inflation definitely fell in   that episode, as Dave Stockton noted earlier  Another place to look is at price–cost margins    These are currently very high, leading to an expectation that price growth could be soft  A third   place to look is at the staff regressions explaining prices or wages or both  As usual, the staff has   December 9, 2003 71 of 133    lots and lots of regression models  All of them have strong negative gap effects; some have zero   speed limit effects; and others have small and generally insignificant speed limit effects  Rapid   growth does seem to drive up commodity prices but not overall prices or wages, at least not very   much  The clear verdict here is that output gaps impart powerful downward forces on inflation   whereas speed limits impart weak upward forces  This means that inflation should be more   likely to decline than to rise  This, by the way, is essentially the argument that the Wall Street   Journal this morning criticized Governors Ferguson and Bernanke for making  If the Wall Street   Journal editorial page criticizes an argument, there must be some merit to it!  [Laughter]     Since core inflation is already near the bottom of my preferred range and is more likely to   drop than increase, that should show up as a negative bias for the inflation term  A negative for   inflation and a neutral for output should lead to an overall negative  But my intuition suggests   that the overall bias should be neutral  That’s the difference between intuitions and models    How to resolve this?  One possibility, as Dave mentioned earlier, involves some of the upside   risks on inflation coupled with the foreign exchange risk that we mentioned and the oil price risk   the Chairman mentioned  Another possibility is that, although the inflation bias is still negative,   it is moving toward neutrality, as is the overall bias  Whatever the case, I think we ought to start   preparing the world     I think I’m speaking for most of us when I say that I hope this table   doesn’t get more complicated than it is  [Laughter]     No, I haven’t, and I don’t want to!     Well, I support the recommendation  As I said, I have a hard time   getting the right flavor, given the logic of the table that Brian has in exhibit 2  My logic is that   we are in the northwest and we want to get to the northeast, or from low inflation as the   predominant concern to a balanced inflation risk assessment  I think the statement you propose   migrates us over  I’m not so sure it’s a bad idea—it might be a good idea—to get rid of that   overall balance of risks statement when it becomes very awkward, and this meeting may be one   of those times  So I think your recommendation has all of these elements, and I support it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I’d like to compliment the staff on   the new uncertainty calculations  It’s very important to have them because without them one   tends to measure uncertainty by comparing forecasts  Since forecasters talk to each other and   March 16, 2004 58 of 107    probably talk in terms of means, this what I’ll call “conversational approach” greatly understates   true uncertainty  Now the staff is giving formal statistical estimates of uncertainty  I like the   graphics, too, because we have an estimate of where the alternative simulations fit in these   uncertainty bounds   On the forecast itself, we may be getting to the end of a swing of upgrading  For the past   half-year or so, most data have come in ahead of expectations, and most forecasts were steadily   upgraded  This is the first meeting in some time where the Greenbook has actually downgraded   the forecast, albeit only slightly  The main reason, of course, was a disappointing employment   growth number, but some other indicators are showing a bit of weakness as well  While the   Greenbook forecasters have downgraded their estimates, the Blue Chip forecasters are not there   yet; they are still upgrading  This suggests a new way to evaluate forecasters—not only in terms   of group mean square errors but also in terms of how alert they are to picking up turning points    Since I’ve been here, I have a general sense that those preparing the Greenbook are pretty alert—  much more so than the Blue Chip forecasters—but this matter should be studied further    Moreover, it’s way too early to tell whether this recent downgrade is a mere blip or the start of   something more meaningful  Nevertheless, the new development certainly bears watching    Since the basic economic situation is so little changed, and since I speak after Don who   leaves me very little new to say, [laughter] there is not much to talk about here that has not   already been discussed many times over today or at a previous meeting  Let me focus instead on   the macro implications of an issue that all of a sudden has become hot politically—the potential   widening of the income distribution     Typically in recoveries, the income distribution closes, as lower-income workers gain   more than higher-income workers  This time it seems that the pattern will be reversed, as indeed   March 16, 2004 59 of 107    it was in the ’80s  Evidence that the income disparities will soon widen is all around us  Profits   are very high relative to wages  The Greenbook shows that the price markup on unit labor costs   is at a record high  The profit share of total output is at least at a cyclical peak, and wage growth   remains relatively sluggish  Based on data now available, I’m fairly sure that income disparities   will widen significantly in this recovery  This in turn raises the question of what impact that will   have  There seem to be widening disparities among households  From the financial statistics we   see that the wealth–income ratio is rising, but the financial obligation rate remains high, and   loan-delinquency rates have risen to a local high  From labor statistics we see that labor force   participation rates are dropping, mainly among groups likely to be affected by the cycle    Moreover, there’s a sharp rise in quit rates for those who gave up looking for a job because they   couldn’t find work  Similarly, the duration of unemployment is rising even as the overall   unemployment rate falls  There is a similar income-related disparity in consumer sentiment    Three years ago there was a 4 percentage point spread between consumer sentiment of median-  income families and low-income families; now that spread is closer to 10 points  Nearly as   much widening has been apparent on the high side of the scale  Whatever consumer sentiment   means—and I have never managed to figure out exactly what it does mean—low-income groups   now have a good deal less of it than high-income groups by a very great margin  [Laughter]   While it is easy to find evidence that income disparities are widening, it is harder to   identify macro implications of this shifting distribution  Imagine first that a dollar has shifted out   of wages and into profits  The marginal income tax rate for workers is 20 percent, and the   household marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 75 percent  These, by the way, are stylized   Research and Statistics Division estimates  So the drop in wages would lower consumption by   about 60 cents  If the marginal tax rate on profits is 35 percent and the wealth consumption   March 16, 2004 60 of 107    coefficient is 035, the 65 cent rise in profits would raise stock prices by a little over $16 and   consumption by about 60 cents  It’s a total wash  And it would even go the other way without   the marginal tax rate differences  One gets similar results from a shift of income within the   household sector  Marginal propensities to consume for different income groups seem close   enough that there is likely to be little change in overall consumption from the distributional shift   apart from that due to differences in marginal tax rates   So while it looks as though a very significant disparity in the income distribution could   open up, it is hard to find major overall macro effects from this source, apart from the unlikely   suspect of different marginal income tax rates  At the same time, these conclusions are tentative    The internal group MPCs are not as reliably estimated as is the overall MPC, and there could be   further effects on confidence, social tension, or who knows what else  Here again the   distributional shifts are likely to be large enough that the issue bears watching       I support your suggestion, Mr Chairman  I’m actually not altogether   averse to going to balance on the inflation assessment  But given that we’re coming off a period   of downgrading our forecast of economic activity, I think I’d rather leave the statement alone for   another month  I’m not entirely averse to that minor change, however, if that’s all we do     I have a question  We log in our preferences to Vincent Then what   does he write down as the final word, the majority vote?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just after our last meeting, Greg Ip wrote a   column describing three alternative strategies for the Fed to follow in getting rates back to normal    We could be early and gradualist, wait and make sure, or follow what he called the late and leisurely   strategy in which we would actually aim for a rise in inflation     Taking them in reverse order, I’m not impressed by the late and leisurely strategy  I did give   a speech six months ago that argued for a target band for the core PCE of 1 to 2½ percent  While I   argued for a band and not a point target, one could infer that my desired target would be about   18 percent—roughly what inflation has been over the past decade and slightly above what it is   forecast to be now  From that, one might infer that I’d have some sympathy for the late and   leisurely strategy, but I really don’t  Permitting inflation to rise some before we extinguish it   reminds me too much of a controlled burn in the forest fire business; there are many anecdotes of   controlled burns getting out of control  In a fine-tuning sense, inflation might be forecast to be   slightly below where we desire to see it in the long run, but I would be very reluctant to base policy   on a controlled rise in inflation because I don’t think we could control the rise   The second strategy—waiting until we are sure that the expansion is on track and that there   is a risk of higher inflation before changing policy—strikes me as risky as well  In the forecasting   game, we will never be that sure of anything, if for no other reason than that the data get revised so   much after the fact  Waiting until we think we are sure strikes me as an invitation to wait too long    In the case at hand, output has been growing at healthy rates for nearly a year now  The expansion   seems to be quite balanced and stable, and it is easy to envision output gaps gradually closing  I’m   already pretty sure that there is at least a risk of higher inflation  Exactly how much of a risk is not   clear  The Greenbook argues persuasively that much of the recent uptick in inflation is just that—an   May 4, 2004 59 of 112       uptick  Even the scenario labeled “higher inflation” has inflation bumping up and then stabilizing    One can worry about pass-through effects, but there is an argument that commodity prices are   stabilizing, that the dollar has stopped dropping, and that energy prices will decline     It’s hard to question these arguments on logical grounds though one can have fears  First   off, the wide uncertainty ranges in the Greenbook chart indicate that the staff is pretty uncertain   about all of this  The commodity-price assumption involves some guesswork about the Chinese   economy; the dollar assumption involves some guesswork about Asian central bank behavior; and   the oil assumption involves some guesswork about political instability in the Near East  I myself   wouldn’t feel hugely confident about any of these guesses, though I don’t question the main   assumption  Further, we might dismiss the slight rise in inflation expectations as reflecting the   boding of basically uninformed consumers who can’t distinguish price shocks from continuing   inflation  We could question the slight rise in TIPS spreads as attributable to technical problems in   that market   Hence, while none of these indicators is a definite sign that inflation is on the rise, all of   them together do give me pause  And I might say that the anecdotes I’ve heard around the table   today do as well, and in some ways these anecdotes may be more fine-grained than some of the   formal data we’re getting  But to be honest, my biggest fear reflects a haunting similarity with the   ’60s and ’70s, when those in the economics profession were rather firm in insisting that inflation   would not heat up because output gaps were large  Output gaps turned out to be not as large as we   thought, and inflation got pretty high  Given all these concerns, the wait-and-make-sure strategy   strikes me as another invitation for us to get behind the curve There are too many uncertainties to   be resolved and too many haunting memories   May 4, 2004 60 of 112       Having rejected the first two strategies, it shouldn’t come as a huge shock that I favor   gradualism  As a theoretical matter, gradualism involves taking smaller steps but starting earlier    The disadvantage is that policymakers know a slight bit less when they start the tightening process    The advantage is that, other things being equal, particular rate moves are smaller and less disruptive    After each small step, we can make assessments and either proceed or not proceed  If one wanted a   medical analogy, the doctor gradually removes the stimulants when the patient appears to be   reviving, monitoring all the while  Since this strategy reduces the chances of falling behind the   curve, in general I think it should be preferred  I haven’t been ready to start the tightening process   until recently, but now I’m reassessing  We know that the inflation process has a lot of momentum    That does seem to be the one thing we can take from all of these experiences  And to me it makes   an enormous difference whether inflation is possibly pointed down, as I thought last year, or   possibly pointed up, as I fear this year   I recognize what Ben just said, but let me focus on the follow-through part of the issue that   he raised, which is how far monetary policy is out of equilibrium  According to the Bluebook, the   forty-year average real funds rate has been 27 percent  Adding 1½ points for normal inflation and   another small bit for the effect of productivity on real rates, we are at least 350 basis points away   from equilibrium  That’s a lot of small changes, and those of us who are gradualists had better start   thinking about changes fairly soon  I recognize that we could do a lot with our rhetoric and we   could always make larger changes later in the process, but that’s exactly the course I’m arguing that   we should try to avoid if at all possible  I also think it is time to change our rhetoric  In the   gradualist strategy, we can be very patient in carrying out our rate increases, but I hesitate to use that   word because I think it has become a code for the policy strategy that I don’t favor  If I could   May 4, 2004 61 of 112       paraphrase Rogers and Hammerstein, I’d like to change our rhetoric so that we are in a position in   June to declare the time of 1 percent rates all over and start busting out  [Laughter]     You had a measured rise in your temperature!  [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, at this point I think it would be helpful if you would give   your views and your policy recommendation, and then we could all say what we think about this    [Laughter]  That may avoid our being surprised, just as we don’t want to be surprised by the   upcoming unemployment report     First of all, I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  As I said in   my earlier statement, I’d prefer to be gradual, and I’d prefer to start early and stay ahead of the   curve, understanding that we can change our mind depending on the way the data come in  To be   May 4, 2004 86 of 112       positioning ourselves for a move of 25 basis points in June is fine and would satisfy my Rogers and   Hammerstein test   On the language, I actually think the sentence in alternative B is brilliant  In my view it   does not put a collar on us  Second, we have not always moved in a measured way  Our policy   moves weren’t measured over the course of ’94, and they weren’t measured in ’01  So to say that   we prefer to be measured I think does add to the dialogue  The wording probably does not make   our actions as contingent on the data as Bill would like, but it does say that our stance is conditioned   on inflation being low and resource use being slack, so it does tie into the data at least to some   extent  And to me the phrase “likely to be measured” really is the gradualist mantra  So how could   I object to that?  I think it’s just perfect, frankly     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I normally speak after the break, so I was   intending to pass out a chart2  Let me quickly do that  Just when it looked as though everything   was on track for a gradual tightening of policy, an energy shock seems to have hit the economy    How does this change our calculus?  We’ve talked a lot about oil this morning already, so let me   just hit the high points  The spot price for oil has risen from about $25 a barrel throughout 2002 to   $45 a barrel now  The far futures price, a better indicator of whether this price shock is likely to be   temporary or permanent, has risen from its long-term average of about $20 a barrel throughout 2002   August 10, 2004 48 of 103          to about $35 a barrel now  Similar upward movements are occurring in the markets for natural gas   and gasoline  Supply margins in these markets have tightened, and markets are now much more   susceptible to further shocks in price increases  All things together, this looks pretty much like a   permanent energy price shock   The first question is, how serious are these energy price shocks to the macroeconomy?    That’s what the chart I’m distributing addresses  An analytical approach that focuses on reduced   form correlations, an example of which is being passed around, shows pretty strong effects  Since   1975, every upward spike in real oil prices has been followed by a recession, though some of the   recessions seem far deeper than could be accounted for by oil prices alone and there does not seem   to be a symmetrical effect for downward price shocks  But this result is still pretty impressive since   most of the oil price shocks have been temporary, at least as measured by the difference between the   spot price and far futures price  Presumably, the macroeconomic impact would have been even   more powerful for permanent shocks   The staff has analyzed both temporary and permanent shocks through structural model   simulations These are alluded to briefly in the Greenbook this time and in more depth in the   French, Horvath, and Mauskopf memo we got for the last meeting  If we take the far futures price   difference of about $15 a barrel as our measure of the permanent price shock, the implicit energy tax   comes to about $75 billion—definitely not chicken feed  The model works in empirically estimated   effects of price changes and lags on consumers and businesses and finds effects on next year’s   unemployment rate of more than ½ percentage point—say, for an unemployment rate of 5½ to   6 percent  The effect on core inflation is ⅓ percentage point and, in what seems to me to be a   separate calculation, that on long-run aggregate supply is about 1½ percent  It is often said that the   August 10, 2004 49 of 103          reduced form effects that I have circulated are bigger than the model effects, and that may be so; it’s   hard to compare exactly, but even these model effects look pretty big to me   If there are extra-model effects, that should be considered  One obvious place to look is   consumer confidence  Historically there does seem to be a slight correlation between oil price   spikes and drops in consumer confidence  But whatever the past correlation, this chain of events   does not seem to be occurring now  Consumer confidence is bumping along but hasn’t really   dropped since the oil market worsened  Another place to look is in business scrappage of capital   equipment that has been made uneconomic by the assumed permanently higher prices of energy    Understanding this chain of events involves a highly detailed analysis of capital use, which I’m not   going to give today  But if such a factor were important, it could have either positive or negative   effects on investment demand but presumably negative effects on employment demand  Possibly   that is occurring now but, frankly, if this factor were important, I think we’d hear more about it   anecdotally than we are  There are other such uncertainties  One that was mentioned by the   Chairman this morning relates to the recycling point  But I tentatively conclude that none of these   extra-model effects seems as though it is particularly important right now   Assuming then that the model does have the basic story right, what should the Fed do in   general about a permanent energy price shock?  To me, the optimal strategy—again, laid out in the   staff memo for last time—is to keep the real funds rate constant  Keeping the real funds rate   constant implies permitting the nominal funds rate to rise on the order of 40 basis points for a   $15 permanent oil shock  Compared with the base case of no shock, unemployment would   temporarily increase approximately ½ point and core inflation about the same amount, for about a   year, but both would then revert to their initial values  There doesn’t seem to be much way to   improve on this outcome  A supply shock will force us to accept some combination of temporarily   August 10, 2004 50 of 103          higher unemployment and temporarily higher core inflation  But there is a way to make this   outcome dramatically worse, and that is by not letting the funds rate rise, letting inflationary   expectations become unmoored, and permitting the relative price shock to be translated into   permanently higher inflation  This is the outcome we should try to avoid at all costs   Turning to our present situation, before we got into this energy price shock, the plan was to   let the nominal funds rate rise gradually to equilibrium as the expansion proceeded  With the added   bumpiness of an energy price shock factored in, there is much market commentary that we might   have to change our approach to policy at this meeting or the next  While conceding that the   expansion path is likely to be much bumpier than we thought because of the energy price shock, it is   interesting to note that the policy strategy for dealing with energy price shocks is essentially the   same as before  We should let the nominal funds rate rise now, with or without energy price shocks     Of course, nothing is certain in life, and there is a scenario under which we ought to suspend   our policy of gradual rises in rates  This would be the case if two conditions were fulfilled—if the   present weakness in aggregate demand were really persistent and if it were in fact due to some cause   other than energy  The obvious candidate for fulfilling those two conditions that we’ve heard about   this morning is the consumer saving rate, though there would be others  However, at this point, I   don’t consider either possibility very likely, but obviously we have to keep our eyes open  So even   though a lot has changed in the last month, I’m still in favor of going with the program  We are   likely to be in the midst of an energy price shock  These shocks are not pretty, and they are likely to   worsen economic outcomes over the next year or two, but they don’t change what I think we ought   to be doing—certainly at this meeting  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Number one, I support your approach  I   agree also with the notion that, at least this time, we should not fiddle with this statement very   much  We are on track to have a more thorough discussion of the language in our statements in the   near future, and I think the minor adjustment approach is the right decision for this meeting    Second, I agree with you very much in that I, too, would be reluctant to leave gaps in our moves   toward policy neutrality  I think almost methodically raising the funds rate is the right thing to do    If we do it at some meetings and not at other meetings, that’s just going to cause a lot of attention    Of course we have to look at the data, but as long as we’re in a position where the level of the funds   rate is so highly accommodative, in general I would lean toward the methodical approach of taking   baby steps at each meeting unless we get some jarring new information  Third, I would keep in the   reference to energy prices, as my remarks indicated  I think they are important  In my view you are   right that, if we don’t mention them at all, it will look as if we’re vaguely out of touch   On the statement itself, you may be right on the employment side  Essentially, the way I’m   interpreting what you say is that you’re criticizing employment in the first difference sense because   the 32,000 is a number that is estimated with error on the base of millions of people being   employed  I still look at employment a lot for output gap purposes, just to see how far the   expansion has to run  Our statement focuses on the first differences part of employment, not on the   levels  Maybe we ought to commission our drafting committee to think about a different way of   referring to the employment picture  I wouldn’t do it this time, but in general we might want the   statement to focus more on levels of employment and not so much on recent changes, for the reason   August 10, 2004 77 of 103          you suggested  That’s one of the things I’d put on the agenda to deal with in the statement as time   goes on, but for this meeting I would go right down the line with alternative B     Just on this point  I think I cannot be accused of going on my merry   way on this particular issue  But as a result of the discussion that Karen led last meeting, I’m   actually more pessimistic about the demand switching—I believe that’s what it’s called in the   trade—than I was going into that discussion  Now, the first question is the one that you and   President Geithner raised  how to get there  How do we start the slide in the exchange rate?     Right  That’s an obvious problem  But the other problem is that we   have to get more demand stimulation in the rest of the world  And as Karen just mentioned, the   September 21, 2004 34 of 100          zero-bound issue really gets in the way of that  We talked a little last week about fiscal   expansion, and that possibility is always there, but I think demand switching has two real   problems  One is how do we get there, and the other is how do we switch demand on in the   countries where we have to switch it on  It’s not so easy  So, I’m all for talking about this and   so forth, but I think it’s a very hard problem—a lot harder than I previously thought it was      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The news that we have to deal with for   this meeting relates to the mysterious soft spot that is affecting or trapping the economy  We’ve   had soft spots before, blamed variously on the hangovers from the 1990s, the Iraq War, Enron,   and Sarbanes–Oxley  Let’s face it, none of these is a credible explanation for the current   slowdown  At the last meeting, I thought the problem was an oil shock  While I still think the   economy is suffering the effects of an oil shock, I’m beginning to think that more is going on  If   one goes back to our forecast earlier in the year or looks at the Greenbook forecast revisions or   the Blue Chip forecast revisions lately—and this is the point that Don just made—both inflation   and output forecasts are down  Perhaps this suggests that we may have a plain old demand   shock out there mixed in with the oil shock   Whatever the shock is, there also seems to be a strong international dimension to it    Taking the International Finance Division’s forecasts of yesterday, if one could imagine the   world economy without the United States and China, domestic demand would be deficient in   country after country  The countries that are doing well are those that trade a lot with the United   States or China or both  And in general they are doing well because of exports, not anything   related to domestic demand  It is too strong to say that there would be a world recession without   the US and Chinese economies, but there would certainly be global sluggishness  And this   sluggishness would be greatly magnified, as we discussed a minute ago, if the dollar started   September 21, 2004 65 of 100          slipping, which it might do at any point  As I am told, John Connelly once said, “Our dollar,   your problem” [Laughter]   So what do we do about all of this?  With weakness emanating from some unknown   source, seemingly on the demand side, do we continue our program of gradually raising or re-  equilibrating rates?  I would say “yes” for this meeting, but I’m getting much less certain about   future meetings  To rationalize my vote for continuing to re-equilibrate, my own personal view   is that up to now the re-equilibration process has gone very well  Since we began raising rates in   late June, the funds rate has risen 50 basis points, yet ten-year bond rates have fallen 65 basis   points over this span, and even the TIPS long-term rate has fallen 30 basis points  A 35 basis   point decline in long-term nominal rates would be fully explainable within the context of   orthodox macro theory; that is, either the Fed showed it was concerned about inflation, or   inflation just plain dropped and the inflation premium in long-term bonds was reduced  As for   the 30 basis point drop in real interest rates, there are technical explanations, but the most likely   cause is that the real economy has weakened  Whatever the explanation, why fight it?  We have   an opportunity to bring the financial system closer to equilibrium  We can lessen the chances   that we’ll be caught with inordinately low interest rates should inflation suddenly speed up, and   we most likely can do this with minimal effect on real long-term rates, perhaps even a negative   effect if there is some sort of expectations effect  This win–win situation can’t go on   indefinitely  If it were to do so, lots of macro textbooks would have to be rewritten  But it does   seem a likely result for today and, again, why not take advantage of it?   One broader point should also be kept in mind  Re-equilibration means re-equilibration   in several different markets more or less simultaneously  The funds market is now something   like 3 percentage points out of long-term equilibrium, as defined mechanically according to past   September 21, 2004 66 of 100          averages  The long-term market may be about half or perhaps a little more than that out of   equilibrium, defined the same way  I don’t know that there is any theorem that re-equilibration   will happen at an equal pace in different markets, and maybe it shouldn’t puzzle us much if the   pace of re-equilibration is different   So my judgment on what we should do today is clear  We seem to have a situation where   we can restore equilibrium a bit without damaging the economy, at least for a stretch  This is a   good horse to ride, and we ought to keep riding it for now  When we get to the next meeting, it   may be time for the “pause that refreshes,” or it may not be  Markets seem to be responding to   the data, and perhaps we should as well  Thank you     I support it, too—even though you didn’t care!  [Laughter]   September 21, 2004 85 of 100            Thank you, Mr Chairman  A standard forecast today, well represented   by the Greenbook baseline, assumes a minimal decline in the dollar and something close to   projected current policy for the federal budget  It has the funds rate rising by roughly half as much   November 10, 2004 63 of 107    as is suggested by the fed funds futures market and finds an output expansion barely above   potential, with a very slow closing of the output gap  Inflation is pretty stable in such a forecast,   and it doesn’t take much of a negative shock to get the output gap not to close at all  In view of a   forecast much like this, many of you have implied in previous comments and also today that there   might be pauses in our rate-raising process, that the equilibrium funds rate might not be so high   after all, and that of course we will always be looking at the data in our conduct of policy   I can’t disagree with any of that  You’ve all been very convincing, but it is a little boring if   we all say the same thing, so let me talk a bit about the other side of the question and focus on a   couple of longer-run reasons that in the end we might be forced to raise the funds rate more than in   the Greenbook path  I’m using the whole path here; I don’t want to even pretend to be precise   about timing  I’m also not commenting on the fed funds futures market; I can’t really make   comparisons to that because I don’t know what market participants are assuming   My first point involves the dollar  Now, Don, I promise never to say this publicly, but at   least let me say it today  It does seem to me that the international co-dependency truce, where the   United States is allowed to over-consume while foreign central banks are allowed to print money to   buy US Treasuries, thereby supporting the dollar, may be close to becoming unstuck  Dino   pointed out a few countries whose currencies have already appreciated relative to the dollar  Japan   doesn’t seem to be quite as willing to support the dollar as before, and China may have to fight its   own inflation by clamping down on its own money growth  The dollar has dropped since our last   meeting, and the current account deficit, even with the latest good news, continues at well above the   pace that stabilizes the international debt–GDP ratio  The staff has provided a useful memo that   finds that it would take a 50 percent drop in the dollar to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio  Given   previous work of the staff that we’ve heard about, I did not find that particular result surprising    What I did find surprising in the memo was the fact that this fall in the dollar, by itself, could start   November 10, 2004 64 of 107    core PCE inflation rates on a steady upward trend  Perhaps I had been deadened by the staff’s   finding of very low pass-through rates, but I think their deeper message is that international   accounts are so far out of equilibrium now that there is a potential for continuing US inflation even   with the low pass-through rates  How likely all of this is, I can’t say, but I think it could be an   important problem we should keep our eye on   My second issue involves fiscal policy  I’ve long been a fiscal hawk—or really a national   saving hawk  For fiscal hawks, the only redeeming grace in American politics these days is   political gridlock  Political gridlock has just taken a big hit in the recent elections  Specifically,   there are four budget-conscious Republican Senators who have stood in the way of some of the   more irresponsible, in my view, budget-busting policies  These four have just lost their blocking   power, and in the strong tax-cut atmosphere, I worry about what will happen next  The tax cuts are   almost sure to be made permanent; and while politicians will talk a good game on spending cuts,   we all know how likely those are   The Administration has announced two broader priorities for the next term  Social Security   reform and tax reform  There are lots of ways to do Social Security reform, but I think the most   likely is that some payroll tax revenue will be diverted to individual accounts, with benefit   payments to be cut only in the far future  In principle, recipients of these individual accounts   should save exactly the same as before  But if individuals are already saving in eligible assets, will   some of their payroll tax reductions show up as consumption increases and national saving   decreases?  I bet they will   On the tax side, there will be statements that reform should be revenue neutral  But when   loopholes are closed and some people actually have to pay more taxes, how long will that last   politically?  I bet not long  I would be all for thoroughgoing tax reform, but I greatly fear that tax   reform will, in the end, be simply another tax cut—with some taxes going down and none going up   November 10, 2004 65 of 107     Maybe I’m being excessively paranoiac, but I worry greatly about the new fiscal atmosphere  We   may have a much more expansionary budget than the Greenbook is presently forecasting, and it   may happen fairly quickly without the friction of political gridlock  This is another reason that I   think we have to be at least thinking about higher rates than in the Greenbook path   There is also an interaction between these two points  If the budget falls even more out of   balance, national saving is likely to drop from its already historically low levels, magnifying the   current account deficit and the dollar problems  Monetary policy can’t really solve any of these   problems, but it can make them worse by letting inflation come loose from its moorings    Obviously, none of this is certain  I am merely trying to point out that, while there are valid   downside risks in the forecast, some worrisome upside risks have also recently come into view    Let’s remember that the uncertainty distribution still has two tails   As for policy, I’m perfectly happy to go with the flow this time  In the future, we obviously   can’t move the funds rate up at every single meeting, and as many of you pointed out, it would be   nice to find a way to say or signal that  I’m not quite sure how to do that  I’m also not sure how   ready for a more immediate pause I am  The whole pause issue does give me pause  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your recommendation in all   parts  I’m madly looking around for the sentence that Janet is referring to, and I can’t find it     Oh, they’re putting in a reference to the cumulative increase     Right  So I’m for B′— the statement that was passed out  But I agree   with some combination of the views expressed by Janet, Cathy, and you that soon we should   change this sentence that says, with inflation expected to be low, “the Committee believes that   policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured”  At some level, that   statement is inoffensive and all-inclusive, but the problem is that the more we move up 25 points   per meeting, the more we define what measured is  We’ve now done that four times, so we are   coding that sentence, and we probably have to change it pretty soon  I wouldn’t want to change it   this time; I have at least some hawkish elements in my head, as you heard before  I think next time   may be the time to change the sentence in a way that undoes the coding we have given it     I would support early release  I would do it unequivocally  Unlike   Cathy, I don’t view this as something under the conservation of law and information here  So if we   give out more information sooner, I don’t think we have to take anything back  In particular, I think   the statements are working very well now, and I wouldn’t change those in the least  I just plain   support early release     Let me make three other quick points  Bill mentioned that, if we didn’t have early release of   the minutes, we’d still have a number of speeches as a communication tool  Well, member   speeches are member speeches; they are not statements from the whole Committee  I don’t think   the two are equivalent, and I’d rather have something from the whole Committee  On the question   of whether the market would misinterpret the data, I can’t see how bringing the minutes closer to   when the data came out would increase misinterpretation  This is a point Don made  I think it   would reduce misinterpretation  And, third, I’d like to support a point that Ben made, which is that,   when the minutes come out after we’ve given the statement for the next meeting, there’s inevitably   confusion about that  It has happened several times, and with early release of the minutes we get   away from that  So, to me, it’s becoming clearer and clearer that we ought to go to early release and   that we shouldn’t do anything to our statement     Yes  Let me take that a step further  What if we put something about   this in our statement today?     As long as we’re into this, what’s the problem?  If we can release the   February minutes in three weeks, why can’t we release today’s minutes in three weeks?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been much discussion lately of   our measured pace  Are we slavishly raising the funds rate 25 points per meeting or following some   other strategy?  Frankly, it is hard to think about this question without knowing where we are   ultimately going  Many seem to feel that our ultimate target is the equilibrium funds rate, but   whether we use a three-year or seven-year horizon, or some other construct, this equilibrium is only   a measure, not a policy goal  We could raise rates to equilibrium, beyond it, or short of it  The   answer depends on economic considerations  So let me try to analyze our rate strategy in terms of   these economic considerations, focusing, just as Governor Bernanke did, on global economics over   a slightly longer period than we usually consider   My goal is to rebalance the world economy, ultimately stabilizing US international debt-to-  GDP ratios while preserving price stability and at least proximate full employment around the   December 14, 2004 53 of 118           globe  A more ambitious goal might be to let capital on net start to flow away from the United   States and more toward the emerging-market world, but such a goal is too ambitious even to think   about now  Governor Bernanke, I think, would say “unwise” even to think about now  For now, I   just want to limit the inflow ultimately to the United States to a pace that is likely to be sustainable   in the long run  A necessary part of this rebalancing is that the dollar has to fall enough to   ultimately eliminate the US trade deficit, the condition for stabilizing debt-to-GDP ratios  I’m not   talking about any of the preemptive strategies discussed in the international finance memo  I think   the memo is right that these are unlikely to work  I am talking about how monetary and fiscal   policy should act to facilitate this rebalancing while, as said above, preserving price stability and   proximate full employment  It is harder than one would think to accomplish this rebalancing   because Americans seem to be chronic overspenders while the rest of the world seems to be   chronically underspending, and I think this would be true even apart from demographics   The most straightforward part of the plan involves Europe  European economies are already   operating at less than full employment, and their employment problems only worsen if their   currency rises  They just have to stimulate their economies by some combination of monetary and   fiscal policy  If that involves modifying the Stability and Growth Pact or the normal modus   operandi of the ECB, so be it  One would normally think that structural policies would be a neutral   to a negative as demand stimulators, in line with that anecdote that Karen told us this morning, but   it’s possible that European laws are so rigid that structural policies may boost demand as well   Asia is more complicated  First off, the Asian economies should let the normal adjustment   process work by permitting their currencies to appreciate  If they don’t, they will just continue in   this likely unsustainable situation with the ultimate adjustment probably becoming even more   costly  If they do let the adjustment process work, Japan will definitely have to stimulate demand    December 14, 2004 54 of 118           Not being aware of a way to set interest rates below zero, this probably means fiscal stimulation,   presumably a tax cut  I realize that Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is large and rising sharply, but that’s   happening anyway  It seems to me that Japan should let the equilibration process work and at least   try to find some way other than by exports to stimulate domestic spending  Other Asian economies   should also let the adjustment proceed and stimulate their own domestic spending enough to   preserve high employment   For the United States, the situation is complicated in a different way  My own preferred   approach would be to have fiscal tightening to raise national saving and perhaps even monetary   accommodation to keep at full employment  We should recognize that the fiscal tightening and   lowering of interest rates would likely add to the fall in the dollar  In the press lately there have   been many statements implying that fiscal tightening is an alternative to a falling dollar  In   particular, Europeans seem to think that if we would only cut our deficits, the euro wouldn’t rise so   much  No way  Fiscal tightening would normally start or be part of a process that leads to a falling   dollar  The two are complements much more than substitutes   In the unfortunately likely case that fiscal tightening does not occur, there would have to be   monetary tightening in the United States to offset the new export demand from the fallen dollar, as   discussed by Dave earlier  Such a response would fulfill the Fed’s mandate, but it would be less   preferred, at least to me, from a national or world standpoint because it would not raise—and could   lower—national saving  With no net capital inflows, this means lower domestic investment   To return to the central question, with this overall design, should we continue raising the   funds rate, and how fast?  One outcome that would persuade me to sit still for a while, or maybe   raise it at a gentle rate, would be the desirable prospect of real fiscal tightening in this country  I   haven’t been one of the Committee’s doves in recent meetings, but if we had the real fiscal   December 14, 2004 55 of 118           tightening and higher national saving, I’d happily join the flock of doves and argue that the Fed   should try to keep the economy at full employment by pausing or perhaps even lowering interest   rates   On the other side, a much less desirable outcome that could also persuade me to sit still is if   Europe and Japan don’t come through with the desired expansionary policy  If neither stimulates   their economy sufficiently or is able to stimulate their economy sufficiently, world demand could   easily be deficient, and there could be a world slowdown, possibly even recession  In such   circumstances, the Fed also might well have to leave rates alone for a while  But between these two   extremes, there is a broad middle ground—not much fiscal tightening here and a world economy   growing at moderate nonrecessionary rates—which is essentially the Greenbook forecast  In such a   case, US demand will be bolstered by the combination of a falling dollar and expansionary fiscal   policy, and we should continue raising rates at a measured pace  Hence, I am still in favor of this   strategy but willing to change my position if I see, among other things, either credible US budget   tightening on the good side or signs of a world slowdown on the bad side     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  However,   if I could substitute my own analogy for change—     The ship is sailing along, but I do think there’s an iceberg out there    Now, we may avoid it  I don’t want to say we’re going to hit it, but I do think one is out there    May I get in on this one?  Steve, didn’t your paper with Dan Sichel   do that?  I thought it did I thought you had a little routine within multifactor productivity to do   exactly what the Chairman was suggesting    No, I just wanted to ask about that issue    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think I will be the fourteenth person to   explain why the balance of risks is gradually changing  A few months ago, we were still worried   about supposed soft spots but at this point the expansion looks pretty solid  Housing and   consumption growth remain strong  The feared pothole in business investment never materialized,   which strengthens the forecast in two ways Not only is there no pothole, but now the strength of   investment last year can be attributed to underlying forces, not tax incentives, and carried forward   into this year   The international economy looks pretty vigorous, especially for emerging-market countries,   and actual output expansion is now being forecast even for Japan  The Blue Chip forecasts, which I   use as a reflection of conditions more than as forecasts, are now being revised upward  The whole   picture looks quite strong, and, if anything, the risks are tilting to the upside Conditions will be very   strong if the personal saving rate doesn’t rise A recent bank newsletter was entitled “A Whiff of   Inflation in the Air” I actually think it is still possible not to whiff inflation, but there is no denying   that the risks are changing   Oil prices have jumped up again both for the spot price and the far futures price  In contrast   to earlier oil shocks, which clearly could be attributed to some disturbance on the supply side, the                                March 22, 2005 59 of 116  present uptick seems more likely due to international demand conditions, making the higher prices   less idiosyncratic and presumably more lasting  Other commodity prices have also jumped  The   dollar has fallen already, and there will be continuing fears that it will fall further, with these fears   presumably lasting until our international liability ratio stabilizes—a prospect that seems more   remote by the day   So far, wages and unit labor costs have been a stabilizing force but wages may become less   so as output gaps tighten, and productivity growth rates could at some point stabilize or decline    There is nothing surprising or disappointing in this If a year ago we had known that output growth   would be healthy here and around the world, that output gaps were closing, that oil prices were high,   that commodity prices were high, and that the dollar was falling, we all would have been quite   worried about inflationary threats   In a way, over this span the anti-inflation news has been reasonably good Pass-throughs   have proved modest, and wages have been rather well behaved  Productivity has hung in there But   there is still an enhanced risk of inflation   In recent meetings, I have held out one factor that could get me to be less hawkish—the   prospect of real fiscal tightening This has become less likely, too  There has been a dispute   between those who want to cut spending and extend the tax cuts and those who want to maintain   spending When not dealing with steroids in baseball and feeding tubes in Florida, the Congress   seems to be working toward one of their unique compromises Let’s extend the tax cuts and maintain   spending [Laughter] There just doesn’t seem to be much voice for and hope for real fiscal   tightening   Hence, whether one is looking at output growth, inflationary pressures, or fiscal policy, the   risk of falling behind the curve has increased  We have to keep raising rates  I am still in the camp                             March 22, 2005 60 of 116  for 25 basis points per meeting and for keeping the “measured pace” rhetoric for a little while longer,   but I am also for tightening up our rhetoric in subtle or even occasionally non-subtle ways     There has been some dispute about the normative global impact of our low national saving   rate, and I would like to say a word about that When one aggregates the low personal saving and   the large budget deficit, the US national saving rate is at a post-war low How bad is that?  Given   what appears to be a saving glut around the world, some argue that it’s actually a good thing our   national saving is low Otherwise, world long-term interest rates would fall to very low levels  It is   definitely good for world savers that our own national saving is low That maintains their return    But I am still more worried about stimulating world investment than about the returns realized by   savers   We all know that in this country the number of workers per retiree will fall from 33 now to 2   in about 30 years—2 is actually high by world standards With present trends and with present   policy, the same ratio will be a little more than 1 for Canada, France, Germany, Korea, Russia, and   the United Kingdom, and actually less than 1 for Italy and Japan  That’s right Those two countries   are on track to have more retirees than workers  Even in most emerging-market countries, the ratio   will not be much above 2     Barring the unlikely case where national social security systems are totally fully funded, the   younger generations in all of these countries are going to need more capital to pay the retirement and   health costs of our generation Hence, I remain much less worried about the upward pressure that   our low national saving puts on world interest rates than the downward pressure it puts on world   investment  Yes, in the short run our high budget deficit and low national saving are benefiting   world savers But, no, in the long run, I don’t think they are benefiting the world Thank you    Let me ask you about your last few sentences  You said that if we use   the alternative B version for the balance of risks, that limits its use in the future because if we ever   say the risks are not balanced, then we’re confessing that policy is inappropriate in some sense    When I first saw that clause I liked it, but I think if you look at it cross-eyed, it may not be so good   And I agree that we ought to recognize that if we use that wording this time, we probably can’t use it   again    Could I make a friendly amendment, President Moskow?  It is very   dangerous to do this at the eleventh hour I wish I’d gotten into this sooner, and I apologize for not   doing so But we could go down to the sentence in alternative C for the balance-of-risk statement,   and then back to the last two sentences in “B” And I think that outdoes your suggestion, Mike                                        March 22, 2005 79 of 116   Whether we keep the sentence that Cathy talked about or not, we’d have   the sentence that says pricing power is more evident  And then we’d go to “The Committee   perceives that if the current target for the federal funds rate were maintained for the next few   quarters, it is more likely than not that output would grow at a pace faster than sustainable and that   inflation pressures would pick up” That says exactly what we think    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First off, I accept your recommendations in   total, and I also apologize for making the point I made so late in the game  I wish I had been quicker   to see the problem, and I would have said something earlier  But I accept the argument that at this   point we probably ought to go with alternative B   There are, as I see it, two huge issues in terms of the economy  One is whither personal   saving and the other is whither inflation We’ve talked a lot about those and hopefully we will have   more information on them in May   I think most people around the table agree with the fact that the revision in wording that we   have put in the balance-of-risk statement today means that we probably can’t use that statement in   May or at all any more, so that issue will take care of itself  Whether I was with Don or not before, I   can’t remember, [laughter] but I do like something like the statement in alternative C now  I’ve   never been uncomfortable with the “measured pace” language  I think it actually has served us well,   and I’m not sure I’m ready to get rid of it  A number of people around the table have said that   various measures seem to be showing a little more stability now, and I think that just could be due                                   March 22, 2005 92 of 116  partly to the fact that we have tried to be a little forward-looking in our statements  So I don’t want   to give that up I don’t have a careful thought on how we ought to be forward-looking, but I don’t   want to give it up    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The short-run monetary choices are getting   harder While the world oil market is suffering a demand shock caused by rapid growth in China   and elsewhere, it affects the economy as a supply shock, with simultaneous worsening of inflation   and unemployment  Many of us lived through just the reverse of this in the late 1990s, with   simultaneous improvement in inflation and unemployment  For us, turnabout is fair play But while   it may be fair play, the choices get harder  Does one look at the inflation numbers and tighten up or   at the unemployment numbers and loosen up?  The answer depends, I think, on whether the   medium-term impact on inflation or unemployment is likely to be stronger and more pervasive   As the numbers came in over the past six weeks, initially I was on the hawkish side, worried   that inflation would come loose from its moorings  In terms of Vincent’s Bluebook rhetorical chart   [exhibit 6], I found myself over in column C somewhere looking for ways to tighten the statement to   express more inflation concern  But as time went on, the dribs and drabs of steadily worsening data   have shifted me over to where I am now, which is somewhere in column A, wanting to ease our   rhetoric moderately  Given the enormous amount of accommodative policy that we have put in and   our fairly elaborate telegraphing operation, it is too late to actually pause in our rate increases at this                                    May 3, 2005 62 of 116  meeting  And I guess I’ve been to too many meetings of this sort to suggest major changes in our   rhetoric [Laughter]   But I would like to lobby for at least some elements of column A in the statement  The   reasons for my change should be fairly apparent  As the Greenbook notes, the spending data have   been consistently weak over the last six weeks The first-quarter GDP report was below   expectations in a way that is likely to last Not only was GDP overestimated, but final sales were   overestimated by even more  So the future forecast should be scaled down to reflect the lower final   sales momentum and perhaps additionally because there might be something of an inventory   overhang   In terms of spending components, there has always been a likelihood that consumption   growth would slow as personal saving rates keep dropping to historic lows  And it was always   likely that saving rates would revert to more normal, higher levels, slowing consumption growth    The wealth–income ratio was held up by house prices, and it, too, could revert to more normal   levels, further slowing consumption growth  Consumer confidence has been dropping for a while   now On the whole, it is quite reasonable to project that consumption will grow less than income for   the next few quarters, repressing income growth     Fiscal policy appears to be roughly neutral over the forecast horizon I note that the   Congress did pass a budget agreement that seems to contain at least moderate fiscal tightening    Whether this fiscal tightening will actually come to pass is still an open question, but we will   probably not get much new demand impetus from the fiscal side or from the foreign side  Some   parts of the world are growing well, but many of our trading partners are experiencing slowdowns of   their own; hence, slackening export growth is likely The dollar drop may help, but if the dollar                                 May 3, 2005 63 of 116  declines sharply, there may be enough dislocations around the world that export growth could still   sputter   This means that over the medium term unusual importance attaches to capital investment  In   the staff’s own words, in the data report we got, business fixed investment rose at a rate “well   below” that in the fourth quarter; “spending on equipment and software decelerated and spending on   nonresidential structures declined” I might add that durable goods orders are down sharply    Housing starts are down, and the ISM [Institute for Supply Management] index of factory activity is   down The stock market is sluggish despite pretty decent earnings reports, and measures of small   business confidence have plummeted   Even though this is a lot of data, I do think it’s too soon to tell if there’s a pattern here, but it   wasn’t so long ago that we were worried about an investment pothole  Maybe we just got the timing   of that a little wrong; with sluggish aggregate macro time series, that can easily happen, I think  Or   there could be some other source of impending weakness in investment  It seems as if around this   table about every eight months we get worried about a lack of corporate animal spirits  I don’t know   what the answer is, but I do think that, if investment flags, there is no other obvious source of   spending strength Granted, as Gary says, the economy has shown a lot of resilience, but the   spending still has to come from somewhere   As I said before, it is intrinsically difficult to conduct monetary policy when both objectives   are turning the wrong way, but in the medium run I’m going to differ with many of you in at least   raising the possibility that the weak spending data may trump the strong price data  Many of the   price increases seem to be one-shot increases due to energy shocks and unlikely to pass through into   continuing inflation We talk about the core index, but the core index doesn’t purge all influence of   energy, and I’m a little suspicious that some of the taints are, if you will, energy taints  I think it’s                                 May 3, 2005 64 of 116  important to keep our eye on wages, and wages have continued to be moderate, indicating that price   pressures do seem to be contained for the longer run  And as many of us have noted over time, if   aggregate demand does weaken, output gaps will fail to close and overall price pressures should   wane   So what should we do about all of this?  In the short run, I’ll go with the crowd We have   invested so much in advertising a climb in rates that we can’t back down now  For the medium run,   however, I’m beginning to get worried on the negative side  At this meeting, I would like to shade   our rhetoric toward the A column in the Bluebook  I guess the only other thing I could say is that I’d   like to recommend that over the next six or eight weeks everybody study carefully the simulation   that the staff labeled "Sentiment slump with financial spillover"  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I support your recommendation to   move the funds rate up 25 basis points and to use the language of alternative B  In my remarks, I   made some noise about combining some elements of alternative A; I’m not going to press that    Based on the discussion, I think I’ve lost that debate And the hour is getting late, so I’m fine with   B   On the minutes, I think I’m with Roger in that I don’t really see the problem  We issue a   fairly terse statement  Subsequently, the minutes come out and they give a lot of color  The minutes   indicate that some people felt this and some people felt that  That is all said; it’s faithfully   transcribed I think it just fills in some of the blanks  So, I don’t really see what the problem is  I   actually do think it’s a great assist to us that the minutes are coming out with a three-week lag  I   think that’s going to be one of the better things we’ve ever done, though I must say a lot of us had   reservations about it at the time   On the process issue, one thing we’ve learned is that we can’t make major rhetorical changes   at the meeting  These statements have to be read probably eight times to figure out all the nooks and   crannies in them  If we get a statement circulated at the meeting, it is just too late to assess all the   nuances We’re tired, and we’re not thinking about the wording from all perspectives  So, I don’t   think that is a good idea   Let me suggest one thing that we might consider  I actually think the format that we have   developed—where we get alternatives A, B, and C and have a chance to study them—works pretty                                       May 3, 2005 99 of 116  well But I think the domain of the options has gotten rather narrow  Look at the differences   between A and B In line 1, there’s a “further” in alternative A and in line 2, there’s a “somewhat”    In line 3, alternative B has a “somewhat” and in line 4, there’s a “while”  In line 5 the word “action”   is gone in alternative A [Laughter] This is pretty small potatoes, I think, compared to what some   people are talking about So, one thing that we might consider is to have a little extra material in the   Bluebook every now and then—maybe at the January and June meetings or maybe at this critical   time when we’re going to change our strategy—that gives a broader range of options  The staff   could provide a draft statement without this bank of sentences with minor variations—just look at it   in a little bigger way That way we’d still get a chance to study it and we wouldn’t be getting a   statement late in the meeting   The last thing I want to say is that I totally agree with Janet that line 5 ought to go I’ve been   on two committees that have tried to fix that up, and we couldn’t do it  At one point I sent some   memos around and tried to do it on my own  That didn’t work either I don’t think we can fix it   And I think that’s when we started on sentence 6 de novo We had a specific problem, and we   worked out language to deal with it I’m saying “we,” but in fact you did that  And I think sentence   6 has worked much better than 5  So, at some point sentence 5 ought to go  Let’s just try to come   up with some terse language that gives the full dimension in 6  That would be my suggestion    Thank you
