 We'd have to consult with our model experts on that  SPEAKER(?) Well, it certainly would be hard to do in a day or two But a few weeks' work [unintelligible] to what you've seen here  Yes, we really would, because some of those underlying factors would tend to increase the probability of oil price shocks If we continue the growth of oil demand [unintelligible], we would see production outside of OPEC about flat, so that would increase the chance of something happening there If world growth were to go significantly below potential, that would certainly reduce the chances of oil price shocks  What matters here is what's happening to real activity If we're holding the oil price unchanged in real terms so that greater inflation results in an increase in the nominal price but not necessarily [unintelligible] your question Clearly, there are fiscal shocks; we've had a more expansive fiscal policy than--  Well, let me address the question about the willingness [to hold] dollar assets in exchange for disinflation Clearly, the rise in real interest rates would be in favor of the dollar; but in that case, the current account deficit is persistently [growing]--we're up to 1/2 percent of GNP and it's widening in absolute terms And the US [external] debt is growing to levels that perhaps could be a source of concern at some point As to when the shift in [unintelligible] takes place, that would be hard to say; and it's one of the reasons we considered two clearly marked alternatives, obviously, since [unintelligible] But we certainly couldn't rule out the distinct possibility of some movement against the dollar as the amounts of the external debt and debt payments begin to stabilize [unintelligible] The second question was on--  On the question about oil prices yes, clearly, as we discussed before, if they were not very [successful] in slowing real output, the implications for real oil prices would tend to be more favorable If we go back to the early 1980s, for example, the difference is that oil prices were at substantially higher levels to begin with; and perhaps part of the more favorable outcome then had to do with the fact that we were beginning to be on the down side of an oil price shock We also had a very small rise in the dollar Both of these tended to reduce somewhat the [costs] of disinflation in the world in that period, relative to a period when oil prices and the dollar were moving differently At this point we are at a very low relative level for real oil prices We're [assuming] the production costs are insensitive to oil prices in some of the marginal areas And the outlook for production outside of OPEC does not look particularly good So it's a very low downside limit on the oil price situation this time as compared to the early 1980s when there was clearly a very strong downside potential  In terms of what the models might suggest there, for adaptive expectations models, backward-looking models, the oil price shock will have an impact on the price level for a time And this could work into the wage/price dynamics and have an inflationary effect Now, if you had a system where zero inflation was expected so that a relative price shock was more forward looking, the inflationary effects generally would be small   [Statement--see Appendix]  With a proviso that as the economy has become more open, these normal channels that are put in the model become more important  Certainly, import prices have a greater effect as the share of imports has grown over time I think the share has come close to doubling over the last 25 years But in addition to the effects of import prices on aggregate demand, there's really not much comparative evidence although we've really only begun to look carefully at the statistical evidence there   [Statement--see Appendix]  The decline in foreign demand is related to the Mexican situation Excluding Mexico, we do not expect a significant change  There is a little drop in Canada's rate of expansion because of their monetary policy tightening--  Yes   Developments in international financial markets, which are reviewed in Chart 3, continue to be dominated by turbulence in Asia as Peter Fisher has indicated Movements of exchange rates in that region, shown at the top left, can be divided into three groups of currencies first, sharp declines in the dollar values of Korean and Southeast Asian currencies last fall, followed by some recovery and a further downturn more recently; second, a somewhat less pronounced but persistent decline in the yen; and third, still relatively stable currencies in Greater China and Singapore Movements in Asian equity markets have paralleled those in currency markets across these groups, with equity prices in Southeast Asia and Korea turning down again in recent months after an early 1998 bounce- back, while those in Japan and China plus Singapore have shown much less precipitous declines since mid-1997  Looking ahead, a central assumption underlying our forecast is that in the period ahead Japanese authorities will come to terms on and implement an effective resolution of their banking crisis Bumps in the road will be inevitable; interruptions of credit lines and other uncertainties associated with the resolution process will weigh on real activity for much of the forecast period, but we expect financial markets eventually to be bolstered    6/30-7/1/98  by signs of progress Against that background, we have assumed that the yen will be flat for the balance of 1998 and will appreciate somewhat during 1999 Our forecast has currencies elsewhere in Asia remaining about unchanged in nominal terms, with the exception of the Chinese renminbi, which we see depreciating moderately next year The currencies of Korea and Southeast Asia should appreciate in real terms with rising inflation in those countries  The middle two panels show developments in other key emerging markets The recent decline in the real value of the Mexican peso is dwarfed by its earlier recovery from crisis-induced lows several years ago--the real peso is still nearly 20 percent below the pre-crisis highs reached in early 1994 Brazilian authorities have maintained a steady rate of depreciation in the real, and we assume they will be able to continue to do so Russian authorities, too, have so far succeeded in keeping the ruble relatively stable in the face of growing uncertainties about Russia's economic prospects, but the odds of a sharp depreciation are rising (Russia has too small a weight in US trade to be included in our index for the dollar) Stock markets in all three countries have retreated noticeably from earlier highs in the past year, feeling the contagion from Asian equity markets  Among the major industrial currencies, shown in the bottom panels, sterling has strengthened recently, while the Canadian dollar has weakened against the dollar and the mark has moved roughly sideways since its sharp decline through the middle of last year We project the mark/euro to appreciate somewhat over the year ahead as the new monetary union gains market acceptance Our trade-weighted average of 29 currencies of industrial and emerging market economies follows a similar pattern Stock markets in continental Europe have continued their strong advance in recent months, while those in the United Kingdom and Canada have leveled off or declined somewhat  Turning to foreign economic activity, while observers on continental US shores are still waiting for the tsunami to hit, our seismographs now indicate, for a second time, that the quake in Asia has been substantially larger than previously believed The top left panel of Chart 4 shows how we viewed total foreign GDP growth and Asian real GDP growth prospects last September as Thailand's currency crisis was beginning to spread to elsewhere in Southeast Asia At the time, we saw economic and financial turbulence as a downside risk for Asia, but with indicators for the third quarter coming in strong for the region as a whole, this risk did not significantly alter our baseline forecast for growth to remain near its historical trend rate of more than 5 percent By the time of the January Greenbook, the panel at the top right of this chart, with the crisis having    6/30-7/1/98  intensified greatly and spread to north Asia, we had marked down Asia's growth for 1998 by more than 4 percentage points to less than 1 percent  In recent weeks, news about the first quarter and preliminary indications for the second quarter have been far weaker than we anticipated, indicating that GDP has been plunging at unprecedented rates, as shown in the lower left panel Our current forecast has Asia's GDP falling 3 percent during 1998 and picking up only very sluggishly, by Asian standards at least, in 1999 The level of GDP in that region at the end of the forecast period is 11 percent below the path we were projecting last September We see total foreign growth, the black bars, rising over the next year and a half as the drag from Asia recedes  The lower right panel shows the importance of various regions in US exports--the weights used in constructing our foreign GDP aggregate--as well as their shares in total foreign GDP Asia accounts for over 40 percent of foreign GDP but for 30 percent of US exports and on that basis is divided into three roughly equal subgroups (1) the front-line crisis economies of Korea and Southeast Asia, (2) Japan (which seems to be seeking membership in the first group), and (3) Greater China plus Singapore Europe, Canada, and Latin America, shown at the bottom, each take about one-fifth, or a little more, of US exports  Turning to a closer look at these regions, your next chart focuses on the front-line Asian economies The numbers here are mind-boggling but, I would caution, also very fragile and subject to substantial revision In the first quarter of 1998, real GDP in Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia dropped at annual rates in excess of 20 percent Early indicators for many of these countries suggest large declines in the second quarter as well The picture that emerges from our analysis of this free fall in GDP, based on some still very sketchy details and an accumulation of anecdotal reports, is indicated in the middle panel Sharp contractions in consumption and especially in investment have resulted from four factors first, massive adjustments of balance sheets as private wealth has plunged with the downturn in stock market, property, and other asset values and increases in the local currency value of foreign debt; second, growing uncertainty about job security and earnings prospects as unemployment and business failures have soared; third, cancellation of construction and investment projects following past overinvestment and growing excess capacity; and fourth, a widespread credit crunch and rising cost of funds Credit availability has dried up as foreign investors have fled and as domestic banking systems have retrenched Substantial increases in interest rates--as indicated at the lower left--have raised the cost of funds, although real rates have risen much less as inflation has ratcheted up in most of these countries and soared in Indonesia in response to currency depreciations    6/30-7/1/98  As indicated in the lower right panel, trade balances in these countries have dropped sharply, primarily because imports have plummeted with the contraction of domestic demand Korea's imports in the first quarter were $53 billion at an annual rate, or nearly 40 percent below year-earlier levels, contributing to most of the $63 billion increase in its trade balance over the same period In most cases, exports have failed to rise appreciably, partly because of the contraction of trade credit but also because of falling export prices and the fact that a large share of the exports of these countries are to each other  Returning to the top panel, in the two right-hand columns we are projecting further significant declines in activity in the second half of 1998 and only sluggish recovery at best next year The near-term outlook for Indonesia is especially bleak, weighed down by ongoing political uncertainty, social unrest, and a paralyzed banking system The likely prolonged absences of many ethnic Chinese, constituting a substantial portion of Indonesia's entrepreneurial and managerial expertise, also are resulting in critical breakdowns in the distribution system Prospects in the other countries are somewhat less gloomy as some progress has been made on restructuring foreign debt Current accounts in many cases have moved strongly into surplus, and macroeconomic stabilization programs are being adhered to Once domestic financial conditions begin to stabilize, renewed access to international capital markets should help to support economic expansion, but probably not until later next year  A linchpin for the prospects of stabilizing Asia's financial markets is Japan, the subject of Chart 6 As can be seen in the first line of the upper panel, GDP fell at a 5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, much more than expected Consumption was weak, reflecting declining consumer sentiment and rising unemployment, as shown in the middle left panel Sentiment fell further in April, while unemployment soared in April and leveled off in May, although the ratio of job offers to applicants weakened further in May to a 20-year low These and other recent developments portend a significant further downturn in consumption in the second quarter Investment dropped sharply in the first quarter and likely declined further in the second quarter As shown in the middle right panel, the Tankan survey of business sentiment and the lending attitudes of Japanese banks tanked in the first half of the year The drop in the latter series is evidence of a credit crunch associated with the growing crisis in Japan's banking system Uncertainties surrounding the resolution of the banking crisis, as banks are closed, merged, or otherwise dealt with will continue to depress consumption and particularly investment in the second half of 1998, but we are assuming that private domestic demand will stabilize and begin to creep up next year as longer-term prospects for the financial system begin to brighten The projected increase in GDP in the second half of this year is more than accounted for by fiscal expansion as the recently passed large    6/30-7/1/98  supplemental budget package more than offsets the contraction incorporated in Japan's initial 1998 budget As indicated in the lower left, we are now assuming that the structural budget deficit will weaken by 3/4 percent of GDP this year and a bit less next year We also expect net exports to make a modest positive contribution to GDP growth, as indicated at the lower right, with real imports contracting somewhat further and exports receiving some stimulus from the depreciation of the yen  Turning to the third group of Asian economies, Greater China and Singapore, growth in China has slowed noticeably from the near double- digit pace of a year ago, as both exports and direct foreign investment inflows have declined sharply We are projecting growth to come in well below the government's target of 8 percent during 1998 and to recover somewhat in 1999 We assume, though with diminishing conviction, that the Hong Kong peg will hold despite the beating that the Hong Kong economy has been taking Hong Kong's GDP fell at a 10 percent annual rate in the first quarter following a downward revised fourth quarter The spike in interest rates late last year, shown in the middle left panel, in response to pressures on the Hong Kong dollar along with massive corrections in equity and property values have weighed heavily on domestic demand and will continue to do so well into next year  The bottom two panels summarize changes in the combined external balance of all ten major Asian economies As shown on the left, we expect the combined current account surplus of this region to be well over $200 billion this year, up from less than $50 billion in 1996 A rough indication of how this massive shift is being distributed around the globe is shown at the right, based on trade data for eight of the ten economies Between the first quarter of 1997 and the first quarter of 1998, the combined trade surplus increased $151 billion Of this total, $36 billion was in trade with the United States and $41 billion with Europe In both cases, Asia's imports fell and exports rose by similar amounts The $50 billion decline in Asia's imports from itself, and hence identical decline in its exports to itself, reflects a sharp contraction in intra-Asian trade as demand in the region has plummeted There was also a sharp drop in imports from the "other" region, largely OPEC and Latin America, reflecting in part declines in the volume and price of oil imports  Your next chart touches on the rest of the world Despite the negative surprise in Asia, growth in Europe came in at a healthy 3 percent annual rate in the first quarter As indicated in the second panel on the lower left, net exports made a large negative contribution to Europe's GDP growth in the first quarter, partly because of a surge in imports and partly because of a slowing of exports to Asia In contrast, Canadian net exports benefited from strong demand in the United States The net export drag in continental Europe was offset by robust growth in domestic demand, supported by low    6/30-7/1/98  or declining interest rates, shown at the right UK interest rates have been rising, however, as the unemployment rate, shown in the third panel on the lower left, has declined further, and consumer price inflation, shown at the right, has moved above the Bank of England's 25 percent target range Looking ahead, we project growth in Euroland to continue at a fairly robust pace, buoyed in part by "europhoria," while growth in the United Kingdom and Canada should slow somewhat  The bottom two panels address developments in Latin America Negative effects of the Asian crisis have been felt by the major countries in this region Brazil's GDP will be depressed this year, partly by a run-up in interest rates in the wake of the Asian turmoil last fall Brazil's problems are also home grown, including persistently large fiscal and external deficits and growing political uncertainty as President Cardoso faces a tough challenge from labor candidate Lula ahead of the elections in October Mexico has been hurt by the drop in oil prices, and the region as a whole is facing higher spreads in international credit markets Assuming the situation in Asia stabilizes by next year, we expect growth to pick up in Mexico and Argentina However, this means a further widening of the region's current account deficit, shown at the right In the case of Mexico, we can begin to anticipate its own special Year 2000 problem in connection with its 6-year presidential election cycle  Chart 9 reviews the implications of these developments for US exports and imports Recent movements in US exports by region reflect the differing trends in activity abroad Exports to Europe and Canada have been on an uptrend, while shipments to Asia dropped sharply in the first quarter Imports, shown at the right, rose in the first quarter from all regions except Asia However, there appears to be some uncaptured seasonal variance in these data; imports from Asia were well above their level of four quarters earlier, roughly consistent with the view we get from Asia's export data  As shown in the middle left panel, real net exports of goods and services declined in the first quarter and, given the substantial drop that occurred in April, we expect a more significant decline in the second quarter Thereafter, a slight increase is projected for the second half of 1998 and a somewhat faster expansion in 1999, roughly in line with the projected pickup in total foreign GDP growth Real import growth, shown in the middle right panel, should slow in the second quarter and beyond in response to the decline in US GDP growth The bottom line for real net exports, as shown in the lower left panel, is another substantial negative contribution to GDP growth in the second quarter, about 1-1/2 percentage points, followed by lesser negatives in the second half and next year The ongoing declines in net exports push the current account, shown at the right, below minus 3-1/2 percent of GDP by the end of 1999 This level matches the    6/30-7/1/98  previous low that occurred in 1987, a period of considerable weakness in the dollar  In the more pessimistic simulation that we did, we had Asian growth  falling by somewhere between 5 and 10 percent at an annual rate across countries We assumed  that this weakness would spread to Latin America and growth there would fall on the order of 2  to 3 percent There is obviously a risk that it could fall a good deal more    6/30-7/1/98  The situation in Latin America is a bit reminiscent of that being experienced a little  less than a year ago in Asia We are seeing some turbulence in Latin American financial  markets, but the current indicators in that region look fairly strong outside of Brazil We have  seen indications of slowing economic activity in some of those countries but also a fair amount  of good news There seems to be optimism in Argentina where domestic demand is growing  fairly strongly Mexico has been hurt by the drop in oil prices, obviously, but domestic demand  there seems resilient Nevertheless, given the widening current account deficits we see in those  countries, and perhaps a little overvaluation of their currencies, though nowhere near as much as  we had in Mexico in 1994, there clearly is a risk in that part of the world In Brazil, growth has  been sharply reduced by monetary tightening in response to currency pressures, and risks remain  high given that country's large fiscal and external deficits and the fact that President Cardozo is  in a close election race with the leftist labor candidate, Mr Lula We thought the pessimistic  scenario we picked was a plausible one that would involve a fair amount of contagion following  a failure in Japan There is no question that it could get a good deal worse  Just to address the oil price question, I think the jump in the futures  reflected OPEC's recent agreement to cut production by somewhat more than we had assumed in  our forecast Our oil experts doubt that OPEC will come through and actually restrain  production as much as the agreement suggests But there is some upside risk in the oil price  forecast in light of these very recent events  We "add factored" both the yen and aggregate demand    6/30-7/1/98  We stipulated that we were going to reduce growth What we did  was to impose an exogenous negative psychological or confidence effect on Japanese aggregate  demand in the model Everything else equal, if the yen were to depreciate to the extent that it  does in the pessimistic scenario, the model would normally give us a rise in Japanese GDP We  stipulated that this was a combination of a currency shock and an aggregate demand shock  through confidence effects  If all you do is let the yen go, this is positive for Japan The effect of  this currency shock on the rest of Asia is not that large in the model The model does not pick up  the related uncertainty and confidence effects  Another shortcoming of the model is that it does not capture  borrowing denominated in foreign currencies, and the wealth effects are rather minimal  There has been a longstanding dichotomy of views about the  equilibrium exchange rate for the yen Most PPP indices have it somewhere between 150 and  200, depending on which one we look at on which date Most models that focus on the external  balance would put it between 100 and 120 Perhaps one way of looking at it is to anticipate that  in the very long term the yen will gravitate to a real rate consistent with the 150 to 200 range as a  result of domestic price adjustments but that in the intermediate term, given the pressures from  the market relating to the external balance, the yen will most likely go the other way  We see further weakness in Japan's private domestic demand That  clearly is a result of anticipated difficulties in the process of resolving Japan's banking crisis  Over the second half of the year, there is no question that the banking problem will continue to  weigh on the performance of the Japanese economy We have chosen to write down a relatively  moderate further decline in private investment after a fairly significant drop in the past few  quarters and some further decrease in consumption after the declines registered over the past  year We are starting from a low base The declines in these two key sectors have resulted in a  significant further reduction in GDP in the second quarter I agree with you that, despite  impending large fiscal stimulus, there is a downside risk in our second-half forecast There is  also the possibility that if Japanese officials made a clear statement about resolving their  banking-sector problems and actually started to implement remedial polices and their financial  markets began to improve, we could see their economy begin to recover  Yes, domestic private consumption in our forecast does fall through  the second half of the year  On the fiscal side, there is no question Over the past three or four  years, the growth that we have seen in Japan has been largely associated with movements in  Japan's structural budget deficit In 1996, they had a large fiscally-induced expansion of GDP  At the time, we thought conditions were beginning to turn around in Japan They withdrew that  fiscal stimulus in 1997, and the economy dropped off sharply In the bottom left panel of that  page, you can see a shift from fiscal stimulus of 1-1/2 percent of GDP in 1996 to fiscal contraction  of 2 percent of GDP in 1997 It was not surprising that Japan's economy weakened substantially  between those two years The fiscal expansion expected for 1998 is going to be crowded largely  into the second half of the year Our view is that if they get progress on the financial  side--financial restructuring and banking reform--and the economy begins to pick up as a result  of this fiscal push, households will start to have a brighter outlook  We looked at the numbers carefully in this regard and made  judgments based on the past relationship between the announced numbers and the so-called "real  water" content of the package The numbers on actual investment spending in the announced  package account for about three-quarters of the overall spending and the tax cuts for one-quarter  The tax cuts are spread over the next couple of years The spending also is fairly evenly  distributed I have forgotten exactly what the gap is between the "real water" and the headline  number, but it is fairly significant  We see it as beginning to have a significant impact Probably the  best indicator is the Tankan survey of business perceptions of the lending attitudes of banks The  survey results are shown in the middle right panel on Chart 6 They indicate a rather large  decline in the first half of the year in the perceived willingness of banks to lend Last year, our  Japanese banking experts were questioning the existence of a credit crunch and attributing the    6/30-7/1/98  weakness in lending to a slowdown in demand Now, with these survey results and a lot of  supporting anecdotes, one cannot ignore the possibility that there is something significant there
