9166,2011-01-25,"  Thank you  I will now review some of the work within the Federal   Reserve System that has examined mismatch  Mismatch is a broad term that  describes an imbalance between the characteristics of unemployed workers and of  available jobs  For example, there can be a mismatch between the skill requirements  of vacancies and the skills of the unemployed or a mismatch between the location of  jobs and the location of workers  As discussed by Jason, greater mismatch in the  economy can potentially lead to a higher level of structural unemployment   I start by reviewing Federal Reserve System research that has analyzed mismatch  through comparisons of the experiences of different types of workers, some of whom  may be more prone to mismatch than others  To the extent that mismatch contributes  to higher unemployment, workers more prone to mismatch should experience  relatively worse labor market outcomes   In my own research with Mike Elsby from the University of Edinburgh and Bart  Hobijn from the San Francisco Fed, we have calculated unemployment outflow rates  conditional on the industry in which an unemployed individual was last employed  If  the need for reallocation across sectors causes a mismatch of skills, workers who  were formerly employed in sectors undergoing a structural decline will have a harder  time finding new jobs; that is, a rise in mismatch would imply a divergence in  outflow rates  As seen in the upper panel of exhibit 7, we have actually seen a  convergence of these outflow rates rather than the divergence predicted by a rise in  mismatch   Another way to examine whether there is an increase in mismatch is to look at the  unemployment outcomes of different age groups  Relative to their younger  counterparts, older workers have lower mobility rates, and they are more likely to  experience skill obsolescence  If geographic and skill mismatch are important,  younger workers should have relatively better labor market outcomes  The lower  panel of exhibit 7, which comes from work by Dan Aaronson at the Chicago Fed,  shows that the unemployment rate of workers with at least a college degree who are  under age 25 exhibits remarkable similarity to the aggregate unemployment rate   January 25–26, 2011 22 of 282              during both the recession and the recovery periods  Because young college graduates  are a group who are less susceptible to skill and geographic mismatch than the overall  labor force, this suggests little role for mismatch   The figures in exhibit 7 are suggestive, but they do not provide a direct measure  of mismatch  I will now focus on more direct measures of mismatch and summarize  the results from my own work with Joe Song and Giorgio Topa of the New York Fed  and Gianluca Violante of New York University  To assess the importance of  mismatch, we ask the following question  Given the distribution of vacancies, would  it be feasible to reallocate unemployed workers across markets in a way that reduces  the aggregate unemployment rate?  This involves comparing the actual allocation of  unemployed workers with an ideal allocation that assumes costless worker mobility  across labor markets  This ideal allocation requires vacancy–unemployment ratios to  be equated across labor markets; therefore, any deviation of a specific market’s  tightness from aggregate labor market tightness indicates misallocation  Because  frictions remain within each labor market, there will still be some unemployment,  even under the ideal allocation  The difference between the actual unemployment  rate and the unemployment rate implied by the ideal allocation provides an estimate  of the effect of mismatch   Based on this reasoning, we first analyze skill mismatch across 15 major industry  sectors over the period 2000 to 2010, computing two indexes  The first, Mu, which is  the black line on the upper left panel of exhibit 8, measures the fraction of  unemployed workers searching in the wrong labor market relative to the ideal  allocation  This index rose from around 021 in 2007 to about 032 in 2009  It then  declined to 025 in early 2010 and has since increased slightly  The biggest  contributors to the increase in mismatch were the construction, durable goods  manufacturing, health, and education sectors   A more interesting question is what would the unemployment rate have been if  these workers were allocated optimally?  Our second index, Mh, addresses this  question  In the presence of mismatch, the economy generates a lower number of  hires for a given level of unemployment and vacancies compared with the ideal  allocation, and this index measures the fraction of these lost hires  The red line in the  upper left panel of exhibit 8 shows Mh the fraction of lost hires was 28 percent  before the recession started, increased to 76 percent in 2009, and has declined to  around 5 percent since then  This index also allows us to compute a counterfactual  unemployment rate that is purged of its mismatch component  The upper right panel  of exhibit 8 shows this counterfactual unemployment rate along with the actual one   Before the recession started, the difference between these series was 04 percentage  points  This is because, as the upper left panel showed, there is misallocation in the  labor market even during expansions  By 2010, this difference had risen to  12 percentage points, implying that rising sectoral mismatch accounted for around  08 percentage points of the increase in the unemployment rate from the start of the  recession to 2010   January 25–26, 2011 23 of 282              One drawback of this calculation is that the industry classifications are very  broad  The sectoral measures do not capture any mismatch that may occur within  these broad sectors  To address this concern, we have computed occupational  mismatch measures using the help-wanted online data from the Conference Board   The lower left panel of exhibit 8 reports results for the mismatch exercise for 2-digit  occupations  Both the Mu and Mh occupational indexes display patterns similar to  those for the sectoral indexes, increasing from 2007 to 2009 and then declining  The  lower right panel of exhibit 8 shows the actual unemployment rate and the  counterfactual rate implied by the occupational Mh index  Before the recession  started, the difference between the actual and the counterfactual unemployment rates  was 13 percentage points  By 2010, this difference had risen to 27 percentage  points, implying that occupational mismatch accounted for 14 percentage points of  the increase in the unemployment rate   It is important to note that the effect of mismatch on the unemployment rate tends  to be higher during recessions  Because the presence of mismatch results in fewer  hires, it lowers the job-finding rate in the economy  When separations are high, the  pool of unemployed is large, which amplifies the effect of this reduction in job- finding  Our tentative conclusion is that while mismatch has contributed to the  increase in the unemployment rate, its current pattern suggests that it is not likely to  lead to a long-lasting unemployment problem for the US economy due to its  seemingly cyclical nature   As Bruce also noted, the decline in house prices that accompanied the recession  may have caused job applicants to be more reluctant to apply for and accept jobs that  would require them to move and sell a home that has negative equity  This  phenomenon, which is generally referred to as “house-lock,” appeared consistent with  recent data that showed that the rate of interstate migration in the US has reached a  postwar low   However, as several studies within the System have shown, contrary to popular  belief, interstate migration did not fall relative to the trend during the recession  The  upper panel of exhibit 9 shows the findings of Greg Kaplan from the University of  Pennsylvania and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl from the Minneapolis Fed  The significant  drop reported in the interstate migration rate was a statistical artifact of changes in the  Census Bureau’s procedure for dealing with missing data  The non-imputed data  show that interstate migration has been trending downward for many years  Relative  to that trend, there was no additional decrease in interstate migration during the  economic downturn   Other studies have found that the house-lock mechanism has only a negligible  effect on the unemployment rate  For example, Chris Foote and Richard Ryan from  the Boston Fed analyzed the relationship between falling home prices and individual  unemployment experiences  The lower panel of exhibit 9 shows their calculations of  the average unemployment durations of renters (the red line) and homeowners (the  black line) as a function of the percentage change in state-level house prices during  the preceding 12 months  While we see a sharp rise in unemployment duration when   January 25–26, 2011 24 of 282              house-price changes move into negative territory, the difference between the  price-duration relationships of owners and renters is relatively small  Even though  the house-lock mechanism operates in the right direction, its effect is quantitatively  negligible  This conclusion is also supported by my own work with Song, Topa, and  Violante  We calculate mismatch measures for 50 US states and find only a minor  effect of geographic mismatch on the increase in the unemployment rate   Finally, I want to discuss the risk of a European-style hysteresis problem for the  US economy  Accompanying the big rise in the unemployment rate, the average  duration of unemployment peaked at a record high of 348 weeks in June 2010  A  major concern associated with the rise in long-term unemployment is the possibility  that long-term unemployed workers may become increasingly disengaged from the  labor market  The upper panel of exhibit 10 presents unemployment-to-employment  flow rates for workers with different unemployment durations  As you can see,  individuals with longer unemployment spells typically have a lower outflow rate from  unemployment into employment  During the recession, these rates had fallen  proportionately across duration spells  Recently, however, the recovery of the  unemployment-to-employment flow rate has been concentrated among the short-term  unemployed  Although this seems to suggest a relative worsening of the outlook for  the long-term unemployed, as you can see in the figure, it is actually a pattern  observed during previous recoveries   Overall, it is still too early to tell how the job-finding prospects of the long-term  unemployed will evolve during the recovery, since their job-finding prospects have  only recently started to recover  In work with Sagiri Kitao of the New York Fed, we  take a different approach and try to quantify the risk of hysteresis using a structural  model similar in spirit to the seminal work on European unemployment done by Lars  Ljungqvist and Tom Sargent  Ljungqvist and Sargent argued that, at a time of  increased economic turbulence, generous unemployment compensation might hinder  the process of restructuring because it reduces the incentives of job losers to quickly  search for and accept new jobs and therefore avoid further depreciation of their  human capital  Currently, conditions in the US economy may appear to resemble  the conditions described in Ljungqvist and Sargent’s study  As Jason discussed, there  has been an unprecedented extension of unemployment insurance  Moreover, a  disproportionate share of the unemployed has endured particularly long spells  We  ask whether these factors are likely to cause a permanent unemployment problem in  the US   My analysis with Sagiri finds that even a permanent extension of unemployment  insurance benefit eligibility from six months to two years would increase the  unemployment rate by less than 12 percentage points, which is consistent with the  empirical estimates Jason just reviewed  Even under unfavorable labor market  conditions, such as a greater layoff risk and accelerated skill depreciation, the effect  will not exceed 17 percentage points  If UI benefits were paid in perpetuity, then the  unemployment rate could move permanently above 10 percent, but because the  extension of benefits will likely expire once labor market conditions improve, this is  not a likely scenario for the US   January 25–26, 2011 25 of 282              Finally, I want to emphasize that, while the jobless in the US are exiting  unemployment at a historically low rate, they are still exiting at a faster rate than  those in continental Europe  The lower panel of exhibit 10, which comes from my  work with Elsby and Hobijn, shows the historical averages of unemployment inflow  and outflow rates for selected countries  As seen in the figure, the high rates of both  make the US an obvious outlier Even the current record low outflow rates in the  US are still above the flow rates observed in continental Europe   As summarized in exhibit 11, our review of recent research finds that extended UI  benefits, changes in the recruiting behavior of firms, and skill mismatch have had  measurable effects on the unemployment rate over the period 2007 to 2010  Studies  found little evidence that geographic mismatch or house-lock has contributed  significantly to the rise in the unemployment rate  Finally, we do not view a  European-style hysteresis a likely outcome for the US labor market  However,  because of the high number of long-term unemployed workers, who tend to exit  unemployment slowly, a quick turnaround in the unemployment situation seems  much less likely than in earlier recoveries   When interpreting these findings, please keep in mind that these effects are not  mutually exclusive and, thus, not additive  For example, an increase in skill  mismatch exacerbates the disincentive effects of extended UI benefits  With that, I  turn it over to Bruce to conclude    That’s an excellent question  We know from Mincer-style regressions, as   you said, that we can only explain up to 35 percent of variation in wages by looking at   observable characteristics  So the approach that we took is to try to understand the   characteristics of unemployed workers and try to match them with the job openings that we have   been seeing  Unfortunately, the biggest restriction while doing this exercise was on the worker   January 25–26, 2011 28 of 282              side  On the worker side, we could observe the industries and their occupations, but other than   that, we could not really observe much  So our hope is to get UI records—from certain states, at   least—and try to use information about unemployed workers to come up with more detailed   measures of mismatch  We hope these will include demographics, locations of the workers,   education levels, experience levels, et cetera    First of all, I agree with your summary; we were actually surprised to   uncover this cyclical component of mismatch  Even if the level of mismatch stays constant,   when the economy goes through high levels of separations and the unemployed pool gets bigger,   this effect gets amplified  So, as the unemployment rate starts going down, this effect will go   down   In terms of wages, I haven’t done any work on that, but the San Francisco Fed’s memo   written by Mary Daly, Rob Valletta, and Bart Hobijn actually looks at exactly what you said    They looked at the employment cost index and average hourly earnings series for different   industries, and they tried to link this to quit behavior  So the question is  Do we see industries   that are trying to hire and not managing to do so, and in industries where quit rates are different,   do we see anything on wages?  They found that there are broad-based movements in wages   January 25–26, 2011 35 of 282               I would like to make a quick comment about the DSGE models with search   frictions  In my opinion, they have two major shortcomings  The first one is that generally they   assume complete markets, and, in a model where we assume complete markets, policies like   unemployment insurance are completely irrelevant, so we can’t really understand their effects    The other shortcoming is that generally workers are homogeneous, which makes it harder to   study issues like mismatch  These were the two main reasons that we wrote the papers as we   did  "
