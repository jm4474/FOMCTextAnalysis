7867,2007-01-30,"  There’s a little lawyer in all of us  [Laughter]      That’s exactly right   January 30-31, 2007 4 of 255    "
8018,2007-09-18,"  I was delighted to hear this morning that employment of  lawyers is now a factor in assessing the robustness of the economy  I recommend that  in the Committee’s drive for transparency, however, the FOMC not disclose this new  factor because undoubtedly there will be those among my colleagues in the legal  profession who will sue for a more prominent and permanent place in the  Committee’s forecasting models  Today, I’ve been asked to address an element of  the Committee’s governance  Over time, a consensus appears to have developed that  the Committee would prefer to change its current practice of approving only the  assessment of risk portion of the policy announcement issued after each Committee  meeting and instead approve the entire statement  If that is the Committee’s desire,  there are several methods for achieving that result  Each method has advantages and  disadvantages  A key concern in choosing an alternative involves the amount of  flexibility that the Committee wishes to retain to allow other methods for announcing  its decisions, especially in emergency, intermeeting, and special circumstances  A  second key concern is how much attention the Committee wants to draw to its change  in practice      The first and simplest alternative would be for the Committee just to begin   voting on the entire statement along with the policy action  This approach maintains  the maximum flexibility for the Committee to alter its practice in different situations  and to adjust the content of the statement  This approach also maintains the  flexibility of the Chairman to issue a statement in times of emergency or special need   If the Committee chooses this alternative, the Committee also controls the amount of  prominence that it calls to this change in the minutes  If the Committee believes this  change is significant, it may include a robust discussion in the minutes  If it views the  change as not significant, it may have no or only a brief notice in the minutes       A second and slightly more formal alternative would be to adopt a nonbinding   resolution outlining the Committee’s desired new practice  A nonbinding resolution  provides a more formal vehicle than the first alternative for explaining the change in  voting practice in the minutes  At the same time, because the resolution would be  nonbinding, it retains the flexibility of simply voting on the matter      The remaining two alternatives are the most formal and involve adopting a   binding resolution or changing the Committee’s rules to require Committee approval  of statements issued at each regularly scheduled meeting  These alternatives are more  binding because they require further deliberate Committee action to change the  practice in the future  A rule change would also be very visible because, in addition  to an explanation in the Committee’s minutes, a rule change entails publication in the  code of federal regulations  This would attract attention in part because the  Committee’s rules currently do not address voting practices beyond the requirements  of a quorum   A formal resolution or a rule change may hold an advantage for a   September 18, 2007 121 of 188    member who wants to delineate publicly the exact content of the statement  On the  other hand, were the Committee to desire to retain flexibility to alter the content of  the statement, a rule or resolution would have to be carefully crafted to ensure that  flexibility  A binding resolution or a rule change could also limit the flexibility of the  Committee and of the Chairman to speak about the FOMC’s actions  To date, the  Chairman has retained the flexibility to speak for the Committee in emergency and  other situations  Indeed, the statement was originally a statement of the Chairman,  not of the Committee  If the Committee desires to retain this flexibility and yet adopt  a binding resolution or rule, the resolution or rule could be drafted to maintain that  flexibility  That concludes my presentation  I would be happy to entertain any  questions       That’s the current practice  That’s right     This would be just a discussion     The Committee needn’t take a formal position today on what it does,   particularly if the discussion suggests that the Committee simply wants to act when the time is   right  So the minutes could be very general   September 18, 2007 123 of 188      The FOMC continues to be in meeting, and so what is happening here   is part of the transcript of the FOMC  But on top of that is a Board meeting  The Board meeting   has only minutes  Those minutes are very summary  The current plan is that they won’t be   released until after Thursday     Well, the auction credit facility doesn’t require the approval of the   Reserve Banks  The Board is required to set the rules for lending under 10B, which is what we’ll   explain in the program  However, the interest rate on loans under the credit facility would, of   course, be established by the Reserve Banks and reviewed and determined by the Board  So   depending on the governance of the different Reserve Banks, it may be that the interest rate that   is the result of the auction would be something that the board of directors would want to   recommend  Our proposal, as you’ll hear it later on, will be that the boards of directors adopt the   process rather than a particular interest rate, and that would allow the auction to continue over   time     Right  Like seasonal credit works today     We did consider imposing a higher standard, something like “well   capitalized and well managed”—the financial holding company type standards—and two   concerns were raised  One is that it has the same problem that President Rosengren referred to   that we have to rely on the exam rating and the capital adequacy determination by another   regulator  We don’t get out of that problem by raising the standards, and most of the institutions   that were referred to actually fit into the higher standard  So it didn’t achieve very much  The   second thing is that there was some concern that it might have a blackballing effect  For folks   that were between the standard for primary credit and the higher standard that we were setting, it   might indicate that the Federal Reserve felt those folks were weaker  Those may in fact be   people we want to get some funding to  They’re the ones that seem to be struggling with   liquidity, and this might make their problems worse because the market will perceive that the   Fed wouldn’t even be willing to lend to them under the facility  "
8089,2007-12-11,"  I circulated to the general counsels yesterday resolutions that could be   presented to the boards of directors that adopt the result of the auction as the recommendation by   December 11, 2007 123 of 138    the Reserve Bank for the discount rate on the TAF  The Board would then be accepting those   and voting on them     Yes  The resolutions have all been circulated to all of the general   counsels of the Reserve Banks, so they should have them and could be presenting them     I could give them to you     It is less for you to carry home     I can send a copy to all the Presidents     They just have to be here by December 17  "
8182,2008-03-10,"  Yes  President Hoenig, you are correct  We are relying in part on   section 14, the open market operations piece, even for accepting collateral that is not section 14   collateral because it does have an effect in improving the market for US government securities,   but there is a very strong component of this that is providing liquidity to the primary dealers, and   to satisfy that we are relying on section 13(3) authority     That is right  We are relying on market conditions, on limiting it to   primary dealers, and on limiting the types of assets that we will accept as collateral     The resolution that the FOMC will be asked to vote on today will have   an outside limit of $200 billion as the total size of the term securities lending facility  If it were   to go above that, it would have to come back to the FOMC     You’ll be asked to vote on three resolutions today—one that deals with   the term securities lending facility and two that deal with the swaps  The Board is also voting   separately to authorize part of the term securities lending facility  One matter I would note, because   the rate on the TSLF must be set in the same way that other discount rates are set, we do need a   recommendation on how to set the rates  However, because this facility involves just securities   lending from the SOMA portfolio, it will be sufficient to receive a rate recommendation from just   the New York Reserve Bank, and so the resolutions would not be needed from the boards of   directors of the other Reserve Banks at this point  With that, I’ll read the resolution for the term   securities lending facility, and I will ask for a vote on that   March 10, 2008 34 of 39    “In addition to the current authorization granted to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   to engage in overnight securities lending transactions, and in order to ensure the effective conduct of   open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank   of New York to lend up to $200 billion of US government securities held in the System Open   Market Account to primary dealers for a term that does not exceed thirty-five days at rates that shall   be determined by competitive bidding     These lending transactions may be against pledges of US government securities, other   assets that the Reserve Bank is specifically authorized to buy and sell under section 14 of the   Federal Reserve Act (including federal agency residential-mortgage-backed securities), and non-  agency AAA-rated residential-mortgage-backed securities   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee consistent with the   objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue   that may be auctioned and on the amount of securities that each dealer may borrow     The Federal Reserve Bank of New York may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer’s   ability to control a single issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   This authority shall expire at such time as determined by the Federal Open Market   Committee or the Board of Governors”     That’s correct  This is securities lending by the New York Reserve Bank   out of the SOMA   March 10, 2008 35 of 39      Correct     There are two swap resolutions  The first  “The Federal Open Market   Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to increase the amount available from   the System Open Market Account under the existing reciprocal currency arrangement with the   European Central Bank to an amount not to exceed $30 billion  Within that aggregate limit, draws   of up to $15 billion are hereby authorized  The current swap arrangement shall be extended until   September 30, 2008, unless further extended by the Federal Open Market Committee”     “The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank   of New York to increase the amount available from the System Open Market Account under the   existing reciprocal currency arrangement with the Swiss National Bank to an amount not to exceed   $6 billion  Draws are authorized up to the full amount of the swap  The current swap arrangement   shall be extended until September 30, 2008, unless further extended by the Federal Open Market   Committee”  "
8249,2008-06-24,"  Well, as you can tell from Art’s presentation, there’s been a   significant amount of information-sharing and collaboration already between the  Federal Reserve and the SEC  So we’ve taken this opportunity simultaneously with  what’s going on with the primary dealers to fashion a document that will lay out a  framework for how this information-sharing and collaboration will go forward    June 24–25, 2008 143 of 253    We’ve made some pretty good progress on a document, but we’re still negotiating  In  fact, the Chairman is negotiating this afternoon with Chairman Cox  This is one in  which the principals have been intimately involved       The agreement as it is currently structured really has two parts  The first part   outlines plans for sharing information between the two agencies  Here I would divide  the world into two pieces  There are the consolidated supervised entities (CSEs),  which are the four large investment banks—Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,  Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch  We have agreed to share information and  analysis of the financial condition, risk management, internal controls, capital,  liquidity, and funding resources of those firms  The agreement is focused primarily  on those areas—so the financial condition, liquidity, and risk management of the  firms  As you know, we have accessed information from these companies in  connection with our providing liquidity through the PDCF and the TSLF, so we’ll  share that with the SEC  Similarly, the SEC, which is the primary regulator for those  and has access to much more information, will share their information with us   We’ve also agreed to share information and analysis on various financial markets that  these companies are intimately involved in—in particular, the tri-party repo market  and the interbank lending market       Now, two bank holding companies participate in the SEC’s CSE program—  Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase  We have agreed to share with the SEC the same type  of financial and risk-management information regarding those two firms but only to  the extent that that information affects the broker-dealers that are controlled by those  two firms  So we are not expecting, nor is the SEC expecting us, to share information  that relates to the condition of the bank or the condition of the other nonbank portions  of either of those two firms—just the part related to their broker-dealer     We have an interest here in the Federal Reserve in the financial condition of   broker-dealers that are not in the CSE program  That would be any broker-dealer  that’s in a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve  Our plan is to  include an information-sharing arrangement regarding those institutions as well       More broadly, the SEC would provide us with information on an ongoing basis   about the financial condition and risk management, internal controls, capital,  liquidity, and funding resources of all broker-dealers that are controlled by a bank  holding company  This would allow us access beyond what we’re currently getting   Right now we’re getting primarily FOCUS reports on the broker-dealers, which are  not always the most informative documents  So we’ll get more access  We also are  expecting to agree to provide similar kinds of financial and risk-management  information to the SEC, again to the extent that the information affects the broker- dealer  So we would not be routinely providing information about bank holding  companies related to the bank or related to the nonbanking operations that are not  broker-dealers  We also are expecting to include a provision that outlines several  existing agreements that we have for sharing information regarding some of the  clearing companies—DTC in particular—transfer agents, municipal securities   June 24–25, 2008 144 of 253    dealers, and investment advisers  This would simply incorporate, without changing,  the arrangements we already have  An essential part of all this sharing of information  is that both agencies would agree to keep the information confidential  In addition,  the SEC is agreeing not to use our exam or supervisory information, in particular any  opinions that we might have, in their enforcement actions or investigations without  the permission of the Federal Reserve     The second part of the agreement, as we’re working through it, relates to   supervisory expectations for the four large investment banks and for the primary  dealers that have access to the PDCF and the TSLF  There the current proposal is  that the two agencies would agree to collaborate and coordinate with each other in  obtaining access to the information on the financial condition of these organizations  and in setting supervisory expectations concerning the capital, liquidity, risk  management, and funding for the CSEs and the primary dealers  We’d also  collaborate and coordinate our communications to those entities about supervisory  expectations, something that’s already begun with Art and his group       The memorandum of understanding (MOU) is intended to serve as a bridge from   the existing world to whatever brave new world the Congress may put together  But  it is not tied specifically to the PDCF or the TSLF and is intended to last beyond  access to those facilities  It also does not change the legal authority that either of the  two agencies has  We continue to have full, unfettered legal authority over bank  holding companies  They continue to have full, unfettered authority over the broker- dealers  But we do agree to talk more, collaborate more, and coordinate more  As I  mentioned, the MOU is substantially worked out  We are still, though, in negotiation  over a couple of key points  Our goal is to have it done this week, we hope with an  announcement at the end of the week or sometime next week  We expect that the  terms of the MOU will be made public  As soon as we have something that’s  concrete enough, we’ll also send that around to you        I was perfectly content to get through this without any questions    [Laughter]  But I am happy to answer anything   June 24–25, 2008 173 of 253      Well, we have had a bit of interaction on the Senate side  The Senate   folks are very interested in what we are doing and whether this would preempt a congressional   action  Chairman Frank has been more sanguine about our doing what is appropriate to deal   with the situation now—Laricke may speak to this more at the lunchtime conversation  But we   are building on existing authority  We are not expanding beyond the existing framework  We   are agreeing to collaborate more, work together more, but we don’t gain any legal or statutory   authority through this MOU  We gain some admission because we are standing next to the SEC    We expect that the primary dealers and CSEs will be more willing to talk with us because we are   with the SEC  But in the end, it depends on voluntary cooperation by all     On the House side, Chairman Frank is thinking of a model that is   similar to what the Treasury blueprint outlined, where the Federal Reserve would be a systemic   regulator and have some authorities that go along with that  I think that on the Senate side they   are very much in disarray  They want to visit this issue, but they haven’t figured out exactly   what point of view they want to have  "
8276,2008-07-24,"  The TSLF authorization needs to be voted on by both the FOMC and the   Board  Shall we begin with the FOMC?     I think you have all received the resolution  It is the second resolution on   the third page  “The FOMC extends until January 30, 2009, its authorizations for the Federal   Reserve Bank of New York to engage in transactions with primary dealers through the Term   Securities Lending Facility, subject to the same collateral, interest rate, and other conditions   previously established by the Committee”     Yes  The Board also votes on the TSLF  This is on the second page, the   third resolution  “The Board finds that conditions in the credit markets in which primary dealers   obtain funding continue to be fragile and subject to unusual strain and uncertainties  This fragility   continues to threaten the satisfactory functioning of broader financial markets and thus poses   July 24, 2008 44 of 50    significant risks to the economy  In view of these unusual and exigent circumstances, the Board   authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to continue to make credit available to primary   dealers through the Term Securities Lending Facility, subject to the same collateral, interest rate,   and other conditions previously established, until January 30, 2009, unless the Board finds that the   unusual and exigent circumstances no longer prevail  The Reserve Bank may extend credit where it   has evidence that reasonable credit accommodations are not available to a borrower from other   banking institutions”     The second resolution on the second page  “The Board finds that   conditions in the credit markets in which primary dealers obtain funding continue to be fragile and   subject to unusual strain and uncertainties  This fragility continues to threaten the satisfactory   functioning of broader financial markets and thus poses significant risks to the economy  In view of   these unusual and exigent circumstances, the Board authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New   York to continue to make credit available to primary dealers through the Primary Dealer Credit   Facility, subject to the same collateral, interest rate, and other conditions previously established,   until January 30, 2009, unless the Board finds that the unusual and exigent circumstances no longer   prevail  The Reserve Bank may extend credit where it has evidence that reasonable credit   accommodations are not available to a borrower from other banking institutions”     The only action by the Reserve Bank board of directors on the original   TAF was to set the formula for the rate  That has been set, and no further action would be required   for this modification to the TAF     Sure  This is the first resolution on the third page  “In addition to the   current authorizations granted to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to engage in term   securities lending transactions, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve   Bank of New York to offer options on up to $50 billion in additional draws on the facility, subject to   the other terms and conditions previously established for the facility”  "
8346,2008-09-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  On Friday, Wachovia experienced  significant liquidity pressures, and its management concluded that it would have  difficulty funding itself this week  So the board of directors of Wachovia authorized the  management to begin entertaining merger offers  Wells Fargo and Citi quickly emerged  as the leading candidates among a group of candidates, but by Sunday it became clear  that those two, which were the only remaining candidates by Sunday, could accomplish  the merger only with government assistance  For a variety of reasons, the Board  believed that it was appropriate to implement the systemic risk exception to give the  FDIC the widest flexibility to resolve Wachovia in order to maintain confidence in the  banking system  Among the reasons was the concern about liquidity pressures that  would be felt by similarly situated banking institutions if there was a disorderly or very  focused failure of Wachovia  Also, there was concern that, because Wachovia looked so  strong on a capital basis and it would be somewhat surprising to some in the market  when it closed, it would send a bad signal about similarly situated institutions  There  was also concern about the large amount of foreign deposits that would be left behind in  a least-cost resolution; the potential for money market mutual funds, which are already  in a fragile state, to have further disruption from a least-cost resolution; and that the  current financial turmoil and weakened economy would be further weakened if the least- cost solution was pursued and that might undermine business and household confidence     The FDIC and the Treasury both agreed with that analysis, and the Secretary   consulted with the President, and the systemic risk exception was invoked on Sunday  late afternoon  After a bidding process that was run by the FDIC between Citi and  Wells Fargo, Citi emerged as the better bid for Wachovia  You may have seen this  morning a report about that bid  Citi offered slightly more than $2 billion to the existing  shareholders  Plus it would buy out all of the banks from underneath Wachovia and  leave AG Edwards and Evergreen, the two investment banking firms of Wachovia,  with the existing shareholders  Citi identified a portfolio of largely real estate–related  assets that was about $312 billion in size that it felt it could not handle without some  loss-sharing with the FDIC  It proposed to the FDIC that Citi would take a $54 billion  first loss position, and then it asked the FDIC to share losses—actually to take losses on  the portfolio—above the $54 billion mark  The FDIC’s analysis of that was that the  $54 billion cushion was sufficient to allow the FDIC on its average basis to emerge with  little or no loss, and so the FDIC accepted that bid     The Board was asked to give some capital relief to Citi in connection with this and   did agree to give relief at the holding company level from the tier 1 regulatory ratio and  the leverage ratio for approximately $270 billion worth of assets that would come over  from Wachovia to Citi  That capital relief will be amortized over time and is similar in  many ways to the relief that was granted in the Bear Stearns transaction  An application  will be filed shortly for the merger  The two parties are still working out the details of  the merger agreement, but they expect to have it done in the next day or so  That’s all       The $312 billion was the value on the books of Wachovia, and so Citi is   providing the cushion in several ways  One is marking them down $30 billion to begin with, to be   more in line with what Citi’s own marks are and to add to reserves to supplement the potential   losses there  Then the rest is a loss-sharing     Yes     That’s correct  "
8434,2009-01-16," Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  Let me start by saying   that a tremendous amount of effort went into this deal, and the folks at the Richmond   Reserve Bank—in particular the lawyers and the exam staff there—with some   support from the New York staff did a phenomenal job in putting this together  This   proposal was motivated by significant losses that Bank of America announced this   morning There are two kinds of losses They announced some losses that were a   little above market expectations for Bank of America itself  This is their first quarter   of losses, and the market is now expecting that this is the first of several quarters of   losses for Bank of America  They are one of the more thinly capitalized banking                        January 16, 2009 4 of 69  organizations, so losses for them are taken pretty seriously  What was most important  was a very large loss that Merrill Lynch declared for the fourth quarter today, much  larger than market expectations—in the mid-20s pre-tax  The concern was that a  large loss on the Merrill Lynch acquisition, which Bank of America just closed on  January 1, might shake market confidence in Bank of America itself   The proposal that Bank of America requested from us and that we ultimately  agreed to provide is in two parts One is a capital injection of $20 billion from the  Treasury from the TARP funds—that is in the form of preferred stock  It is very  much like the preferred stock that was issued in the CPP (capital purchase program)  to other banking organizations, except that the interest rate is higher  It is a uniform  8 percent interest rate right from the start, rather than 5 accelerating to 9, I believe,  under the CPP  The capital injection has some conditions tied to it  One condition is  that dividends be restricted to a penny a share per quarter for the next three years   There is also an executive compensation requirement that is more severe than the  executive compensation requirements that apply under the CPP but very much like  the exec comp restrictions in the Citi deal  So the highest management of Bank of  America, roughly the top thirty officials, had their bonuses cut 40 percent for the next  two years, and their bonuses are based on the 2007 performance  There are also  restrictions on corporate activities, on the use of corporate jets, and on various extra  corporate expenditures, which are subject to Treasury review   In addition to the capital injection, the US government agreed to provide some  downside protection for a period of time on a pool of ring-fenced assets  This part  was also modeled on the Citi deal  The maximum size of the pool is $118 billion   The pool includes a variety of residential and commercial real estate securities,  including some structured instruments—CDOs and the like  The underlying assets  include a range of prime, subprime, and alt-A assets  There are also some  derivatives—in fact, a large derivative book on real estate and other corporate  assets—and some leveraged loans  The term of the downside protection is ten years  on the residential-mortgage-based assets and five years on everything else  The way  it is structured, Bank of America has a deductible of $10 billion  That is the first loss  position on any losses in this pool After the Bank of America loss position, the US  government will share losses on a 90/10 basis with Bank of America, the government  taking the next 90 percent and Bank of America, 10 percent, for another $10 billion   That $10 billion of losses is shared between the Treasury and the FDIC on a pari  passu basis, which is slightly different from the Citi deal  The Treasury will take  $7½ billion in losses potentially, and the FDIC is willing to take $2½ billion   In exchange for providing that protection, the Treasury and the FDIC are getting  $4 billion in preferred stock and some small amount of warrants as a premium  The  losses will be based on actual losses that are incurred in the maturity and sale of  assets from the pool, not on mark-to-market losses  So if the pool continues to exist  after they have gone through that series of $20 billion in protection, then the Federal  Reserve Bank of Richmond stands ready to make a loan to Bank of America on the  basis of the assets remaining in the pool  That loan would be on a nonrecourse             January 16, 2009 5 of 69  basis—so recourse only to the assets in the pool  Again, Bank of America would   share 10 percent of the losses alongside the Reserve Bank in that pool liquidation    The Reserve Bank is getting a commitment fee on this loan that begins immediately   on signing the documents  The fee is 20 basis points on the outstanding amount of   the assets, which represents the potential amount that the Reserve Bank could lend   against  Once the loan has been drawn, the Reserve Bank would also get an interest   rate of OIS (overnight index swap) plus 300 That interest rate is the same that we   have used in the Citi deal The restrictions that I went through on the preferred stock   that the Treasury gets are also part of the asset ring-fencing proposal and will last as   long as the ring-fence continues to exist  That is the summary of the deal  President   Lacker may have other comments to make, and I am happy to answer any questions   "
8617,2009-09-22," Yes, that’s right  In fact, we committed to putting the proposal out for   comment before making the TAF a permanent facility                    September 22–23, 2009 57 of 212 "
8643,2009-11-03," Yes The matters that Bill Nelson just brought up and the matters that   Jim Clouse brought up on the Federal Register are matters that will eventually come to the Board   for its decision  So if the Presidents want to express some views that the Board should consider   when the Board is formally presented with those matters, that could be helpful; but they are not   matters for the Board to discuss in today’s meeting  "
8775,2010-05-09,"  I can’t either  We’ve given out the contracts in our other facilities  I   don’t see anything off the top of my head that we couldn’t sterilize if we had to  I think the   agreements are actually very simple, very straightforward, and could be made available  "
9051,2011-08-01,  That’s right  
9152,2011-11-28,"  Yes     If I could add something there, Mr Chairman  However, if we do the   reciprocal lines, and, for example, we then do transactions in yen with domestic banks, that   would be considered open market operations  We would disclose those eight quarters after the   transactions occurred   November 28, 2011 21 of 40                That’s a question of first impression  Because the System has never   lent any currency other than dollars, we’re looking into that  We clearly can do open market   operations with anyone in the market  If we consider it that way, then we would buy and sell the   yen, and we would treat that as open market operations for the Dodd–Frank Act  That would   involve eight-quarter disclosure     It’s not a loan  It’s a swap     Correct     It stays the same     I think this would give the Chairman the latitude, after consulting with   the subcommittee and informing the full Committee, to deny draws or approve draws     Yes     Yes  Remember, there are two directions that these swaps would work   in  There are the swaps with the foreign central bank that they disseminate through their   mechanisms and their countries  The disclosure of that would all be done by the foreign central   bank, if at all—not by us  We do disclose that we’ve had the swap with the foreign central bank   and how much draw there has been by that foreign central bank  But the clause you’re referring   November 28, 2011 32 of 40              to is the reciprocal side of the line  So if we were to allow an institution in the United States to   draw down yen that we had taken from a swap line, for example, then we would consider that an   open market operation, the sale of foreign exchange in the open market  We would have to   disclose that eight quarters after the transaction had occurred  We would make a disclosure of   our counterparty and the amount and the rate, but it would be done in the future     I’ll leave the policy issue to others, but on the operational side, the   thought was that because each financial institution—bank, in particular—has accounts at its local   Reserve Bank, it made sense for banks in particular to deal with the Reserve Bank where they   had an account and then for the Reserve Bank—say, Richmond—to obtain the currency from the   SOMA  That was an easier operational method than having banks deal directly with New York,   which wouldn’t have the account set up for the bank  So they’re OMO transactions, but we   would be dealing with counterparties beyond the primary dealers, which are normally who we do   the OMO transactions with   November 28, 2011 33 of 40                It could be done with any financial institution, the way the resolution is   worded  So that would include affiliates as well  "
