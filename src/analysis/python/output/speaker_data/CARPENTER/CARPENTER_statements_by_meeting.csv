8720,2009-04-28,"2  Thanks, Trish Mr Chairman  For this meeting, the  Bluebook included a new section that presented projections for the Fed’s balance  sheet, and I’ll be referring to the exhibits in the handout entitled “Material for FOMC  Briefing on Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base”  The projections   2 The materials used by Messrs Carpenter and Burke are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                  April 28–29, 2009 9 of 201  that we put into the Bluebook were linked directly to the policy alternatives presented  in the Bluebook  Chris and I will briefly explain the assumptions that underlie those  projections, caveats associated with the exercises, and the projections themselves   Under the current policy approach, the scale of asset purchases and demand for  Federal Reserve liquidity and credit facilities, given their terms and conditions and  the evolving financial and economic conditions, will drive the size and composition  of the Federal Reserve’s assets and the quantity of liabilities  The composition of  those liabilities will be determined primarily by the evolution of currency demand and  other factors on the liability side of the balance sheet, with reserve balances  determined largely as a residual  The balance sheet projections are “bottom up”  forecasts based on assumptions about the various components of the balance sheet   We should emphasize at the outset that all of our assumptions, and therefore the  resulting projections, are subject to significant error  The significant uncertainty  surrounding the outlook for the economy, the uncertain response of users of Federal  Reserve credit to the state of financial markets and the economy, and the fact that  some elements of the balance sheet are policy choices make these projections more  judgmental than typical forecasts   The charts in exhibit 1 illustrate the assumptions that the staff has made  As  suggested in the top set of graphs, we assume that the Board extends at least some of  the section 13(3) lending facilities beyond their current expiration dates later this year  and that the FOMC extends the horizon for the foreign central bank liquidity swaps   The recent improvements in functioning in some markets, however, have led to  decreased usage of several facilities, as Trish noted  For example, draws on the  foreign central bank swap lines and borrowing from the TAF have fallen so far this  year Consistent with this development, we assume that demand for credit from all of  the facilities, with the exception of the TALF, falls to zero over the next couple of  years as markets recover  The assets held by Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II, and  Maiden Lane III are assumed to mature or eventually be sold over time; they reach  zero in 2015 In light of the slow initial uptake of the TALF, under the baseline  projection the facility is assumed to peak at $500 billion at the end of 2010, half of  the announced $1 trillion limit  For the baseline, we also assume that all TALF loans  have a three-year maturity and that none defaults   As shown in the next set of graphs labeled “Securities,” in the baseline scenario  (denoted by the blue lines) the Desk purchases $300 billion of Treasury securities,  $200 billion of agency debt, and $1¼ trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities  this year as directed by the FOMC in March  We assume that the agency debt and  Treasury securities are held to maturity  MBS are held to maturity as well but are  subject to prepayment  Given the historically low coupon on the securities that the  Desk has purchased, we assume a slower-than-average path for the prepayment of  MBS that implies that approximately half of the MBS purchases remain on the  balance sheet in 2016 Of course, the Committee may consider other possible courses  for policy Consistent with alternative A in the Bluebook, one alternative scenario is  based on an additional $450 billion in purchases of Treasury debt (the red line in the                      April 28–29, 2009 10 of 201  graph) Another scenario includes the additional Treasury securities as well as a  TALF that reaches $1 trillion, with a second wave of loans that have a five-year  maturity, shown by the red lines in the middle row of the top set of charts   On the liability side of the balance sheet, we assume that Federal Reserve notes,  shown in the bottom set of charts, expand at the same rate as money stock currency as  projected by the staff under the Greenbook forecast through 2010 and at the rate of  nominal GDP growth thereafter  The Treasury’s accounts at the Federal Reserve  return to historically normal levels from their current total of roughly $300 billion;  specifically, the supplementary financing account falls to zero, and the general  account returns to the $5 billion target by the end of 2009  Taken together, these  assumptions plus additional assumptions for miscellaneous assets and liabilities imply  a path for reserve balances Chris will now discuss the projections   There are a couple of parts to that question, so I suppose a couple of   people will have to answer For just the baseline projections, we wanted to be illustrative, first   and foremost, to give you all a chance to understand what sort of impact different sizes of TALF   programs would have on the balance sheet and what that would mean down the line in terms of   levels of reserve balances and potential exit strategies  We intentionally, therefore, did not try to   tie it to the operational details that Bill and colleagues are going through in seeing how quickly   they would actually be able to arrange deals with specific borrowers for specific types of   collateral Bill, in terms of the detail, I don’t know if you or Trish want to comment  "
8756,2009-06-23,"2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Earlier there was material  distributed entitled “FOMC Briefing on Projections of the Balance Sheet, the  Monetary Base, and Federal Reserve Income” For this meeting, the staff has again  prepared projections of the balance sheet under various alternatives  Here we focus  on the baseline and expanded purchase scenarios that were presented in the Bluebook   The baseline scenario involves maintaining the currently announced limits of the  FOMC’s asset purchase programs, while the expanded purchase scenario depicts a  case in which the purchases of Treasury securities are expanded from $300 billion to  $750 billion, consistent with alternative A from the Bluebook  The staff sent the  Committee a memorandum that projects Federal Reserve income using the baseline  balance sheet projections and various assumptions for interest rates  In this briefing, I  will summarize the balance sheet and income projections   The charts in exhibit 1 illustrate the underlying assumptions for the baseline and  expanded purchase scenarios  The dotted lines present the projections made for the  April meeting  Several factors account for the differences from the previous  meeting’s projections  First, we have made some technical adjustments to our                             June 23–24, 2009 10 of 261  assumptions for securities holdings, the most significant of which is a slower assumed  prepayment rate for MBS  As a result, MBS holdings end the projection period  almost $200 billion higher than in our last projections  Second, we have also adjusted  our assumptions regarding the credit and liquidity facilities given the recent lower­ than-projected usage Most notably, as shown on the second page, loan issuance  under the TALF has been revised downward significantly because of the experience  with the facility to date and revised staff views of likely use in the future   As shown in exhibit 2, under the baseline scenario, the balance sheet peaks at  about $28 trillion at the end of this year  In subsequent years, TALF loans are repaid  and securities mature, or are prepaid in the case of MBS, so the balance sheet  contracts to just under $15 trillion at the end of 2016  On the liabilities side,  currency grows steadily and eventually returns to being the largest liability item  Reserve balances shrink reflecting the runoff in assets and the growth in currency   Exhibit 3 presents the projections for the expanded purchase scenario  The results are  qualitatively similar, but total assets peak at a higher level at the end of this year and  remain slightly higher than in the baseline for the projection period    Corresponding projections for the monetary base are presented in exhibit 4   Continued large-scale asset purchases lead to rapid expansion of the base from  August through the end of the year, with annualized growth rates of around 100  percent Early next year, the contraction of the balance sheet resulting from the  cessation of LSAPs and the runoff of liquidity facilities causes reserve balances to  shrink more rapidly than currency expands  As a result, for each remaining year in  the projection, the monetary base contracts   The substantial changes to the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet pose risks to the System’s net income that were summarized in a staff  memorandum to the Committee dated June 17, 2009  The memo concentrated on two  risks The first risk is that, as the policy rate is increased, the income that the Reserve  Banks earn on largely fixed-rate assets becomes insufficient to offset expenses, most  importantly the interest expense on reserve balances  The second risk is the  possibility that increases in interest rates reduce the market value of the SOMA  portfolio so that, in the event that the Desk needs to sell some of these securities to  drain reserves to raise the federal funds rate, the System realizes capital losses  The  analysis presented in the memo suggests that, using the baseline projection for the  balance sheet, the first risk is not significant under most plausible scenarios, but the  second risk is important to consider     Exhibit 5 summarizes projections of Federal Reserve income and remittances to  the Treasury under three different scenarios for interest rates  The first row shows the  baseline with interest rates consistent with those in the Greenbook, that is, the  Greenbook as it was iterating on Tuesday, June 16, just before finalization  The black  line in the top left panel presents gross income for the Federal Reserve System, which  is driven largely by interest income from the SOMA portfolio, and the red region  represents total expenses, which is driven significantly by interest paid on reserve                                                            3 The materials used by Mr English are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)                         June 23–24, 2009 11 of 261  balances, which leaves the grey region as net income for the System prior to  distribution of dividends To the right, subtracting dividends paid on Reserve Bank  capital and other transfers—the red region—leaves excess earnings that are remitted  to the Treasury as interest on Federal Reserve notes, the grey region  In the second  row, which uses an interest rate path consistent with current market rates, remittances  to the Treasury remain sizable and, in fact, exceed the average remittance to the  Treasury over the past ten years The bottom row, however, shows a scenario where  interest rates rise sharply—in this case, the federal funds rate rises to as high as 8  percent by the end of 2011—and interest expense drives net income to zero, and, as  shown in the bottom right panel, remittances to the Treasury are projected to be zero  from 2011 to 2013   The memo also presented approximate unrealized mark-to-market losses for the  SOMA portfolio, which are summarized in exhibit 6  At the end of the first quarter of  this year, the SOMA portfolio was in a modest gain position, illustrated by the blue  line for the baseline starting slightly below zero—that is, with negative losses—  because the legacy holdings of Treasury securities had an average coupon above  market rates  Under the Greenbook projection, longer-term interest rates do not rise  appreciably above current levels until 2013, and the portfolio shifts to a modest loss  position around that time Under the market-based scenario, losses mount more  quickly, and before long the portfolio has unrealized losses of about $100 billion  As  a result, if one-third of the portfolio were sold to drain reserves and so one-third of  the total portfolio losses were realized, those losses could conceivably wipe out the  remittances to the Treasury  Under the high-interest-rate scenario, the red line, losses  are even higher and mount more quickly  In such a case, the sale of securities could  quickly lead to significant realized capital losses  As Jim and Spence will discuss,  however, it is not necessarily the case that the Desk will need to sell securities, as  other tools will be available when the Committee deems it appropriate to tighten the  stance of monetary policy   Yes The difference between the two is not very big, partly because   the liquidity and credit facilities are starting to wind down fairly quickly now over the next year   or so So we didn’t see that much reason to make significantly different assumptions about them    That’s right   I would slightly prefer to think of it as that you guys have turned it   around [Laughter]   I do The logic underlying it, such as it was, was that the use of the   facilities by depository institutions is by and large determined by economic and financial market   conditions; that is, while financial markets are under strain, depository institutions will continue   to borrow and other institutions will continue to borrow, and when things get better, they’ll   borrow less We’ve thought of that aspect of it as being roughly independent, and, for most   cases, that seems to be borne out by the anecdotal information we get from markets   The particular institution you’re talking about, I agree, is quite different from a lot of the   other institutions That bank has a very large amount of reserve balances that it owns outright in   some sense  In addition, it’s also borrowing a reasonably large amount from the Federal   Reserve To me, that says that it’s choosing, as I think you characterized it accurately, its level   of reserve balances as a specific target—this is how much it wants to hold, and it has some   latitude to go up or down   Our reading on the rest of the banking system—the banking system in the aggregate—is   not quite that way The bulk of the activity in lending facilities involves not depository   institutions but other institutions  Their borrowing through the commercial paper funding   facility, for example, shows up as a quantity of reserve balances, but it’s not a depository   institution that has done that borrowing If we wanted to get that set of reserve balances out of   the banking system, there’s not a bank that would intentionally repay that borrowing to reduce   their reserve holdings—it’s the CP issuer that’s doing it  So, in that sense, we’ve separated most   of the borrowing as a response to financial market conditions and economic conditions in   constructing the reserve balances   That sounds like a profit-sharing plan for the Fed employees  The   accounting treatment is that once there’s no net income after paying dividends and that sort of   thing, we stop remitting money to the Treasury  What happens if we can’t even make the   dividend payments to the member banks?  The Reserve Banks would not pay their dividends to   the member banks, but they would have to make that up in subsequent years   It’s cumulative, exactly     My recollection is that it’s a choice, and part of it comes from   Board direction to the Reserve Banks Then the question becomes how long this goes on; it ends   up accumulating through time, and then in subsequent years it just takes that much longer before   we start getting back to normal  We have to save up earnings  The accounting for it is still being   evaluated  There’s some view that some of the remittances that have already been paid to the   Treasury could be recouped by booking an asset that’s essentially a prepayment, and then that   might be able to be pushed back an extra year; the accountants in the System are working on the   actual treatment of that   Just to clarify a bit, what we sidestepped in the analysis was the fact   that the remittances are actually made currently by individual Reserve Banks, and it is very, very   common for an individual Reserve Bank not to have sufficient capital to equate with surplus and   to make a remittance to the Treasury  Over the past decade or so, it’s been something like   40 weeks per year that at least one Reserve Bank hasn’t made a remittance to the Treasury  So   it’s not as though this is something that is completely unprecedented for the Federal Reserve    What would be very different here is that it would happen for the Federal Reserve System as a   whole   It has been the stated policy that it’s expected that these assets will   be managed through time to recover everything, so in that sense the official view is that there   will be no losses  Given that, the estimate is conservative—it’s taking on more losses than was   originally expected by the policy itself   The other part that’s not obvious to me is the effect if, for example, interest rates rose  If   that increasing rate was because the economy as a whole was getting better and financial markets   were healing and everyone thought the outlook was very, very rosy, then the underlying value of   some of those assets may no longer be distressed  Some of the write-downs are because of the   strains in financial markets  You could imagine cases where some of those assets increase in   value because the economy is turning around and the outlook is brighter, and it’s exactly those   sorts of multivalent influences that caused us to throw up our hands somewhat and take the   coward’s way out   Right now what’s envisioned is the case where losses were   sufficiently large that capital would go negative  What has been written into Reserve Bank   accounting policy is the ability to create a prepaid asset for things that have happened year to   date They are currently working on ways of going back not just year to date, but the prior year               June 23–24, 2009 53 of 261  as well, so that would be used in the event of losses where you wouldn’t have enough retained   earnings to equate surplus with capital paid in   One extra bit of data that might help with that specific question is   that, even in the past couple of days, and in the past months, when the effective federal funds rate   has been right at the top of the zero to 25 basis point band—or we would just say right up against   the rate on excess—it has been associated with the repo rate being above the excess rate, that is,   at 27, 28, 29 basis points And we’ve been hearing that that has been causing some of this              June 23–24, 2009 60 of 261  shifting of funds that might have been lent unsecured into the secured funding markets  So I   think that is very much in line with Spence’s point about the repo market being a way for us to   take care of some of that   "
8786,2009-08-11," Just one minor clarification, though, President Lacker  Some of the   facilities, if we take two of them in particular—well, just take the CPFF as a single example  At              August 11–12, 2009 29 of 165  its peak, the CPFF was very, very large—well over $200 billion  And it wasn’t necessarily just   banks borrowing that As that usage came down, that was not in the first instance a bank   deciding that they have access to funds in one case and so they are going to give it up in another   case So it is not obvious that it is quite as tight a link of reduced use of liquidity facilities,   simply because of the increase in the provision of balances from that asset purchase   Thank you, Chris A term deposit facility could be another  part of the tool kit for implementing a decision to raise short-term interest rates   Because a deposit facility would be created under the authority for paying interest on  reserves, access would be limited to depository institutions and not, for example, the  GSEs This distinction is a clear difference from Chris’s description of reverse repos   Funds deposited in a term deposit facility would not be available to clear payments,  satisfy reserve or clearing balance requirements, or be treated as balances for  purposes of calculating overdraft fees In essence, by shifting balances out of DIs’  master accounts, a deposit facility would lower excess reserves     The quantity of excess reserves that could be absorbed by a deposit facility is  unclear, though logically it should increase as the interest rate paid on term deposits  rises The staff is evaluating two potential approaches for setting the rate paid on  term deposits  The Federal Reserve could auction a fixed quantity of term deposits,  with the rate established in the auction  Alternatively, the Federal Reserve could post  the interest rates that it will pay on term deposits, and DIs would decide what  quantities they wish to deposit at those rates  In either case, the rate paid would be  constrained by the statutory requirement that rates not exceed prevailing market rates   The staff currently envisions that a deposit facility would be a somewhat blunt tool  and be used to drain a block of reserve balances rather than as an instrument for day­ to-day reserves management  The auction-rate approach would likely give the  Federal Reserve greater control over the quantity of term deposits than would a  posted-rate facility Such control might be desirable if other tools, such as reverse  repos or asset sales, were to drain such a large quantity of reserves that precision over  the level of reserves would become important again  That said, under either  approach, settlement would likely occur with a lag of at least one day, partly to  enhance the predictability of the quantity of reserves     In practice, the Federal Reserve would announce the details of each operation, and  an administrator would enter those details into an automated application that has been                     August 11–12, 2009 33 of 165  largely developed Using a web-based interface for the new application, depository  institutions would submit tenders electronically and get notification of awards  For  auction-rate facilities, in particular, the application also provides the capability of  noncompetitive bids, which might appeal to some of the smaller depository  institutions   The background work to put a deposit facility into operation is well under way   The Federal Reserve could announce a deposit facility as early as November and  implement the facility before the end of the year  IAS, the Integrated Accounting  System, has been modified to accept settlement entries from the new term deposit  application During the next several months, System staff members will complete  and test the deposit facility application Implementing a deposit facility would also  require a number of additional steps beyond those already completed, including  preparing any necessary Federal Register notices, drafting legal agreements,  educating DIs about the new facility, obtaining signed versions of the legal  agreements from DIs that may wish to use the facility, and issuing the electronic  certificates that DIs would need to access the deposit facility application through the  web-based interface Completing these steps would take several months and entail a  significant, coordinated effort by System staff members across a number of business  lines Jamie McAndrews will now discuss reserve collateral accounts     I think one extra point, because you did note accurately the role that   the GSEs played in a lot of the discussion, we are still working out precisely whether it is the   aggregate quantity of reserves all by itself that matters or if there is an extra effect of the GSEs   selling into the market  Chris noted the quantity of fed funds sales that the GSEs did, and so did   Jamie  Relative to the $750 billion of excess right now, it doesn’t seem as though it is that huge   a portion So there is definitely an argument to be made that we might be focusing too much   attention on them utterly and completely idiosyncratically when it is a larger issue in terms of   just the sheer quantity I think all of these issues that Chris and Jamie brought up have to be seen   through that filter as well   Just to reduce the incredulity a bit about the market power, one of   the main factors of the non-collateralized market is that risk mitigants include just line limits    All of the market participants know that the GSEs have limits on their counterparties, and they   also know that on many days, if you were to add up the line limits across all their counterparties,   that would be less than the aggregate amount they are going to want to sell into the market  In   that sense, each individual counterparty has a line limit  They know that the GSEs are going to   use up their line limits, and that is where the market power comes in because the aggregate   amount that they would like to sell is greater than the sum of the individual line limits to   counterparties And the “dozens” is closer to two dozen, not three, four, or five dozen    "
9217,2011-06-21,"5  I’m going to be referring to the package labeled “Material  for Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 depicts the  broad contours of your current projections for 2011 through 2013 and over the longer  run  As shown, you expect a gradual economic recovery over the next two and a half  years, with real GDP growth—the top panel—little changed this year from its pace in  2010 and then increasing modestly in each of the next two years  The unemployment  rate—the second panel—steps down slowly over the same period  With regard to  inflation—the bottom two panels—the central tendency of your projections for PCE  inflation indicates a transitory increase this year before it settles back in 2012 and  2013 to levels roughly consistent with or just slightly below your estimates of its  longer-run, mandate-consistent level  Your projections of core inflation generally  remain at or somewhat below 2 percent over the forecast period   Exhibit 2 reports the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for 2011  through 2013 and over the longer run; the corresponding information for your April  projections is indicated in italics, and the current and April Tealbook projections are  included as memo items  You generally see somewhat weaker real activity over the  forecast period than you did at the time of the April meeting, but your forecasts for  inflation have not changed appreciably on balance  In your forecast narratives, most  of you indicated that these revisions were the result of disappointing incoming data  on production and spending and elevated energy and food prices   The central tendencies of your longer-run projections—detailed in the column to  the right—show that over time, the annual rate of increase in real GDP is expected to                                                     5 The materials used by Mr Carpenter are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   June 21–22, 2011 83 of 282              converge to about 2½ to 2¾ percent, and the unemployment rate will fall to between  5¼ and 5½ percent  Your longer-run projections for total PCE inflation suggest that  most of you see PCE inflation between about 1¾ and 2 percent as consistent with  your dual mandate  All of the longer-run projections were unchanged from April   In the near term, each of you marked down your projections for real GDP growth  this year, with the central tendency of your estimates, shown in the top panel, almost  ½ percentage point lower than in April  Most of you now anticipate that real GDP  will increase just under 2¾ to 3 percent in 2011, versus just over 3 to 3¼ percent in  the previous forecast  The downward revisions to your GDP growth forecasts for  2012 were of a roughly similar magnitude, with most of you expecting growth next  year to be between 3¼ and 3¾ percent compared with expectations of 3½ to  4¼ percent in April  Your revisions for 2013 were smaller, with most of you still  expecting growth in real GDP between 3½ and 4¼ percent in that year  This pattern  of revisions is similar to, but slightly less pronounced than, the changes in the  corresponding Tealbook projections since April   Your unemployment rate projections are summarized in the second panel   Reflecting the increase in the unemployment rate in recent months and your weaker  projections for economic growth, all but one of you raised your forecast for the  average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year, with the central  tendency of your projections running from just over 8½ to almost 9 percent, versus  the central tendency of just under 8½ to 8¾ percent in April  Similarly, most of you  now project that the unemployment rate will only fall to 7 to 7½ percent in late 2013,  a range that is about ¼ percentage point higher than your previous projections and  still well above the roughly 5¼ to 5½ percent central tendency of your estimates of  the unemployment rate that would prevail over the longer run in the absence of  further shocks (shown in the right-hand column)  The revision to the Tealbook  forecast of the unemployment rate over the forecast period was roughly similar   Turning to inflation—the bottom two panels—the central tendency and overall  range of your projections for total PCE inflation this year narrowed slightly  Most of  you now anticipate that headline inflation will be between 2¼ and 2½ percent,  compared with a central tendency of just over 2 to 2¾ percent in April  You  generally view inflation as likely to subside in coming years, and the central  tendencies for both 2012 and 2013 are 1½ to 2 percent  While the top of these central  tendencies—and ranges—has not changed since April, the bottoms of the central  tendencies are a bit higher, as fewer of you now anticipate very low inflation rates  than at the time of the last SEP  The central tendencies for 2012 and 2013 are a bit  below the central tendency of your estimates of the longer-run, “mandate consistent”  inflation rate, shown to the right  The central tendency of your projections for core  PCE inflation for 2011, shown in the bottom panel, has shifted up a touch and now  runs from 1½ to 1¾ percent, about ¾ percentage point below headline inflation  By  contrast, the central tendencies of your core inflation projections for 2012 and 2013  are about the same as those for headline inflation, as most of you see the factors  boosting headline inflation this year—including higher commodity prices and supply  chain disruptions related to the events in Japan—as likely to be largely temporary    June 21–22, 2011 84 of 282              The Tealbook forecasts for both total and core inflation in 2012 and 2013 are in the  lower part of the central tendency ranges of your projections   The next exhibit summarizes your assessments of the uncertainty and risks that  you attach to your projections  As indicated in the two panels on the left-hand side, a  sizable majority of you continue to judge that the levels of uncertainty associated with  your projections for both real GDP and inflation—as well as for the unemployment  rate (not shown)—are greater than the average levels that have prevailed over the past  20 years   As shown in the upper-right panel, there has been a noticeable shift in your views  about the risks to your GDP growth projections, with a substantial majority of you  now seeing the risks as weighted to the downside  The downside risk to GDP growth  that you most frequently mentioned included the persistent weakness in household  income and spending, uncertainties about the domestic fiscal outlook, possible  spillovers from the European debt situation, and a slowdown in economic activity in  emerging economies   Your assessments of the risks attending your inflation projections—shown in the  bottom-right panel—have also shifted somewhat, with a majority of you now seeing  the risks to the inflation outlook as generally balanced, although several of you  continue to see upside risks  Some of you noted that although you expect the  inflationary effects of elevated food and energy prices to abate, these effects could  prove to be more persistent  Others pointed to the risk that monetary policy could  remain accommodative for too long, resulting in an undesirable rise in inflation   The last exhibit is an alternative presentation of the ranges and the central  tendencies for GDP growth, unemployment, and PCE inflation  This exhibit presents  the same information about these projections as is presented in exhibit 1; however, a  fan chart is used to depict the dispersion in views instead of a so-called box-and- whiskers chart  The Chairman intends to distribute the fan chart, along with the table,  shown in exhibit 2, in conjunction with his press conference tomorrow afternoon   While the fan chart was judged to be more helpful in the context of the press briefing,  we plan to continue to use the box-and-whiskers chart for now in the SEP that is  published with the minutes That concludes my prepared remarks  "
9294,2011-09-20,"  Thank you  The Committee also received a memo about the  implications of lowering the interest rate paid on excess reserves (what we refer to as  the IOER rate) to zero or to some positive value, such as 10 basis points  I should  note that I’m referring to what’s labeled “Exhibit 2”  It’s a set of bullet points to help  you follow along  Lowering the IOER rate would likely push down money market  rates and, by lowering the expected future short-term rate, should also put some  downward pressure on longer-term interest rates  The overall effect would likely be  quite modest, however, because money market rates are already near zero, and there  are some impediments to some of these interest rates falling below zero  For  example, it is unlikely that the federal funds rate would ever trade at negative rates;  however, other instruments, such as Eurodollars, GC repo, and Treasury bills, have  traded at negative rates in the past and could do so in the future   September 20–21, 2011 18 of 290              Lowering the IOER rate should, all else being equal, provide banks with an  additional incentive to lend, because any individual bank could fund additional  lending by running down its reserves and leaving the overall size of its balance sheet  unchanged  However, surveys over the past couple of years suggest that banks see a  paucity of qualified borrowers, so a modest reduction in their opportunity cost of  lending may have only modest effects on their overall quantity of lending   Lowering the IOER rate might also mitigate the reputational risk to the Federal  Reserve from the appearance of paying a subsidy to banks  That risk may be  heightened because the rise in reserve balances that came from the LSAP program  initiated in November 2010 has been concentrated at branches and agencies of foreign  banks and because, since the spring, with the adjustment in the FDIC’s insurance  assessment, market rates have fallen further below the IOER rate  Reducing the  IOER rate to zero would clearly eliminate any possible subsidy  Reducing the IOER  rate to 10 basis points would at least result in the Federal Reserve paying interest to  banks at a rate that is somewhat more in line with other safe, short-term assets   Of course, reducing the IOER rate, particularly to zero, has potential costs,  including disruptions to money markets and the intermediation of credit  If short- term interest rates decline further, money market funds could come under additional  pressure, and the industry would likely contract further  The large volumes of funds  intermediated though money market funds might have to be redirected, with the  ultimate investors potentially switching to other assets and the ultimate borrowers  finding alternative sources of funding  If such shifts were abrupt, and borrowers  could not find ready alternative sources of funding, disruptions to market functioning  could ensue   There could be, in particular, implications for the federal funds market as well   The federal funds market consists of banks borrowing from institutions that cannot  earn interest on reserves, primarily the Federal Home Loan Banks, in order to  arbitrage the IOER rate  If the IOER rate were cut, especially to zero, banks would  lose the incentive for this trade  The federal funds market would likely contract  significantly, and the effective rate could become erratic, perhaps becoming less well  correlated with other market rates and even possibly rising outside of the target range   Investors might react to lower money market rates by leaving large deposits with  their banks  Given balance sheet pressures, other banks might follow the lead of  Bank of New York Mellon and begin imposing explicit negative interest rates on  deposits  If such a pattern became widespread, policymakers might be concerned  about creating hardships for households and other savers and, as a result, run a  different reputational risk   Finally, the US Treasury debt auctions cannot accept negative bids  If Treasury  bills were persistently trading at negative rates, bidding at auctions could be distorted,  with a likely stop-out rate at 0 percent, and the primary dealers would instantly realize  a risk-free profit from the Treasury  That concludes my remarks  I turn it over to  Dave   September 20–21, 2011 19 of 290               I don’t have that on me    Yes, it’s getting up close to just under half of the total quantity    Most of the roughly $600 billion increase from the second LSAPs,   in dollar terms, went to the foreign branches and agencies, in an adding-up sense  So it’s a good   portion of it    I guess I would offer the following  The transmission channel that   you described about the switch in the funding position of the branches relative to their   headquarters overseas is consistent with the anecdotal reports that we are hearing  And you can   think about the reasons for this working independently and then reinforcing each other, with   reserves being an attractive asset, paying more than other perfectly safe things, and the foreign   supervisors wanting there to be more dollar-denominated liquidity on their books for liquidity   reasons  We’re definitely hearing that story  I think there are a couple of different ways it could   September 20–21, 2011 23 of 290              matter in terms of the effect on other market rates and intermediate-term market rates  The story   that you told where there is reduced demand for two-year Treasuries and increased demand for   reserves would tend to push up the two-year rate closer to the IOER rate  But that’s in some   sense just the more general point that the rate paid on reserves affects short-term rates and things   that are close substitutes  To the extent that it’s higher than it might otherwise be, if 25 basis   points is higher than zero, then presumably if the IOER rate fell to zero, the two-year rate would   also come down at least to some degree with it  Does that answer the question you were asking?    I think your story is consistent with what we’ve been hearing and   the data we have    The statutory requirement is that the rate paid on reserves can’t   exceed the general level of short-term interest rates      Not defined    The statutory requirement is pretty vague  In terms of putting   things into practice, it ends up being a little bit more judgment  You could look at several other   market rates, and so you’d have to define the universe of short-term interest rates  You’d have to   define what “general level” means  So if you were to look at just federal funds, the effective   federal funds rate is 6, 7 basis points, but every day there’s a distribution of trades, and some of   September 20–21, 2011 25 of 290              those trades are outside of the 0 to 25 basis points target range  As a result, there are, every day,   trades in short-term money markets that are above 25 basis points  In that sense, it’s not obvious,   at least to me, that paying 25 basis points is at odds with the vague definition of the law    Right  What we tried to characterize in the memo, and I alluded to   it in the briefing, was that this would be in some sense a reputational risk  From an economic   perspective, banks have, since time immemorial, imposed fees on checking accounts, giving at   least effective or implicit negative rates  But writing down a negative interest rate as their   deposit rate is psychologically different for people    Yes  On the first point about the money fund, I think we agree with   you entirely, and I should point out that there is a distribution across the staff as to how big the   costs are  I think the ability of a sponsor to subsidize a fund that’s operating at a loss then means   either that some of the disruptions won’t happen or that the disruptions might happen more   slowly through time, allowing this greater intermediation that may ultimately have to take place   going from one steady state to another  It could happen more gradually—again, mitigating the   potential disruptions  So the scenario you paint seems entirely plausible  We just can’t be   certain that that’s going to be the case    I think from the money fund management perspective, the view that   President Rosengren brings up is one that we’ve heard a lot here at the Board  Brian, I don’t   know whether you want to characterize the Desk’s discussions    We have not recently done a survey of banks on that specific   question, but the way we look at it is to ask how big of an effect could it be and what are the   current impediments to lending right now?  That’s why we tried to allude to some of the surveys   that we have on a regular basis about business lending from banks, and banks tend to point to a   shortage of qualified borrowers—their terms—and low demand for loans  The economy is   weak  The need for bank credit is low, and as a result, there’s less demand  While it seems clear   that this should, at the margin, provide banks with a greater incentive to lend, at most we’re   talking about a 25 basis point change  In that sense, it’s not clear that it could be that large to   begin with  Moreover, banks have some balance sheet constraints  An individual bank may try   to get rid of reserves and get more loans, but the banking sector as a whole can’t get rid of   reserves  And if, in fact, the real constraint on bank lending now is on the demand side and not   so much on the supply side, again, at the margin it should go in the right direction, but it doesn’t   seem like it could be “the answer”  That said, we’ve seen a small increase recently in bank   lending, and so to the extent that this could help with that momentum, maybe there’s something   at the margin   September 20–21, 2011 30 of 290               Well, we can definitely do more thinking about it  I guess some of   the issues are almost inherently unknowable until we get there  As in the discussions that the   September 20–21, 2011 111 of 290              Desk had with money funds and in those that President Rosengren had with money funds, you’ll   get potentially different answers from talking to different people  Is it primarily the cost that you   are asking about?    Yes  Let us think about it and then get back to you    After today’s meeting wraps up, we’ll have some discussion and get   back to you tomorrow morning with our thoughts    You asked if we had scope to do any more work on the costs and   benefits  I feel that on the benefits side, we have as much knowledge as we are going to get    The economic effects are likely small; we know the sign, but the magnitude is very small  So   then I think that it is the political economy subsidy issue that policymakers obviously will have   to weigh, how important that is to you   On the cost side, though, it is possible that we could do a bit more work, by talking to   banks and money funds, to try to make more precise the mechanisms where we think disruptions   would be, how big they might be, and what the probabilities are  We could talk to banks; we   also could talk to the Treasury to understand its constraints about the bill-auction mechanism, per   se  I suspect we could do a little bit more to try to clarify the costs and get back to you with a   memo  Does that seem like a reasonable plan?   September 20–21, 2011 187 of 290               One possibility is to use the fact that since the spring, market rates   have fallen pretty significantly, and talk about that as a pattern and ask what sort of effects they   have seen, and then ask them to extrapolate on that if that trend were to continue    Yes  That seems exactly right  And to the extent that we are   worried about disruptions, we could also think about the opposite side of the market, who the   ultimate borrowers are and to what degree they would be able to substitute    Absolutely   "
