 One thing that I just wanted to make sure we understand is that the test on   insolvency is different from having a buffer  For the large institutions, you would only get to the   point of insolvency if, in fact, you looked at their expected losses for the first year and you got a   reserve need that was so big that it actually made the institution insolvent  What was outlined   here is the amount of capital a bank would need as a buffer to get beyond that one-year time   frame, whether it is two years or three years  You would not use that calculation to make a   determination of insolvency  So I just want to make sure that you understand, in looking at even   the largest two that we’re talking about, the insolvency decision is made the same way as always    If you have no capital or you’ve gone below 2 percent (for prompt corrective action), then we   would do, obviously, what we would do in the normal course for large banks, or any bank  But   that’s not what we are talking about here in terms of capital buffer   We would acknowledge that request and give them the capital  I was   responding to your question on insolvency for the large banks, and I just wanted to make sure   you understood that   I don’t have a good response to your question, but there is a separate   group working on what steps we might take if, for example, there’s vulnerability, particularly   around some of the larger banks, before this program can even get up and running, or if there’s   another Friday night phone call There is an interagency group that is not only working through   the steps and clearly thinking about the capital and the wraps that we have done before, but that   is also considering what other actions might need to be taken There’s also a separate subgroup   of people who are thinking about the legal changes that need to be made in the regulatory   structure to be able to deal with a failure of a large, systemically important financial holding   company; now we would have to deal with it through something like bankruptcy, which is not   acceptable So we’re laying out all of those steps—what we’ve done before, what other things   we can do The FDIC is involved in it We’re trying to quickly put down on a couple of sheets   of paper all of those things   We have run screens, too, just to see which banks might on “day one”   have a capital bogey that would not necessarily meet that tangible common equity threshold, to   see which ones the market might pick on right away—that are vulnerable—and there are   probably about four of them  So we’ve tried to go through and look at those particular firms   I’ll add one other thing to that point  It hasn’t been decided yet As the   Chairman said, a lot of the details are still being worked out  But there is a concern around   banks retooling their balance sheets, shutting down on lending, or shrinking their balance sheets   to make some particular capital ratio bogey  We’re trying to figure out ways to get around that    For example, last night there was a lot of discussion about having a dollar amount of capital to   focus on as opposed to a capital ratio—so we’re trying to see if we can work through some   process where banks don’t shrink their balance sheets just to get to a certain capital ratio  People   are working on all of that now, and we’re all concerned about the same thing   And I think getting to the 3 percent bogey gets to the predominant figure    That doesn’t change the well-capitalized requirement of 6 percent  So we were trying really hard   not to come up with a new capital standard in that sense    Right, but only for the buffer   I think there will be some differences  We’re trying not to do just a fixed   percent That’s why we’re looking at it institution by institution and working with the examiners   who have some insights on the quality of different portfolios in order to get to a buffer  I agree   with the Chairman  The buffer was always supposed to be there  It’s the environment we’re   now requiring it in that’s very different   It is a big concern that banks could try to meet the new requirement in a   variety of ways, including selling their assets  On the other hand, there are good examples where   you do want them to deleverage and sell the assets  But the problem in terms of getting things   moving again is, if they just shut down, don’t lend at all, totally strip their balance sheet, it   somewhat defeats the purpose  So people are brainstorming about other ways to do this without   leading to shrinkage of the balance sheet to meet some ratio number        February 7, 2009 45 of 65   I’m not quite sure how to frame “all they can”  I think the supervisors—   particularly with the company that’s probably the most international of all—have clearly gone   through their funding It has set up appropriate funding mechanisms within those countries   where they are being looked at, and they have taken good significant steps to try to address some   of the vulnerabilities They’ve had outreach meetings with the different central banks  So   during the last year, they have actually been taking a lot of aggressive steps to try to minimize   the vulnerability associated with that  But some of the organizations are big purchasers in   foreign currencies We just can’t shut that down that quickly, nor do we expect to  It’s just not a            March 17–18, 2009 32 of 266  believable strategy for that funding mechanism  But they’re looking more broadly both at the   US and abroad   They absolutely have been not only looking at those strategies, but also   executing those strategies
