 I should probably point out that this was not an on-site  examination Our staffs met with the managements of these institutions I think they came away  with a feeling that, generally speaking, the banks were saying the right things in terms of the  kinds of risk management processes they had in place The bankers talked a lot about how their  involvement with hedge funds was becoming a bigger part of their overall business activities,  and they noted that they actually had staff who managed their relationships with the big hedge  funds because of the nature of the business I gathered that the bankers were indicating that they    9/29/98  had the policies and procedures in place to deal in a fairly effective way with the risks that  generally were involved  In terms of this situation, I think that the issues either then or going forward are  threefold One is the extent to which the banks actually are applying these risk management  policies in the course of their activities That application of policies has to be looked at in the  context of the examination process We indicated in the memorandum, as Bill McDonough  mentioned, that this was an area that we needed to continue to focus on in the course of the  examination process Secondly, in terms of the issues here, I think the robustness with which the  banks applied their own policies was adversely affected by their perception of the reputation of  the people who ran LTCM/P The final point is that in terms of lessons learned, a lot of the focus  here has to be on collateral and collateral management One thing that this experience has  underscored--and actually we have known this for some time--is that collateral is only one aspect  of the overall control of credit risk, but it is not a replacement for the banks' analysis of the  overall creditworthiness of the borrower  At this point, we think the banks had the right policies and procedures in place The  question is how effectively the banks were implementing those policies and procedures We  have people visiting the three major state member banks today, and tomorrow they will be at  Salomon, to talk about the overall exposure of these institutions to hedge funds, their exposure to  LTCM, the extent to which they actually are following the policies that they said they had in  place, and whether they treated LTCM differently from other hedge funds for whatever reasons  I think the basic answer is that we were reasonably comfortable that they had the policies in  place, but the question is how effectively the banks were actually implementing them in the case  of this particular institution We still have to look into that    9/29/98   We typically do some transactions testing to see if banks  are carrying out their policies with respect to counterparties Actually, the Bankers Trust and  Morgan exams are now under way Just before I came to this meeting, I looked at the previous  examination, and there was no mention of LTCM in it But that firm grew rapidly, and the banks  may have had a fairly modest amount of exposure at the time of the previous examination At  this point, I cannot say whether we looked at the particular relationship you mentioned, but we  do look at and test to see whether a bank's policies are being implemented We do not do that  for every counterparty by any means We do a spot check   Yes, that previous exam probably would have been as of  the middle of 1997 That exam would have been over a year old That's a question we have to  go back and take a look at   Initially, these transactions in derivatives were in a sense  unsecured Once the exposure reached a certain point, then the lender, the bank, had the right to  demand collateral to cover that That is, when the mark-to-market position and the current  exposure built up to a certain point, then the banks asked for the collateral According to the  numbers we have now, it appears that the mark-to-market positions of these big institutions are  largely covered by collateral So, it does not seem that there is much loss in their current  mark-to-market positions and other derivatives positions One of the problems is the potential  future exposure I am going to say this in English If markets keep moving away from them in  the wrong direction, their future exposure could be very large and they might not have the  collateral at that point in time to cover that exposure    9/29/98   As I recall, the credit was $700 million It was $500  million initially, but it subsequently was increased   No   It looks as though their current positions are covered by  collateral, but the issue is potential future exposure in these markets I have to pin these numbers  down, but from the numbers I've seen, it looks as though they did a pretty good job of getting  collateral to cover their mark-to-market positions But the potential future exposures seem rather  large, and if they were to materialize under these market conditions one has to wonder where any  collateral would come from in the future That is part of the problem
