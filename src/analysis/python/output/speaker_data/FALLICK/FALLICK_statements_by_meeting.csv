9151,2011-01-25,"1  Thank you  I’ll be referring to the materials in the packet titled  “FOMC Briefing on Structural Unemployment”  Unemployment can be thought of as  divisible into two components, one that I will refer to as structural unemployment,  and the other as cyclical                                                       1 The materials used by Messrs Fallick and Faberman and Ms Şahin are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 25–26, 2011 13 of 282              As outlined at the top of your first exhibit, structural, or frictional, unemployment  can be thought of as reflecting difficulties in matching available workers to available  jobs  The extent of structural unemployment is determined by numerous factors   One is demographics; for example, young workers move into and out of jobs more  frequently  Another is the technology of job search and worker screening, which  typically evolves only slowly  Others include imbalances between the characteristics  or locations of potential workers and those of vacant jobs  These imbalances may be  long-lasting, even generational                  The other main component, cyclical unemployment, is the additional  unemployment that arises due to a shortfall in aggregate economic activity  This is  the category most closely associated with the typical fluctuations in unemployment  over the business cycle and is the most obviously amenable to reduction through  policies aimed at stimulating aggregate demand   We generally view structural unemployment as determining a NAIRU  On this  view, inflation is most sensitive to cyclical unemployment, as wages and prices adjust  to put underutilized resources back to work   The line between these categories is often blurry  Consider, for example, a policy  like extended or emergency unemployment insurance benefits  Such benefits likely  increase unemployment by changing search behavior, thus increasing what might be  called structural unemployment  However, the policy itself is a response to the  business cycle and can be expected to disappear once labor demand improves  sufficiently  Similarly, recent geographic or industry imbalances between the supply  of workers and the demand for jobs could be described as raising structural  unemployment  But recessions always affect some regions and industries more  adversely than others, and these imbalances typically fade as aggregate demand  recovers  Each phenomenon requires its own evaluation  However, we would  usually not interpret those that regularly accompany recessions, and regularly cease as  the economy recovers, as contributing to an increase in the medium-term NAIRU   The recent recession has raised numerous questions about whether the events that  precipitated it, or the features of the recession itself, have raised the level of structural  employment  Several phenomena prompted this interest, examples of which are  highlighted in the middle and lower panels of the exhibit   As illustrated at the middle left, the onset of the recession was marked by sharp  reductions in employment in the residential construction and financial activities  sectors  If these reductions are permanent and the workers displaced from these  sectors have a particularly difficult time finding new jobs elsewhere, these shifts in  demand for labor could add to structural unemployment  However, as mentioned  above, in every recession some industries are hit particularly hard  The panel to the  right shows one measure of the dispersion in employment changes across major  industry groups  The red line shows the amount of dispersion attributable to normal  cyclical variation, while the black line shows the amount of dispersion that cannot be   January 25–26, 2011 14 of 282              explained simply by the cycle  The black line suggests that the degree to which  particular industries have suffered during this episode is not out of line with the  overall depth of the recession  And although the cyclical dispersion indicated by the  red line is large, it appears to have disappeared as quickly as it did in previous  episodes, as the large job losses in several industries came to an end  For this reason,  we do not view recent sectoral shifts as a significant source of increased structural  unemployment     Another feature of the recent downturn has been the large increase in the number   of homeowners with negative home equity, shown in the bottom left panel  Being  “underwater"" may inhibit the geographic mobility of these households and thus  reduce the speed at which the unemployed among them find new jobs  However,  based on the sort of evidence that Ayşegül will review in her presentation, we do not  believe that this “house-lock” has, as yet, significantly limited geographic mobility            Finally, the red line in the bottom right panel shows the rate of permanent job  loss; that is, the number of workers who lose their jobs each month with no  expectation of being rehired by their previous employers, scaled by the level of  employment  This rate moved up sharply during the recession, and although it has  moved down from its peak, the outstanding stock of persons unemployed following  permanent job loss (the black line) remains high  A permanent job loss will often  require a worker to make significant adjustments—to sector, location, or wage—if he  or she is to become re-employed, which usually entails a longer period of job search   As was noted in the September Tealbook, the elevated level of permanent job loss has  been an important factor in our thinking about an increase in structural  unemployment   Recognizing that these specific phenomena represent only a subset of the factors  possibly in play in the current episode and that their individual effects on structural  unemployment are both difficult to quantify and possibly overlapping, we have also  looked to more aggregate relationships as guides  One important relationship is that  between job openings, or vacancies, and unemployment  This relationship, known as  the Beveridge curve, is the subject of your second exhibit   The top panel graphs this relation for historical periods that include the past five  recessions and their early recoveries  On the vertical axis is a proxy for the vacancy  rate constructed from Conference Board data on help-wanted advertising  On the  horizontal axis is the unemployment rate  As one would expect, over the business  cycle the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate are negatively related  In each  recession, the economy moves along a curve down and to the right  The graph also  shows that over the longer term, the curve has shifted position  Shifts in the  Beveridge curve are often interpreted as reflecting changes in the amount of structural  unemployment  Indeed, the broad shifts observed over the past 40 years—outward  during the 1970s, then inward in the 1980s and 1990s—are generally attributable to  changes in the age composition of the labor force and the increasing labor market  attachment of women   January 25–26, 2011 15 of 282                The lower left panel highlights the past decade, using data from the Job Openings   and Labor Turnover Survey, which are not available for earlier years  The decade can  be conveniently divided into three periods  The black dots are the period before the  recent recession  These data points describe an apparently stable and almost linear  Beveridge curve—shown by the dashed black line  The red triangles denote quarterly  observations for 2008 and 2009  During this period, the increase in the  unemployment rate outpaced the decrease in the vacancy rate as judged by the earlier  relation  The blue squares are 2010; during this period, the vacancy rate rose, while  the unemployment rate remained almost unchanged     The observations after 2007 are a striking departure from the straight line   suggested by the data for the pre-recession period  However, as noted to the right,  there are reasons not to take these deviations at face value as measuring the increase  in structural unemployment, a few of which I will discuss here     First are questions of the underlying shape of the curve  As Jason will explain, a   typical theoretical treatment in the literature bases the Beveridge curve on the  technology of matching workers with jobs  The properties of this “matching  function,” as it is known, imply that the Beveridge curve should become flatter as the  unemployment rate increases  The green line shows the fitted value of a curve  suggested by a typical matching function  This shape for the curve implies smaller  recent deviations than does the linear version     Second, the persistent increases in layoffs that occur during recessions could be   expected to raise the unemployment rate more than the green line would suggest   This is not because the matching process itself has deteriorated, but because that  process faces such a large pool of newly unemployed workers who need to be  matched with jobs  Whether this is best described as a further flattening of the curve  at high rates of unemployment or as a departure from the curve, it is a regular feature  of recessions that we view as an increase in cyclical rather than structural  unemployment     Third, as one can see in the panel at the top of the page, as the labor market has   improved following past recessions, the vacancy–unemployment locus has exhibited  counterclockwise loops; that is, vacancies have improved in advance of  unemployment  Despite a lack of consensus on the source of these movements, they  appear to be a regular part of the dynamics of recovery, which we would not tend to  interpret as structural     However, remaining movements in the Beveridge curve could represent changes   in the efficiency of the job-matching process, which we would view as changes in  structural unemployment  An effort by my colleagues Regis Barnichon and Andrew  Figura to isolate these changes is illustrated in the top panels of exhibit 3  The panel  on the left shows a measure of job matching—the flow of persons from  unemployment to employment  The black line shows the actual flow, while the red   January 25–26, 2011 16 of 282              line shows the flow estimated by a model that holds the efficiency of the matching  process constant  The gap between the two that opened up during the recession  represents the decline in matching that cannot be explained by the other elements of  the model and is therefore attributed to a deterioration in matching efficiency  The  panel on the top right shows the approximate contribution of this deterioration to the  unemployment rate  These estimates suggest that structural unemployment increased  by about 1 percentage point by the middle of last year     Note that the Board staff estimates that the extended UI benefits have boosted the   unemployment rate by as much as ¾ percentage point  Some of this may show up as  a decline in matching efficiency and thus contribute to the estimated increase in the  top right panel  As I mentioned earlier, whether to call this an increase in structural  unemployment is not obvious  In the Tealbook we have accounted for it separately  from what we call the NAIRU, but included it in the “effective NAIRU,” which we  use to define medium-term labor market slack  In any case, we expect this element to  wane as these programs expire     As noted above, one reason that we care about identifying structural   unemployment is that it provides a benchmark for our estimates of the margin of  slack in the economy that influences price and wage pressures  That being so, the  behavior of inflation to date ought to tell us something about structural  unemployment  As you know, both price and wage inflation have moved down since  the unemployment rate began its sharp rise in 2008  Does the extent of this price and  wage deceleration suggest that part of the rise in the unemployment rate reflects an  increase in structural unemployment?     This is a difficult question to answer given our incomplete understanding of the   inflation process  My colleagues Charles Fleischman and John Roberts have  developed a model that attempts to address the question by combining a number of  economic relationships  As noted in the middle left panel, the model treats the  NAIRU and trends in output, productivity, the workweek, and labor force  participation as unobserved components  These trends and their observed  counterparts are related to each other through such macroeconomic relationships as  the Phillips curve and Okun’s law and by the assumption that the macroeconomic  variables are influenced by a common cyclical element     Lately we have been looking at a variant of this model that allows for the   possibility that the Phillips curve flattened in the mid-1980s  Also, given the earlier  evidence that the severity of the recent recession may have caused a relatively large  movement in the NAIRU, it allows the NAIRU to be more variable than in previous  episodes  The middle right panel graphs the NAIRU estimated by this version of the  model  This estimate has risen roughly ¾ percentage point since the onset of the  recession     The bottom left panel of the exhibit shows the current Tealbook assumptions for   the NAIRU  We assume that the NAIRU has risen 1 percentage point since the onset   January 25–26, 2011 17 of 282              of the recession, to 6 percent  Adding our assumptions about extended UI benefits,  we put the effective NAIRU as of the fourth quarter of last year at 66 percent,  implying an effective unemployment rate gap of about 3 percentage points     A crucial question is how persistent this or any increase in structural   unemployment is likely to be  As you can see, the Tealbook assumes that the  effective NAIRU falls back to nearly its pre-recession level by the middle of the  decade, as the extended UI programs expire, workers and firms adjust their behavior  in reaction to imbalances in the labor market, and the general recovery of the  economy resolve the structural issues currently in play  We believe this assumption  puts the current episode broadly in line with the experience of previous episodes     There are, of course, risks to this view  For example, as shown in the bottom right   panel, the average length of unemployment spells (the black line) and the fraction of  the labor force experiencing long spells (the red line) have been extraordinarily high   These long spells raise concerns that the affected workers may find themselves less  employable as their skills, reputations, and networks deteriorate, resulting in a  persistently higher level of structural unemployment  Although such effects do not  appear to have been important in the United States in the past, we recognize that the  current unprecedented durations of unemployment may reduce the relevance of  historical experience  Ayşegül will have more to say about this concern     Jason and Ayşegül will now turn to a review of Reserve Bank research on   structural unemployment     Thank you  We asked the research staffs at the 12 Reserve  Banks to provide estimates of concepts at least somewhat analogous to the Board  staff’s estimates of the effective NAIRU  The table at the top of the final exhibit  shows these estimates, as well as the Tealbook assumptions, for three points before  the financial crisis in 2007, the current time, and 2015, as well as the increase  between the first two points  The numbers for the current period include the effects  of extended unemployment benefits for the Board and for those Reserve Banks that  thought them relevant and included them in their estimates  The lower panels show  the estimates graphically, with the larger bubbles representing a larger number of  Reserve Banks  The panel to the left shows the levels; the panel to the right shows  the increase from before the crisis to the current time  The pre-crisis estimates cluster  around 5 percent, although they range as high as 7½ percent  Most viewed structural  unemployment as having increased since then, and many expect the increase to be  mostly reversed by 2015  The estimated increases are centered around 1½ percentage  points, but they range from essentially zero to 2½ percentage points  Moreover, I  think I can say without fear of contradiction that a considerable range of uncertainty  surrounds each of our estimates  We would be happy to take your questions      That depends  Each Bank was asked to provide an estimate of that   quantity that the staff thought would be useful in this context  We would describe that as a   NAIRU; in other cases it was described as an unemployment rate consistent with price   flexibility, or an unemployment rate that is not susceptible to monetary policy  A variety of   definitions were provided    I was trying to represent only the Board staff’s view of the matter,   which sees it in terms of a NAIRU    Obviously, as the previous discussion of terminology made clear, I   think, there may be a variety of views around the System about whether that equation is   reasonable    I think it’s fair to say that the concepts that are inherent in EDO do not   track well the description of structural unemployment that I’ve given here  Of course, that’s only   one input into the staff thinking, even in terms of econometric models  "
