5,1976-03-29,"  One question, Tom  Do you gather any sense or feeling from the  judge as to the degree of push that is likely to be made towards release or attempted force of  release of the Memorandum of Discussion item beyond the segregable facts?     The plaintiff has made no comment publicly on the amount of  material or any material of these proceedings?     [Unintelligible]     Are we left in a position where we could appeal the entire thing on  even segregable facts?     3/29/76 - 6 -      May I inquire, Mr Chairman, about the relevance of the Government  in the Sunshine question to the Memorandum of Discussion?     Just a “splash windshield” opinion, Mr O’Connell  What do you  think that we would have to yield in our Memorandum of Discussion if we had at this time the  Government in the Sunshine law?     If I could, Mr Chairman, I’d like us to return to this question of the  Memorandum of Discussion for just a moment  I think it will be well for members of the  Committee with [unintelligible] think about the problems of deleting the Memorandum of  Discussion entirely, or maintaining it in an abbreviated or edited form It would seem to me that  the problems which have to be addressed in making this decision center on two or three points   First, how much trouble is it going to be to delete segregable facts?  Second, how much staff  time and member debate would have to go into a discussion of an enlarged Record of Policy  Actions? And third, is the Committee overreacting to a potential mischief which might be down  the road, and should it move in anticipation of that mischief or wait until the mischief shows up?     Well, I would challenge that only to the extent that if we’re attempting  to double the size of the Record of Policy Actions to obtain the flavor of each member’s position,  it is going to [unintelligible] discussion     I don’t mean identify     Will you improve your predictabilities against M1?     What about the prediction capabilities on M1 itself?  We’re  attempting to make judgments about M1 and seem to be missing quite often  Now, are you  going to be able to predict with nonborrowed reserves with any greater certainty?     But he keeps coming back to federal funds as opposed to the other  prediction     I was asking if you could forecast in the coming months a  nonborrowed reserve figure any better than you’ve been able to forecast for the M1 figure, if you  had one     I believe the subcommittee report says that the market factors are at  least equal to our input into this nonborrowed figure  If that’s the case, then over a month’s  period, the least we have is wide [unintelligible]     I hear you     Your element of controllability, Steve, that you mentioned before with  regard to prediction of nonborrowed reserves versus money supply, is [higher than]  controllability in federal funds  Right?     I agree, but you also--what, you’ve taken a fast look at is the question  of federal funds as this proxy target as opposed to nonborrowed [reserves], and I guess you just  tentatively, anyway, said that’s not so good     Why do anything, Mr Chairman?  Why not just commit ourselves to  looking at this question four months from now, or three months from now, and say, “All right, at  that time we will substitute it”     I agree they are not useful  My question is, does another three months  of publication hurt you at a time when you could make the substitution three months from now?     Mr Chairman, nonborrowed reserves has a lot of attractions for me if  we use it as a substitute for attention to M1 in a short time frame  But if we’re merely adding the  nonborrowed reserves as another element for inconsistency purposes, I have a lot of trouble with  that     Well, we just add another item that the Desk is going to have fight  between M1 and M2, the federal funds rate, and now nonborrowed reserves     I understand that, but I’m a little resistant to the idea of giving them  more elements of inconsistency to work with in a short-range period  Over a longer range, if we  use nonborrowed reserves in a monthly context and look at the Ms in a quarterly context, I can  see this as being a valuable addition     Is this workable?     May I make a comment first     A question, I guess  Why do you want to bury it today rather than  wait till we have a substitute?  What does the difference of another few months carrying on a  nonexistent or a noneffective [unintelligible] after you’ve done it for a year?     3/29/76 - 37 -      Well then what you have to say is--  "
27,1976-04-20,"  In the past, Mr Chairman, in situations like this--we’ve had them  recurring, I guess, about every four to six years--the orders that Ernie refers to of 50s and 100s, I  think you will find them coming back to him very promptly  And they come back in the form of  people moving their money out of Mexico  Usually with the use of the 100 dollar bill down  there       So move   SPEAKER(?)  Second     May I ask a question, Mr Chairman?  We’ve talked about these two  debts for a long time  Are we still making some efforts to get Treasury to bail us out of this?     We aren’t even attempting to ask the Treasury to take us out of this?     Second     Are we still using about 50 percent man-hour data?     Did you say that the automobile makers can survive a 90- to 120-day  rubber strike with no [unintelligible]?     Well, I recognized that there was some flexibility in that, but I didn’t  think the flexibility was very large in the [potential] size of pickup by the [unintelligible]      Peter, has the market reacted, or does it know of a change in our  acceptance [unintelligible]?     Second question  Do you see any signs of a longer range--I don’t  mean in the immediate weeks ahead, but longer than that--decline in corporate bond offerings?     Mr Chairman, I am in agreement with the thrust of your reduction  I  find a couple of points which I’d like to raise as to the position of leaving one end or other  unchanged  Recognizing that there is some sensitivity to the question of the margin [the range  for the growth of the aggregates], I think that, over the past year, we’ve had more and more  questions raised here at the table [as to] the variability of this aggregate data in the short run     I’m a little bothered about narrowing [the margin] down  You’ve pulled M1 from [a range  of 4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent to a range of] 4-1/2 to 7, reducing the upper end by 1/2 [percentage  point] and narrowing the spread to a 2-1/2 [percentage point] margin, while leaving M3 at a  3 [percentage point] margin     I find myself wondering if we couldn’t just do a 1/2 [percentage point] cut on both ends of  the spectrum, to go to 4 to 7 on M1 and 7 to 10 on M2, leaving M3 unchanged  It seems to me  that the margin question here perhaps goes against the experience we’ve had  Also, it seems to  me that, with the changes in the savings deposits, we’ve had severe questions about the ability to  control M1  I’m not sure whether that’s worked itself out, or will over the coming months, but to  narrow this margin at a time when you’re raising even further questions about the meaning of the  aggregate data seems to me somewhat questionable     4/20/76 - 22 -             Just one question Mr Chairman, if this is a formal action of the  Committee to set longer-range targets, then I would think that the vote is desirable  I don’t  understand why you don’t have a vote on a target     The only part that Bob’s talking about that makes it compatible is that  I think we’ve served the Committee well by having you announce these at your hearings within  the Congress, and if a formal vote has a chance of [being] pre-released, I would not--      I think it would be, too     Could I raise one question with counsel?  Is the long-range target a  segregable fact?     Is the long-range target a segregable fact?     Did I hear you right, Steve?  They hold their auctions the first week of  May for a May 28 refunding?     Mid-May     Mr Chairman, I think the recovery is moving along well, and I’m  really not awfully unhappy about what I’ve been hearing  I think I would buy in on Bruce’s  comment that if we’re going up, I’d like to have the market and the aggregates lead us there  rather than have us lead them to a higher level at the present time     I don’t have much confidence in these Ms and the figures that we’re projecting here  We  might have as high as a 10 or a 12 percent blip show up suddenly, and I would hate very much to  have us have to react sharply to bring the federal funds rate upward to 5 percent  I think it’s  going to be moving there someday, but we’ve been told repeatedly around this table for months  on end that the short-term rates are going to move up  I think I agree that someday we’re going  to get there, but I don’t see any reason to force it if things are moving along well     So, I guess in part on the basis of the fact that we’ve just dropped to a 4-1/2 percent lower  limit on the long range, it would seem to me that we shouldn’t be accepting much less than that  in the short range  So I’d put my lower figure at 4-1/2, and the upper figure of 8-1/2 is fine with  me  I would not widen that federal funds range to as high as 4-1/2 to 5-1/2  It’s the one thing  we’re able to do in the intermeeting periods here--be very close to whatever the target and the  middle point are  I noticed the averages for the weeks where I don’t think they varied more than  12 basis points or some such over the past four weeks     So if we’re going to look at letting the market lead us out of this, and they think they’re  getting strong credit demands, why, I’m willing to let the things tighten up a little bit in a modest  and very orderly and slow fashion  But I’m not prepared to jump  So we’re talking of a 4-3/4  center point on federal funds now, 4-7/8 to 5 would be fine with me  I certainly would not carry  that up without reconsidering it up to the 5-1/4 range  So 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 centered on 4-3/4, I  guess it is, or on 4-7/8, that’s all right with me       4/20/76 - 44 -           Your zone of indifference--take that 2 point slice out of the middle, from 4-1/2 to 8-1/2--I  guess means 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 as a zone  I might even take that zone a little farther  You say 4 is  equal to 8, then 4-1/2 must equal 8-1/2, so in this case I’d almost treat the whole doggone zone  as a zone of indifference and stay at 4-7/8  That’s all, Mr Chairman     But I don’t think it’s fine tuning, Mr Chairman, when you change the  midpoint of the range of the federal funds rate, because that means a very prompt move--      Even though it’s only an eighth, it’s still a move     Just, well, our zone of indifference in the middle?     One question, Tom  Having gone through this process, what’s your  judgment about long-run efficacy of an appeal?     That’s what I’m talking about     This is just the first court we’re talking about?     In terms of the Memorandum of Discussion, the way it’s drafted now,  you do have an appeals court you can go to?     And any further beyond that I assume?     May I ask a question, Mr Chairman?  Is it possible, Art, to prepare a  Memorandum of Discussion without segregable facts?     It seems to me, Mr Chairman, that the real question is whether this  proposal of yours that we eliminate the Memorandum is perhaps at the moment premature with  regard to the court’s position, since we have not obviously taken appeal or gone further in our  appeals on the matter  I suspect that the Memorandum could be written slightly differently     I guess I have a certain amount of feeling for the Memorandum, and I also have a certain  amount of resistance to the idea of being forced into cutting out something that we have done  which has been helpful, no matter how marginally it has been helpful, as a track record of the  Committee  And I give that up with great reluctance, and consequently, I see a question of  whether this is something we have to do today or whether the Government in the Sunshine bill  and court appeals might provide a different set of circumstances to work on two or three months  from now     It could be made rather strongly, though, if we follow the staff’s  recommendations, that the other elements of this be placed in memorandum form, which I  assume are going to be held under one of the exemptions under FOIA  In which case, you don’t  even release that at all, period     What about the decision on engaging in finance bills by our  [Domestic Trading] Desk?  Where [unintelligible] is almost in the same [unintelligible] as our  decision that they do this     I was thinking of the finance bills     Which is a decision of the Committee     I’m merely pointing out that things of that nature will get buried into a  memorandum          I’m not going to agree on that  Well, this is going to be action of the  Committee for a vote     I have the opposite idea  That it would be worse to bring it out after  the next meeting     We’re having a sidebar--   "
56,1976-05-18,"  May I raise a question, Mr Chairman?  I’m not going to reiterate all  my reasons for objecting to this [unintelligible] last time, so I’m not going to reiterate  I would--    SPEAKER(?)  Phil, we can’t hear you down here     I would like to know whether the informal understanding memo was  planned to be released at any time?     Unless you can [unintelligible] upward the level of the policy record     How about the zone of indifference, is that another point which you  put as an informal understanding?      I may have missed it, but is it in this one?     I would certainly hope we would, Mr Chairman, because I think that  what we are doing is actually reducing the amount of information to venture into the public’s  domain  If we do this informal--     Well, they’ve been in the Memorandum of Discussion     But by your lights, no decision may actually be a decision, would be  an action     My point is, [when] you decide to take no action, that, in effect, is a  decision  Suppose we had a situation in which we were discussing New York, and they had  applied to us for a loan, and we took no action, we neither approve nor disapprove  Will that  be--     Why are we reducing from 45 to 30?      I have a question, Mr Chairman  I wonder if any progress has been  made with the Treasury on our Swiss debt       As the Desk was proceeding through this gradual tightening, were you  giving weight, in [your] evaluation of the [monetary] aggregates’ change, to the impact that  might have developed from the Treasury balance, currency, and shifts in corporate savings?     As you look back over the period, with the large rise in April, what  proportion of that would you assess would be a fundamental shift in demand for balances?      I’ll withdraw the question and wait for your discussion      I have just one other question, Mr Chairman  If you had looked  across this valley from, I guess, late December through mid-May and had, first, washed out one  change in the Treasury balance, then the other change, do we then come out with something  that’s reasonably balanced to the growth targets of the Committee?     Suppose you just washed out the government deposits as part of the  package     About $200 million to $300 million     But you annualize it and it gets to be quite a bit of money going out  over a short period of time  I think Steve’s got a good point, that they had to pay for it some  way  If they pay for it by writing some checks for some $2 bills, that’s one thing, but if they paid  for it by drawing down their savings account, that’s another  But, I suspect from just the people  I’ve heard talk about it, [they] got one and put it away  How did they get it?  Well, they traded a  $5 for two $2s and a $1     In fact, Frank, don’t you have a number of different nonbanking  groups who are buying and selling federal funds?   MR PARTEE Selling     I was thinking of some international banking groups, agencies, etc,  that are also in this market     Mr Chairman, I think our economic recovery is proceeding generally  satisfactorily except for the continuing high unemployment and the threatened price advance   And our policy move this past intermeeting period to counter a rising aggregate trend seemed  appropriate to me     I am concerned about overreacting to what I saw as some extraneous [factors  temporarily  increasing] the growth rates of the aggregates, and if the aggregates are now going to subside to  their fundamentals, and we don’t get some more of these extraneous things on the downside,  why then I’m perfectly willing to continue resisting the higher rates of growth  On the other  side, though, we have moved the rate 50 basis points in an intermeeting period, and I’m hesitant  to continue that pace of movement, which I presume was in some of your comment also     I would prefer that we be a little more constrictive in this sense and aim at a federal funds  rate lower limit in the range of 4-3/4 to 5, and I don’t care whether you put it at 4-3/4 or 5  I’d  rather not go down into the 4 range, having reached the 5 level, but I’m somewhat nervous about  going up to the 5-3/4 range  I really would not like to see another 50 point rise in the     5/18/76 - 43 -         intermeeting period  This could build expectations to a point where the market could take it  away from us and move much further than perhaps we intend     So I really prefer that we put a ceiling on [the federal funds rate] at 5-1/2 with the  expectation that these aggregate numbers come out somewhere in this general ballpark we are  talking about  I don’t hear much around the table except that your 7-1/2 deviates from  somebody’s, someone else wants 10, that’s a fairly wide number--you move more rapidly if you  get a much lower figure, but somewhere in this 6 to 10 range doesn’t bother me  I don’t pay that  much attention to that wider range, and if we continue to have a fairly broad zone of  indifference, then it doesn’t matter that much     It can cumulate if the extraneous factors were as insignificant as Steve  seems to be portraying them--then perhaps the fundamental is a 7 to 8 figure  If they’re a little  more important, as I thought they were, then perhaps we get away from some of that  We might  even get some downward pressure on this  And if that were to develop, and we drop below a 6  or 7 percent range, then we would be forced into a question of whether we move the funds rate  down again  I would really rather keep this moving in a very slow fashion  If we see the  fundamentals continuing on in a 7 to 8 percent [range], then I’d like to move up another one- fourth, but I would hate to move up to a full 1/2 percentage range again in this intermeeting  period   "
81,1976-06-22,"  Tom, is there any possibility that the Justice Department runs into a  conflict of interest in defending the Federal Open Market Committee against a congressman?     I presume this drawing you are talking about will be pro rata among  all the members of the group?   SPEAKER(?)  As the request went out in the cable we received on Friday, it would be pro  rata against all central banks and governmental agencies  That includes all participants except  the BIS  There currently are negotiations under way as to whether or not that pro rata situation  should [include] or can exclude the BIS  The Treasury was under the assumption that the BIS  would be included in a manner similar to other participants; however, the BIS was under a  different impression, apparently, and the Bank of England will be going to the BIS to finance  outstanding short-dated swaps, which would be outstanding over the month-end     So the total participation of the BIS, if [unintelligible] to conclude the financing of short- term swaps, would be far greater than the $15 million that would [unintelligible] to a 10 percent  draw  There are a variety of issues outstanding, and it is for those reasons that we have not been  able to confirm the drawing or actually [unintelligible] on the takedown of this particular  drawing       This is a first renewal?     Mr Chairman, let me go back to the question of retail sales  Lyle, if  you take as an assumption that we have had a run-up in retail sales that was at least partly  attributable to price increases, do we have anything in our data which would indicate that price  increases [are easing], particularly for GAF [general merchandise, apparel, and furniture] stores,  which I gather are showing further weakness in the last month or two  Any evidence indicating a  slowdown in the price changes with that type of commodity?       6/22/76 - 21 -             In other words, there’s an element here, too, Lyle, in the question of  the kinds of commodities or goods which the public is buying  If there has been a shift in that  toward upgrading or something like that, which might be reflective of a kind of commodity that  is not growing at a price rate [unintelligible], you might be having an effect here on your total  retail sales     I would suggest, Mr Chairman, it might be helpful, though, for either  the next meeting or the one following, to have a recap of the past four months that we have been  tracking this and where the Desk thinks it might have to come out with these     Mr Axilrod, what is there in the situation now that [supports] the  staff’s estimate of strengthening business demand?  We haven’t seen this for some time  The  latest figures that I see coming out of the economy [suggest], perhaps, even some slowing in rate  of progress  If we get some continued slowing in retail sales, you have a dampening influence  on inventory accumulation  What is it that brings you to the idea of a stronger business demand  over [unintelligible]?     If you keep your level of internal cash generation without any increase  but keep the current level of long-term issues, isn’t that going to supply most of what you’re  going to need to meet this inventory and capital expenditure requirement?     Mr Chairman, I’m delighted to join you in your prescription  I would  also prefer a narrower fed funds rate, mainly because, with those wide margins [unintelligible]   I’d prefer that the money market conditions stay stable and that we take time to pause while we  decide whether this economic lull is going to continue  I don’t see any real evidence yet of a  business loan expansion  I value Steve’s judgment when he tells me that he’s at least partially  convinced that it will occur sometime, and I would agree with that judgment  Someday I think  we will see it, but I don’t see it yet, and I don’t really think it’s necessary that the policy must  take an advance look at it that far down the line  "
106,1976-07-19,"  Because we don’t know yet the outcome of the suit     Well, Mr Chairman, as the only one who voted against this decision, I  must say that I would prefer that we continue on with the Memorandum of Discussion  But the  Committee clearly voted it down, and I am not interested in fighting [unintelligible]  So I’m not  going to suggest we consider it     I can’t resist, Mr Chairman, commenting that if that new document is  enlarged far enough, we’ll have a Memorandum of Discussion without [unintelligible]  And  promptly released     Mr Partee asked my questions     Are you suggesting, Henry, that we have a zone of indifference in the  federal funds rate as we do in monetary aggregates?     Mr Chairman, I came prepared for a further notch at the bottom of  this, bringing [M1] down to 4 to 7 and [M2 down to] 7 to 10  I have listened to the discussion,  and I have looked over the alternatives that the staff has prepared  If I could really believe  alternatives A, B, and C, I have to say that the trade-off with the rate of inflation is not materially  different, and the trade-off in the unemployment rate seems to be somewhat better  I don’t feel  the high 6 rate on unemployment is an acceptable rate for the long-range package we’re  [considering] through 1977     However, I don’t think the forecast takes into account the possibilities of new  congressional stimulus, so I suspect we’re going to get some there anyway  And consequently,  I’m not quite so disturbed about that  I can accept the rates that you suggested with lowering the  upper end  Actually I would prefer to lower the bottom end of the targets and leave the upper  end where it was and provide a little greater flexibility     But I do think Henry has put his finger on something [on which] we need to do careful  analysis, and that is the stickiness of the federal funds rate  And I’m not being facetious when I  suggest we might consider a zone of indifference in the federal funds rate as we do on the     7/19-20/76 - 56 -   monetary aggregates  Perhaps reduce our sensitivity to some of the overshoots and undershoots  on monetary aggregates and the sensitivity of the market to a particular rate     We have enough upset with the changes in the market in reaction to  what we’ve been doing over the past 90 days     I don’t have any problem with that Mr Chairman  I do think that it  seems strange that we don’t have a formal vote on long-range targets  We’re having it  announced as being future policy     Mr Chairman, I’d be perfectly willing to stay with alternative B the  way it’s written     With a 5 to 5-3/4 range your midpoint range is 5-3/8, and presumably  the Desk would move to that     Then you change the ground rules upon which the Desk operates     We’ve done it in the past, but I thought I just heard you [say] you  didn’t want to change     7/19-20/76 - 70 -     Between the first and second quarter Mr Chairman?  I thought we had  some evidence of rather sizable change in the inventory accumulation rate  "
133,1976-08-17,"  Alan, are we making any move at all on Swiss franc repayment?     Or any Treasury bailout?     First or second rollover?     Second rollover?     Well, I’m basically opposed to the idea, Mr Chairman, but we could  be in the same boat ourselves with Swiss francs  I know no other way but to speak out of both  sides of my mouth     Are we still supplying currency?     Mr Chairman, I don’t find great difficulty with what you or Governor  Gardner has said  Perhaps a nuance  I’m not ready to write off this recovery  I think we are  involved in the pause, at least with some dimension, probably for another month and perhaps  longer  [If] we recognize this pause in the policy prescription, I would think it would be a matter  of minimal response     At least, however, [it] ought to call for some caution on our part  Perhaps a shading of our  judgments in Desk operations might be sufficient  It doesn’t mean an overt move, but I suspect  not perfectly steady in the boat either  I’m a little bothered by the continued Desk mechanization  with policy and response  I’d prefer to shade just a little bit as the Desk sees opportunities,  capitalizing on those opportunities as the market believes it ought to move     I would like to raise, though, with the Committee the possibility of again taking the  opportunity of the fall and the seasonal demand period to look at--what is essentially a [Federal  Reserve] Board action, of course--a change in reserve requirements  I know that it is difficult to  do this in a period of recovery, but we have a seasonal demand which, in the past, we have met  with this device  I continue to believe that our reserve requirements are larger than necessary for  policy action, and it would be helpful to our [Federal Reserve System] membership problem if  we could get them further reduced  "
156,1976-09-21,"  So moved     Mr Chairman, I assume this special agreement means that the  Treasury is not going to develop that commitment or semicommitment that we thought we had     But my question is not that so much as it is in [regard to] the future   Are we now without any backup from the Treasury on future swap drawings?     In which case the net result of all this questioning is that we ought to  plan our swap arrangements with the idea of no takeout     Jerry, does your forecast of only 1/10 percent of CPI just look at the  direct impact of the price changes in gasoline or is that filtering back to the prices elsewhere in  the economy?     I have a hard time believing--      I hope you’re right     Mr Chairman, I didn’t put my rose-colored glasses on, but I don’t  have a whole lot of problem with some of your comment about the future  I guess my principal  problem is timing more than perspective on the direction of the economy  I’ve been doing a little  bit of traveling around in the past couple of weeks, and I don’t find a tone of expectation [in]  which businessmen and others are looking for the kind of movement that you’re talking about  I  recognize the lag which most businessmen have  [Unintelligible] statistical items that you  mentioned with the exception of unemployment  It certainly seems to portray a stronger  economy in the future  And I guess the question is, How long do we have to wait for this happy  future to come about?     Mr Chairman, I don’t have a whole lot of problems in the   [unintelligible] question  I guess my principal question is one of flexibility  I like to cover my  bets, frankly, and that to me means we permit more flexibility in our approach to this matter  rather than the kind of rigidity in funds rate approach that we have had  I don’t have problems  with the range you suggested on the monetary aggregates, I think [unintelligible] range of 4-1/2  to 5-1/2--     Well, it was a 1/2 point [unintelligible] I didn’t read you that closely   What I’m really aiming toward is letting the market have a little more freedom to move [within]  the interest rate picture  If the market believed, in its wisdom, that a slightly lower funds rate  could be accommodated, then I’m perfectly willing to accommodate it, provided our aggregates  are moving within the bands set  If the bands were 4 to 8 for M1; 8 to 12,I don’t care,  somewhere in that neighborhood, for M2--I’ve given you a suggested alternative which tries to  portray this flexibility that I’m trying to allow here     And I think the flexibility could go either way if [the aggregates] show any kind of marked  movement  But I think it would require that we look with a little more grace upon the idea of the  market leading us somewhere, permitting the market to lead up or down within the range of the  federal funds rate we establish  It means utilizing the full range for the aggregates before the  Desk seeks to guide this federal funds rate, providing the rate’s moving at orderly pace  I would  not like to see anything over a 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 [upper bound] for the funds rate before the end of  the next period unless we got some pretty violent moves in the aggregates  On the other hand, I  wouldn’t much want to see it below 4-1/4 to 4-1/2, certainly if the thing is going violently in the  other direction  I really would rather keep about where we are, with perhaps a little shading  toward the soft side if the market thinks that desirable     I guess my underlying rationale for all of this is that I’m just not all that certain, and I’m a  little bit perturbed about the idea that fiscal policy may come along [with] more stimulant  injections at a time when I think we’re fading out [of the] time in the cycle when such things are  appropriate  So I guess I’m pleading for a little flexibility here but basically staying [in] the  same general frame we’re in     May I have just a bit of clarification, Mr Chairman, on this  asymmetric principle?  If I understand, what the Desk would do is stay at 5-1/4 unless things  start moving toward the upper or lower parts of their bands  And all this asymmetrical principle  does is hold the wider range on the bottom side within which the Desk may operate  "
177,1976-10-19,"  Mr Chairman, I find myself in a kind of an in-between position  [relative to] those who have already spoken  I sense a feeling of unhappiness in Lyle’s report,  but not nearly so deep as Governor Lilly’s position  I don’t think, from my viewpoint, the  economy is going to roar [during] the rest of ’76  I’m just optimistic that what will happen in ’77  will be an improvement for us  I don’t think that we face a recession in the real growth rate, and  yet I’m not terribly happy with the prospects that the staff gives us and certainly not that which  Governor Lilly portrays  The unemployment rate is much higher than I care to have it, and yet  the inflation rate continues also     It seems to me that if you look down the road, we’ve got a pause  The pause is disturbing   It’s been disturbing in the past, and perhaps we may be saddled with this for the rest of 1976   But I’m basically optimistic about what happens in ’77, and I didn’t want to be associated with  quite as strong a position as the staff portrayed last time or this time, but neither do I want to take  on the recession scenario that Governor Lilly seems to be showing     Not short of a recession  Well, in my view, that’s almost a recession,  from the pointing out of a problem     I thank you for it, but I don’t believe I want that either  No, I think the  economy is not doing as well as I’d hoped it would, but that’s been my story for several months   I’ve been hoping that we would find a little more room to expand  But we’ll talk about policy  later on     Mr Chairman, your formulation of the figures is precisely what I had  written down before I came in this room this afternoon, so I am merely supporting what you  said--5 to 9, 9 to 13, and 4-1/2 to 5-1/4  And on the Ms, I really don’t care anymore  These  things are violent--fluctuating so violently it’s almost impossible to play with them  I’d rather  focus on the interest rate itself, and I’d like to keep that between 4-3/4 and 5       I came out differently on that, Mr Chairman  I came out with a  money market proposal using the words “seeks to ease bank reserve and money market  conditions”  I keep hearing around this table people wanting to lower the funds rate       Mr Chairman, I’m not with you on the long term, like I was in the  short-term  I’m afraid the long-term targets you suggested are a bit low for me  I’m not ready to  take another notch off of this, partly because I have some of Dave’s feelings that we have not  met what we set out to do  I have sought somewhat more stimulative policy a little bit around  this table for months, but I think you really have not lived up to the level we set in front of  ourselves as they’ve actually come in  That’s partly the problem with forecasting and other  things characteristic of these Ms     I think that [unintelligible] for the long range I would be willing to keep the bottom figure  of 4-1/2 [for M1], but I would raise the top figure from 7 to 7-1/2 or even 8, partly because I  think we’re reaching a point where we just cannot do a forecasting job on these figures, and  we’re coming in so differently month-to-month and even quarter-to-quarter, and yet we always  seem to be at the bottom end of this package  The M2 range of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2, I’d actually prefer  a 10 to 12; and on the M3, instead of the 9 to 11 we now have, well, it actually would be  acceptable to me, but I really prefer a 9 to 12       Except that everybody looks at Ml instead of the other two    "
200,1976-11-08,"  Good morning, Mr Chairman     Thank you  I’ve been doing some thinking about this because of  some of the [unintelligible] you raised  I could accept a reduction in the M1 upper level from 7  to 6-1/2 percent, but I accept it more because of the impact that I read from the staff’s  memorandum on regulatory changes and the things that [those changes have] done to our M1  figures     Contrary to that, however, if we’re going to reduce that level, I would prefer to have a third  alternative of raising M2 and M3 levels from where they are now to an 8 to 10 percent for M2,  and 10 to 12 percent on M3, giving cognizance to the fact that we are still expecting to have  more shifts out of the M1 level into the M2 and M3  I admit that it complicates our discussion,  Mr Chairman, but I do think that if you look out over this year or for the past two years, you’ve  seen our past records being a very low level of M1 but [at] the upper level of the M2 and M3  ranges, particularly M3  And I guess if you ask for my preference, my preference is for the  lowering of that M1 so that we don’t get caught with a partly presumptuous feeling of change for  other reasons rather than the basic economy and yet leaving us some leeway on the upper end   That’s all I have  "
216,1976-11-16,"  Henry, who are the banks besides Bank of America, Citicorp--I don’t  mean by name, not many, not at all     11/16/76 - 6 -             You don’t know how many other banks are involved?     I understood there’s a number of regional banks waiting in the wings  to participate     Was there a consideration that our participation as an official body  might have encouraged other people to lend?     Are there elements in our present swap network which you believe are  either unnecessary or undesirable?     We have no further requests for drawings of swap arrangements?     I don’t think this is a matter which I’d want to go into that kind of  fight on, Mr Chairman, but there may be some down the road which I hope we would not accede  to his request just as a chairman or a congressman     His staff--     What about audit committee minutes?     Mr Chairman, I’m not [unintelligible] pessimistic about our  economy, and I agree with you that declaring a recession now is way too premature  I am very  concerned, however, about the state of confidence, and I’m afraid we may get a couple of  additional shocks  One which I keep saying--and I haven’t found anybody that agrees with me  yet, but I will continue to say--is that I am wandering around this country and believe that we are  getting Christmas sales very early this year  We may get a severe shock in terms of the rate of  sales when Christmas gets here     Perhaps so, but I keep wandering around, going into stores to see if I  can buy Christmas presents for myself, and I find Christmas sales going on at a pretty good clip,  and yet I don’t see a major movement in the sales  And if we are really borrowing from the  Christmas sales level, we may find ourselves greatly disappointed     Well, for whatever reason, I still think we have a problem with that  I  think the uncertainty that I feel in talking to people around the country not only relates to this but  also to no real incentive to expand purchasing  On the capital spending side, in talking to  businessmen, I find they are still quite hesitant about it and [have] no real push behind it and they  are still looking at an interest rate level which they consider to be quite high for commitments in  the long run     On the employment side of it, I also feel [that] is an area of potential shock  Just a very  random piece of information--even some of the banking openings are not very plentiful right  now  I’m talking about the lower level, not [about] the people sitting around this table  I find  some people out in the streets, which surprises me a little bit in the banking field  And I wonder  if, not only this, but the potential of our foreign banking problems, might constitute some  difficulty for us in the next few months  All in all, this is a kind of psychological problem I think  we face and one which needs some [unintelligible]     Mr Chairman, I’ve been accused of being a harbinger of gloom today  already, a couple of times, but I really think that our economic prospects have dimmed over the  last couple of months  And whether we accept the staff projection or not, the unemployment  levels predicted in those projections are unacceptable, gentlemen  I think the only question that I  face here is a question of stimulus  Do we stimulate this economy in fiscal or monetary [ways]  or both?  I have a great reservation about leaving all stimulus to the fiscal side of life  If we’re  going to hold monetary policy and leave it to Congress to stimulate this economy, I think we’ll     11/16/76 - 40 -           come out much worse than if we attempt to do some ourselves  I think the policy can provide a  little bit of help in easing rates     As a consequence, that’s where I come out  I would prefer to see the federal funds rate of  4-1/4 to 5, and I would stop at 5, because I think we are at 5, and I would prefer that we not go  down to the midpoint of that range--that it be asymmetrical, as we’ve done before--go down to  4-3/4 and then look and see  But I would not prefer to have an upper [limit] over the 5 unless we  reconsidered the matter  On the monetary growth rates, there’s been a suggestion of 3 to 7 [for  M1]; I would hope that we would not go down as low as 3  I would prefer to put a bottom of 4  on it, but I suspect I’m going to be in the minority here  But nevertheless, I would prefer a 4 to 8  range  As far as the other matters of policy on discount and reserve requirements, I will not  comment at the moment  "
242,1976-12-20,"  But we have not recorded the specs  Now will this require a vote  recorded on the specs?     We would not get you into the problems of publishing or releasing  them?     If we were to fight this court matter, Tom, would we be giving up  anything by taking this action?  Would we compromise your ability to resist this court order?     Yes, but you’re talking about this particular appeal, and I was thinking  of something broader than that  If you got a different challenge to the record of the Committee,  would [we] compromise your ability to resist that, by [our] having put the specifications into this  record     I have a question, Mr Chairman, on something that I should think  does remain in the doctored document  Are we changing the System policy to invite swap  drawings for 12 months instead of 3 months?  If not, then this “fully liquidated” comment on top  of page 2 is, “any such agreement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after origination”--     But in our present--is this consistent with that policy?     Well, I understand that we have exceeded the borrowing side, but I  meant with regard to the policy of the Committee     The policy of the Committee does say 12 months     On a renewal basis     My second question relates to the terminology at the bottom of page  3, in which you say the currency to be used for liquidation may be purchased or drawn on at the  same exchange rate as that employed, whereas in the bottom sentence you’re talking about at  prevailing market rates  Is that a change or is that--     [Unintelligible] purchases as the rate of the drawing  Now what  [does] that mean to them?     Spot purchases--     The other matter relating to procedure--I take it we’re not discussing  that now     Even bearing it in mind, Mr Chairman, I still have that one word  which I would question slightly, which I questioned the other day with regard to an item  At the  bottom of page 1, it says “in collaboration with the United States Treasury,” semicolon  The  [phrase] “collaboration with,” rather than “consultation with”     Well, if you can find the halfway house, you might be willing to buy  it, Henry, but “collaboration” to me means a participation in this, almost guaranteeing that we do  go into participation with the United States Treasury on each of our operations  I’m not sure I  want to do this     Probably not     I’m not sure I want to be locked into the US Treasury coming in on  every one of those swap arrangements     This includes any action with regard to foreign currency operations,  even if it were merely for stockpile purposes  Now I’m a little reluctant to go that far, Mr  Chairman     I would agree with you, it’s worked very harmoniously to date  I’m  looking [at] a change in the Treasury’s lead group, and I’m not at all sure it’s all that  harmonious     12/20-21/76 - 12 -           I haven’t--let me make my position clear  I am not saying we do not  talk to the Treasury  I’m merely arguing the word “collaboration” versus “consultation”     We could wait a month--     12/20-21/76 - 13 -           What is the status of article 4?     If you would forgive me, Henry, the way you described that paragraph  2 isn’t the way I read paragraph 2  The way I read paragraph 2 was that it does clear with the  Committee but it has a parenthetical “(or with the subcommittee),” which would give the  subcommittee, and ultimately the Chairman, if he believes the time is not available, also the A  and B authority     There is no Manager’s discretion     I have a more substantive problem with 2 than I do with 1--I think 1 is  perfectly clear; I really had no problem with it  It requires a subcommittee or the Chairman’s  action, which I think is appropriate  When you get to number 2, however, if I read this correctly,  ultimately the Chairman could commit the entire Committee to the full swap arrangement if he  chose to do so     I know it hasn’t, Mr Chairman  I’m wondering, though, if that’s a  desirable position for this Committee to be in     Few minutes to involve a $3 billion swap arrangement agreement?     It might not be desirable to do it     It’s not to me, Mr Chairman, but since I seem to be the only one  bothered by this line--     I would, on the parenthetical phrase of page 2     That’s right     Just a couple of questions, Lyle  Have you made a forecast of the  labor force growth in ’77      19  Is ’76 coming out 26?     My second question--a decline showing the--     It was exactly my point, looking at the projected decline in the  unemployment rate, I was wondering, if you have a 19 million increase, it means you’re  projecting an employment increase even higher than the labor force increase     12/20-21/76 - 50 -           How much of that do you expect to be government jobs?     19 million is still high historically     We’ve made progress slowly     Mr Chairman, I don’t play these numbers games too often, but I’m  curious [about] citing comparisons against decades or five years  You also compared the rate of  growth of M1 and the other aggregates against periods in recovery?     I know you hadn’t  You didn’t here  I was curious whether you had  measured against other recovery periods  How does this M1 or M2 growth stack up against  periods of recovery prior     What about M1 in that period?     It’s not the same     12/20-21/76 - 58 -           Mr Chairman, I guess I’m kind of in a halfway house here  I’d like to  have my cake and eat it too, [which] means I’d like to have kind of a blend of some of these  targets in front of us here  I’d like to broaden that rate range a little bit and yet keep squaring on  the aggregates  I think a small additional decline in the rate would not be damaging and would  validate that very small reserve requirement change we made     I’m still concerned over the unemployment forecast and the prospects for heavy fiscal  stimulus  I think a minor monetary stimulus could reinforce this incipient reemergence of a  faster recovery  I believe there is a small move that we could make for a further rate decline that  could be helpful to this recovery, so I would prefer an M1 target of 3 to7 percent; M2, 9 to 13;  and the federal funds rate of 4 to 5 percent, which would put the midpoint at 4-1/2  I would not  want to see it below the 4, so I have deliberately exercised the alternative A lower limit   Similarly, I would not at present want to see it go above 5  So that’s a minor modification of  your suggestion, Mr Chairman  "
269,1977-01-17,"  I move ratification, Mr Chairman     Enlarges the assets by 50%     This would require, however, the Committee’s authorization for  purchase of this specific currency?  In other words, it has to be a swap currency?     It would not be possible for the Portuguese whatever, then?     Well, my only question is something which we’ve talked before, and  that’s the enlargement of the ESF divorced from the Basel agreement  But given the restudy of  this, or specific re-analysis in March, then I’ll subside     No, I meant March of next year     I wonder where it goes--     The final determination if it’s within our limits?     You have another question, which I probably can answer myself, but  maybe I’d better get some guidance  If you have a consent calendar item, that is just as much a  decision as a regular calendar item?     So you don’t have a Board meeting?     Also dangerous     Yes     Yes  Governor Gardner, Mr Allison, and I spent a couple of hours on  this subject just prior to this meeting     I think we have     Well, we’re headed in that direction  I’ll let the Vice Chairman [of  the Federal Reserve Board] speak on that subject     1/17-18/77 - 21 -             Is this to be in any way tied to the Treasury action on our part?     Mr Chairman, I’ve been listening  I think I agree with much of what  I hear  To me, the tone of things has improved considerably; perhaps we’ve lost some of the  threat of inventory change  I have a feeling that this year ahead isn’t going to be quite as smooth  as this staff forecast shows  I guess you could say that about any year, but I have a feeling that  this one’s going to be a highly erratic year  We may get some heavy fiscal stimulus that runs up  one quarter or a couple of months and then runs back down the stream  I can see possibilities of  the same sort of arguments and data that we faced in early ’75 on the money supply and  aggregates data and maybe on some interest rates, too  I can see some very sharp run-ups in  consumer spending right after a rebate, if that’s the way the Congress goes  I can see as a  possibility that there may be another--if there is such a thing--midcourse pause somewhere down  the line, too  So I guess I’m a little more cautious about taking all this and converting it into a  very bullish year ahead--but on the other hand, not much in the way of a bearish year, either  I  think it’s going to be a highly erratic one     Mr Chairman, I’ve been debating this matter in my mind for several  days, weeks, months as to where to opt for standstill or some modest lowering of targets, and I  agree with you that, if we are going to lower targets, M2, M3 [offer] the better logic than M1      1/17-18/77 - 50 -           The arguments that I devised in my mind went something like this for a standstill  We do have  adequate range [from] where we stand today to probably come within that  We certainly  exceeded the M2, M3 this past year; I believe we came within the targets for M1     I don’t believe it is absolutely necessary for us to move every time, and perhaps when we  see something very strong in the way of a move, it might be worthwhile to knock a full  percentage point off instead of a half percentage point, and maybe cut your years to 5 instead of  10  But the lower growth rates, I think, can be reached within our current stance  Certainly if  we’re looking at a 5 percent inflation, we’re going to have to accommodate some of that in our  aggregates     But I look at the primary function of these annual rates, [and] as I see them, [there are]  basically two  First, the public perception of what we’re doing and the congressional oversight  position  And second, some very broad Committee guidance--I would emphasize very  broad--because I don’t hear many Committee members, perhaps excluding President Balles, who  keep reminding us that our short-run [targets] ought to be somewhat consistent with our long-run  targets  And consequently, while we get some very broad guidance out of [the annual rates], our  performance really hasn’t been tied very well to the long-range targets     I think the possibilities over the coming year are interesting--almost a possibility of a  reversal of 1976--in that we might get greater M1 growth and lower M2, M3 growth, especially  if we really believe that this economy is going to move up strongly and interest rates advance  with it  To lower the targets comes down to a point, really, of the degree of harassment you want  to take at your hearing, because I think you will get harassed by a Congress that says, “Well, you  are trying to frustrate us, and you’re not going to provide the funds necessary to make our fiscal  policy work”  Now that doesn’t bother me, because I’m not on the stand now  It may bother  you considerably before your hearing’s over     But assuming you can get away with this without too much harassment, and I believe you  can because of the particular points you picked, I’m perfectly willing to [reduce] the [lower end  of the] range [for M2] to 7 and [for M3 to] 8-1/2  I would like to point out to the Committee that  we do have a different spread in these three aggregates  M1 at 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 is a 2-point spread,  and I have heard some around this table [who say] that it ought to be a single-point number and  others who want a 3- or 4-point spread, including those who said it doesn’t matter a bit whether  you’re talking 4 or 8, it means the same figure     No, I recognize you have not made it for the long run  Nevertheless,  M2 and M3 are presently on a 3-point spread  Now, I haven’t got any strong feelings about this  because I am not much of a short-run believer in these things  But [for] the long run, I have  some belief in these figures, and I would like to see if maybe we could talk some day about a  little narrower spread on the long range in the upper end instead of the maintenance of the 3[- point spread]  And, unfortunately, what you’re suggesting enlarges the spread instead of  narrowing it  We did narrow it before; we enlarged it last time by raising the upper end, and     1/17-18/77 - 51 -           now we’re going to lower the lower end, which enlarges the spread again  Well, this long  diatribe will come to a halt  I am willing to accept the M2, M3 change  I would have been  willing to accept a standstill because I don’t think it is absolutely necessary for us to move every  time     Mr Chairman, I found myself in the same box you did because the  only thing I really have much problem with is the federal funds rate range  I don’t have any  problem with the alternative B objectives  The federal funds rate range, though, I came out  differently than you did  Although not differently in the center point  I just think if we are going     1/17-18/77 - 59 -           to have an opportunity to make this work, we have got to have that range wider, and I picked the  4-1/4 to 5-1/4 range, which puts me exactly at the same center point of 4-3/4 that you have [put]  down  Directive-wise, I take a status quo position     It’ll take three weeks for the Manager to understand where he is  anyway     Mr Chairman, I don’t want to put too much sand into this cogwheel,  [but] I must admit you’re narrowing the degree of available range within which the Desk moves  from a--     Well, I understand that--     Well, but you’ve got some range now     Well, against the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 you have narrowed it  "
295,1977-02-15,"  Are you able to buy your Swiss franc repayment in francs out of the  market primarily, or are you drawing it from the Swiss?     Does the market know this?     A lot of non-unions     Mr Chairman, you and Governor Partee in effect have stolen exactly  what I’d planned to say, except that I’ve got a little bit different scenario to it, and I think Chuck  is right that we’re headed upward  I have a sneaking suspicion that we may find ourselves in a  kind of a peaking situation in the latter part of the year--maybe a downturn of no major  proportion, but a kind of interruption in this nice smooth path the staff has laid out for us here   And I suspect that we can have exactly what you are talking about, in terms of the uneasiness in  businessmen accumulating into a less-than-forward look [to] their operations, and certainly  capital spending, and perhaps some other areas, too--an uneasiness translated into perhaps  excessive caution  So while I think we may average out to where the staff is looking for it, I  wonder if this pattern isn’t going to be perhaps markedly different than that shown     No, I’m thinking in terms of a fairly low first quarter, with a growing  boom in the second and third tapering off largely because of the impacts of business caution,  reflected by the comments of the Chairman  We might have a consumer boom from the first to  the third quarter quarters, [but] not supported by a capital spending boom     Yes, the inventories are playing a considerable part     2/15/77 - 19 -             Mr Chairman, I’m in a basically hold position, which I guess is what  you’re saying  I think the interest rate structure is generally satisfactory for growth over this  near-term period, and monetary aggregates seem to be growing at a reasonably satisfactory pace,  given the liquidity in the economy  I wouldn’t resist much of an increase if we came down to the  rebate, but that’s a down-the-road decision  I might want to change my mind later on     Right now, I would resist too much of an increase in the fundamental growth here  I do  have a feeling that we may end up with some international pressures which might impact upon  our decisions in the near-term future, in the next few months  I think the Committee’s posture  right now ought to be one of a rather cautious stability  And, it seems, that is an appropriate  position for the uncertainties of the economy ahead, until we see exactly what kind of a fiscal  policy and impact these various things have had over the past few months  So I would stay with  B with a federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 5      But I would echo Paul’s reservation This does provide a bit more  emphasis, placing them within the directive      I raise a question, Mr Chairman  If we were to, at a later date, decide  there were to be a reserves intermediate target or something, would you also advocate that that  be a part of this?      We don’t specify the amount      That’s why I said, if later on you did, you would include that in your  directive      Well, you have both  It would appear in one place or the other      That’s not presently reported in this      Is there any possibility, Mr Chairman, that this may trap you in your  testimony with Congress      I think the rules of the Committee permit calling a meeting by a  certain number of members anyway      But we did agree that where opportunities arise when we were going  into sales, we ought to view that as our prime--      2/15/77 - 44 -             I think this is [desirable], too, Chuck  We encourage them to come  into the Federal Financing Bank  They decide in their own judgment that they want to issue  something separately--why, then, they ought to stand on their own   "
322,1977-03-15,"  Does it reflect also a concern over the cost of production of gold?     I have heard this--that there is a possibility a few of the mines are  running into problems, thinner veins, and so forth     So moved     Mr Chairman, I did not raise my hand on that because I think the  pattern is going to be different     Thinking of the--     3/15/77 - 20 -             Mr Chairman, may I ask a question?  Peter, has there been any  reaction in the market to the change in our policy on purchases of agencies?     Are the dealers showing you any agency issues for purchase?     What you’re saying, then, is that only when you go out and ask for the  agency offerings do you get some offerings     You may have said this, but it didn’t sink in  You said the second  quarter does not contemplate the effect of the rebate  Is that correct?     And yet, you do expect a significant effect in the full second quarter?     3/15/77 - 23 -             I guess my timing is a little bit different  I thought you might get  those mailed out in late May, and you might start getting an impact in mid-June, which would  mean that your deferred impact would be into the third quarter     I’m looking at your pattern here, on whatever table this is on p 5 of  the Bluebook, showing the M1 pattern for the alternative B  In effect, you’ve got stability for  three quarters and a 3-1/2 percent jump in one quarter     Coming back to the discussion concerning inventory, I thought we  had a prospect of relatively slow inventory growth in the first and second quarters, which does  not seem to me to imply major expansion for inventory purposes in bank credit     First, and second     Well, at least in the early part of the second  Maybe that’s my  problem  I’m looking really through mid-May     Yes  A different stage of inventory operations here, but who’s doing  the financing through bank credit, I guess is the question  If you’re building your M1 growth  exclusively on the rebate, that would be one thing, but I gather you are not     On the strength of the economy, bank credit demands, and so forth;  partly on the inventory expansion     Mr Chairman, I am going to have to start talking before Mr Volcker   He stole what I wanted to say  I had a slightly different perspective, but it tracks what he had in  mind  I really had in mind bringing that M1 down to the 4 range and lifting the top of the M1 to  9, but giving some movement in there, as Mr Volcker has indicated, as we approach either the  top or the bottom--and I assume it’s going to be the top--that we start moving slightly     On the federal funds range, I had planned to suggest to the Committee a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4,  with the same fuzzy 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 percent center point until we see some movement  I am  bothered also, as he indicated, about this basing it on a projection  I have a nagging suspicion  that these things are not going to work out with all of this beautiful symmetry that the staff has     3/15/77 - 26 -           worked out for us, and I suspect we might be surprised on either too high or too low a level  And  consequently I would hope that we would have a little more upward side to this, but, in effect,  validate these projections before we make a move     Mr Chairman, I found myself perfectly compatible with the  majority’s recommendations on this matter  I think it does leave--with the intention of the  authority that’s in the directive--the possibility of reopening  I would not be too sympathetic  with the idea of using the Open Market Desk as a means of fostering regional markets  I think  we could get into some problems there, but with that caveat, I’m perfectly happy with the results  of the subcommittee  "
346,1977-04-19,"  This particular request has one element of difficulty in it because of  the supplement to the operation [unintelligible] which the New York Fed highlights the rate  change from a very low rate to the discount rate presently  I would suggest that the Bank would  not comply with this request--that they limit their compliance only to [unintelligible] report and  not the supplement     Mr Kichline, would you repeat to me the odds on the scenario for  higher interest rates, please?     Yes     Well, your words, I believe, in the Greenbook reflect a “balance” or  “equilibrium,” I forgot the word you used, of demand and supply of credit largely through the  third quarter of the year  My question is, what upsets that balance?     Do you give any credence to the idea that the stock of liquidity [is]  available to absorb it?     How much of that is the falloff from expectations?     If you accept those numbers     Your description reminds me of the FIA [Financial Institutions Act]     It seems like you described them as individual [unintelligible]     4/19/77 - 24 -             Mr Chairman, I have a little difficulty today  I listened to what others  have said about this  I am really more concerned about the performance than I am the ranges   And while we can jiggle the ranges around, we have taken some steps, as was pointed out, to  reduce the ranges, and yet you point out our actual performance was somewhat higher, on  average  I have a great deal of sympathy with Chuck’s position that this is kind of a poor time in  life to be changing something as visible as the ranges  On the other hand, if we’re really going  to live with this range business and make it meaningful to Congress and to ourselves, I think the  latter is more important than the former  We ought to be doing something about it     I am bothered about the kind of philosophy behind this  If I understand this, and there is a  high question about that, but if the prognosis is for a major increase in business loans, which puts  some pressure on things around here, then it seems to me that much of that pressure ought to  come through on the M1, not the M2 or M3 category, in the sense of building up the pressure   Now if M1 is the principle target here, and I think it might become one under such conditions,  then we ought to be looking for the change in M1 or some more restrictive element     I am a little bothered, though, because I still have some sympathy, if not almost outright  allegiance, to questions of interest rates and money market conditions  And I am a little  concerned that this would appear to be a time when we’re taking a step in emphasizing the  aggregates which kind of prejudges what the interest rates will do  I’m not yet convinced that  this long-range forecast of interest rate increases will come to this happy land yet     A very modest change on the upper range of M2 wouldn’t bother me a whole lot  I don’t  know that M3 gains me a whole lot, because I have a lot of sympathy for Chuck’s position about     4/19/77 - 30 -           the velocity side  So I suspect that I would be willing to accept something in the very modest  change in the upper limits of M2 and M3, and it may be something in the neighborhood of an 8  to 11 on M3 and perhaps a 7 to 9-1/2, but we then start narrowing the range, and that gives me  some cause for thought  M1--I don’t believe I’d touch [it] right now     Steve, is the timing and magnitude of the tax returns giving you any  problem this year?     4/19/77 - 40 -             It could be also on the other side of the extreme, people may be filing  returns and you’re getting the rebate--     The magnitude and timing?     I was ready until you did that last thing  I was going to buy  alternative B all the way across the board because I thought it was reasonable, as we’ve done in  the past with the rise in [unintelligible] stability at this time of considerable uncertainty, and the  impact of the rebate program  All of which I think is more immediate than the longer-range  question we adopted  I would prefer that we stay with 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, and I’m perfectly willing  to take the center range just as it’s normally handled--4-3/4  I gather, Peter, that’s where we are  now?     I hadn’t thought about making a suggestion, but as long as Mr Black  [is] talking about [it], our wording was to move toward the upper limit rather than deviate  significantly  "
373,1977-05-17,"  Jim, what’s your balance between industrial production and inventory  gain?  You’ve had about a 2-1/2 to 3 percent increase in industrial production, first quarter, and I  noticed looking down here that, taking off from the third quarter of 1977, our industrial  production growth--78, 88, 90, 101--a steady rise throughout this  Is this balanced between  industrial production and inventory?     5/17/77 - 12 -             You lost me a little bit on that last comment       Well, I understand that  Coming back to the inventory question,  though, I’m just a little bit puzzled  Jerry, if you take an early inventory buildup in nondurables  at the manufactures level, which I believe is what Jim said, do we have enough track record to  call that a forecasting development to [an] enlarged total inventory, and does the balance  between your industrial production, with that track record, give you pause for thought?  An  inventory cycle question      But you said yours was going down     5/17/77 - 13 -             That’s exactly my point  That’s where I think I get off the track--I  think that the inventory-sales ratio either should level off or go up  If sales weaken and you  continue your industrial production--     Mr Axilrod, in forecasting the aggregates over the remainder of May  and early June, my recollection is that you are looking at about 4 to 5 for May and 1 to 2 for  June  Does your cutback reflect the idea that April is now explained at least partly in a seasonal,  or is this a stock and flow concept--there’s enough in the hands of the consumer to do what he  wants to do over the next month?     Well, I may be missing something in the rationale here, but see if you  can help me  If this is a position in which sufficient [funds have] been created now to handle the  second quarter’s expenditures, and we still get further enlargement of the recovery and growth in  the economy, presumably creating additional funds--yet I believe I heard you say that you are  going to have a further slowing of the time and savings deposits  Now what am I missing, if the  time [and savings deposits are] going slower and the demand [for them] is going slower     [Does] your forecast for these various alternatives range no higher  than 8 percent for M2 and go as low as 2-3/4 per cent, depending on the alternative selected?     Now, that to me sounds like you’re still slowing this time and savings  [deposit] package       I won’t take any more of the Committee’s time Mr Chairman  I don’t  quite understand the figures with what I’ve heard when you look at the forecast of the June rate  on M2 at 6 percent  But on the second sheet, page 6, on the alternatives [unintelligible]     Mr Chairman, you started taking my speech away  I was going to  suggest a 5 to 5-3/4 with a 5-1/4 to 5-3/8 midpoint, and 5-3/8 happens to be the midpoint of 5 to  5-3/4  And I was with you until you started talking about the aggregates  At that point, I  dropped off the list because I’m a little bit hesitant about some of the forecast on this  I’d take  the M1 forecast of 1 to 5  I’d prefer M2 of 4 to 8 because I suspect that we are going to get some  reactions in this picture ahead  I, too, am not willing to give up what we’ve already had, but I  don’t believe I want to say that if the thing comes in at below zero, I’d be unwilling to lower the  funds rate target  We need to be flexible on both sides  We reacted to a very high April  You  get a very low June, then I think we ought to have some reaction to that But that kind of a  construct sounds perhaps equally unbalanced to yours, where you took the alternative C and I  took in effect, alternative A, to some extent, although I didn’t go that far     They certainly loaded the airplanes to Atlanta from Washington every  Friday night  "
394,1977-05-27,"  St Louis has not     I’ve got a somewhat similar position to Governor Wallich’s position   I would support President Volcker’s position in terms of moving to the Treasury to get a position  from them, but I think it would be highly desirable to have a full FOMC discussion of the matter  at our next meeting   "
409,1977-06-21,"  Mr Chairman, there are only three spots in the change, or in the  projections, which raised some flags for me  First, the inventory change, shifting--from the first  quarter to the second quarter--from 121 to 30  And secondly, the increase in final purchases  jumped from 39 billion to a 57 billion rate  And then, finally, the net export picture, from a  negative 13 to a positive 1  These are very large changes in these units as the forecast--     Between the first and the second quarters  I think, as I look over these  figures and other matters, that the directions are right  I wonder if the magnitudes are quite that  much in the way of change  I particularly question the degree of change in inventory because I  think you’re going to get more rather than so much less  The net export figure, I guess, was an  oil figure more than anything else in the first quarter, and maybe that will swing that much  But  a shift [in] consumer purchases by that large a change is truly a major shift  I guess all of this  means to me that you’ve got negatives and positives on the side of the total change in the GNP   And I just wonder if maybe the second quarter isn’t going to be stronger than what you’re  reflecting in this forecast     6/21/77 - 20 -           Jim, on alternative B, you are looking at an M1 [growth rate] rising  from 19 [percent] in June to 82 in July  Would you tell me what the pattern of that was in  1976?       So your pattern isn’t much different     One point higher     Yet, your economic situation is sharply different     Which ought to then build a higher rate for M1, shouldn’t it?      I know, but starting at the lower base you still are moving roughly the  same--     Will you translate that into percentage change, too, Jim?  A third of  your 82 would be--     Mr Chairman, I’d be perfectly satisfied with the steady policy  directive this time, but that, to me, implies use of the money market directive rather than the  monetary aggregates directive  I would prefer that we use the full specs of alternative B, 5 to  5-3/4 on the funds rate range  If things turned out to the point where you had a very large  shortfall of the aggregates, I wouldn’t want to be limited to only 1/8 of 1 percent change in the  funds rate  It seems to me that, looking further on down the road, we’ve got ourselves built into  a very high velocity estimate, and I’d like to maybe soften my bet a little bit on that, so I’m  perfectly willing to stay in the 3 to 7 range for alternative B right now  But I’d like a little  flexibility in the funds rate and use the money market directive       I think I’d be constrained on that last one, Mr Chairman  I think we  need more room on the bottom side      Before we start that, may I ask a couple of questions about the issues   First, Alan, to what extent are we dealing with others rather than central banks?      We are dealing only with central banks     Asian Development Bank is a customer     Especially because we make no charge for doing it     Alan, operationally, do you have any advantages other than the  knowledge of flows?     Alan, to what extent have you been able to move some of the people  out of RPs into regular transactions in bills?     It was successful     Would the ruling block out the idea of the central bank applying for  exemption?     Well, if they did, then we could still work through the market     [Unintelligible] does, doesn’t it?     The major [central] banks would be government owned, I am sure     I was thinking in terms of the volume you do  Your volume would be  largely with government-owned central banks     [Unintelligible] cover RPs in governments     Your exemption covers RPs in government [securities]     Yes, but your present [unintelligible] this exemption covers  government[s] only     You have the authority to provide certification     Well, my question is, how much of these RPs are covered on the  government--     The exemption you seek, then, is just the RP exemption     6/21/77 - 54 -           I think we ought to have a report back to the Committee on the pros  and cons and the way in which changes are going to be implemented  We have had enough  problems with this pricing business     That means in effect that New York will continue its provision of the  service of RPs to all customers     But no matter how it’s done, you will continue to provide that service     Does that mean that you will ask the IRS for a ruling either way, for  [the System] account or New York?  "
435,1977-07-19,"  Mr Chairman, I don’t see how we can jump into a massive  intervention if the Administration part of this government is going to talk the other way     We’ve been talking about better control for some time, but we still  had a pretty good inventory cycle last year     Jim, on the projection of net exports of goods and services, you’re  showing a shift from a negative 6 [to a] positive 21 between the first and fourth quarter, and  then back to a negative 6 in the third quarter of ’78  Would you give me a little of your rationale  for getting there?     What brings you back up then?     So you are saying that the entire swing in net exports is an oil-related  phenomenon     Mr Chairman, I find myself differing in pattern and perhaps in some  of the details of the forecast  I have a feeling the second quarter is going to show a higher figure  than the staff is showing  I hope the third and fourth quarters show lower figures, because I  think we get a more sustainable pattern if you slow this thing down in the latter part of the year   And I think we will slow it down partly by what you have been saying, and I’ve been saying, for  some time  We will have an inventory correction here in the summer and early fall of the year   If so, the third quarter could be considerably less than what is shown in the real rate of growth  I  think it doesn’t worry me at all  In fact, I would applaud it because we get a more sustainable  pattern if we get a slower rate in the fall of this year     I am also concerned about that net export pattern you are showing  I just don’t quite  believe it, that’s all  I think we are going to show higher deficits, and I’m concerned about the  rate at which we are contributing in this deficit package  And while I hear what you are saying  in terms of the oil change, I have also done some looking about the relative change in our export- import patterns from a year ago, and oil is not the sole change by any means  In fact, it’s only  about a third to a half--a little less than that for the total change in the export-import pattern  So  if we are going to continue to support a good share of the world with our net import position, this  has got some important implications to me in the rate of growth which we aim for in this  country     Mr Chairman, I’m prepared to move more strongly than you’re  suggesting  I would like to see us set the M1 target at 4 to 6 percent, knocking a 1/2 percent off  both sides  And the M2 target, from 6 to 9 percent  I do this because I think the recovery has  moved along well enough  I’m not terribly satisfied with some of the longer-term problems of  unemployment, but I’m convinced that some of those are out from under our purview     I think there’s some slowing desirable to sustain this recovery, and I think a level of 6 or  6-1/2 percent rate of real growth is sustainable  We have a very large liquidity level  We have  some very heavy purchases in imports as well as domestic consumption  I’m particularly  concerned about the dollar’s weakness and the large deficit growth  We could let the rate float  down and get some help, perhaps, in getting our exports more competitive  It might reduce our  import demand  But I think it’s time we moved ahead a little bit on tightening monetary policy  to reduce the rate of growth in the aggregates and to tighten down to reduce this pressure of  higher prices  So I’m ready to take a larger step than you are in the targets--a little bit     Why even have it?     Why even have it?     I happen to be of that persuasion, too, but I still wonder why we just  create a figure that we add on to the pack     It’s pure cosmetics     It’s a meaningful one     It’s a meaningful one     It also lowers the midpoint     Your midpoint     Mr Chairman, [we’re] not too far apart; actually I have gone a little  step further, with M1 of 3 to 7 and M2 of 6 to 10  But the federal funds rate--if we are going the  monetary aggregates route, I think we ought to return to the full 1 point, and I’d take 5 to 6  percent     Mr Chairman, I have no problems with your [5-]1/4 to 3/4  The only  question, I think, is the asymmetrical side  You might test to see whether the Committee wants  the asymmetrical or the move to the 1/2 point [midpoint]     Well, reasonably prompt  "
461,1977-08-16,"  Would you care to comment on President Morris’s pattern question  that he talked about?     Mr Chairman, that’s an interesting act to follow because Governor  Partee has covered what I was going to say in rather considerable detail, and I don’t see any  point in repeating it  Except my final answer is that I’m quite happy with a slowdown in the  economy in the fall of this year  In the spring and early winter of this year, as you may recall, I  predicted such a thing, and I’m kind of delighted that it’s occurring because I can’t really see a 7  percent continuation without real pressures on the economy  So if we’re getting a slowdown  from 7-1/2 to 4-1/2 or something like that, I’m just delighted that it’s occurring as long as we  don’t accumulate the baggage  I think you’ve got the strength of government spending which is  going to come along  And maybe we’ll get some clarification in the tax matters if this  Administration ever gets its act put together, and if so, I think we’ve got a good possibility of  some strength in 1978  That’s the horizon I’m looking at, not this second or third or fourth  quarter of ’77     What I was trying to get Mr Kichline to say earlier is, the pattern  might even be a better one for long-range growth in this economy--to have a little slowdown in  the fall of this year     8/16/77 - 13 -             I had an industrialist spring a new idea on me, at least new to me, in  terms of why he wasn’t building a plant  He said, “I don’t need to build a plant because if my  demand overruns me, I’ve got several plants abroad that are at a much lower capacity utilization,  and I could import to the United States if I run into capacity problems”     [Unintelligible]     Less than the staff forecast?     Has the market moved to an expectation of a discount rate change?     What’s the 90-day futures market for bills looking like?     Given the dealers’ net short positions, do you find any congestion in  the market?     In the bond sales?     What about corporates?     I move we ratify the suggested action     Mr Axilrod, did I hear you say that the model had stopped  overpredicting for the third quarter?     My question was, how will you know?  The third quarter isn’t over  yet  Well, even if there is no growth, it’s going to be very difficult to avoid a very large growth  rate in the third quarter  But essentially the second quarter has a very small overprediction, 3/10  percent on the level     Does your model tell you what would have happened, for instance, to  the funds rate had you tried to hold M1 on target?     May I ask one other question, Steve?  You made a comment here  about the implicit velocity of M1 in the fourth quarter of the year, that it would have to be  [growing] 4 to 8 percent--     --6 to 8 percent, and that is grounded on an assumption of what?     The assumption also includes the GNP forecast     Mr Chairman, a question  Maybe it’s better directed to Peter  Where  is the commercial paper rate after this series of moves to 6 percent?     If there were no change in formula, would this make the change in  Citibank prime?     Is there any likelihood that that would be affected by a change in  relative interest rates?     At least I’m not aware of a satisfactory explanation     Mr Chairman, you have just destroyed my whole thesis--what I was  just planning to spring on you--of lowering the lower end of the M1 and M2 ranges     I approached it a little different     Yes, I understand  Well, let me make a couple of comments first   From my perspective, the planning horizon for policy using the aggregates must be down the  road apiece, and I look for early ’78 as my target area, in that the job of the Committee today and  over the next couple of periods is to position itself for what it expects is coming up     Now, if there is anything to this monetary aggregates target business we are going through,  and the long-run target growth, I think we have to keep the growth [with]in those target ranges  we have set for ourselves  And thus I would hope we would widen the range on the downside as     8/16/77 - 33 -           we did in the longer-run target the Chairman presented to Congress recently, leaving room for  restraint if further excessive growth develops but leaving ourselves some room to accommodate  this lower range     I had suggested in my jotted notes here that we might go down to a 1 to 6 frame [for M1]  [and] in the 3-1/2 to 8-1/2 range [for M2], but I would be willing to go to zero on the M1  I  would not want to see a negative figure  As far as the funds--     I’m talking about publications     On the federal funds rate, I am disturbed about this concentration and  limitation on the range  And I would hope if we are going to look at these widened ranges of M1  and M2 that we would also widen the range on the federal funds rate, and I would suggest to the  Committee a 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 rate, which centers upon where the Desk is supposedly now, at 6  percent     One other comment, Mr Chairman, to the general paragraphs of the directive--     But only if [M1] goes down below the lower limit, if we put it at 0 or  into the negative range, then I would think we would     I don’t think it’s inconsistent, and perhaps more philosophically I’d  rather have the full percentage [point] range     In the general paragraphs on line number 8, Mr Chairman--in the past we have published  these figures in our policy directive concerning local retail sales     Line item 8 of the general paragraph  I think it would be desirable for  us to cover our tracks here to say “total retail sales according to advance estimates grew  somewhat”     8/16/77 - 34 -             Well, it’s certainly uncomfortable the way it’s stated because of the  change that we had this past month in the revision  I looked back at prior figures, or statements  and policy records, and we are trapped in this advance-estimate approach     I would suggest, Mr Chairman, that we leave it to the staff to amend  this     May I have one other moment, because while you directed the  question to the Presidents, and I will not comment concerning my opinion on the discount rate, I  do think it would be of some help to not only consider the discount rate but, in this period of  seasonal expansion of required reserves, to consider the possibility of a structural adjustment of  reserve requirements     I’m not prepared to make that a recommendation     Yes, over the next several months     That’s all I have     8/16/77 - 35 -             I think Philip’s got a point there     They do it on a standard of administration which would very seldom  change     That’s what I think Philip was saying     The more attractive it is to borrow     You get more borrowing then     Let me clarify as far as the rates are concerned  You would go up to a  1/2 percent[age point] increase or 1/4?     Do you define this to mean above 5 percent for M1?     I would prefer 6-1/2 [percent for the upper limit of the federal funds  rate], Mr Chairman  My count of the Committee would indicate that there was a majority in  favor of that, but I guess you will find that out in a little bit     I’d like to make a comment, Mr Chairman, since I guess I’m the one  who kind of moved this toward the Committee  When this was raised as to a question of denial,  I had qualms about denying [release of] a five-year old document  But I didn’t [see] that I had  the authority to overrule the Committee’s decision of a five-year rule  I talked to the Chairman  and with Tom about it rather extensively, and then we drafted a letter of denial, and if I  understand correctly, Mr Siciliano, you talked with the Justice Department about the denial  position     And I wonder if you would mind acquainting the rest of the  Committee with what Justice said to you     Well, this comment from Justice reinforced my hesitancy about a flat  denial, and I suggested to the Chairman that we might want to raise this matter with the  Committee because, at least interpreting Justice’s position, it would seem that they’re viewing a  flat denial as being somewhat arbitrary in this five-year lag period     But the fact would be well apparent in court that Justice was not there  to defend us     1970 [maybe]     Very close to that anyway     As of right now, seven months of minutes are five years old     The last paragraph of my letter says that--“However, in light of the  possibility that the Committee decision on the question of near-term release, the requested  Memoranda   ”     Except, Mr Chairman, I believe there’s another element to the  Hannaford amendment  That is that the minutes of the Committee will be made available  promptly to the committee in Congress     The letter says that this will be raised at the meeting today     Mr Chairman, may I make a comment  What you’ve been saying is  quite interesting in a theoretical vein to me, but the reason I brought this, and asked you to bring  it, to the Committee has not yet been touched  And that is that times have changed, and we now  have a Freedom of Information [Act] which requires the appeals officer of this Committee,  whoever he may be, to rule on whether a particular document should be made available to the  public  His ruling is to be not capricious or arbitrary but is to be grounded on good reasons for  withholding from the public  I find myself in difficulty establishing good reasons to withhold  this document after 5-1/2 years, except for the sheer decision of the Committee, which I think  was an arbitrary decision in the first place--it could have been three years, it could have been six  years     8/16/77 - 67 -             Mr Chairman, I think the final gun has to come down on this as to  whether you need to release this information under the Freedom of Information Act request  We  may not like the request  We may think that it is politically motivated, but nevertheless it is a  request under a law of Congress, and if we’re going to stand pat, then I think we run a risk of  being overturned in court  If we are overturned in court, we run greater risks     Well, we already offered that to him, Tom  In fact, we recognize in  the letter that he was entitled to it     That’s all we said     No, it says--now, let’s see  “I would note that, pursuant to the  Committee to stay with scheduled public release, the Memoranda of 1972 will be available to  you in January 1978”  He is already advised on that     May I presume then, Mr Chairman, that either you or I will write a  letter to Mr [Herbers]?  "
490,1977-09-20,"  Jim, let me ask three or four questions here, and comment, if you  wouldn’t mind  Your briefing indicated that you believe consumers still have capacity to  materially add to debt  I would like to hear your rationale on that     That’s not your expectation?     Second question is [regarding] your expectation on federal  government expenditures  If I heard you correctly, you indicated some pickup in such  expenditures and that the full-employment deficit would narrow significantly  Is that what you  said?     Presuming that there will be no new major thrust of federal  expenditures flowing into 1978     I’d like to finish up one other thing, Mr Chairman  I noticed no  comment, Jim, on the impact of expectations  Have you factored this into your forecast?     Well, Jim, it’s a matter of interpretation and to some extent  expectation, I guess  My net result, looking over the data, is a somewhat different pattern of  GNP real growth than you have  I think you’re over-optimistic in the fourth quarter  And [will]  perhaps be surprised a little bit with a higher rate--partly by expectations, partly by government  expenditures--in the first half of next year  That’s all I have     Maybe it’s a good time to start thinking about it     Something else, maybe     9/20/77 - 19 -     Peter, in your contacts with dealers, do you get the impression that  they’re looking for higher rates?     Is there any significance to the change in the dealer inventory  position, particularly bills?     Well, that short position is almost liquidated now, isn’t it?     Have you gone back to look at the shape of the yield curve in prior  recoveries of this?  Where are we in regard to that shape of the yield curve, the slope of it?     Steve, can you jump to the conclusion that the Committee still has a  considerable margin [for] tightening in the short area without impacting on that long-term yield?     It depends on your timing     But you have a timing question on the rate at which you change the  short rate, too     May I ask one more question of the Desk?  Peter, given this dialogue  that Steve and several others have been having, is there strength in demand at the short end of  the market which the Committee would have to resist in a rate advance?     Strength of demand largely for investments is what I was thinking of     Well, I’m thinking of investors demanding short-rate bills     --which would be a resisting factor for your moving the rate up very  rapidly     9/20/77 - 32 -     Well, I’m not saying that you couldn’t do it  I’m merely saying  you’ve got a resistance factor built into it     I move to ratify the Desk actions     May I pursue this just one minute, Mr Chairman?  Steve, had you  looked into--and [can you] give me a good explanation for--the correlation for currency  increases with the precise months when M1 goes up?     Well, I understand it’s a small number with a huge increase, but  what’s the correlation in your reasoning, why currency moves up     Henry, in either case, isn’t it a permanent build in the stock or supply  of money?     It hasn’t been     Well, Mr Chairman, I guess I am going to round out these various  alternatives, using the same figures, but come out just slightly different from Mr Mayo  I would  be perfectly willing to accept your prescriptions in M1 and M2, putting the cap of 7 and 8  percent on the two respectively  I think there’s room for a little bit more restraint here  In the  short run, I think real growth [is] going to be a little lower than what staff or the others have  forecast at 5 percent in the third quarter, 5 in the fourth, or 4  But I’m optimistic for the first part  of ’78  And the longer range, I don’t think, is satisfactory, both on an unemployment and an  inflation basis  I’d like a policy mix shift here, with the Federal Reserve tightening [and] fiscal  policy easing  How that fiscal policy ease is achieved and the particular instruments used are  matters beyond our control, at least within our range of advising somebody as to the direction it  should move  I’ve reached a point where I think the Federal Reserve needs to limit the liquidity  advances in this economy and I think we need to pay a little attention to these monetary  aggregates     So I’m perfectly willing to use your cap level of 7 and 8  I would use the 6 to 6-3/4  percent as the range for federal funds, but putting the 6-1/4 as the asymmetrical midpoint  I  think we’ve reached a point where we will come up pretty soon here to the problem of  confidence if this thing doesn’t turn a little bit  But I believe it’s going to turn again, and I’m  making a policy recommendation with the assumption it will turn  Establishing a cap on M1 and  M2 is a bow in the direction of the monetary side, but looking over a long range, I really don’t  care if the thing does go down to zero  I’d be happy if we got a little retrenchment in the total  level, and whether you want to put it in a prescription or not is immaterial  But I don’t want to  go down below the 6 percent range on the federal funds  So with those comments, I’m willing to  stand on these particular prescriptions     If we’re going in that direction, I’d want a 3/4 [percentage point  federal funds rate] range, too     Well, let me try, Mr Chairman, since I ruined the shift on that   Suppose we just take the M1 at 2 to 8, leave Mr Partee’s 4 to 9 on M2, use the 6 to 6-1/2 as the  fed funds range, put a 1/8 asymmetrical position but with the understanding that it moves to a 1/4  if the figures confirm the staff projection     Mr Chairman, I wonder if there is any possibility that we might  resolve one or two votes  I doubt that we can resolve all of them because we have a conflicting  viewpoint on both sides of the spectrum  But I wonder if it is possible to shift one or two by  talking about a 6-1/8 [midpoint for the federal funds rate range] with a move to the quarter only  with confirming     No, we had 6-1/4  And if we changed that last specification to 6-1/8--  "
516,1977-10-17,"  I move that it be approved     I’d like to [ask] one discrete question to start with, Mr Chairman   Mr Truman, in the material on net exports and imports, on this chart you’re showing on the  export side a very large increase in nonagricultural volume--I guess about a 10 percent increase  in volume--if I can read it from the chart, which is terribly hard to do  What is there in the  outlook that makes you think you’re going to have such a dramatic increase in exports for  nonagricultural?     If I draw my lines over correctly, you’re about $25 billion on a $100  billion base; that’s 25 percent  Is that right?  Start to the end of the period, now--I’m not talking  about the whole forecast period     So you have a 9 percent price increase and 9 or 10 in volume increase,  which would compound to be over 20 percent  Seems like a very large increase to me     One other question  Does your agricultural forecast take in the new  information concerning the drop in production estimates for Russia?     Is that speculation about a 20 million ton demand from Russia out of  the picture or is that realistic?     It does lead into something I was curious about, Jim  If you take a  look at the real personal consumption expenditure chart and then you go back to the retail sales  chart--and admitting that it’s difficult to do this because one’s on a seasonally adjusted annual  rate basis on a real term and the other one’s on billions of dollars--there seems to be a difference  of perspective, at least in my mind  Adding to that the consumer attitude surveys, there seems to  be a kind of a flattening of the retail sales picture in at least the pictures we have here  But then  a sharp upward tilt to the real personal consumption expenditure picture  Now is services going  to do all of this for us?     10/17-18/77 - 16 -           You mean you’re pinning that advance on the basis of real disposable  personal income?     Over the full projection period?     Is this the meeting of the Sunshine [law] now?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  We were talking yesterday, as you may  recall, about any questions of difference on the projection period  And I don’t find myself, on  balance, over the period to mid-’78 on a net basis a whole lot different than the Board staff,  although I think they’re a bit optimistic  But my pattern of projections seems to be fairly  different from theirs  The third quarter, fourth quarter shift--I think they’re overly optimistic for  the fourth quarter of ’77, and I’d say a little bit less optimistic than I am for early ’78  But then  in later ’78, I have a pattern which fades and perhaps fades more rapidly than theirs  It seems to  me that early ’78 could show some strength in the inventory, government spending, and some  personal consumption elements of the economy, countered to some extent by net export  weakness and sluggishness in the construction area  For the latter part of ’78, I think we’re  going to get additional sluggishness or weakness out of some inventory cutback and possibly  also further construction weakness     So I guess what I have to say to the Committee is that, looking down the path, my little  scenario runs to weakness in ’77 with more early strength in early ’78  And it’s a balancing act   As I said, I come out on net balance not much different than the Board staff, forecasting through  the summer of ’78     You say continue to diversify  How far has this moved?     Or do you know?     So your impression is, this is more than a threat, then?     So moved     Mr Chairman, it’s a very difficult decision because we’re looking at  an interpretation of what we come out with  My interpretation is slightly different from yours  I  think we have a question of credibility in practice versus policy prescription that we put forth to  the general public  And I don’t believe that lowering the range at the present time is going to  give anybody a whole lot of comfort, in view of what’s gone on in the past six months  It seems  to me that we are better off, given the uncertainty of the data which is before us and the  uncertainties which we clearly have seen in our projections of these aggregates, to widen the  ranges which we put before the Congress     We have had a history, I believe, in this Committee [of] 2 and 3 percent range widths on  the long-term objectives, and I would prefer to move toward that upper limit and perhaps even  exceed it  I would be perfectly willing to accept a 4 percent lower [limit on M1] and widen that  up to a 7; and then on M2 to widen again, and here I would prefer to go to a 6 to 9-1/2, and the 7  to 10-1/2 [on M3] I do this largely because I don’t believe in what I’m hearing  I don’t think  we’re going to be able to outguess these aggregates over the coming three months, and I don’t  think we really want to be in the position of being caught out on a limb again     But on the other hand, I don’t really have that much attachment to aggregates anyway  It  seems to me that our interest rate position is going to have to be taken into account, not only in  terms of a longer-range picture but more importantly the short-range area  So it would be my  preference, Mr Chairman, to widen these ranges and give us a little more leeway so we do not  have to move in much of an interest rate pattern in the next three months     Same thing     No, but could I have just a little more clarification of what you said to  Peter, that, under the money market directive, we hold the midpoint where we are now unless  things really start moving out of the picture, as opposed to the other one, where we start moving  the funds rate gradually  "
543,1977-11-15,"  May I ask a question, Mr Chairman?  Tom, if I heard you correctly,  you not only have the possibility of a request for a 30-day extension; you also have an outside  emergency type for a longer extension?     So you don’t go in asking for longer than 30 days to start off with     I see     11/15/77 - 7 -           Mr Chairman, I don’t have any problems with Governor Gardner’s  idea that we go ahead with appeal on this  But I do think it might be well for the Committee to  take a look at what Governor Wallich suggested, however  If Tom’s appraisal of this matter  bears any relation to where we come out, we may find ourselves [with] a December 1 release  date if the Solicitor General refuses to take our case  In which case, we have a release problem  immediately upon us     [Unintelligible]     That’s fine, Mr Chairman, but with the one exception that you are  going to write a directive out of today’s meeting     That’s the one that would have to be released if we lost everything       One of the alternatives the court suggested to us was legislative relief     We are approving the actions of the Desk     Mr Chairman, I would merely comment, in the vein you ask, that the  staff seems to be moving in a direction which I had thought was probably the likely outcome, a  shading of the fourth quarter ’77  You have only taken 2/10 off of it this time  I was kind of  hoping you would take a bit more off, but I think, in terms of the outlook, I’m a little more  bearish in the earlier part and a little more bullish in the latter part of the six-month forecast area   And you get out to the latter part of ’78, and I won’t even attempt to guess, but I suspect there  will be a shading downward     Mr Chairman, it seems to me that today is the day for some  stability--no change  I like Paul Volcker’s 1 to 7 [percent] range [for M1]  It gives a little more  outside movement, and it doesn’t threaten having to go off of our 6-1/2--I don’t want to go above  it unless we’re forced by some pretty high figures in the aggregates  So I’d be just happy to  adopt that 1 to 7 [range]  "
568,1977-12-19,"  That presumes, however, that you are going to endorse the GAO bill     Well, I guess my question is, question of strategy--you deal with it  more than the rest of us, but the question is whether the GAO bill is actually going to get passed   I have not crossed that bridge in my mind     I’m not totally optimistic that it can be accomplished either, Mr  Chairman  But I would like to see a little more evidence of some real interest [in] the Senate  before we start a compromise of it     That’s already gone  The Senate--I’d like to see what they come back  with after their vacation     Well, they haven’t had a markup session yet     Couldn’t that be done by a person or people not particularly in favor  of it--somebody who would take this as an acceptance of GAO?     I’d have to remember more carefully than I do, but I think there is  some comment about referring that GAO [bill] to Senate Banking as a courtesy referral before a  final passing      I’m pulling something out of memory that I’m not positive about  The  reason I was--     12/19-20/77 - 6 -           I’d like to hear the Committee’s feeling a little bit more on why you  think the very narrow range of the federal funds rate is desired     Let me come back to that question on the running side  On the  question of intermeeting decision, would that also, counsel, come under this immediate release?     Yes, but what I don’t see  is the early information on the aggregates  ranges, which we are basing the decision on, before it’s published in the papers  We may have a  set of aggregates figures that we are looking at which strongly go beyond the market perception  or beyond our released aggregates guides  And we are taking an action which then, in advance,  probably a week in advance from the past, moves us beyond our limits     I guess it’s a matter of perception as to whether a 1 point range in the  federal funds market might give more leeway for the Committee not to have to have these  special announcements, as opposed to a narrower range, [which], in at least a few instances,  would almost assure that we would have an announcement to make      But you could have a reporter ask a majority opinionated member why  did you vote for this  Which is the same thing Chuck was saying--why did the dissenter vote for  this, or against this      Your problem might be a 6-1/2 to 7 percent     I think there’s a question of the interpretation here, as to whether the  market would react stronger with a half point or a full point  And that, no one can tell until we  try it     Mr Chairman, I have one other--     I have one other concern on this  I want to state this carefully  I don’t  have any interest in this Merrill decision  I wish it would go away someplace  But if we are  actually going to be subjected to this court interpretation, then I raise questions, counsel, as to     12/19-20/77 - 26 -         whether we can be charged with evasion of the court’s activity or requirement if we do a pro  forma on the long-range targets after a full discussion      Moot until we hit the next long-range target discussion     In either direction      I get the impression that the Desk would prefer greater intervention   What’s your concept of intervention?     Which implies then, you’d just be throwing some money down the  drain if you did too much with it daily      Only one facet of that bothers me, and I’ve listened with care about  the reason we can’t do this--there’s a cost-benefit relationship here  And I think the deterioration  of the exchange rate is building an inflationary force here, and the cost of that inflationary force  might be even more than the intervention cost--if it carries too far     We’re even trying to block it from other countries     But we have done it for international purposes at this table     Art, under the rules, does the subcommittee really have an additional  500 million between meetings?     No, not another, he said on top of what we have done     I agree with your formulation, unless this deterioration moves more  rapidly  At this point, I think I might want to reconsider that     That’s my point     It wouldn’t under--could at least spend $500 million before you get  there     Refresh my memory, Secretary  Have we a sharing on losses on this  swap?     50-50 loss sharing     There should be mentioned also, if you do get your major energy  program curtailing consumption of gasoline, you do have a significant impact on housing  construction out in the far suburbs of major towns, because you cannot create new public  transport overnight to service areas like that     All right, but not on a single-family basis     You can do it on a condominium or high-rise apartment     12/19-20/77 - 51 -           Mr Chairman, I am satisfied with the status of the economy today  I  think we are having very good improvement  The short run, I don’t see much problem through  the early part of ’78  But I differ from the staff when we get down into mid and late ’78--not on  the basis of housing or anything of that character  I can see a major run-up in inflation this  coming year  Government policy, I think, has weakened very sharply in any resistance to  inflation  The actions they have taken with regard to the stockpile--sugar, grains, copper--and  other things which are coming down the pike  I think it’s going to provide a major stimulus to  raw materials and prices       Well, we’ve got a stockpile policy now, if I understand this correctly,  to rebuild the stockpile which Nixon tore down and sold off      The last I heard on this, Mr Chairman, was a policy statement which  would roughly put out $3 billion to $5 billion in raw materials, one of the major elements of  which would be copper     12/19-20/77 - 58 -           It was to be spread over the next 2-1/2, as I recall, sir     Yes it did, but the net, I believe, Paul, was a major stockpile   Furthermore, I think the deterioration of the dollar is going to add a significant inflation stimulus  over the next few months  I hope you are right that we’ll get a reduction, or a correction, in  these various elements you’ve mentioned to stop the deterioration, but I have my doubts about it  over the short-run period  On balance, what I’m saying is that I think we are going to be facing a  fairly significant inflationary run-up in the early part of next year, culminating, perhaps, in the  summer of the year  How that culminates--whether we are in a downturn or in a roaring boom, I  don’t know  It’s too far out for me to guess  But I think the staff may be severely  underestimating the inflationary problems next year       Peter, what can you tell us about dealer attitudes now with regard to  interest rate expectations?  I noticed some shifting in their [long-term] positions over the last few  weeks  Is that indicative of a shift in attitude?     If he knew what he knew last week in the first week--     So moved     But didn’t you explain away that January miss in a recent document,  that maybe this was covered up by some lack of seasonal reflection and changes in bank  statistics?  That you might have actually had a blip of significant proportion if the seasonal had  been caught?      Well, I saw something recently where you were trying to explain  away the April or whatever months you had--      All right, all right  I thought there was reference in that document to  January, but maybe we actually had one in January, too, and that this would mean all four [first- month-of-]quarter months      I have to look up my memory with [unintelligible]     Mr Chairman, the suggestion you’ve raised bothers me only a little  bit, the 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent [range for M1], because if I read these estimates for December and  January, the average is 68 percent, which leaves you a margin of only 1-1/2 percent if the staff  estimate, on an averaging basis, is anywhere near correct  Given the margin of error which  Steve has already alluded to--while I don’t like 9-1/2 percent, I wonder if we aren’t setting  ourselves up for a change in the fed funds rate by narrowing that top level down to this narrow a  range against the average       12/19-20/77 - 71 -         I believe I would rather have taken the wider spread that Steve suggested, certainly the 6  point spread  I wouldn’t be disturbed if [M1] did come in at 2-1/2 percent, but if you hold me to  a 6 point spread, then I’ll almost have to come up to 3-1/2 to get to a 9-1/2 or a 9  I hate to be  caught in these statistical traps  And all I’m saying is, I would hate to be today making a  decision which might be said to be couched in a framework of a movement in the [federal funds]  rate even though I don’t hear any support for much of a change in the fed funds rate over the  next month  So I guess I would come out somewhere in the 3 to 9 range, Mr Chairman     Maybe we are dealing with lag time, then     Mr Chairman, while you are doing that, may I suggest something  here  I’d like to have the staff look into the possibilities of using two-month retro and one-month  forward instead of our present two-month aggregates figure  So that for today--     You are studying it now?     Good     Right     Well, it reduces the amount of forecasting influence     Well, I’m talking about for today, in December, using November,  December, and January  "
590,1978-01-05,"  Do you want us to ask questions now or--       Alan, I believe you said in your comments that some of our  commercial banks have been testing us on this announced policy  Would you clarify what you  mean by that?       But it’s not our own commercial banks?    "
609,1978-01-17,"  Ted, have you seen any evidence of a shift in leads and lags of   commercial payments aggravating this pressure on the dollar?      You two are talking about a time problem  [There’s] a short-run   problem and a longer-range problem  I can’t see just standing by while the dollar depreciates at a  rapid pace But neither can I see a long-range intervention policy       Scott, you seem to be working on an attitudinal problem  How much   progress have you made?      No, I don’t mean intervention  I mean in terms of attitude      When do we reach the first second renewal?      Mr Chairman, I think the net result of what I am going to say is not   going to be a great difference in the average for the whole year  But I see the pattern as  significantly different and it perhaps connotes the beginnings of a possible recession at the end of  1978  I think [the staff’s] rate of inflation is too low  I think [the projected] rate of [growth in]  gross national product in the first and second quarters is too low but I think it’s too high in the latter  part of the year  As we move [through] the year, I think the impact of the dollar depreciation on  our prices and the increased pressure on wages and the minimum wage and the CPI through  indexed growth are going to cause greater inflation than [the staff] had planned  With regard to the  GNP side, I can see a very sizable gain, perhaps even larger than what you are forecasting--maybe  even up to 7 percent real growth in the first quarter--primarily from inventory growth and the  impact of this government spending that has just been hitting us  But by the time the second, third,  and fourth quarters are coming along I think inflation is going to take its toll  I suspect that housing  declines are going to be sharper than [the staff is] looking at  I don’t think capital spending is  going to have the strength shown  So I am looking for something much weaker in the latter part of  next year, Mr Chairman       I am talking in terms of a major slowing of growth      Even with the tax cut      Normally, we would take it up at this meeting      We are getting off our schedule in considering it  There are some   implications to that  Still, given the request for Miller’s testimony after the next meeting, on  balance I prefer to wait       Will that hearing postponement be made public?      Mr Chairman, I would feel comfortable with either 3 or 4  I happen to   have a preference for 4 because it states [the authority] more clearly      Mr Chairman I would like to stay where we are at 6-3/4 percent  I   would put a caveat on that only [if] the aggregates appear to be growing very strongly--by that I  mean even the 8-1/2 percent specification in “B” would be acceptable to me  I’d prefer the 6-3/4  percent midpoint and be willing to go with a 6-1/2 to 7 percent formulation or something like that I  don’t really care; I just want to hold [the rate] at 6-3/4 percent    "
636,1978-02-28,"  I move acceptance      I think there was another reason too, if I recall correctly, for the   establishment of the gross limits--to achieve some balance in the Desk=s operations in foreign  currency transactions  [The goal was] that we not be intervening constantly in the market, but  intervene with a balanced approach without heavy, massive intervention  A net limit, as you  pointed out, would perhaps reveal nothing       If I hear you right, Alan, you are talking about doing some of this   negotiation in what--March or April?      Mr Chairman, I agree with much of what Henry was saying about   reducing the scale of operations, but something he said bothers me considerably and it=s something       2/28/78           12  about which I wanted to check with the Desk  At least publicly we have been saying that we are  intervening to counter disorderly conditions  And yet we are using the Swiss franc, in effect as  Henry has been saying--obliquely anyway--as a means of achieving a higher dollar rate       But is there a conflict here between using another currency as opposed to   intervening only in disorderly [conditions]?      Could I go back to Governor Partee=s question for just a moment?  He   asked if you defended 204 the same as you defended 206 or something like that  You said “no”      All right  I think the question is not that but would you defend against a  quarter percent reduction or deterioration in the exchange rate harder now than you did before?       But when do you go into the market?  That=s the question      Didn=t you say [the open position limit is] $175 billion right now?      I beg your pardon?      What=s the purpose of that?  I don=t understand your reasoning for the  delegation       No action would mean you=d have what?      Mr Morris just made my speech, Mr Chairman  I=m pleased that the   staff is moving back down the pike a bit from where they were last time  They have a bit left to go  to reach what I think is likely for the rest of this year  I still believe that we=re going to have a  snapback from the cold weather and the coal situation  It=s hard to tell whether it will hit the last  month of the first quarter or the first two months of the second quarter  Even if it were not for the  coal and cold weather problems, I think we have an inventory rebuilding problem on our hands  which is likely to boost activity considerably in the first half of this year  But beyond that, I see  problems looming on the construction side, higher prices and maybe some impacts on buying,  capital spending reductions, and certainly a problem in our international relations  All of these  [factors] say to me that we=re going to get lower rates of real growth in the latter part of the year  and higher rates of inflation  And I don=t think [the economy] is going to be growing fast enough to  [produce] any measurable reduction in unemployment in the latter part of the year       Mr Chairman, Mr Partee gave [many] of the same reasons that I would   to support your package  I think there are two or three other points  First, if I understand the  ballgame here, and I am not sure I do, if we go back to our normal [schedule for] reconsideration  [of our long-run ranges] we=ll be back to this subject very soon  And I really don=t want to be  launching into a whole new ballgame with [another review of these ranges] coming up within a  month or two  Secondly, I would strongly resist the idea of narrowing the [M1] range, which  flaunts the track record we=ve had on this  We can=t even meet the upper [end of the] range the way  it is now   If we narrow it even more, I think it would be a mistake  Third, on the M3 point, while  it=s a good theoretical exercise and we can speculate about what will happen to the savings and  loans and their thrift record, in practical terms I don=t find the Desk paying much attention to M3 in  the day-to-day transactions  In fact, [while] M1 and M2 have some relevance, M1 seems to be the  principal point of contact  So I guess M3 is a gratuitous type of figure to use--one that we ought to  pay attention to, but not one that somebody else is paying a whole lot of attention to yet  And  they=re likely to as the economics change  If  I thought we were really going to do something and       2/28/78           37  use these ranges in a practical sense of setting policy, then I think my preference would be  something like a  4-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent M1 range, which I think is probably more practical than  what we have in front  of us  But I=ll take the coward=s way out and stay with the status quo       Mr Chairman, I=d take alternative B  I have some doubts about the   figures the staff is [projecting for] the rates of [monetary] growth in February and March  I have a  suspicion that the March figure is going to be sharply higher than what [they’re] showing  But  there is some leeway in this averaging business, and as long as we are looking at a 6-1/2 to 7  percent range on federal funds, it doesn=t disturb me a whole lot  I don=t want to go down from  6-3/4 percent now that we=re there for the moment, but I don=t want to go up over 7 percent by any  means until we take a good long look at it  I would even be a little reluctant to go beyond 6-7/8       2/28/78           46  percent, so if we are going to fine-tune it, a 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent range would be my ideal  But we  might as well set a particular [rate]  We might even get to 6-11/16 but I hate those 16ths  So, as far  as I=m concerned, alternative B is the best    "
658,1978-03-10,"  You lost your audience      Mr Chairman, I would echo much of what Mr Burns has said in his   comments with regard to this action  We are building a fairly large intervention ammunition base  here which I think exposes the Federal Reserve to much greater losses, certainly, than we have  already had  If we go ahead with this--I am not going to raise any huge flag against it except that I  must admit I would have preferred a different course--I would hope that we would at least extract  three terms and conditions  First, that we have the same terms and conditions we have had on our  past swaps--and I believe Henry covered that--a 50-50 sharing of loss on the interest rate side   Secondly, I would hope that this second extension of the swap would have something built into it  which says that the Federal Reserve can buy out of this by direct action with the Bundesbank   Thirdly, [that the agreement include] a Treasury takeout down the road if we do get socked into  some very large figures on the swap arrangements  Now, we had what we thought was a takeout  commitment some years ago, which got rescinded or forgotten or something or other  But if we’re  in the process of trying to build up a highly visible dollar total to impress the market, I think the  Federal Reserve also has the responsibility to protect itself where it can  The pressure for  fundamental action, I think, is reduced by actions of this character, but I certainly would like to see  the Federal Reserve protected in a long-term loss operation  That’s all I have, Mr Chairman       I’d at least like to try it      [There’s only] a $400 million differential between the availability of the   two lines anyway  We have $14--well, $24 billion      How about the BIS?      Could I comment?      Phil, I share much of your concern  I wonder if something like this   couldn’t be handled with a Treasury takeout?      I’d just like to make one more comment, Mr Chairman  It seems to me   that basically we’ve been talking here about a negotiating strategy with the Bundesbank  I hope  our negotiators, as they move through this, will keep a close [eye] on the points we’ve been  making--[about having] the same terms and conditions in the [new] agreement [and for direct  repayment] of the new $2 billion and some settlement of the repayment policy  I don’t know  whether we’re going to get answers on those things before the final vote on this extension comes to  us  Henry, do you think we’ll have answers on those things?       The part that apparently is getting lost here is the question of whether   we do any Treasury takeout negotiations  That, of course, is between us and Treasury, not the  Bundesbank       Over what period?      Does that mean until the next meeting of the FOMC or--       Unless there is some change in instruction or we call for additional   consultation       3/10/78              14    Do I understand that we are maintaining the ranges?   "
673,1978-03-21,"  On the part of the Germans       Scott, if my arithmetic is correct, there’s $50 million of Treasury   money left  What happens if you hit a big day?      Mr Chairman, I would second that proposal but only if in the interim   period we are seriously negotiating a long-range repayment procedure  I gather that was the intent  of the renewal, Alan  So given that clear understanding that we will come out with some sort of  repayment program within this time frame, I would be willing to support that proposal       Yes, or if we make an agreement in that interim period for prompt   repayment      Thank you  I think I would agree with what Paul and Henry have been   saying--that the worst of the possible alternatives is nothing but continued rollovers for 3 years  I  think that leaves us with a very large outstanding financing that I prefer we not take on  I would  hope, though, that if we’re going into a Swiss type of approach to this that we could accelerate the  repayment  But my real preference is to pay these off right now       Mr Chairman, I’m looking down the pike at this and I want to come   back to the question that you asked us to defer until the Manager reached this position and that is  the question of what do we do with the fact that the Treasury has only $50 million available       Forgive me, Mr Chairman, but I think it becomes an important point   here  If we’re going to authorize an additional $425 million--or whatever the figure comes out to  be--for a net open position and the Treasury only has $50 million, we could be in a position where  we are expending sizable amounts and have continued exposure without comparable Treasury  operations       Without sharing it      A period of a few days doesn’t bother me; months would [bother me]     3/21/78              21      My hesitancy on this, Mr Chairman, is that I know how some of these   things get deferred and delayed  I am concerned that the Treasury might end up actually not selling  these SDRs  If I recall [the reference to selling SDRs] that was in the press release, that says “if  necessary” or “if desirable” or something like that       You added “can’t we”      Mr Chairman, I would agree with the thrust of this  I do think,   however, that we can easily get led down a primrose path month by month by month to the point  where we again are using up in full-scale intervention the nearly $2 billion of additional authority I  would hope that before we move much further down this [road] of continuously intervening each  month--this is the reason I’m a little resistant to going much further than we’re going here--that we  have a full-scale debate here in the Committee as to whether we want to go on with any further  intervention or just stop it without Congressional authorization        Mr Chairman, let me ask one question first   Jim, in working out your   forecast for the remainder of the year--well, let me state it as an assumption  I assume you knew of  the downgrading of the fourth-quarter GNP--the recent announcement--before you went into this  [projection exercise]       If you had known this, would you have shaded your figures down?      Mr Chairman, I guess I’m seconding Henry’s comments in a way  It   seems to me that we’re faced with a difficult problem here of slow growth in two consecutive  quarters  One is theoretically because of the coal strike and cold weather  The other one has now  become less than expected--at the 38 percent level [for the fourth quarter of] last year  I’m still  optimistic that the second quarter is going to show a major rebound, and perhaps even more than  the staff is indicating  Although I really wonder if the 34 percent [preliminary estimate] for real  growth for the first quarter is as low as it will [turn out to be or if it will] be cut back by the events  of January and February  I’m more concerned as I look in the future, however, because there is a  significant rebound in the second-quarter [forecast]  And if inflation continues to move up, as I  expect it to, I think we’re going to be placed in a position of resistance--with higher interest rates,  slower construction, and consumer buying weakening as debt increases  I would parenthetically  add that I’ve been questioning bankers as I go in and out of these meetings here and I find more  and more of them are saying now that their consumer credit delinquencies are rising and that they  are starting to see evidence of excessive debt on the part of the consumers  I haven’t yet gotten  enough answers in that vein to call it a nationwide trend by any means  But if this were to be  developing, then consumer buying would also weaken and we could face a further reduction in real  growth in the latter part of the year  It doesn’t mean, however, that we won’t have a great  inflationary problem to attack; and, unfortunately, I think it’s going to be left to us to attack it       Peter, what’s your reading of dealer attitudes these days?      Does that reflect even their coupon holdings?      And yet positive as opposed to negative a couple months ago?      Mr Chairman, I’m not too far away from you and Vice Chairman   Volcker on this, with perhaps a slightly different twist to it  I would take Paul’s 6-3/4 percent  lower limit on the federal funds rate and put the top end up to 7-1/4 percent  I would take your  alternative C as a guide to M1 and M2, mainly because I think we need to take advantage of any  kind of window we can get toward lower aggregates growth  I think we’re going to be faced with  higher aggregates growth; and there’s no point in getting socked in with more of these spikes if  they come along after the seasonal adjustment  I don’t know, Steve, whether you’ve ruled them out  or not  But I would prefer that we take this kind of a measure now  In effect, it’s a slight  tightening of the posture of the Committee, [which I favor] because I see inflation as being our  biggest problem over the months ahead and I’d like to get a leg up on it       No, I think I would stay with the monetary aggregates directive this   time, Mr Chairman      Mr Chairman, if we follow the formulation you’ve laid down at 6-1/2   to 7, 6-3/4 is the midpoint and you would stay at the midpoint unless--      In other words, we would not be taking the flexibility down below to   6-1/2 percent      How about the upside for the 7?      I do not      We haven’t done it and I don’t like the idea in our exact current   environment, where we’re questioning whether the Treasury is going to fulfill its responsibilities in  this action, that we have a warehousing arrangement which they can push off on us        Yes, even if I have a legal opinion  [We’re] not only asking for a   future payback to us but also going to warehouse their foreign currencies      No, but if they bought something, warehousing puts them over here   and they’d be made whole, wouldn’t they?      But we would be holding their foreign currencies      There was a change made in the Procedural [Instructions]   "
698,1978-04-18,"  Well, I think both groups have a clear point  We would like to have  some improvement to pay off [our debt]  But I think there is a fundamental policy understanding  here that if we are going to counter disorder on the downside, we ought to counter disorder on the  upside too  I would be a bit reluctant if we are going to apply the disorder only on the downside  risk       I didn’t say it had  I am merely saying that the policy of countering  disorder ought to be uniformly applied     4/18/78             5       Scott, has the Treasury yet bought or sold any SDRs?       Mr Chairman, I think the effort has been worthwhile, and I think Ernie  has raised something [important] with us  But I happen to agree with the Subcommittee on the  Directive that it would not be advisable to do this in a public setting at the moment  My personal  preference would be that we do this on a semi-annual basis for a while--raise our horizons and look  down the road 2-1/2 to 3 years and try to keep track of where we are coming out with regard to the  longer-range picture  I don’t think we can afford to put this out in the public arena with the  indefiniteness of it  I can see why, perhaps in the current setting, it might not be too difficult  But  perhaps in a setting where down the road in 1-1/2 to 2 years we are looking at a recession, the  publication of a System document indicating that a recession is on its way would be a terribly  difficult thing to agree on         Yes, it is tough on a one-year basis  So I think the effort here is  worthwhile  I agree with the idea of going ahead and having repetitive reports  I hope we do so on  a semi-annual basis because I don’t think there is any point in revising a 3-year goal on a quarterly  or monthly basis       Mr Chairman, does that mean we are accepting the final page of that  report indicating a quarterly setting of targets in the 3-year period?       No I think semi-annually  But I do think more could be done in the way  of developing alternative possibilities over the longer run through scenario writing than the staff  has done at this time  But that shouldn’t be every quarter   Would you--       Mr Chairman, I think the staff projection is again moderate, in line with  what a few of us have been talking about for several months  I still think we have a little ways to  go, Jim--maybe another 02 or 03 on the average annual rate of GNP  I think [your] pattern, too, is  still a little bit flat, with not quite as much volatility as I still see in it  I think we are going to clear  7 percent in the second quarter; you are in the 6 range  Bob Mayo has given a good share of my  comments concerning the international side; I think we perhaps overreacted to a bad set of figures  in the early part here  I thought you were perhaps a bit optimistic a couple of months ago about  improvement, but I think you are a bit pessimistic on the 5 percent depreciation now  Somewhere  in the middle range, which I guess is zero--which is about where Bob came out--I believe  On the  internal forecast here, I would suggest that you might want to take another look at housing starts  I  doubt if they are going to hold up this high; these things have a cyclical life of their own and once  that cyclical life starts it’s a bit difficult to turn them around  I suspect we will get [greater]  declines than we anticipate and we may get a little less strength out of the consumer expenditure  side than you seem to be forecasting, particularly on the strength of the tax cut in the third quarter   All of this adds up, Mr Chairman, to [my view that] we are still a bit more optimistic on total  growth of GNP on the real side  I’d suggest that we are looking at something that might be termed  a mini recession--I hope it’s mini--by the latter part of this year       That is exactly what I have written down       Mr Chairman, I have no real preference for movement  I came prepared  to support a 4 to 6 percent range on M1 and 6 to 8-1/2 or 6-1/2 to 8-1/2 on M2 and I think those are     4/18/78             29  the two principal items that we are looking at here anyway  We are playing a surface game in a  sense, [in] that we are setting long-range targets and not meeting them  So I, too, am much more  interested in the short-range side--the attitude and actions of the Committee--than I am the long- range side  So I don’t really object to the status quo       It is likely to be there only in the first few months and it is a long way for  a year’s operation  I am not sure that 7-1/2, 10-1/2, or 6-1/2--or whatever figure you want to pick-- is adequate       Mr Chairman, I think I would support the idea for you to continue to  give your private thoughts and views on this  The harder and more formal these become I think the  more the Committee is going to be forced into a position on this  We may end up quibbling among  ourselves and having outliers  In just the figures you have named, for example, you said 5-3/4 to 6  percent for the unemployment rate and I would put a 6-1/4 [on the top] partly because I think you  have your range too narrow  You might not want to be too tight on the package  These are  quibbles  And maybe if we got down to the point of debating this around the table and going  through the exercise we did last time, then we might come up with a reasonable consensus and  those who were outliers would have to be outliers  But I do think that the more formal this  becomes and the more it becomes a position that the Federal Reserve has a forecast--whether you  put it out on your own or the public merely perceives it as the Federal Reserve’s forecast--the more  we have to be careful       Can I mention one other thing?  I don’t remember exactly what your  figures were that you surfaced to the [Banking] Committee last time       That was my recollection  That exactly portrays my point  These are  going to have a track life of their own and you will have yourself in a ruler graph of the economy  coming down the [pike]       Mr Chairman, I don’t think we are making this decision forever  anyway       Excuse me, Mr Chairman       Are you going to handle the question that was raised by Mr Proxmire?  Are you going to assign that Kaufman proposal to the directive subcommittee or to somebody to  review?       Okay       Mr Chairman, I find myself very compatible with what Paul Volcker  just said  The 2 to 8 range seems terribly wide to me for M1 but I like the upper limit; the lower  limit seems a bit low to me       Oh, perhaps a range of 4 to 8 or 3-1/2 to 8--something like that  M2 at 5  to 9 I could live with  The combination of the two I think is reflecting a restrictive position, which  will mean--if the staff figures are reasonably close on this--that we will be moving the federal funds  rate fairly promptly  I am perfectly willing to live with Paul’s 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 for that  I could have  6-1/2 to 7-1/2, with a 7 percent midpoint on the package, which is the same as the midpoint that  Paul has in the narrower range  I think there is some advantage to having a wider range on these  things, so I really prefer 6-1/2 to 7-1/2  I think what this is doing is perfectly compatible with what  I was saying [regarding] my expectations for the economy--that we are going to attack this inflation  rate promptly and are likely to slow down the economy in the latter part of  this year       We might just want to delete lines 20 to 24, too; it is not a full picture     4/18/78             46       7-1/4 or 7-1/2?       If we want to go beyond 7-1/4       Mr Chairman, could I suggest an interpretation?  I suggest that we move  to the 7 percent and accept 7-1/4 but go beyond 7-1/4 only on consultation       We could take 4 to 8-1/2 for a split       There is no M2 reference either; it is a very balanced paragraph       There are all sorts of [references to] M1 below that  This is just the  historic past now    "
737,1978-05-16,"  Jim, you’ve got a fairly strong durable goods personal consumption  estimate in here and yet you’re also commenting on the very high level of consumer debt  How do  you [reconcile] those two?       Mr Chairman, I find myself in agreement with Governor Wallich’s  comments  I think our effective labor supply is narrowing and I think our capacity availability is  less than shown  I am especially worried about price pressures, which I view as very strong; and if     5/16/78              14  fed by the availability of credit, they will intensify  Credit demands in this nation are extremely  strong in certain areas and strengthening elsewhere  The competition for it is good; nevertheless,  the demands are high and they’re going to be met with some of the liquidity and large CD funding   I view the possibility of the staff’s forecast as I guess 50 percent and maybe that’s enough for you,  Jim  But I suspect that your second-quarter GNP [forecast] is still going to be low  I think the  chances of 10 percent are very good  Third-quarter GNP, I think is going to fall off faster than you  have indicated--perhaps down to 4 percent and then in the fourth quarter, I view down to 2 percent  [as likely]  I see that largely because I think consumer demand is going to weaken as debt  increases and I think the interest rate increases are going to dampen housing and eventually in 1979  they may have an impact on capital spending  I don’t view this as a very horrible scenario because  I think we need to slow the growth of the economy down to a [pace that is sustainable] longer run  because if we don’t and we face these continued price pressures, we’re going to have a bigger  problem later on       Mr Chairman, I’ll be brief  I think the point of view that Ernie has  expressed fairly well encompasses my position  I think we run a greater risk of a bigger  inflationary blow-up by not taking a small judicious action in tightening further now  The change  in fiscal stance, I think, will be helpful but I don’t think it is material  So in my view we need to  slow this GNP down a bit more and I think the inflation problem is our greatest problem  I’d prefer  to have, in line with what Steve said, a greater emphasis on M2  I made this comment at the Board  meeting the other day  I’d be willing to [give it] 2/3rd weight as our policy action guide  But I     5/16/78              32  think we do need to curtail growth if inflation is to be slowed  Therefore, I’d take a small step  I  happen to have come out with precisely the same [range] on federal funds that Ernie came out with  but I would put the midpoint at a skewed level of 7-1/2 instead of taking the 7-5/8 [midpoint] and  then I’d wait to see what happened to the monetary aggregates against our expectations  And here I  would provide a little more room for action, which would mean that we didn’t necessarily push  ourselves  I would prefer an M1 range of 3 to 8 and an M2 range of 4 to 9, which I think gives us a  bit more leeway here to work with, and at the same time a skewed federal funds range       Mr Chairman, may I suggest that my objection is registered largely on  your 7-3/8 midpoint?  I would take the 7-1/2 midpoint and I would permit the Desk to go on to the  7-3/4 percent  I have no objection to consultation  You can call a meeting of the FOMC by  telephone any time you like or you can send a wire out       Well, my principal point is that I think we ought not to put a cap on the  7-1/2 right now and merely say that’s going to trigger a meeting  I think we ought to move to the  7-1/2 promptly  That’s my biggest difference here       Just as we normally do, Paul  I wouldn’t change the normal  arrangements of this       But that’s not a normal arrangement       5/16/78              45     But, Paul, the position I think is right  We are at 7-3/8 now and edging  on up to 7-1/2 is no big deal right now       Of course not tomorrow       A week to 10 days; that doesn’t bother me a bit       That’s what the Chairman has the right to do       I’d rather not have it in the directive       Yes, Mr Chairman, do you want to get the type of directive [in this vote  as well]?       That’s what the first sentence says       I would also       It’s not totally agreed on       You could say the ranges of tolerance of the annual growth rates   Picking up Chuck’s words for the aggregates, “the ranges of tolerance for the annual growth rates  of the May-June period would be 3 to 8 and 4 to 9…”       That’s the formulation with a monetary aggregates [directive]       I hope we are not understanding a change of policy here on this   Midpoints are midpoints  And they do trigger a change if [the aggregates] move above them       Meaning you’re waiting until you get to the peak--to the ceiling--before  you change?       No question about that    "
762,1978-06-20,"  Jim, this gets down to your judgmental forecast  Where is your  strongest level of confidence in this forecast--in the GNP or inflation?  Or to put it the other way  around, where is your weakest level of confidence?       Second question  If I understand you correctly, this forecast is based  on the 5-1/4 percent midpoint of the target range  If it were based instead on the 7-1/2 percent  actual we=ve been achieving over the past period of--I forgot what it is but let=s say this last 18   months or whatever it is--where would you be coming out on the GNP and inflation forecasts?       You call that short run  [Do you mean through] 1979 or are you  talking about “short run” through the rest of 1978?       Mr Chairman, I am troubled with trying to give a forecast, troubled  between what I think is coming up against what I=d like to see come  I think I=d agree with much of  what Phil and Chuck have said--that it looks like we=ve got strength here that if left unchecked is     6/20/78                25  going to create a sharp downturn next year  I=d like very much to cut the peaks and valleys off of  that forecast  I think the consumer does have a problem with the degree of debt he=s assumed and a  problem with the inflationary cycle  Inflation, I think, is going to be higher than what our staff has  forecast, unless it=s hit pretty hard, and I expect it=s going to be in the 7-1/2 to 7-3/4 percent range   Unemployment looks to me like it will be very strong in the sense of a lower figure; and I wouldn=t  be terribly surprised if it went down to the 5-3/4 percent range  I don=t gain any comfort out of that  because I think it=s a short-run [development] which I see then causing significant adjustments into  the summer of ’79  I question whether we are at a sustainable level of GNP in other facets, given the  level of inflation and other matters  It seems to me that expectations are rising for higher rates of  interest and higher rates of inflation, and we=re even seeing some acceleration in wage rates also So  it seems to me a desirable aim of policy would be to moderate this  I don=t gain any comfort by what  fiscal policy has done so far  I see an early ’79 increase in the minimum wage--in the 9 percent plus  range--and yet I hear them saying they want to cut wage rates  If they=re going to cut wage rates,  you can=t have a 9-1/2 percent increase in the minimum wage  The forecast our staff has given us,  admittedly at the low end, still requires an 8-1/4 to 9-1/4 percent federal funds rate  And if that=s in  the cards just to achieve what they have [forecast], then I suspect we=re not going to be looking at the  staff forecast  The artificial velocity assumptions here I think are just out of the ball park  I can=t see  an 8 percent velocity change  So I guess I=m more pessimistic in one way in that I=m afraid we=re  headed toward a sharp retrenchment next year unless we do something about it now       If you want to forecast GNP without much change, you=re going to have it  somewhere in the 4 percent [area]; I=d prefer to aim at a little less than 3  The unemployment figure  I=ve given you       Mr Chairman, I approach this from a standpoint that we=re having too  high a rate of inflation and, therefore, have to cut it back  If you want to translate this into what we  should do now, I think we need to tighten up and that means raising the federal funds rate  I would  go to 7-3/4 percent promptly  I would leave ourselves leeway of at least 1/4 point, preferably 1/2  point, above that  And I wouldn=t be reluctant to take it up there if the aggregates are growing above  what I consider to be very high figures in relation to what we have set as targets or even in relation  to what we have accomplished over the last year  So I would put the federal funds range in the  neighborhood of 7-1/2 to 8-1/4; I would put the aggregates limits at 4-1/2 to 9-1/2 on both M1 and  M2 and that gives me a midpoint of 7 percent, which I think is still too high  Nevertheless, I’m  willing to buy it because of the projections for this  But I certainly would be very reluctant to see us  accept anything above 9-1/2 percent       Looks like 5 to 10 would be a good average       Mr Chairman  I have only one problem, and that=s [with] lines 12 and  13; if that were moderated, I wouldn=t have any trouble with the rest       It says “In the short run the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and  money market conditions consistent with the longer-run ranges for the monetary aggregates”       What I wanted to put instead was “In the short run…seeks to  achieve…that are consistent with the expected growth rate of the aggregates”       Well, I=m thinking of both long and short  What bothers me about the--        Well, I understand it is  But we=re really going to do what we=re saying,  [and] we haven=t been doing [that]       And to say that in the short run we=re going to seek these bank reserve and  money market conditions consistent with the 4 to 6-1/2 percent--       6/20/78                38     But the language says what we=re trying to do, supposedly       Yes, that=s what I=m worried about         We=re just not doing it  And this was a directive [from] this Committee       Come on  We just don=t do it, and we are instructing the Desk to do it       Now, that=s another good alternative       It=s a modification, Mr Chairman, but I think I=d be willing to buy it with  “reasonably consistent”       “Broadly consistent”?     SPEAKER(?)  Broadly?  Generally?  That=s an even better word     SEVERAL  Broadly       Average of what?  A monthly average?       Have we set the upper limit on--       Mr Chairman, I wonder if there isn=t a halfway house we could go with,  without going into the full details  We could just ask the Desk to stop its rollover of new issues to  reduce its portfolio and do some reduced buying       Reduce your degree of buying       It just reduces the degree but without going into a heavy or visible selling  program at a time when I don=t think we ought to be giving that kind of signal to the market       Mr Chairman, I=m sorry I made the suggestion  I thought maybe we  might be able to buy ourselves out of this quickly  But we apparently can=t       Not that minor       Not in this present market       About 1980 I=d buy it    "
788,1978-07-18,"  Scott, do you have an impression of where the major corporations and  others are with regard to their position on payments?  Are they running a covered position, doing  shorts on this, or are they shifting in their leads and lags positions?       I raised the question because I’m hearing noises from some friends of  mine involved in the international area  They are increasing their covered positions       I’d have to see some fundamentals change before I jump into this       Jim, you have made two variable assumptions in this, as I hear you--a  6-1/4 percent rate of growth in M1 and a lower end of the interest rate spectrum  If you were to  modify the interest rate assumption, what impact would this have on your model?       No, that’s fine  I was just curious which way things would move in  terms of the impact on GNP, prices, and unemployment  You would say, for example, that your  l979 figures would give me a rough estimate of what you would expect on real GNP, prices, and  unemployment       I don’t believe this is all that inherently stable  Looking at the figures I  jotted down before I came here, I would put the range of GNP in this coming period at 2-3/4 to  3-1/4, the price deflator from 7-1/2 to 8, and the unemployment rate probably running in a range of  about 5-3/4 to 6-1/4       Only that I think the possibility of having Henry’s soft landing is still a  possibility  I think we could reach that if we have some appropriate government policy to dampen  this [inflation]  My figures for the price deflator are very high, largely because I question whether  we are going to do the appropriate things in all of the government to correct this  Consequently, I  am fearful that the price side is going on up  The unemployment side I think is the most favorable  of the whole package       The Chairman hasn’t given his       Not a question, Mr Chairman       I would like to try to put a rationale in front of the Committee here by  taking a look at the purpose, the public perception, the performance, and the prospects--the four  “Ps” if you wish  It seems to me that the purpose of our long-range targets is to provide a guide  that the FOMC can use to, in effect, have a forward framework for its short-run decisions  Public  perception, unfortunately, has been conditioned to low rate goals, and a noticeable move upward  could damage our credibility to some extent unless carefully couched  Our performance obviously  has not been good in the last year for M1  But it has been good on M2 and M3  And I would not  back away from that position  The prospects, though, seem to be that there is no real expectation of  being able to hit a 4 to 6-1/2 percent range in the coming three months  And I would not like to  make this long-range decision to encompass the change in the automatic transfer  I think we can  look at that next time      It seems to me that these four points imply, obviously, some basic philosophy on how much  lag we look at [in terms of the] impact of policy  It may highlight some of the differences between  an aggregate and an interest rate policy, and it assumes certain velocity changes  I think the  Committee ought to be looking at putting this long-range growth in the perspective of economic  growth slowing in the third and fourth quarter  But with what we are already looking at--in my  opinion, an insufficient amount of restraint--the timing of this change is unfortunate, but there is  not much we can do about it  So what I would recommend is for the Committee to consider  announcing a policy shift away from M1--a modest shift at the moment by perhaps taking M1 as  being 1/4 and M2 3/4 of our average  I would accept the 4 to 7-1/2 percent for M1, which gives it a  midpoint of 5-3/4, not 6-1/4  I would go 6 to 9 on M2 and 7 to 10 on M3, with the midpoints of  their long-range goals being 1/2 point less than what the staff has suggested  I would announce  these [decisions as being] a result of inflation and our failure to meet the more restrictive goal, but  with it clearly implied, if not explicitly stated, that we are going to meet this goal  I think the  velocities are going to be higher than the 2 to 3 percent range the staff is telling us  I suspect they  are going to be 4-1/2 to 5 percent  I have some backing out of the data, which Steve sent around to  the rest of the Board, for the average in the four quarters prior to the peak       You would almost have to say that        Mr Chairman, can I make one point?       [There is another] reason I opted for a slightly higher rate in M1 as well  as the other things I have already said  [If we retain the current range] I think we are giving up an  opportunity here to say to the Congress  Look, the Administration and the Congressional actions of  the past year and those forthcoming in the first quarter of next year are the cause of this rise in  inflation  We are giving up the opportunity of telling them that if they would defer the minimum  wage increase, stagger out the increase in the social security taxes, and take stronger action to  reduce the deficit, we could live within the smaller range of growth in M1  I think we would give  up something important by not being able to say that       7/18/78              34     I think we are forecasting a tightening       Oh yes, no question about that       I would prefer not to make that change       I see no reason to create a major division on this point because I think  we’re going to be back at it in October, so I will go with the majority       So will I       Mr Chairman, my recommendation to the Committee would be  encompassed in the following 4 to 8 percent for M1, 5 to 10 for M2, and a 7-3/4 to 8-1/8 percent  funds rate range with a skewed midpoint of 7-7/8, to which I’d move promptly  I do that  deliberately       I think it is desirable to take another notch in this but not as great as a  full 1/4 percentage point on a prompt move  I don’t think we have excessive restraint on the  economy yet  In fact, I don’t really see much restraint in the change  You will note that the ranges  as given do move us down and if the Committee is really serious about its 4 to 6-1/2 percent long- run range, it must start moving down from the very high level of M1 growth that has been in effect   Inflation is obviously unsatisfactory--both the present and prospective rates--and I think there are  some excess demands both internally and for foreign goods, which can be moderated by monetary  policy actions       What does that mean, Chuck?  You move to 7-7/8 immediately?       Chuck, I think I could buy your formulation if we took the ranges down  to around 4 to 8       [Unintelligible]        But an effort to hold it down to 7-3/4 would be difficult        Mr Chairman, I wonder if I might suggest something  I suggest that we  formulate instructions to the Desk to resist 8 percent until the end of this week and early next week  and then, checking the aggregates, move gradually on up  If it moves to 8, accept it but choose  between 7-3/4 and 8       Let it bounce a bit         4 to 8 and 5 or 6 to 10       I don’t believe I could accept that high a range  I think that’s too much   If we are really headed to try to restrain this, we should not be accepting a 5 to 9 range     7/18/78              47       Cap it at 8       I’d put the cap at 8-1/4 with a consultation at 8       Not necessarily, if we’re talking about 7-3/4 being [unintelligible] too       May I get a clarification of the understanding?       I really wanted a clarification that if the M1 and M2 figures came in  strong and you moved up to 8 and they still came in strong we would have another consultation       It is a discrete tap       Mr Chairman, I think we ought to go ahead with the New York lease  line arrangement and work toward the idea of additional hookups and the security device    "
813,1978-08-15,"  One question, Mr Chairman  Scott, to what extent do you ascribe  some of the dollar's difficulties to the effort we've made to repay German debt?       What has the market done this morning?       So moved       Could I follow that with one question in the same area?  Jerry, what's  your opinion regarding debt burdens as far as consumer spending?        Your banking contacts don't indicate deterioration?       Mr Chairman, when it comes to the figures that you asked for, I'm  talking in terms of real [growth] of about 32, an inflation rate between 8-1/4 and 8-3/4--probably  centered on the high side of that--and an unemployment rate of 6 percent  I think the slackening  that has occurred from the second quarter was expected and, to a considerable extent, desirable   Inflationary pressures to me are building faster, and the dollar depreciation of the past few weeks I  think is going to add a major fillip to that inflationary problem  The wage problem into ’79 I view  as being pretty close to your crisis [situation] here  If we do get the kind of price inflation that I'm  looking for--not with any anticipation but looking at--I think we're going to get wage requests  certainly up at the coal settlement level  And I think this will [lead to] a number of strikes and  interruptions and I caveat my real growth projection on the basis of that  That is, if we do get  major strikes, we could have a negative real growth rate       I thought it was interesting, Mr Chairman, that I didn't hear anybody  talking about the unemployment rate varying any more than 5-3/4 percent to 6-1/2 percent--a very  narrow range       Mr Chairman, I came prepared to recommend almost exactly what  Paul Volcker said--a 4 to 8 percent range on M1 and 6 to 10 on M2  However, I did come prepared  to raise the federal funds rate range [to] 7-3/4 to 8-1/2, not 8-1/4  I think we need that margin up  there in the event these aggregates do start breaking out--to put a little more pressure on it  I'd  adopt a money market directive, which would mean that if they're moving toward that upper range  you'd start moving the rate  I would skew the midpoint to an 8 percent rate, thus moving to that 8  percent But I'm leaving myself a half point above that in the event we need it       Yes, a flat 8 percent midpoint; a 7-3/4 to 8-1/2 range       If I read the directive right--the way this is written on the back of page  13--you start moving the fed funds rate on a monetary aggregates approach [if growth is]  significantly above or below the midpoint and on a money market when it’s close to or beyond the  upper or lower limits So I'm talking really monetary aggregates       Sorry, I meant monetary aggregates  Sorry to have misspoken  I think  it's time we cut the availability of reserves  I'm not impressed that we're making much progress in  the availability; we're making some progress in terms of raising rates but I don't think that's doing  the job  Consequently, I'm toying with ideas of reducing the availability that are not under this  Committee's control but are matters which the Board might wish to consider at a later time       I believe you've got a majority of seven of the Committee members  who are saying either 8 or below as the peak for M1       You've got one, two at 3--       I have another question, too, Mr Chairman  Could we ask Steve?   There's a Treasury financing intervening here       In no event, later than next week       I think I’d put it in the earlier one       Mr Chairman, I have been on both sides of the fence  I think there  have been times when intervention has been desirable  If we're going into this we ought to go into  it in a major way; I would not want to go into this if we're going to fritter away a few hundred  million  I think we ought to embark on a program of this character with the Japanese expecting to  spend at least $4 billion       No  The Treasury and us       And the Japanese also  Though actually I think if we're going in with  the Japanese, in the sense of coming back from the other side, then my figure might be higher  But  I think we ought to at least be willing to commit $4 billion as far as the United States is concerned   I think the conditions that you’ve said you're looking for are largely long-range conditions and  we're looking at a short-range crisis problem  I can't expect that a change in their budget, for  example, would suddenly put the yen under pressure or reverse this package  So it seems to me  that if we're going into this, we need to go into it with a long-range expectation  I would add one  other condition to such intervention on our part--that the Treasury provide a takeout to the Federal  Reserve and conversion with long-range bonds if such swaps were outstanding more than six  months       I'm not saying do this tomorrow  But I think the Committee ought to  be prepared to commit that kind of money if it's going into this kind of deal       What is the rate now--3 or 4 percent?        No  I meant in terms of conversion of the swap line into long-term  bonds       But if we do that, Paul, then we have not solved the problem  Things  continue, and we exacerbate it by--       Well,--       They did a long-term denominated D-mark bond before       For one thing you continue to keep those dollars off the market  If you  dump this back on the Japanese central bank, you know perfectly well they're going to take those  reserves and put them out into the market again, as they've been doing with their own reserves       I would consider myself in that group if we were not going into full- scale intervention       Good luck    "
839,1978-09-19,"  Mr Chairman, I don't have any problems with the staff forecast in the   aggregate  I don't happen to agree with the pattern they're showing  I think they're overly  optimistic on the degree of impact of the tax cut in the first quarter  I think we're likely to have  more inflation than the staff shows and probably a little less GNP in terms of real growth  But my  differences are in terms of a half percent--not terribly off from the basic pattern in terms of the  total      I am a little curious, Jim, about your description of the employment as slowing  July and   August I always thought were slow months anyway and I don't really see anything there      Also, I'm a little curious about your description of industrial   production slowing when we're still getting more than 1/2 percent a month, having come off  [unintelligible]  I thought it was doing very well  The consumer goods weakening I thought was  something that needed to come along, and if we're going to maintain 1/2 percent growth with that  kind of weakening then [something] else has to be strengthening  So I'm a little curious about your  description but your net result is pretty close to mine       9/19/78            12      Well, only that I hope it does not encourage the Desk to do more in the   way of increased activity in the market      I don't think they have      Mr Chairman, I approached this on the basis that we have not yet   obtained the credit restraint necessary to slow inflation  The inflation [expected] even by the most       9/19/78            23  optimistic of those I have heard around the table is by my standard excessive  I don't believe we  can permit the aggregates to continue to grow at this pace we have seen, and I still think policy has  a contribution to make to slow them down and to slow the expectations of higher inflation  The  international value of the dollar to me is a symptom  But I would point out, as the rest of the Board  knows, that I've been traveling in Latin America in the last month or so, and I am disturbed about  what I have heard in terms of the compositional changes in their reserve assets--shifting out of  dollars  Some of this, of course, is expected as this [situation] moves ahead      As far as the specification of policy, I too am unwilling to go as high as alternative B on the   top side; the bottom side doesn't bother me a whole lot  I would like to have a couple of months of  weak aggregates figures  So if we are looking just at the M1 and M2 specifications, my preference  would be ranges of 5 to 9 and 6 to 10 or 10-1/2  On the federal funds rate, I would like to see us  move 1/2 percentage point, to 8-1/2, promptly and I'd bracket that  I don't care whether we put [the  top] at 8-3/4 or 9  I would like some running room if this is going to be restrained  The way I put it  down for M1 and M2, maybe we ought to have a re-consultation as we did this past month   Frankly, I'm not terribly enamored with all these M1 and M2 figures  I'd much rather look at what  we can achieve and I think the interest rates are not yet slowing the demand [to the extent]  necessary to constrain the inflation        On the top side or the bottom side?      5 to 9      Try 5 to 9      Why not split the difference here and make it 5 to 9 on M1 and 6-1/2   to 10-1/2 on M2?   "
864,1978-10-17,"  Scott, what is the market telling you that it thinks we ought to do about  this?       I wonder if the Manager has a recommendation concerning the volume  of operations  It seems to me that the last time we raised the limit on operations  Do you want a  continuation of that increase?       Yes, I'm talking domestic       How much leeway do you have?       Mr Chairman, I think I'd agree with a lot of what I have heard around  this table--much of what Henry, Philip, Chuck, and Nancy said  I do have the same relative  position that we have seen some improvement in the economy this past month  In a kind of  fundamental sense, it is getting a bit better  I don't find any evidence in what I read of an improved  inflation rate, and the inflationary forecast of the staff is just unacceptable to me  I just can't agree       10/17/78 19             with the idea of a future that holds a 7 to 9 percent--and maybe even Henry's 10 percent--inflation  rate      So I guess I get mixed up between what should be the forecast and what I think we ought to  do to alter that forecast  I don't accept the idea of the staff's fundamental assumption that interest  rates will remain at the low end of the ranges of alternative B  If that's the way we are going to  play the game, we end up with an inflation rate that's unacceptable  Given this assumption of the  staff, I’m not far off [from their projection]  I just don't think it's going to yield an acceptable  policy for the future economic growth of this country        Well, I like some of the things that Philip is trying to aim toward but I  question whether this is the time to do it  I really don't know that ATS is going to do all that much  violence to us over the next two or three months  I think there’s a lethargy to this but I don't know   Consequently, it would be my suggestion to the Committee that we set our M1, M2, and M3  ranges as if there were no ATS and put a couple of memo items at the bottom of the page saying  here's an M1+ and here's an M1 with ATS which could be referenced if things really changed in a  major way  It would seem to me we're getting into a question of policy versus procedure  And I'd  rather keep the policy separate       I don't think we ought to put it as “the associated range”  The way  that's written is that the following are our targets and these would be compatible with those targets   We don't know whether M1+ is compatible       No  I kind of like it both ways, M1 and M2 with [and without] ATS       I'd like an M1 with no ATS in there, too       Well, I’m asking  Can we live with the 2 to 6 percent?  I have no  problem with it  Then the question is  Do you also have M1 if there's no ATS?       What [if there are] no shifts of any substance over the next quarter?         10/17/78 42                Mr Chairman, I would get rid of M1 in this particular item and move to  the money market directive  I think M2, contrary to what Steve says, ought to be our principal  focus right now  It does have a heavy share of M1 in it anyway  And I agree with Paul that we  ought to be watching with a great deal of care and maybe giving the Manager a bit more latitude  I  would not want to see us today move to a 9-1/2 percent funds rate without some considerable  discussion  My preference would be a range of 8-3/4 to 9-1/4 percent, centering on 9 and moving  to 9 promptly        I didn't say, Mr Chairman; I would prefer M2 at 5 to 9       We were already there       I think this matter has considerable danger to us, Mr Chairman   Anyway, we don't have to decide [today]  We'd better take a look at what that program is and if it's  going to be desirable for us to speak out, then we ought to do it    "
890,1978-11-21,"  Jim, you're grounding this all on the current level of restraint in terms  of interest rates?       But you are not talking about additional restraint       Or higher rates of interest than we now have     11/21/78              9       Well, 12 basis points; you can't be that [fine-tuned]       I think the forecast is excessively pessimistic under these conditions       Well, I'm tempted to go into a long discussion, Mr Chairman, but let  me just say--       --29, 77, and 60       Absolutely fine-tuned       You see, I knew Henry was going to give that speech for me, so I  didn't have to talk       What are your figures?       I'll [wait] my turn, Mr Chairman       Mr Chairman the figures you gave are not far from the ones I came  out with  I think we have a rather wide diversity of opinion here  I don't see a recession  immediately and I think there is too much inflation involved, so I would put a cap on M1--cap it at  5 percent--put a range of 6 to 9-1/2 on M2, and 2 to 6 on M1+ as a memo item as you have  suggested  On the federal funds rate I guess I find myself at a halfway house here  I think 9-5/8 to  10-1/8 would be where I would [put the range], looking at a 9-7/8 percent midpoint, which does  take us up a shade but it certainly slows the rate of increase     11/21/78              24       Mr Chairman, I am bothered a little bit about a freeze at 9-3/4       I'm worried about both the down side and the up side  I’d rather, if we  could, buy a 9-7/8 midpoint as the midpoint shown on that range you picked  Actually, I think the  range is terribly narrow; 1/4 percentage point gives the Manager very little leeway       If you really want to nail it, then I would rather nail it at 9-7/8 than  9-3/4       It is, but it's a small point on the other side too, Chuck       That's right       Can we buy my try at it, Mr Chairman?  Leave everything the same  but put the midpoint at 9-7/8       Come on, Mark     11/21/78              30       We've got a little bit more       Which we don't know       We did take the money market directive, didn't we?       That’s what you say--stabilizing the exchange value  You can stabilize  both ways, Paul       Why don't we just say “support” the value of the dollar?   It might get  you away from this “stabilization”        No, I don't want to go toward that       I'd buy Paul's wording, with the word “support” instead of “stabilize”       Strengthening instead of supporting it       Really “supporting” is a better word, isn't it?       Mr Chairman, do we have a schedule for 1979?       Do you have enough information yet, Chuck, if we bought your  proposal, to name the date for February?       We really ought to know that     "
913,1978-12-19,"  Just to clarify that last comment, that’s all       Peter, were the losses you’re talking about concentrated in a few firms  or is there a wide dispersion between profit and loss?       12/19/78          5       But there is still interest in becoming a dealer bank?             What part of Las Vegas did you come from?       Sounds like a good explanation until you start adding in the future  figures of the home builders and other mortgage groups that are making commitments at a faster--       Well, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we have not made enough  headway toward slowing this economy down  I am very sorry to see the large increase in real  GNP That sounds cruel to say, but accompanied with that is a major increase in inflation and  another further jump of 07 percent even on the average wages  I can’t in good conscience look  forward to that kind of package for 1979, where we are looking at a minimum of 8 percent  And if  this has to be restructured in the latter part of the year, I suspect it would be even higher      If the Committee decides to buy the idea of skipping the January meeting, then I think we  need greater leeway and more flexibility to meet the shifts in January and I will address that  problem later on  A basic problem to me is that inflation is not showing any slack in it whatsoever  that I can see  The aggregates to me are totally unreliable  We haven’t seen anything that would  educate me that the staff or others who have been commenting even know which direction these  things are going to move over the next few months  The ATS may have been a complicating  factor; it may be something else  So I am giving my attention primarily to market conditions, loan  demand, and the strength of the economy  Now on all three counts, it seems to me that we are  burgeoning fast and I am very sorry we didn’t catch some more of it before we hit this quarter   Consequently, in my view the staff estimate, while still credible in the sense of the GNP, I think is     12/19/78          10    unsatisfactory totally in terms of the rate of inflation and I would apply considerably more restraint          Mr Chairman, I would prefer [on M1] a 1 to 6 range and the 4 to 8  range on M2  I’m willing to buy the fed funds rate but I’d like to throw in for Committee  consideration a slight amendment to it  I’d agree to the 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 range and the move to 10  but I’d like to see a little device we have [used]--not recently but a year or so ago--called a zone of  indifference to permit the Desk to play it in the 10 to 10-1/8 range without kicking back much   This I think provides a little more flexibility for the Manager and at the same time it does give a  picture of slightly greater restraint in the initial move  The 10 to 10-1/8 would be a kind of zone of  indifference in which the Manager could play         Right, and he hits 10-1/8 and he errs on the side of ease  It allows a  little more flexibility than this business of naming a single rate  I think we have been caught on  that too much  It also provides a little bit of lack of knowledge to the market; maybe they won’t  nail it quite so tight  I guess with those changes, I’d be willing to [go] with it        All right, I don’t buy it if that’s the way you want to interpret this  I  was trying to see areas in which I could move and still--        Well, 1 percentage point on one end of M1, and 1 point on each end of  M2        No, you can’t do that       Mr Chairman, I think it’s not [a good idea] to eliminate the [limit on  the] aggregate open position  (A) I don’t think it’s desirable from a public relations standpoint; and  (B) I don’t think it’s desirable from the Committee’s standpoint        I favor the $8 billion        I would subscribe to Henry’s view in a way; I think we ought to have a  look down the road  I agree with you, however, that there’s no way we can’t support this in this  initial phase  But I think we ought to look at the longer-range implications of this and who is going  to hold the funds and what financing is done  So I’d like to go ahead and raise our warehousing  limit  If it takes $5 billion, that’s all right with me  But I do think the study needs to be made        It does have the advantage of bringing it back to our attention in six  months          Well, it’s housekeeping only if we don’t make a decision to change the  direction in terms of ownership        No, I’m not saying that  If we decided as a result of a long-range study  that we are going to hold these ourselves, not Treasury, it will matter  We’d have the flexibility in  six months        Well, we have swaps      12/19/78          38          Oh, I’ll join        Is there a different interpretation?  I’m asking for sheer knowledge,  because I’ve not had a chance, as you know, to even look at this with any care        I didn’t get a copy until Monday, Larry, so--        That’s because I was too close  You have in effect said, I think, that  the law says we must do it for the calendar year  My question is  Does that mean a different  interpretation [is possible]?  Say you do this in February; does that mean that calendar year or does  the law say that the July meeting has to look at the next calendar year?        It does require both in the law        What were you talking about?  Who were you trying to sell?  I haven’t  gotten caught up with this        One final question on the first point, Chuck  You have used the word  “targets”  Is this advisedly [or] required in the law?       Yes, rather than “guidelines” or “ranges”        The word “targets” is used in your next to last line on the first page        I was just hoping we’d stay away from that word        In the past, we’ve tried to stay away from the word target, if possible   [I’d start that sentence with] “These ranges or guides should…”  It’s semantics, I know        May I speak to that?  I’m not speaking with any great knowledge  because, again, I haven’t thought this out  But I’m wondering, Chuck, in terms of the midyear  report where you’ve gone through half of the year and know what that average has been, at least in  preliminary terms, and you have the remainder of that year to forecast  You’re coming back, in  your terms, to a quarterly average of the fourth quarter of the prior year and the fourth quarter of  the year you are in  I wonder if, in the July reporting period, it doesn’t give a little better picture of  the year in which you’re doing this to have an average over the whole year        I was trying to think of your comment in relation to the GNP number   If you use the GNP number, [after] the first [half] of the year, you know what your first half GNP  has been  I guess forecaster minds work differently, but it seems to me that after I get past the first  half I have some idea what that first half has accomplished already and then I look at the second  half and add to it  And it’s a cumulative figure moving ahead       12/19/78          44        Jim, what do you use in the Greenbook?        And this Bluebook change figure, you use fourth quarter-to-fourth  quarter rather than the average?         Chuck, is your base drift on this question?         No base drift in July against our February?       12/19/78          47        [Unintelligible]         Can we have the happy medium of fourth-to-fourth on the February  and July and an average in July also?  Or would that be a problem?        Mr Chairman, I think the arrangement the committee has suggested  would be worthwhile  I would suggest, as we’ve already heard in today’s discussion, that we opt  for telephone updates in the January and [June] periods        I think Willis has a good point  I hope we don’t advertise that we are  skipping--        May I ask a question before you take the vote, Mr Chairman?  May I  ask what in your view, Chuck, Humphrey-Hawkins actually does require?  You started out your  comment that the new law “does not require” and Larry started his with the spirit of the new law  “clearly requires”  Maybe you could say literally that yours is correct and his is, too, if the  difference is that he’s looking at the spirit and you are looking at the literal parts of the law        Is this required?  Do we have to have this one way or the other on this  matter?        I understand that        I’m certainly not prepared to vote for a fixed rule, but I’m not sure I’m  prepared to vote for the other one either        I would like to dissent on number 6, Mr Chairman      12/19/78          64          I’m not prepared to vote on that matter yet      "
938,1979-02-06," Mr Chairman, I think we ought to keep the  [intermeeting leeway] at $5 billion if there is a substantial  possibility that--    I know I‘m saying that we ought to keep it  at the $5 billion [we authorized for this past intermeeting period1  because I think there is a possibility that we may get a very sharp  movement in float, especially if the weather happens to clear up, and  the Desk will need to do some rather sizable offsetting purchases     2 / 6 / 1 9  -4-   And, anyway, this is a 6-week intermeeting period So I would suggest  we keep it at $5 billion    Set it at $5 billion    That's what we've been doing    But the Federal Reserve--    The Federal Reserve grants the credit    They do that   M R   PARTEE They certainly don't give me credit!    Mr Chairman, I guess I have a bit of a biased  view of the world at the moment    Which is an increase    The prior M1 range was 4-1/2 to 6 percent    What these numbers say is that we can go as  low as 1-1/2 percent and as high as 9-1/2 percent and still be within  the range    No, we won't publish it, but if we add the 3  percent plus the 2 percent shift, that gets it to 9-1/2 percent    If we don't get either one of those it could  go to 1-1/2 percent, so I say the range is 1-1/2--    Yes    I'd tell them it's unrealistic even to try    I don’t want to look even-handed    I would revise it upward, Mr Chairman I  would go with 10 to 10-1/4 percent as a range for the federal funds  rate in the coming months primarily because I think now is the time we  run the greatest danger of an additional inflationary problem Down  the road we may have some chance to reduce [the funds rate range]    Too high    3 to 8 and 4 to 8 percent    Good    How would you like 9-7/8 to 10-3/8 percent?    9-7/8 to 10-3/8 percent--1/8th on either side  to play with--    But he has 5 to 9 instead of 4 to 8 percent  [for M21    On MI    Well, Mr Chairman, I'd be satisfied as long  as we don't get beyond the debt we now owe in any single currency    Well, we're buying right now    I meant in terms of the $500 million  cumulatively   M R   WALLICH You mean overall total debt equal to total  balances We have a large D-mark debt and we have yen balances The  $500 million will be much smaller than the D-mark debt    Well, that would be true for today, assuming  we come back to this subject  "
962,1979-03-20," I second    Mr Chairman, I’ve listened to a lot of wisdom  around this table and--    Yes, a good share of what has been said on  both sides I thought after the first two speakers that we had a very  well defined two-camp arrangement The subsequent speakers have  blurred it somewhat I look at this by trying to nail down, at least  in my mind, a couple of points First looking at the economy, I  think we do have [some strength] in labor markets, new orders, capital  spending, business inventories, and loans There is perhaps some  weakness showing up in personal income--although I‘m not quite ready  to concede that--and in housing and industrial production But the  primary weakness in this economy right now is that it’s [experiencing]  an inflationary surge and there’s concern about oil prices and  uncertainty on the international political scene My interpretation  of all this leads me to feel that we are near capacity in effective  labor and in several industries, so I don’t really expect industrial  production to be able to grow very fast unless we find some way to  push a magic button and improve our productivity On inflation, I  think the surge is in food, raw materials, and energy I give very  little [weight] to the aggregates these days because they are totally  confusing; I think we’re utilizing some stock we built up in the  latter part of last year Whether they will take off under the new  set of rules I don’t know From a policy standpoint, I think we have  to balance some of the risks Are we willing to risk a further surge  in inflation, carrying it up beyond the 10 percent the Commerce  Department is talking about in the first quarter and perhaps even up  to a figure in the 15 percent area? I would view that [development]  as perhaps one of the most debilitating to our entire economy of  anything [that could happen] The other risk, of course, is a  potential recession And the balancing of these risks is what I think  the Open Market Committee’s decision is all about today    I did not, Mr Chairman I‘ll wait until  after the [break]    Mr Chairman, I would prefer to do some of  what Bob is suggesting, but with a tilt to it I took your  specifications to a degree for M1, 4 to 8 percent; for M2, 3 to 7  percent; and for federal funds, 10 to 10-1/2 percent, with a midpoint  of 10-1/4 percent A zone to play with between 10-1/8 and 10-3/8  percent will enable the Desk to move around a bit And if the  aggregates come in extremely weak again, I would expect consultation  by the Committee    There was variation on the bottom, though    No, I think the ceiling on the funds rate is  too low    And a money market directive?    May I raise a question, Mr Chairman?    In view of the rising volume in the lending  area it seems to me that we ought to be raising our interest rates on  this, perhaps to a 2 to 10 percent range instead of the current range    My only point is that we are starting to  see an enlargement of this and I would raise questions as to the  desirability of our providing more and more [of these securities  loans] I think we can provide a little more disincentive to borrow  by raising that rate slightly Two percent is not a large change   M R   WALLICH I'd like to support this, because it seems to  me it would induce greater effort on the part of the market to find  collateral in advance and be prepared [to meet obligations] It would  also be helpful should the float become very large again, so we're not  a cheap lender of last resort anyway    But they do come and borrow The question is  the degree to which they push to try to cover [their shorts1 before  they come to us A little more price disincentive might--    I would like to have a little study done on  the question of what [a rate change] would perhaps do   M R   PARTEE Quantify the idea of raising the margin, and see  what the effect would be    We have reached the alternate procedural  1 imi t s- -    It's attachment A; that is the '""A"" [he's  referring to], Mr Chairman    That's not the question, though, Alan The  question is Is it the Manager's prerogative to carry this up to a  full $1 billion without consultation even with the Subcommittee?    The Chairman can act [for] the Subcommittee    I will not vote for the $1-1/2 billion    No  "
985,1979-04-17," Alan, what theory of intervention are you  working under now? Do you just buy back enough to pay off [foreign  currency debt], peg the rate, or bend with market forces? What sort  of strategy are you working under?    In the forecast of federal and state  expenditures, Jim, would you give me a little more explanation than I  have seen on the negatives and positives in the first and second  quarters? Are there some offsetting jumps of sizable magnitude?    Just looking at your pattern, you have a  positive on federal expenditures in the first quarter and a heavy  negative on state and local [spending] and the reverse of that in the  second quarter, with a heavy negative on the federal side and a pretty  heavy positive on [state and local] They just happen to cancel out    Mr Chairman, I see no reason to prolong what  you've heard from Paul Volcker and Henry Wallich I agree with their  positions I would point out to the Committee that we've had several  months now of status quo and in that several months we've had at least  a 3 percentage point increase in the inflation rate And I can see  some more if we don't act    MI Chairman, the view of the world that you  portrayed in your initial [comments] just doesn‘t happen to square  with my view of what monetary policy can do nor with my belief in the  desirability of public policy [moving] to restrain inflation So I  still would advocate that we put additional restraint in this package  I’d prefer ranges of 2 to 7 percent for M1 and 3 to 8 percent for M2,  and a federal funds intermeeting range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent    At 10-1/4 percent, the midpoint    Well, what I think is important to look at  here is the upper part of the M1 range Seven percent is the peak for  alternative B, and if we’re going to maintain a steady directive I     4/17/79 -32-   think we ought to keep some balance I lowered [the bottom of the M1  range] to 2 percent just to give a little balance, hut I’m willing to  go with a 3 to 7 percent range on M1    How about 3 to 7-1/2 percent on Ml?     4/11/19 ~ 3 3 -     No    No    Mr Chairman, I don't resist the idea of  building up a small kitty I do have some resistance to the idea of  an excessive amount in a single currency So I think we ought to  limit the amount in a single currency to a billion dollars, partly to  limit potential exchange losses and partly to avoid pressures in terms  of the currency status of some of these countries Also, we ought to  limit our holdings to major currencies I'm certain that the Desk  isn't going to play in or something like that, but I  think we ought to have that well understood I believe we need  political and Treasury clearance and I assume that that will be done  before we jump into any major stockpiling We ought to have a slow  rate of accumulation, assuming we don't have masses dumped on us,  Alan Then finally, I'm a little disturbed about what I hear in terms  of intervention policy [Under] the first of November ground rules,     4/11/79 -40-   we're going to try to resist further downward movement [in the  exchange rate of the dollar] Well, now we have upward movement  Theoretically, I guess that first of November policy was established  by somebody believing the dollar to be undervalued at that time I  don't know whether the dollar is valued correctly, overvalued, or  undervalued now But it seems to me that we ought to have some sort  of policy that permits some rate increases along with increases in  balances We do not attempt to peg or limit changes in exchange  rates Those are my comments, Mr Chairman    I was assuming we'd accumulate marks    Well, can't we work around that through BIS  and some other procedures to get hold of--    Well, I just think we have a possible exchange  loss and we would be putting on some reserve currency pressure and  ought to be very careful about that    With the intervention limits and limits per  currency  "
1008,1979-04-27," I am, Mr Chairman    I knew all of the background I didn’t miss much anyway I  have one comment As I understand it, Steve, you’re talking 175 percent M1 growth for April and  last year as I recall we knocked 6 percentage points off in our seasonal adjustment revision    So if this were last year we’d be looking at 23 percent    Either one is exceptionally high I must admit that this is  another April package but on general grounds, and more particularly the continuing high rate of     4/21/19 5   inflation, I would permit the directive to be exercised as it is written, raising the fed funds rate to  10-114 percent    Fine  "
1027,1979-05-22," Gretchen, what is the level of our yen balance  at the moment?    Are we participating in yen intervention?    Peter, in your visits with the dealers what is  your reading now of the dealer market?  about developments in the economy and market prospects?   Are they becoming pessimistic    I haven't looked over [the data] but have they  followed that questioning judgment in terms of their portfolios?    Have they been building their long positions?    Jim, I assume you saw that note sent to me  concerning the parallelism between 1973-74 and 1978-79 on retail sales  and real sales versus the peaks and troughs How do you interpret  that?     5/22/79 -8-    It was sent to me by one of the members of  Jim's staff in response to a question I asked at a Board meeting    On a real basis    One point that struck me was the percent of  real disposable income being devoted to energy and food The data  show a quantum jump in '73 and it looks as if we're getting another  one now, although the figures aren't complete nor are they [measured]  in precisely the same fashion    Mr Chairman, I am delighted to see the  slowing in the economy I've been hoping for it for a year I think  we're getting some reduction in the level of activity and I hope it  continues for a while longer I think we need to look at our basic  objectives here because we have a problem of whether we are aiming to  maintain a semblance of real growth or to contain inflation or a  combination thereof It seems to me that our current posture has some  elements of restraint but those elements of restraint are coming in  the housing field, largely in the usury ceilings and the thrift flows,  which of course are the traditional ways I think we run a risk on  two sides We run a risk of recession, of course, and we run a risk  of some acceleration in inflation The latter stems primarily from  what I'd call an energy tax, because we are being hit with a very  sizable tax thrown at us by energy costs I suspect we can weather  the food cost problem, especially to the extent that we can open up  our borders to further imports, if there is anything to bring in But  I don't think the energy cost impact is going to go away and it is  going to [spread] throughout our economy You may recall the last  time around that it took several months if not a year or more [for the  energy shock] to [exert] its full impact I suspect that the retail  sales picture is giving us the signal that things are being slowed by  energy costs and agricultural or food costs Frankly, I welcome the  slowdown I'd prefer it hadn't come from further energy cost  increases, but maybe over the long haul this will do us a favor and  force us into some actions we should have taken six or seven years  ago   A s  for our monetary policy posture, I still believe that  inflation will be our principal problem in the coming months and  years Whether we can achieve a reduction in inflation by a nice slow     5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -21-   pattern is something we have not yet proved I suspect it's going to  require more strenuous efforts than have been mounted so far    That's a possibility! I do want to understand  a little more [precisely], Steve, whether we're talking about the Desk  not moving until we reach the 5 percent or the 8 percent levels or  conversely the 0 or 4 percent levels That means we're using up the  entire range on the aggregates before there is any move off the 10-1/4  percent funds rate, which is the midpoint of the funds range you're  talking about    In other words, we hold the market steady  until we hit the outer bounds, whatever they may be    That's all I have I'd go with a money market  directive    I suspect you could do it by testing Committee  sentiment on the boundaries Take the boundaries on the top and  bottom 10 versus 9-3/4 percent; 0 versus 1 percent; and 5 versus 6  percent    About a 4 point zone of indifference    Yes    M r   Chairman, I'm agreeable to the Committee  approach [outlinedl in this memo I would be much less happy with the  Japanese approach because I'm not at all convinced that the Japanese  yen is undervalued and I'm not at all sure I want to jump into a joint  intervention for the purpose of improving the Japanese yen position    I'd be willing to go with the billion dollars  And I guess I could be talked into the half billion dollar limit on  individual currencies    NO  "
1049,1979-06-27," Well, Mr Chairman, I think you and Paul have [described] the  problem here--the rising inflation, the economic decline in prospect, the monetary aggregates  being somewhat unsettled on the high side at the moment after having been unsettled on the low  side, and the dollar problem I’ve asked myself what we can do that might be a reasonable thing  to do that would impact all of this and yet not damage our domestic situation I don’t find  anything in our kit of tools other than the intervention we’ve been using to do much about this  I’m a bit unhappy that we didn’t do more before but that’s water over the dam so there’s no point  in going over that The one thing I would like to see done is not in our kit of tools to do I would  very much like to see the President forward immediately a new gasoline rationing plan to the  Congress, and see it adopted and put into effect right away I think that would have a salutary  impact on our friends abroad who don’t think we’ve done anything to conserve gasoline; it might  also [reduce] some of the gasoline lines and related problems in this country But that isn’t  something we’re going to settle in Federal Open Market Committee meetings so it’s merely a  suggestion that maybe somebody could get done   As far as intervention is concerned, I am bothered a bit I don’t know what the staff‘s     6/21/19 4   prognosis is for the dollar, but if it were to continue weak or if we were to get back into the kind  of situation we had in late October of last year, we could spend a whole lot of money on  intervention And we might spend our entire kitty I suspect, like it or not, that that kind of crisis  would call for some action [by us] so maybe we ought to be developing some contingency plans  in the event this [situation] does turn bad on us   CHARMAN MILLER Thank you, Phil Monroe Kimbrel  "
1070,1979-07-11," Scott, you said in your comments that this  lays to rest the policy of the Bundesbank Without debating that  question, do you have a sense of the Bundesbank position? Would they  be willing to let the dollar rate go below 180?    Peter, as you've worked through this period  and the seeming expectational swing of bringing rates down in the  short area but up in the mortgage area, have you found any kind of  fundamental thrust in this package? Or is this just sheer reaction on  day-to-day operations?   M R   STERNLIGHT Well, the downward movement was more than in  just the short-term area If anything it seemed to me the mortgage  area was rather an exception in moving up a little further We had  rate declines in the long-term sector as well as in the short-term I  think it was more than just a day-to-day phenomenon There was a  feeling that the economy is likely to be weakening and that at some  point the [long] rates are likely to be lower, although I would not  say that there was an expectation of an imminent easing throughout  [the yield curve]--just in terms of, say, the fed funds rate   happened to have securities to sell at a higher price   It was just a happy coincidence that they    Is this true of all the dealers?    Mr Chairman, maybe I’ll just skip [some of my  questions in light of] the responses Jim has been giving The one  fundamental question I have on my mind was raised by the Board’s staff  in the [pre-I FOMC briefing yesterday and that is Do we fund the  price increases of OPEC?    Yes do we provide the financing to meet them?    Well, it’s a bit difficult for me to accept  that on face value, given the rate of change in M1 in the first  quarter of the year versus the rate of change in M1 now and the  changes in the OPEC and [other] price structures that have been  developing over the first half of this year    Steve or Jim, do you happen to have the 1973  and 1974 figures that would [compare with] those in the bottom part of  this table for Ml and bank credit?    Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with much of what  Henry said There are a couple of outside points I would like to  make Much of the discussion here has been about exogenous factors,  outside influences I still think our fundamental policy response is  responsible for some of this inflation and I wish we had been tighter  A policy response now to fund some of the OPEC move I think would be a  mistake; I'd prefer not to fund as much In regard to Jim's comment  about inventory, I think what is going on is an inventory of labor--  not the normal [concept of] inventory, but an inventory of people     1/11/79 -17-   The sense I get out of this forecast is almost a sense of  hopelessness There's nothing anybody can do We have a high rate  of inflation, a rising rate of unemployment, and a low rate of growth  And you tell me that you want to hold this for three to five years I  don't think that's politically [feasible] I strongly doubt that this  country is willing to stand still for five years, much less a year  So I guess my answer, Mr Chairman, is that it may take some more  difficult medicine than what we have on the horizon right now  Whether this body wishes to contribute its share of that castor oil or  leave that to the political side of life, I don't know I wish we  knew what the President will be coming out with in his proposals; I  think those might have an important bearing    If he wants to play the game that way then I'm  perfectly willing to step up to the policy [plate] and say that it's  time for us to quit--not validate these things My preferences for  the '79 long-term growth ranges would be 3 to 5 percent on M1 and 5 to  7 percent on M2 I would hold bank credit down I think it may slow  but I don't have any confidence that it is going to slow at all On  1980 there is a possibility we could edge [the ranges] down and I  would prefer to go another step further, perhaps to 2-1/2 to 5 percent  [on Ml], leaving the possibility of a lower range of growth I admit  this is likely to exacerbate some of the recessionary tendencies in  the economy [but] I'm not yet convinced that we're heading toward the  doom and gloom that some people are portraying    I didn't specify    Mr Chairman, it seems to me that given the  uncertainties--the idea that we started out with a 3 percent  adjustment earlier this year and it's now down to 1-1/2 percent-- I  don't know what the staff was actually forecasting--    Maybe It may be back up to 5 percent I  don't know which way this [adjustment] could turn    That's why I wonder if it isn't possible just  to use 1-1/2 to 4-l/2 percent and then in parenthesis say ""adjusted  for ATS  ""    Whatever it may be    My point is that we end up leaving the figures  the same, but with a parenthetical adjustment    I don't believe the figures anyway The  figures are going to jump around and ATS account adjustments are going  to jump around    Well, the band is wide enough to encompass  almost anything we can do    We'd be better off just to stay where we are    Verbalize steadying the boat    Henry said a good share of what I was going to  say, so I won't pursue it I wouldn't put the words quite the way he  did, in an ""overriding"" sense, although I think the dollar  depreciation risk is a high one in any policy that portrays any  picture of ease Curiously enough, we came out precisely the same on  the fed funds range, 10 to 10-3/4 percent We're at 10-1/4 percent  now, so it would be asymmetrical on the bottom side I really don't  see much need for [a range] As far as I am concerned, it's 10-1/4  percent unless something overriding develops either to force it on the  up side or on the low side I'd almost just as soon say 10-1/4  percent    I took all of alternative 111, Mr Chairman    Money market    No    Well, I have some of the reservations Henry  does I see it not costing us anything to add more onto their swap  line And if this were a crucial position of the State Department and  foreign policy--that we add to the Mexican swap line--1 guess I'd  swallow and do it just because it doesn't cost me anything at the  moment But I think there is a politicizing of this swap line  arrangement that we have fought, especially with such countries as   wanted a swap line because they wanted  to be a part of the club Mexico now wants to be a part of a bigger  club So I guess I'd have to say that if we are going to do this, we  do it only as a political reason    We've had a Venezuelan request too, as I  recall    Is there a possibility, Mr Chairman, of  saying to the Mexicans that we will consider this at the year-end  renewal of these lines and in the meantime do some checking around in  this government to find out if this is an important element--   CHAIIUmN MILLER Ted?    You triggered one other thing I meant to ask,  Ted What is the Treasury line now?   M R   TRUMAN It’s $ 3 0 0  million though only half of it is  drawable [under normal circumstances]    It might be logical for both of us [to act1 or  for Treasury by itself--    The reason I‘m pushing a bit on this, Mr  Chairman, is that we had a discussion with   We sent him over to the Treasury  Department saying that it‘s their job if they want to make loans for  political purposes He was pleading his [case] on the basis that we  had led him and his poor country into a democratic election and that  was upsetting all of the financial--    we, the United States government    A n  overriding political reason    The bottom line, M r   Chairman, is that I think  I'd insist on the Treasury joining us  "
1094,1979-07-17," Gretchen, is there any marked change in the Bundesbank's position as far as intervention is concerned? Are they moving aggressively in this market?   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we have not yet fully evaluated what the market trend is going to be I think we are getting hit with some reactions here I'm not yet willing to buy it as having a snowball effect that forces action but I do think we are going to have to    7/17/79  watch it with intense care And if by the end of this week we see any snowballing of this [development], then I think we will have to consider monetary action and my preference there would be a prompt discount rate increase   Do you want to take a vote?   No, I'm just talking about the intermeeting limit    7/17/79   I don't care I think we don't have to do this "
1114,1979-07-19," Mr Chairman, as far as the Open Market Committee's action, which is all I would like to comment on at the moment, I would prefer that we move [in conformance] with the current directive I'd reaffirm that directive and then have the Board take a look at a discount action as [the requests] come in tomorrow   Well, I think we really need [a discussion among the] Board members of whether the Board itself wishes to approve any kind of discount rate action If it does, then I'd try to seek a broader action rather than just [act on the pending request of] one Bank   Mr Chairman, may I suggest that after we finish our FOMC discussion you call in and we could hold a brief Board meeting?   We could talk about it then   That's right   There is one other point, Mr Chairman Before--   That was the reason we wanted to discuss it, Ernie   Yes, I agree   Mr Chairman, this is Phil Coldwell I'd like to suggest one thing Perhaps the FOMC might wish to look at lifting the ceiling on its fed funds range to allow the rate to go to 10-3/4 percent in the event things turn even more difficult    7/19/79   Well, I don't think we have to have a vote to change it if we just have an understanding of some leeway above the 10-1/2 percent if it became necessary for international purposes   I was trying to avoid a vote but if you wish to take a vote on it, I would make the motion that we do so   Yes, 10-3/4 percent   Yes   Well, my reason for this, Mr Chairman, ultimately [relates to] what we do with the discount rate If it were the sentiment of the full Board to go more than one half percentage  -9-    7/19/79  point on the discount rate, then we're stuck with a fed funds rate below or equal to it I just was trying to give us a little flexibility in the event the Board decided on a discount rate change of larger than a half point   Well, I sponsored the motion, Mr Chairman, and if there is a strong feeling of reservation on your part I'll withdraw the motion I just thought it gave us a bit more flexibility rather than being at the ceiling [of the funds range] so early in the intermeeting period   Well, I'll withdraw the motion, Mr Chairman   Yes   No "
1136,1979-08-14," Well, my impression of this examination, Mr Chairman, was that the books balance and that all the tests they've made indicate that the books are being kept in adequate fashion   It was a random sample, I trust?   I have no problems with this I move we approve it  SPEAKER(?) Second   Scott, what is your reaction to this discussion that seems to be going on in a number of quarters about a competitive interest rate ""war"" between various countries in the world, including the United States?   Well, I wasn't implying criticism I was just questioning the market reaction to this type of--   Scott, has the market changed its attitude at all about intervention?   My impression though is that they're not willing to challenge us--   --on the total of intervention In other words, they're not willing to push us into saying okay we'll put $10 billion into this package   Mr Chairman, I've done quite a bit of thinking about this since we had a discussion on this the last time At that time I took a position that it was a costless operation in the sense of just raising the swap line, but since then I've had some second thoughts Yes, it's costless in the sense that we could raise the level of the swap, but it's not costless in a precedential sense   Paul, could I ask one more question? I'm a little bothered, Scott, about the last sentence in your memo That sentence indicates that the State Department and Treasury officials involved in the discussions expressed the view that while they would not urge the Federal Reserve to agree to the increase for the sake of furthering such action by the System, on balance it would be helpful Does that capture the flavor of your discussions--that they really don't see this as something that is of any urgency?   But there's no urgency?   Would we gain or loose anything of substance by having the Treasury provide a statement of support?   Yes, that's why I asked do we gain or lose   If this discussion got out, I suspect we'd get applications from such countries as   Well, [because] of the publicity, I think it would be preferable not to have a split vote on this, so I would vote for it, too  -12-    8/14/79   Peter, what is the dealers' inventory position now?   I didn't mean a particular date, Peter; I meant a time frame of, say, over the last 3 or 4 weeks Have they been holding about a plus or an even position?   You see no discernable change in their attitude toward keeping either a balanced or a short position?   Jerry, could we probe just a minute? In your comment on the unemployment rate, I heard you say that you are forecasting a loss of jobs in the industrial sector What do you have in the way of advance indicators of employment changes so you could say to us, for example, that the demographics are there to provide X amount of new labor force? [Are there other indicators such as] the loss of help wanted ads in the newspapers, the changes that you see developing in the automobile industry or whatever else to give you some leg up on what the unemployment rate is likely to be over the coming quarter?  -15-    8/14/79   You do have some [accession] rate figures?   On the question of the participation of women, isn't it possible that we may get a more comparable reaction [to that of] men now that the level of participation is [sharply] higher   Well, that we won't have this division [unintelligible] further increases in participation rates at the time when labor demands weaken   [You have] looked over this range of information, which you obviously thought greatly about And yet in each of the last 3 months I think you have expressed some surprise    8/14/79  that the unemployment rate has not started to move up Do you now view that as an immediate possibility?   Unless [employers] thought they were going to need that labor in the near term   Mr Chairman, the situation as I view it has a couple of interesting quirks As you recall, last fall we talked about the real economy expanding while the monetary economy held quiet We are now looking at a monetary expansion with a presumption that the real economy is flat I didn't believe the one last fall, and I don't believe the one now I think we have either a stock adjustment problem going on or a flow problem At any rate, I think we are caught in a vicious circle We start with an inflation rate base of whatever you want to call it--say, 7, 8, 9, or 10 percent From that comes encouragement for higher oil prices and higher wages; we get lower productivity, we get higher costs, the dollar depreciates, and then we get higher inflation We have got to break out of this circle, and breaking out of it I think means we have to refuse to validate some of these higher costs and prices It's going to be an expensive process for us; it's going to be a traumatic process for some of our people But I think the threat of an intensification of recession, while a cautionary flag, still is not  -27-    8/14/79  balanced against the costs of inflation, which are now in the double- digit range and have been there for some time The costs even if we just take it against GNP are obviously over $200 billion a year  We've got to get out of this box I don't think we are going to break out of it today or tomorrow, but we are going to have to break out of it somehow or we will just continue to have a higher and higher inflation and a constant recurrence of international crises The downside risks are there, certainly But there's a certainty to the upside risks, too, in terms of inflation I haven't had much confidence in these aggregates figures for almost 10 years now I certainly have not seen anything to improve my confidence in them The impact on the dollar has come to be a new element in this package and I think in the long run it means that we have to pay attention to our international position, perhaps a little more so than we have done in the past  All of this says to me that we still have a role to play Monetary policy can't do it all but its role at the moment is to fight inflation I would hope that the Committee would also look at the long-range strategy of how we are going to get out of this box that I have tried to portray for you We need to try to look at the possibilities of getting more certain figures on our money supply, [perhaps by] getting greater reserve coverage throughout the whole range of financial institutions and maybe even some nonfinancial ones also We must try to get ourselves equipped so we can know precisely what we are creating and be able to limit that creation of credit when we think it is necessary to dampen inflation   Mr Chairman, I did not express myself on the aggregates or the range for the federal funds rate I thought we were talking principle more than anything else on the first go-around I would like to view this as kind of a 3-stage process that we would lead with a small increase in the federal funds rate, move with the discount rate, and then appraise whether the federal funds rate needs to be moved after that I'd like to see a strong policy statement drafted at the time of the discount rate action And while you haven't asked for [our comments on] this, I'm going to throw it in anyway I'd like to see us increase our intervention in the international field, with the idea of strengthening the dollar or giving it some upward push at the moment I'm afraid we have downward pushes headed at us down the road and if we've got any stability, I'd like to get a little money in the bank to work with  Now beyond that, on the funds rate and so forth, I'm not a fan of these ranges Nevertheless, I have to work within what the Committee is paying attention to, so I'm going to specify the ranges I think would be appropriate Those ranges would be 4 to 7 percent for M1; 7 to 11 percent for M2; and a funds range of 10-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent, with the understanding that we do not exceed 11-1/4 percent without consultation but move promptly to an 11 percent rate  -39-    8/14/79   From my perspective, Mr Chairman, it's most important that we move to 11 percent promptly I don't think 10-7/8 does us any good because we're in effect already there I am bothered by the [monetary growth] ranges having a level as high as 8 percent or even 7-1/2 percent, but I can buy that with a money market directive, which gives us some movement if [the aggregates] come in at the upper end of the ranges It seems to me, then, that if we want the 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent [funds range], that just gives us a 1/4 point to work in, which bothers me a little But the telephone is always there and we can call a meeting and raise it if we have to   The only way I can see that you really might separate this as to what we're looking for is 10-7/8 to 11-3/8 percent on the federal funds range with a money market directive   I'd like to charge because it's a substitution for direct borrowing "
1165,1979-09-18," Well, on the last point, I think it's  ridiculous Can't we at least get some action [by] the responsible  part of Congress to quit this nonsense?    For the fourth quarter you're saying  consumption is reasonably stable?    S o  your swing in these two quarters is  principally an inventory swing Is that what you're saying?    Which is about the difference--    Mr Chairman, I have been listening here for  some time, trying to cipher out what I think this economy is going to  do I think Steve's comment that it is uncertain is probably a good  portrayal of my position I have doubts that the staff's switch  between the third and fourth quarter is going to come out as perfectly  as they show it here I doubt that they would defend the precision of  the 07 [forecast] or anything like that anyway It seems to me that  we still have some strength left in this economy And the portrayal  of credit demands still reflects, I think, the basic attitude that  inflation will continue If there is anything certain in this world  right now it seems to be that inflation will continue, whether at the  current 10 percent rate in the fixed weighted index or at 9 percent  plus I am bothered about this forecast showing even through the end  of 1980 more than 9 percent inflation in terms of the average from Q4  '79 to Q4 '80 The prospects we have had detailed for us by the staff  have shown weakening, tied primarily as I understand it to an  inventory position and personal income assumption Housing is  expected to decline, but barring a change in attitudes--unless the  ceiling rates in state usury laws become more binding--it still  appears to me a pretty speculative area of inflation Oil [prices],  of course, are something that seem to move ahead; and with a minimum  of 10 percent inflation for this year, I suspect we are going to get  another shock in oil prices next year, unless somebody can find some  way to dampen the demand severely   S o ,  as I look over what is coming up, with high aggregates  growth with which we are financing these [activities], with rates not  dampening the strong credit demands--that is, the financial side of  the economy still indicating strength--the recession seems uncertain  and the inflation certain I still think that the policy position of  this Committee ought to be to do what it can to dampen inflationary  expectations That doesn't mean that we have to charge into major  changes in either the federal funds rate or anything else I suspect  the answer I would come out with is that we have to get the money  supply figures under better control, which means putting some rather  severe limits on what we would accept as a peak rate of money supply  growth over the coming 2-month period And if we exceed that, then we  take another tightening step and so be it If the money supply growth  does subside, as the staff seems to think it will eventually anyway,  then we can afford to be a little more relaxed and perhaps even turn  [rates around], following the market down But for the coming period,  Mr Chairman, I would counsel the Committee to continue the path it  has been on, slowly moving up its [funds rate] targets to force a  curtailment in money supply growth     9/18/79 -18-    Except that the lower limit does keep us from  moving [the funds rate] down    Well, Mr Chairman, I have just a slight  reservation on this on the 8 percent side I guess I'd rather have  11-1/4 to 12 percent [on the funds] range, using 11-1/2 as the  ""midpoint"" but also using 11-3/4 as a possibility if those  [aggregates] start moving up strongly toward the top of the range  I'm a little bothered about just nailing the rate at 11-1/2 percent  and saying that's what it's going to be and we're going to reassemble  if anything happens on either side of it If that's the way we're  going to work the game, then why don't we just say it?    If the aggregates were strong enough? You  would say that [Ml growth] would have to get up to the full 8 percent  in order to move even to the 11-3/4 percent?    I have no objections to having a telephone  call I'm a little bothered about saying that [Ml growth] has to be  at 8 percent [before we confer] because I think 8 is too high If it  means that we've got to go up to 11-3/4 percent, then I'd rather take  the decision now that we're going to go to 11-3/4 percent if [Ml  growth] is up in that area    If I had a preference straight out, the range  would be 3 to 7 percent, but I'm persuaded that with the present  projection 8 percent growth is a possibility All I'm saying is that  I'd much prefer to make sure that we do use some of the [funds] range  if we're approaching that [upper limit] I just think 8 is too high  If it got up in the 7 percent range, I'd like to see us nibbling  toward usage [of the upper part of the funds range]    I wouldn't mind the 11-3/4 percent top on it,  Tom if we were going to use that top as [Ml growth] moved up toward  the 8 percent But I wouldn't require it to get to 8 percent before  we use [the top of the funds range]    I think there's a possibility, Mr Chairman,  of some compromise here To take off on Bob Black's suggestion--    Even to 11-3/4 percent?  "
1203,1979-10-06," Paul, it seems to me that the situation we are  faced with is pretty much as you outlined here Maybe I could  streamline this for my own thinking I see our objectives as perhaps  four-fold--centered around dampening [inflation] expectations,  achieving some credit restraint that might flow from that, hopefully  strengthening the dollar exchange rate, and--depending upon how one  views this--a somewhat self-serving target of meeting our longer-range  objectives and bringing growth in the monetary aggregates down If  those are our objectives and I lay heavy stress on the dampening of  expectations, then it seems to me that the program has to be strong  enough to impress the market I have my doubts that the foreign  market is going to be impressed for three reasons (A) I don’t think  they are going to believe it (B) I don’t think they’ll understand it  in terms of our change [of technique] and (C) I think they are so  skeptical that they‘d just say it’s too little and, without some  effort on the part of the Treasury or somebody else, there would be no  direct impact on the gold price   So it seems to me that we are designing something here to a  considerable extent [for] our [domestic] situation, hoping there is a  fallout internationally The risks are large, of course, and  [primarily] on the side that whatever recessionary tendencies are  already there might be compounded, creating a [greater] decline I  suspect that risk involves 1980, not 1979 I think the risks are  equally strong on the other side in that if we don’t put out something  fully credible, we face a potential blow-up [vial a speculative move  in the metals commodities that spreads out from there--in effect a  flight from dollars So I’m prepared to move ahead on this because I  think the latter risks are too high    MI Chairman, I wonder if we shouldn’t at  least make the initial decision if you are ready to go that far Or  if you want to discuss the specifications, which M r   Axilrod can  [expound on], we can go that route   ought to discuss specifications But in my mind, at this point we’ve  made no decision to go in this direction I think that’s a decision  we should make at the end oE the road, and citing some specifications  may put some concreteness on this discussion in terms of whether we  want to tolerate the risk I just want to come back at the end to the  question that M r   Guffey put very well in stating the other case  There is a danger of a too high [funds] rate and there is a question  of all this publicity and then falling short There are these  analytic difficulties the instability in the demand function for  money and the [multiplier] relationships that we work with There is  the problem that we may run into a situation where, in effect, our  collective judgment tells us to do something different than what the  aggregates are telling us to do Do we want to get locked into a  procedure that prejudices us so far toward worrying about the  aggregates? Those are the questions that should be in our minds,  questions we want to return to before making a final decision here  [We need to weigh that] against the knowledge that we can do something  very comparable, to the best of our wisdom, by devising a package  using the traditional technique--or the traditional technique as  modified somewhat to accomplish the same immediate purpose So that’s  the final question But let’s [proceed]    I was merely raising the question of whether  you wanted to get the specifications of the traditional as well as the  new procedure    Sure, we can do that    Well, M r   Chairman, it seems to me that there  are at least four major decisions the Committee needs to make if we  are going to move to a reserve targeting procedure I‘m not saying  that is the [decision]; as you said, you want to come back to that   The first decision is what target we should aim at That’s  [addressed in the memo in the footnote] at the bottom of page 3   My  preference would be in between the two alternatives shown there I  don’t like the idea of aiming at the upper half [because of] the  potential for a miss and I question whether we can get as far down as  the midpoint of the target So I would suggest to the Committee that  we might aim for 5 percent growth in M1 for the full year, which would     10/6/79 -34-   connote something around 3 percent for September to December and a  quarterly average, if I calculated this right, at about 4-1/2 percent   the borrowing is the key there If we're going to bias it on the  basis of the present borrowings it would be $12 billion I would  allow a little more leeway, say, up to $15 billion   The second decision is how much bias to put in, and I think   The next decision, as I read this paper, is what to do if CDs  stray off path badly That, I think we would have to play somewhat by  ear but if they really take off, then I would adjust the nonborrowed  path   Finally, it seems to me, we have a fundamental question of  where to constrain the federal funds rate I would suggest to the  Committee the possibility of a range of 11-1/2 to 14-1/2 percent    And I am speaking in terms of the next 2 to 3  weeks with this sort of biased arrangement    Wider, Emmett?    Well, I don't think we need to set this for  all time It seems to me that a fed funds rate constraint of 11-1/2  to 14-1/2 percent for 2 or 3 weeks--    Well, it wouldn’t be too bad just to have an  informal discussion at the time of the next scheduled meeting, even if  you decided you didn’t want to have a regular FOMC meeting    We do get caught with that, don’t we? That’s  because we would have to release this--    It’s on a different page    September to December    And we already have 5 percent for the first  three quarters Am I right?    So with 53 percent, M1 growth would actually  be going up in the fourth quarter?    We haven’t got much margin    And the impact of the reserve requirement  change can do the same thing    I said $15 billion; it's $12 billion now    Yes    We are talking about a weekly average    There is a possibility it might go the other  way, though    It‘s not a good idea if you are going to wait  until Monday    No, I don’t agree with you    Reserve requirements?    Targets?    It's just continue the regular procedure    You get your announcement effect out of the  reserve requirement [change]     Well, I‘m not going to dissent against what  the Board and Federal Open Market Committee think they ought to do if  the majority is clearly in favor of package 1 I must admit that I  think the M1 target is too high    Well, why don’t we take a vote on the 4  against the 4-1/2?    It will be in the minutes   CHAI- VOLCKER It will be in the minutes    Policy record    The way she stated it was that a consultation  clearly would be called at 34-112 percent, wasn't it?   M R   MAYO That's right    Well, if we are going to center a range, then  I certainly would rather center it around 4 rather than 4-112 percent  "
1223,1979-10-22," This is Phil Coldwell It seems to me that we  have a situation which we obviously hadn’t contemplated I think we  could justify actions to moderate this under the “disorderly market”  excuse I agree with you, Paul, that the money supply [figures we  get] on Thursday will be important to us I don‘t happen to be in  love with the Ms, so I‘m not all that unhappy about this I think we  have a perception of tightness out there in the market, whether the Ms  are going to show it immediately or not Certainly the market is  showing it I would hate to undermine our effort by doing an  extensive amount of RPs to bring [the funds rate] down to any  predetermined level On the other hand, I don’t believe I want to  tolerate a disorderly market in the general government securities  area  "
1245,1979-11-20," Scott, do you see any further rate changes on  the horizon abroad?    Well, I recognize the fundamentals argument  My question was really about the near term Are you seeing or hearing  any noises about changes?    So you’re looking at a price of about $30 a  barrel   M R   TRUMAN About $28 a barrel; we have $28-1/4 in the  fourth quarter of next year    Jim, as I look over your forecast, you have  some fairly heavy negatives on gross private domestic investment in  the fourth quarter [and] the first quarter of next year But in terms  of the GNP, I assume that your decline in personal consumption     1 1 / 2 0 / 7 9  -13-   expenditures made the tail wag the dog here Is that a good  assumption?    Y o u  have government purchases going up and I  don't have the [unintelligible] proportions here to balance off but it  looked to me as if you might have an offset here between government  purchases and gross private [investment], leaving consumption as the  swing package    What are the possibilities that the consumer  is going to confound you still in this fourth quarter and push off the  decline until the first quarter of next year?    Your October figure is preliminary?    The ""flash"" or whatever you want to call it    It could go the other way   M R   PARTEE I think we could have a very poor Christmas  season, which would start out the new year with an inventory clean-up  job and that kind of thing   M R   SCHULTZ I don't want to be a Pollyanna, but do you  have any sense at all of when we will begin to get some very  substantial substitution in the energy area? Clearly, we're getting  to the point in energy prices where a lot of secondary and tertiary  recoveries get to be very attractive You point out that the natural  gas substitution can go on both in homes and industrial use Coal, as  you say, is very weak Yet there are a lot of energy plants that can  be reconverted to coal At what point does any of this really start  to occur with a vengeance? Do you have any feel for that at all?    Yesterday we talked about the possibility of  extending our horizon on this Are you planning to make any comment  on that, Steve?    You don't show rates that's my point    Well, comparable to the 4-1/2 percent path  that the Committee agreed to for September to December, what would be  the rate for--    Well, I didn't mean necessarily the  continuation of 4-1/2 percent, but what would be the path you would  recommend for November through January?    Through January    So from November through January you're  talking [a bit] higher    Mr Chairman, from my standpoint it seems  probable that the economy is going to decline To me the timing still  is a bit [uncertain] as to whether that is going to occur in the  fourth quarter or the first quarter But I think the chances are high  that the fundamentals will bring the economy to a lower rate of growth  and probably to negative gEowth How much of a negative, I‘m not  prepared to say at the moment I think there is a good possibility  that we might have a fairly sizable negative in the first and second  quarters of next year The place where I would quarrel a bit with the  forecast is in the consumption area I think there is still some  resilience out there in terms of the rate of change in consumption  expenditures, possibly even by making use of some [increase in] debt,  although there it is difficult to see how that can stretch much  further than it is stretched An overriding problem that I see is  that even in the staff forecast we are looking at a 10 percent rate of  inflation for at least the next nine months and maybe further than  that depending upon some ocher things, including the potential for a  very nasty OPEC decision   In terms of the economy, I would mention one other thing  While we did get some curtailment in the rate of bank credit growth,  the curtailment was from a 22 percent rate of increase to 18 percent  or something like that we’ve missed our guess on that by a very  [large] margin I believe our forecast on bank credit growth was  something like 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent or some range in that  neighborhood, so [actual growth] is almost double that I don‘t find,  as I wander around, any real stringency yet There‘s an awful lot of  talk about the price [of credit] bringing things under control [both]  in terms of mortgage rates and I think to some considerable extent a  usury problem in certain states, but liquidity still seems reasonably  adequate for other kinds o f  [expenditures]   S o  my preference would be to tilt [policyl a little on the  tight side now, given the prospects for next year, trying to make sure  that we don’t have a further expansion [in the aggregates], which  might bring us to even higher rates of inflation I’d like to keep  the Committee’s focus on the inflation side for the moment I do  think the chances of [recession] are high next year; and we will have  to face the problem of to what extent we allow the rates to go down  next year But I don’t like the possibility of those rates going down  now, not only because of the potential [effects on the domestic side1  for this quarter but also because of the international side    Yes     11/20/79 - 3 6 -    C H A I W  VOLCKER well, I do think we have this problem  internationally so I'm not all that gung ho on the down side either    Mr Chairman, I did not attempt to specify  [particulars] because I thought we were going around a second time,  but where you come out is not far from where I would suggest I'd  split this borrowing [range] at $17 billion However, if I heard you  right, you're taking the monetary growth rates of ""B,"" and I would  much prefer the growth rates that Governor Partee suggested of 5  percent and 8-1/2 percent [for November-December] I believe that's  what you said, Chuck    All right    Well, if we take alternative B, it's 5-1/2  percent on M1    But that's exactly part of my problem  because--if I heard Steve right--if we confirm that, we've got to hit  roughly 10 percent [for Ml] in December on the basis of his present  projections     I would much prefer to specify this out  rather than to adopt something that then is going to be interpreted  midstream because none of us really knows what the projection is going  to be or how [growth] is going to turn out So I would prefer that we  use 5 percent and 8-1/2 percent with a $17 billion borrowing  assumption and hold the fed funds range    Then we ought to stay at 4-l/2 and 7-1/2  percent instead of going to 5 and 8-1/2 percent    Because M1 is going to be pushed up    It's 5, 8-l/2 and [borrowing of $17 billion]  and the same fed funds range   M R   MAYO 8-1/2    That's what we have    And the fed funds range the way it is    Not necessarily    Yes    Or unless things fall out of bed and you call  a special meeting    How about the 4th?    So moved  "
1272,1980-01-08," Steve, for my simple-minded, poor mathematical abilities, tell me if I can make this statement and say it's reasonably accurate That the things that threw you off were the demand for excess reserves and the shortfall in borrowing The latter was being made up by an enlarged nonborrowed path and the former-- coupled with a currency shortfall, I guess--brought you to the shortfall in the total required reserves path Is that reasonably close or not?   Mr Chairman, I don't have any problems with continuing on the procedure I do think there's some question as to whether the Committee would wish to leave with the Manager and whoever else is guiding this the right to change the nonborrowed path by exceptionally large amounts The amount it was changed this time doesn't bother me, but I can see a possibility where the shortfall might be a half billion to a billion dollars It seems to me that should be the Committee's decision, not a Desk decision   Similar to the international   No, nonborrowed is zero after they've made an adjustment   We could have a situation in which the borrowing reverses its present course and jumps up to $18 billion Then would you cut back on the net borrowed path by $1 billion? I strongly doubt that the Committee would want to do that right away, but--   I guess you're crossing the bridge that there is a good explanation as to why the borrowings dropped from $17 billion down to $800 million That's a $1 billion drop and I'm not at all sure that the--   Yes, but it makes a whole lot of difference in terms of where we come out, not just in the period between [meetings of] the Open Market Committee but beyond, how much nonborrowed is thrown into that package And if the staff, or you, or whoever else is guiding this operation is throwing an extra billion dollars in the path, the Committee is faced with a fait accompli at the next meeting That's all I'm saying If the Committee wishes to concede that to you and the staff, it ought to do so; otherwise it's wide open   But I'm saying that if [the staff is] going to enlarge the nonborrowed path because of a shortfall on the borrowing side, some money will have been put in that at the next Open Market Committee meeting we're not likely to get out   In the sense of the bottom end of the constraint?   I would doubt strongly that Peter couldn't have put in another $400 million in this period if he had fed it in slowly   Yes, I'm talking about the whole period, an intermeeting period of a month   I doubt that   Well, it stops you at some point, but [where]?  -18-    1/8-9/80   Will you weigh the two of them equally?   Do we even have all the data now to [calculate] M-1B?   Well, I was just pointing out that there is a problem knowing what M-1B is going to be If we have a shortfall of data, we may be sitting here next month wondering what M-1B was   If you had your druthers, Steve, M-1B is what you'd focus on now?   Yes, but that's down the road   It may not be very far, but we don't know--   Well, Mr Chairman, it seems to argue for focusing on M-1A until we get a nationwide NOW account bill   But we can't seasonally adjust M-1B How can we use that right now?   If they change the law, we could drop M-1A   Wouldn't the real problem occur, Steve, if we got a surge in M-1B and [the funds] didn't come out of demand deposits? If we got a big jump in share drafts--   Yes We could have a drop in M2   I know, but you didn't discuss the size of M2 here   Mr Chairman, I approach this from two interesting bases Number one, membership of the FOMC will not be the same three to four years from now In fact, if my count is correct, we're going to lose at least one-third of the members I doubt very much if we're going to commit anybody out that long I think it would be a mistake to commit because we'd lose credibility; in fact we may lose a bit this year in [adopting] a set of hard targets There are enough uncertainties and instabilities in this economy right now that we'd better have about as much leeway as we can get If we followed Ernie's path of selecting a particular point, then my aim for a point would be something like 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent; [if we set a range that would be my] midpoint with a 2 percent margin on either side But that would obviously widen the range from the 3 percentage points that we've had in the past  As I look at the picture of the alternatives in front of us, new definitions and current definitions, I'm not quite sure I understand all of them, except that the first two seem to be identical until you get to M2 It seems to me that we might fudge a bit here and maybe use 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent or 3 to 6 percent We had a 5-1/2 percent growth rate for 1979 If we're trying to hold down inflation in 1980 and 1981, I don't see how we could aim for 5-1/2 percent; it seems to me that we have to aim for something lower We've been hitting the tops of the ranges or have been outside them on some of these aggregates, so my preference would be to put the top of the range very close to what I really want to shoot at and then scale down from there and hope we are able to make some progress And if  -36-    1/8-9/80  growth came out at the top of the range, we'd have an excuse of a worsening economy or something that would clearly demand more credit than we had planned But I do think this economy is so unstable that it's difficult to know which way to plan We've already talked about recession for months on end It isn't here yet, except in the automobile and housing sectors, and maybe 6 months from now it still won't be here except for automobiles and housing I don't know It's hard to see how the consumer can continue to fight this Maybe he is going into dissavings, but somehow or other he's keeping up his expenditures and may continue to do so for a while My preference would be not to talk about 1981 because I think we're going to get into a box I'd like a range of 4 percentage points, but if the Committee thinks 3 points is the most we can get away with, I'd take the 3-point range and I'd shade alternative 2   Down   Scott, in your Desk operations and your wanderings abroad, what's your sense of the direction of currency management on the part of the multi-nationals? Are they making any significant shifts?   In effect, Jim, what you've done by the revisions this time is to push the recession into 1980; 1979 is no longer a recession year What are the chances of [a recession] being deferred another six months?   Well, Table I-10 in Part I of the Greenbook seems to indicate that you're forecasting a six-quarter decline in personal consumption expenditures, heavily concentrated in the goods sector--in fact, all in the goods sector--with services continuing to rise on a real basis You're forecasting very heavy declines [in total consumer spending] in the first three quarters, tapering off until you get a positive figure finally in the fourth quarter of 1981 What does history tell us about this kind of pattern? Is this consistent with, say, the 1974-75 pattern?   Mr Chairman, I would like to go back to this forecast of personal consumption expenditures because I think it's an important point You have forecast an increase in unemployment of roughly 1/2 point per quarter in this period ahead, at least for 1980, and industrial production is only going down about 23 percent [in the first quarter] and 6 or 7 percent, roughly, for the full year So, one wonders a little whether these are consistent with the decline you have forecast in personal consumption If the goods part of this consumption is going down at more than 7 percent in the first two quarters and 6 percent in the third quarter, isn't that likely to have a greater impact on industrial production?   Presumably they get convinced by the end of the second quarter with a two percent reduction in goods sales   Jim, in your forecast you said you used 6 percent monetary growth as a base Did you play around with this to take into account some alternatives to the Bluebook with the idea of maybe 3 percent for the first half and 6 or 8 percent in the second half?   Could you say what, let us say, 4 percent across the board would be?   But you didn't do any alternative scenarios?   The three months is starting January 1st through March 31st?   Does it include December or does it not?   Well, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the direction we're working on here is to lower the [growth in the] monetary aggregates I would accept alternative C, for which you have growth of 4 percent I'd be willing to accept a range around that, although I'm not sure how this is all working out with single points versus ranges in the short run But I'd be perfectly willing to accept, say, 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent or something like that My present predilection would be to accept a lower level in the first half and see what the second half brings Because my primary objective is to try to get some impact on the price level, I'm not sure that I totally agree--in fact, I'm fairly sure I don't agree-- with what the staff is saying, which is that we can't have some impact on prices here I doubt very much if this long-range low growth saucer forecast is really a reasonable one over a long period of time; things will change A recession is likely in the next year; it's timing is uncertain And I'm reasonably sure that something will come up and destroy that lovely little package over the next 8 quarters The complex of political as well as economic and foreign factors is such that I would opt for a lower level in the range, particularly since we got something in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent area in the fourth quarter, as I recall, Steve, rather than the 4-1/2 percent we were [expecting]   Yes   Well, I was coming to that, Mr Chairman The range I put down was partly because of our frailties in achieving a number, and I'd give the Desk a little guidance rather than just leave it to the Manager to make some ad hoc decisions on it But it also reflects some interest in the interest rate package Contrary to Mr  -65-    1/8-9/80  Roos, I think interest rates are an important element of the impact both on expectations and on consumer and capital expenditures So, I'm unwilling just to wash my hands of interest rates and say ""Go where you want to go"" I don't think it's likely [to have no impact] internally, and I think it's even less likely to have no impact externally in our relationships with other countries   It might prolong it   I'm not quite sure you said what you wanted to say   You mean we should react more rapidly if M1 growth goes up with the interest rates falling than if M1 growth went down and interest rates were rising   If you are willing to convert everything from borrowing to nonborrowed reserves, sure, you can call it meaningless I don't believe it is meaningless I think it's quite meaningful if we shift from $15 billion of borrowing to zero borrowing   Do you want comments on this compromise or what are you going to do? Mr Chairman, I'd rather have [a range] centered on 4 percent than the 4-1/2 percent you've chosen The [risks] of 5 percent are too high to me I think we ought to be aiming for something less than that in this coming quarter to make sure we do not overstimulate at this particular moment, and I'd much rather we have a 4 percent rate The range could be 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent if we want a center point; or for a single point 4 percent would be my strong preference With the $1 billion in borrowing I have no problem   Steve, I thought you said alternative C was consistent [with the current] rate, not an upward [move in the] rate   [Down] a bit, but not upward   So move it  SPEAKER(?) Seconded   Consistency with the outlook of the Administration? Is that it? "
1298,1980-02-04," If we shift from lagged reserve accounting to contemporaneous and confuse that issue--   I have only two comments, Mr Chairman First, I would agree with the Account Manager that this is likely to  -14-    2/4-5/80  have [only] minor advantages But secondly, I would caution the Committee that this is another interruption in the overall picture of [the policy] the Committee is trying to follow If we add that on top of our redefined aggregates as well as possible daylight overdrafts and additions from the membership bill, we're likely to complicate the figures [further] and they are going to be difficult for people to follow, even our very good staff   Your pressure for urgency of repayment is merely the annual date coming up?  -18-    2/4-5/80   I understand that, but I thought you were conveying a sense of real urgency and that maybe we ought to take further steps than what we're now taking   I was just testing the degree of urgency you're putting on this   And nothing as drastic as the Bundesbank telling you that we have to get out [of debt]   Could I ask a question, Mr Chairman? The Chairman [of the Congressional Committee] has asked us to talk about possibilities regarding real GNP, the CPI, and unemployment As I understand your presentation, your real GNP forecast for 1980 would be down 22 percent   Isn't that what you're asking?   And you have the unemployment rate at 7-3/4 percent at the end of the year   What's your CPI? That is what he asked   But the change over the year is 114 percent?   But if you calculated it, what would it be? They must have some [implicit assumption] Is it higher than yours?   It has to be higher than yours   Well, Mr Chairman, this is the last chance I get to say this so I am going to say it In fact this is my last FOMC meeting   No, I am not going to chance that! I agree that there's a high degree of uncertainty, but our track record and our past performance clearly indicate that we've underestimated the rate of inflation and I expect we will continue to do so I think there's going to be a rapid defense build-up, but impacting largely upon expectations in the first part of this year If that is the case, we may see a moderation from what the staff was [projecting] in the rate of decline in the first half I think fiscal policy is going to be easier than portrayed by the Administration's budget Fiscal policy is likely to be stimulative instead of restraining and I suspect we will probably underestimate the aggregate data that we are using As for the data you've requested we comment on, Mr Chairman, I would put real GNP in a zero to plus 1/2 percent mode, the CPI at the end of the year in the neighborhood of 14 percent, and the unemployment rate at about 7 percent And I have already indicated that I think fiscal policy is going to be easier   I am certainly not in favor of a personal income tax cut I think there is a case to be made to improve the rate of business capital stimulation in the area of improving job expectations, but I would question whether this is the right time to do that There's a fundamental fact of high inflation, which we need to continue to keep our eye on; unless that is damped, the possibilities of a rising rate of inflation are very good I just don't find myself in agreement with the idea of gradualism in economic policy It's a lovely theory but a practical monstrosity Credit availability in the economy is high in my view right now And with expectations of high inflation, the interest rate restraint is minimal Banker attitudes reflect no feeling of quantitative restraint; to the contrary, they are seeing business as usual I admit the majority of the bannking profession seems to say that the only thing that would satisfy them would be a major depression But I still think we have not obtained control over this and I suspect that the recent trends in the international financial side are going to  -30-    2/4-5/80  create some dollar problems for us for the coming year As you struggle through these, I wish you well   Yes, down to 92 percent [in the fourth quarter]   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we have been talking here about a series of figures which, quite frankly, I don't completely understand and in which I have a great lack of confidence  -53-    2/4-5/80  The redefinitions seem to have added about 2 percentage points to these past figures We are questioning the function; we are questioning the seasonals I think the expectations have shifted on us And if we are talking about supporting nominal GNP growth, I would observe that we had a 68 percent growth in M-1A last year and, if I read the correct line on this table, it supported an 113 percent increase in nominal GNP   Yes, that's quite correct In the coming year it looks to me as if we're talking about a GNP increase anywhere in the 8 to 10 percent range and maybe up to as high as 11 percent--that encompasses most of the forecasts I heard this morning--and making some progress in reducing the stimulation that both monetary and fiscal policy have added these past few years I have to come out in favor of a much tighter monetary policy And I would pick up on some people's comments in that I would hate to see another 6 percent increase in the monetary growth So, I would put the target at 3 to 5 percent, centered on 4 percent with a 2-point spread   M-lA   It's so violently different from [the actual experience in] 1978 and 1979   You got 3-1/2 votes   We can't possibly get close   We could widen the range to 3 to 6-1/2  -63-    2/4-5/80   That's what I suggested, but he--   Would it help, Mr Chairman, if we used M-1B as opposed to M-1A as the starting point?   But M-1B has the most long-run potential M-1A, if you read it as ""MIA,"" is ""missing in action""   If we're going to get it anyway, you better be down where I am   No, I am going to be out in the ranks of the unemployed with fixed incomes to pay the price--   Why, Paul? What's your principal reservation about it?  -67-    2/4-5/80   Well, go back and try the Schultz approach again That looks to me as if it buys a good share of those of us who are concerned about--   Reversing the Balles points   Take M-1A and M-1B of ""III"" and M2 and M3 of ""II""   Well, if that's the case, we better stay with alternative III   The President has given up on Humphrey-Hawkins for this coming year anyway He moved out [the time period in which to reach the objectives]   2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent on M-1A?  SPEAKER(?) No   What about M2 and M3?   So the midpoint on M-1A would be 4-3/4 percent?   What did we finally get on the vote for straight alternative III?   I would argue for alternative C with a borrowing level of $16 billion   That is about what they had, $15 billion, for alternative C   They have $15 billion in the Bluebook   I think we have a chance here to make a nibble into that long-term range; and if we give that up now, we may not have a chance later on   On the upper part of the range   Your borrowing level for ""B"" would be $1 billion?   But consistent with ""B,"" you're talking $1 billion?   That says that nothing has happened since the last time we discussed this   It's also partly a perception of front-end loading   More restraint "
