1652,1992-11-17," [Unintelligible] only from Mr Gonzalez and only from his staff or Mr Auerbach We don't know what the new subcommittee chairman's agenda may be A footnote Steve Neal is still trying to keep [the chairmanship of] both the financial institutions and the monetary policy [subcommittees] But whether that will work out or not remains to be seen I would note that back in 1977--   Dick, if I go back to this survey that Steve Neal did in 1976 I'm afraid I don't have a very good answer for you because he didn't put the question in those terms Although there were a number of respondents who in reacting and addressing the issue of verbatim transcripts or memoranda of discussion said such things as ""but I also favor an immediate release of the policy directive,"" that wasn't really the issue on the table Obviously, immediate release of FOMC decisions is the issue in the Hamilton-Dorgan Bill Clearly, there are some members of Congress who are interested in that, but we don't know how many That has not moved along in the Congress, but obviously some members are interested in that   Well, I would guess that the members of Congress are more interested in knowing the results and knowing the results  -52-    11/17/92  quickly than in having a detailed record that comes out in three to five years So, if you put it to a vote, it would probably go that way On these public disclosure issues--the Freedom of Information and Government in the Sunshine Acts--the record of Congress is that whenever those kinds of bills are put before them, it is very hard not to vote for them So, if you put the issue on the floor of the House this minute ""Is the House of Representatives in favor of immediate disclosure or not?"" there's a political bias toward immediate release of information On the other hand, the fact that legislation like that hasn't really moved along in the Congress makes one question how much real interest there is in the subject I don't know if that's responsive to your question, but that's the best I can do   We cannot deal with this long-term disclosure of verbatim minutes ourselves because of the Freedom of Information Act problem The only thing that we have any control over is release of the policy directive   Jerry, I'm not sure that I heard all you said   Right, but what were you proposing? You were asking me-- "
1977,1993-11-16," Bob, I don't think there's any way I can give a clear answer to that question I think to some extent it depends on the decision the FOMC makes with respect to the release of the transcripts or how we may make those transcripts available But I would say that Chairman Gonzalez does make a distinction--at least he has in his letters so far--that while he is interested in the public release of these documents in some orderly way and it appears that there would be some time lag, he is asking at the same time that the raw transcripts be turned over to his Committee So, even if we decide on a program for the public, he is still interested in our turning over all the transcripts and tapes to his Committee And he may pursue that To some extent how the whole Committee would feel about a demand for the raw transcripts may depend on what we decide to do in terms of their release to the public   A majority; [it] would be 26 of the 51   I think there are instances, at least in the past, where committees have delegated to the chairman   That is not the current set of rules in the House Banking Committee   I'm not clear on that   Mr Chairman, the '84 bill would have released transcripts that were between four and five years old  SPEAKER(?) Transcripts or MODs?   I'm sorry, MODs between four and five years old The '79 bill was--   The '79 bill would have released them between three and four years "
2047,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, I have the letter here in front of me In fact, we have two different letters We have one dated December 17 that said ""Please provide the Committee staff with access to the transcript and tape of the October 15th conference call"" The one on December 3 says ""Please make the transcript and tape of the FOMC conference call available to the Committee staff for review next week"" So it's somewhat ambiguous how they put it I think we can understand it as they--   They called obviously to come down and view the table and the recordings, etc I guess I understood their call to mean they were coming here "
2601,1995-09-26," I spoke with one of Senator Mack's staff yesterday afternoon with respect to the hearings schedule, asking what the likelihood was I got no specific answer to that question But in the course of the conversation, I did bring up this issue with him as to what their intent was in terms of the Employment Act of 1946 Had they intended to wipe out the employment objectives of the Employment Act? The impression I got was they had not realized that they had eliminated the ""maximum employment"" objectives of the 1946 Act Their response was that they had intended to repeal Humphrey-Hawkins and the various aspects of the Humphrey-Hawkins Act that amend the Employment Act of 1946 as well as the Congressional Budget Act; they had intended to take out those pieces from the Employment Act of 1946 On the other hand, they also said that they had substituted new policy objective language, which I think is on the bottom of page 3 in the copy of the bill that I circulated I mentioned to them that there was no reference to employment in that provision, which relates to the objective of price stability, and it appeared that they had not realized that They seemed to indicate that that had been an oversight on their part There is some indication that they would be willing to make some changes Of course, I was speaking with only one staff person; I don't know how representative that conversation was of the views on the Hill  By the way, on the hearings issue, they really have not planned what they are going to do next They could have more hearings in the Joint Economic Committee or in the Senate Banking Committee; the timing really has not been decided I asked if there is a likelihood of a hearing before the end of the year They said there is a distinct possibility of that   You made the point earlier that in terms of support for this legislation it appears that all of the majority members of the Senate Banking Committee and the JEC seem to have lined up behind this bill A committee staffer told me that after yesterday they also have as sponsors the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and all of the members of the Senate Republican leadership So, at least in terms of support on one side of the aisle, they feel that they have key members  -50-    9/26/95  of the Senate supporting the legislation Now, obviously the detail of the sponsors' knowledge of this bill is something that has to be considered But in terms of an initial push for this legislation, Senator Mack and his staff are quite pleased by the response they have gotten so far   We have not heard anything   There clearly will be opposition from some important Senators on the Democratic side Senator Sarbanes probably will not be supportive of this legislation "
