3229,1987-07-07," I would just like to go on record as saying that I prefer alternative II with the 5 to 8 percent range on M2 for basically many of the reasons that I've heard already expressed here; no others occur to me   Which we have no history of doing   It would seem to me that if we do announce a reduction to 4-1/2 percent, that would be immediately perceived as being the target that we are after   I thought Jerry's suggestion of 4 to 8 percent was an interesting alternative   I agree "
3256,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like to spend just a second on a little different perspective There has been a very good staff forecast and a lot of very good comment on it But it might be worthwhile to put our attention just a little on whether or not there may be some very fundamental long-range changes running underneath the surface of the world economy and our economy If there's an analogy there, it may be what happens in the sea you have the Gulf stream running up the East Coast from south to north; the storms come and go and calms come and go; and the tide shifts back and forth with the Gulf stream still running north up the coast It kind of dominates everything in the long run I wonder if there's any of that effect going on in the world economy I see several things out there that could be fundamentally deflationary in the long term That's not to quarrel with the kind of forecast that we're seeing here over the forecast period But it seems to me that if we can avoid falling into the protectionist sinkhole--and maybe we won't--that there is a super abundance of pretty capable labor across the world that's waiting to produce, and it's currently grossly underemployed And there's capital that's mobile enough to get there to set up factories and economic capabilities, and do whatever is necessary to employ that still quite low-cost labor And we're going to be competing with that labor In a great many commodity areas there is a worldwide abundance of capacity Absent political events, there's plenty of energy for the next few years at least The world is coming into a surplus of farm commodity production on an aggregate basis; there are lots of metals, and so forth The third factor may be that it probably was inflationary to increase the enormous levels of international debt that we now are struggling with, but it probably is going to be deflationary to try and service that debt, now that we have it There's a lot of pressure on a lot of economies to produce in order to earn foreign exchange to try to service their debt So there are some things out there which seem to me to possibly be exerting a [unintelligible] deflationary effect And, while I see the pressures that we have over the forecast period, and I would not quarrel with those, I think that maybe these long-run deflationary effects under the surface might damp that, as they play through in the inflation numbers   I wouldn't be surprised   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would prefer staying with ""B"", largely for the reasons I outlined a few minutes ago I think that the underlying trends are going to tend to damp both the inflation that is showing up and also, perhaps, the robustness of the expansion that we're in However, I do recognize the short-term tendencies toward some inflationary movement here So, I would also like to see the language be asymmetric in the direction of tightening   I would stay with ""B"", the $500 million   The tilt is worth $25 to $50 million dollars "
3281,1987-09-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me, as I've listened to the comments made around the table this morning, that there's a very, very strong centralizing character to the projections that have been made by everyone--the Greenbook and the District forecasts I think that they constitute, in their aggregate wisdom, a very responsible and good forecast; and I accept it I would like to make this comment the projections arise, as they must, from conventional economic analysis and historical experience; and I would like to suggest that maybe we should be a little open and alert to the possibility that there are some unconventional and untraditional things going on Standing back from the trees and looking at the forest, I observe that we are about to end the fifth year of what has been called a recovery I'm not sure how long you call something a recovery, but this one is going to be five years old in another couple of months; and I note that at the end of the fifth year the economy is, in fact, accelerating and inflation is declining by most measures Inflation is projected to increase for some very good reasons, but right now you've got an economy that is accelerating and inflation that is decreasing--which is pretty unconventional Industrial production is going up at an accelerating rate; unemployment has been dropping very strongly and is probably now somewhere near its natural rate And yet, at the same time, we are seeing very, very small increases in the unit costs of production and a very flat producer price index In fact, last month, the PPI was zero That seems to be a little unconventional and untraditional On the trade balance and the J curve, we are not getting the effects that would have been expected They are stretching out; we still think they are going to be there, but that has been behaving unconventionally Governor Johnson noted a few moments ago the fact that we have taken $60 billion of fiscal stimulus out of the economy, and yet none out of the trade deficit And I think a lot of people would have been surprised ahead of time that those two things could have coexisted Incidentally, as the economy is accelerating its growth rate, that is occurring while $60 billion of fiscal stimulus is, in fact, coming out of the economy  I would suggest the possibility that inflation may behave in an untraditional way also Maybe that also will stretch out and not accelerate I ask myself What possibility is there that could occur? I see several possibilities They are all soft, and I would hate to    9/22/87  have to try to defend any of them But, for one thing, I suspect that we may be undermeasuring our productivity increase We may be doing better than we know I've talked to Mike Prell and some others about this some I think we have a much higher level of mobility in this economy that is helping us deal with imbalances as they show up, rather than just suffer from them For instance, instead of just accepting higher wage costs in Boston, we are moving plants to the rural regions of New England where wage costs are lower That's mobility A lot of bankers who are out of business in Texas are going to places where the banking system is stronger That's mobility There's a lot of that going on and that didn't used to be there I think we may be in an era of very intense competition from several different respects For one, the US is back I think that our industry is waking up and beginning to compete Governor Angell spoke about that a few minutes ago and I agree with him Also, there are many more serious competitors in the world economy than just a few years ago They are serious and they are fierce, and I think that is one thing that is going to tend to impede the advance of inflation I spoke at the last meeting of this group about what seem to me to be basic long-running, underlying deflationary tendencies in the world economy I won't go back over that ground but I do think they are still there All this is to say that I would not quarrel with the projection that we have over the next five quarters, but I'd like to pique a little interest maybe--on the part of some of the research directors around here, and some others, who are far better at this sort of analysis than I am--to see whether or not there are some discontinuities going on that could be favorable discontinuities And, I think we should be open to those sorts of possibilities and alert to them Meanwhile, I think we definitely have to be ready to deal with these inflationary expectations and not let that genie out of the bottle unnecessarily Thank you, sir   Mr Chairman, I think that in the short run the risks that we have here in the inflation area are more expectations  -37-    9/22/87  than anything else, and we should maintain a posture against that, and move against that I think the economy can handle the slight tightening that going on to $600 million in borrowing would imply So I favor ""B"" with $600 million, and would like to see symmetrical language   Both ""somewhat"" and both ""would""   Sure "
3311,1987-11-03," Very briefly, Mr Chairman, I think most things have been said, but just to get on the record here While I agree with Bob Boykin and others that the situation is fragile, particularly in the Eleventh District, which I am still pretty close to, I share Bob Heller's view that there is a lot of room for being optimistic about a light at the end of the tunnel The risks here, I think, are two primarily Number one, as Ed Boehne and others have said, no more shocks is the key If we can avoid that, I think things will be enormously optimistic I also agree with Governor Seger that it is very important that we--and I mean we in the corporate sense--do whatever we can to avoid a recession, which is in nobody's interest at a time like this So, those are the two things that I would like to keep a weather eye to have no more shocks and avoid a recession to  -26-    11/3/87  the extent that we can do that I would like to comment briefly on Jerry Corrigan's concern about the high level of debt, which has been one of my favorite themes also I think that ties together with Frank Morris' comment about the pressure for market share that people feel The creation of all of this debt has put people in a situation where there is enormous pressure to produce; that's not only true for foreign economies and their pressure to maintain market share here but it is also true domestically People who are in debt need to keep their jobs So perhaps if there is a good side to all of this debt creation, it lies in the fact that it puts tremendous pressure on everybody to be productive and, thus, it should have a long-term downward drag on the inflationary concerns that we all have   Mr Chairman, I'm very much a mainstreamer here And I have nothing to add in the way of new reasons from what has been said around the table I would go with Variant I because I think we need to be seen as being on the accommodating and concerned side here, with asymmetric language in the direction of ease I favor alternative ""B"", and I would cut the announced funds rate range back to 4 to 8 percent, again to indicate tilting in the direction of ease   I like the Corrigan language   No, that's an important difference "
3335,1987-12-15," Mike, as you're well aware, there's a school of thought out there that the economy has been running on the strong growth of the aggregates of a year or a year and a half ago and that the economy is about to go downhill as a result of the much flatter growth of the aggregates in the last 9 or 10 months If that's not your expectation, then would you assess that expectation?   At what point in time would you start to give more weight to it? How long can the growth in the aggregates stay very modest without beginning to be a drag?   I haven't spoken yet   Well, I'm glad to follow your speech, Bob, because I think I'm coming from very much the same place I have some concern, too, because I'm getting somewhat different reports than I'm hearing around the table this morning In fact, the reports I'm hearing around the table this morning encourage me greatly from where I was when I came in here My suspicion is that we are getting this adjustment, as Governor Angell suggests; and I also suspect that it may be this very slow aggregate growth and reserve growth that Bob Heller was talking about that's doing it I'm not confident that retailers are doing that well The sales I hear about across the country--when they started and the extent of them--make me wonder how strong things are Indeed, there are a lot of reports coming in from associations that are not as strong as we are hearing here this morning Martha, you were quoting from I had a visit from an economic consultant who works with and this fellow is telling that the economy is going to fall off the cliff in the first quarter on account of the growth in the aggregates That may be part of what's going into their planning In short, Mr Chairman, to go back to your analogy about plumbing and Bob Black's comment on it, I wonder if the plumbing may not be beginning to work again In any event, I suspect it will work a while before we realize it is working Given that the retail economy is as important as it is to the overall picture, I think that we should be very alert to the state of the plumbing--what the aggregates are doing and what effects that may be having I would be very happy with the staff forecast for 1988, and I basically agree with it But that's where my concern about it would lie   Mr Chairman, I like Si Keehn's concept of moving in the right order from (1) to (3) to (4) I would go to (3) after the first of the year, moving toward (4) later on And I would encourage some sort of an announcement at a proper time I favor alternative ""B"" with probably a $300 million borrowing target and asymmetric language on the easing side I'd keep the funds rate about where it has been, calling that 6-3/4 percent, tending on the downside rather than the upside from there "
3354,1988-01-05," Mr Chairman, this is Mike Kelley I quite agree with the thrust of the statement, but I'd raise the question of whether using the phrase ""the passing of the year-end"" might not raise questions to persons in years down the line about where that's coming from I don't think there is any other clear reference to that point in the trail we are leaving   I may be wrong, but I don't remember a previous reference to the significance of the year-end We have discussed it, of course, but is it--   I guess in the full minutes there will be some--   Okay, if that's the case then "
3372,1988-02-09," Thank you, sir I share with many others the view that the staff forecast is a very good one Not only is the forecast good, but I think it's a very attractive path for the economy I like it a lot I'd like to just freeze dry it and put it on a shelf and consider it a record I hope it will happen very close to that way But, of course, what we are talking about is where the risks lie in [potential] deviations from the forecast, and I'm not as confident as some seem to be that they're on the high side I'm a little more concerned about the low side I had a list here I was going to run that was very similar to Governor Heller's and I won't repeat all of that I do think that we should keep in mind that the factors that are going to give us a stronger second half, if we get it, depend to a very substantial degree on interest rates at least as low as we have and probably lower And, if we don't get it, I'm not sure whether some of the other indicators that we see that could take us toward weakness won't gather strength I have concern about the weakness, the extended weakness, of the aggregates I think I was pretty comfortable, and maybe complacent about it, for a long time in view of the fact that they had run high in 1985 and 1986 and it seemed to me to be a reasonable catch-up period But now I'm beginning to get more concerned about it, particularly the weakness we had at the tail end of 1987 It came back, as everyone knows, in January Now, I may be premature on this, but I'm a little concerned that they're beginning to fall back again, and I would worry if that started to happen  Another key thing in keeping the economy going reasonably well and achieving this transition that we need to achieve is to keep this export growth going I think that's going to be harder to do as we go along We may have gotten through the easier part of it Unless I'm mistaken, it seems to me that this path would take us to what looks like a surplus, ex-oil, by the end of the forecasting period in 1989 Ted, you may want to correct me on that At any rate, we're going to be either in surplus, ex-oil, or close to it; and I'm not sure that the rest of the world is going to let us get there without some disruption along the way It's a little harder for me to see a lower dollar and that strong a real trade pattern I'm afraid that something's going to have to give there, and I'm not exactly sure what it's going to be But my concern is that it would be on the side of weakening the economy somewhat Given the straws in the wind and the difficulty of achieving that level of continued export growth over  -26-    2/9-10/88  many more quarters out in the future, I fear that the risks may indeed be somewhat more on the weak side rather than on the strong side   Thank you, Mr Chairman I was impressed with what Gary Stern said a while ago that whatever tilt we may make in the short run--and we'll discuss that a little later--it's important to keep our eye on inflation in the longer run And I think that that's the message we want to project That being the case, I can be very comfortable with alternative III I would like to see us maintain as much discipline as we can to hold our own feet to the fire and stay within whatever ranges we set Of course, we have to have the capability of going outside the ranges if that's appropriate  -40-    2/9-10/88  Part of my reasoning is that I would like to see us stay within whatever ranges we set and, if we're going to make a serious effort to do that, then I like the idea of being a little on the lower side with a 4-1/2 percent low instead of the 5 percent low  Apparently this argument about rebasing has been around for a while--it's new to me being new to this sort of consideration--but I must say that it makes a lot of sense to me I don't know what formal work has been done on that issue in years past, but I would urge that at least we review it and seriously consider it I'd be a little leery of doing it ad hoc right here at the table without some further consideration, but I am impressed with the force of that argument, and I'd like to see it pursued a little I would agree that we have fought the battle of getting away from trying to be forced into projecting M1; we don't have to do it and I think there is still so much variability there that we should not go back to doing it So, the sum of this is that I would go with alternative number III   The major problem is that the coffee hasn't arrived   May I come back, Don, just one second to Bob Black's question about just what alternative B means? On page 13 it does indeed say it's associated with borrowing of $250 million On page 14, in paragraph 16, it says that ""Alternative B contemplates a continuation of reserve conditions now expected to prevail after the recent slight easing"" Now, when we get over to [the directive] language, which we're going to look at in just a minute, it says that alternative B ""would maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions"" And I guess I would like to know how that would be defined Would that be defined as the $250 million or would that be defined as what, in fact, has been happening here in recent days, more like $150 million to $200 million?   Then, if we were to say that we were going to maintain the existing degree of pressure, that wouldn't necessarily mean that we were going to, in fact, tighten from what we have been doing?   Mr Chairman, I'm also in the camp that feels that the risks this year are more on the soft side I agree with Governor Heller in that I don't think this second half is in the bag and I would be fearful of anything that looked like a tightening I'm really quite comfortable with the slight easing that has occurred so far At this meeting I would like to come out with a configuration that would essentially leave us there I'm not exactly sure what would accomplish that I think if we have $250 million as a borrowing target and take that seriously, it might result in what would appear to be a tightening, which I would not be comfortable with So, I think I favor a $150 million to $200 million borrowing target and alternative B with some asymmetric language on the easing side And for the longer term, I agree that we must maintain our posture against inflation For that reason, I would stay with alternative III in order to maintain that message in the market   I could read that as 4 to 8 percent, yes sir "
3396,1988-03-29," Mr Chairman, as the one at the table who has the least background in this, I've been enormously instructed by this whole exercise   I don't want to get too explicit about what the instruction was, but I have appreciated it I came to this discussion without any firm convictions one way or the other, so it has been very interesting for me to listen to the arguments on both sides Where I'm coming down is to stay where we are, largely on the arguments that surround the flexibility that this procedure gives us Also, I like the way that market forces have at least an opportunity to show through on this procedure more clearly than they would if we went to the other route So, I'm comfortable with staying where we are   You are, but go ahead [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, there seems to be heavy sentiment around the table that the risks are increasing on the upside and I share that But I feel constrained to make a couple of points in the other direction I think we should keep in mind, going back to what Frank said earlier this morning, that GNP forecasts are subject to a plus or minus 1-1/2 percentage point error He was concerned about the plus 1-1/2, but let's not completely forget the fact that the minus 1-1/2 is a potential also And there are a number of things out there that could point toward weakness some of the rates of increase are slowing down; industrial production and retail sales are not exciting; you have potentially serious financial conditions in the Southwest I'm not 100 percent convinced that we are out of the woods with regard to the lagged effects of the slow growth of the monetary aggregates in 1987 Capital expenditures look like they are going to be up, but new orders are down right now So, there is some cause to keep our eyes open, looking in the rear view mirror if you will, looking at the downside  In the area of inflation, if I may quote you from this morning, Mr Chairman, let's stay with the numbers Bob Heller was looking at how inflation has been flowing in the last few months If you look at the PPI particularly, but also the CPI, on a month-to- month basis against the same month a year ago, both of the indexes have fallen every month for the last six months--and that includes February, the latest figures So, while inflation certainly has the potential to rise--I see that the same as everybody else here--it absolutely is not here yet And I don't think it is unreasonable to expect, particularly with a 48 percent fourth-quarter GNP, that if inflation were going to show up, it would have begun to do so by now So that makes me wonder if we aren't looking at some things that could be fundamentally different in that area than we're used to I don't know that I believe that, or that it is true, but one begins to wonder In short, Mr Chairman, I think there is concern about the possible downside risks and perhaps some time to take continuing readings on the inflation side; so, I would be somewhat slow to jump on the assumption that things are going to get away from us on the upside "
3419,1988-05-17," Mr Chairman, when Bob Forrestal spoke a few minutes ago I wish that I had been the next one on the list and I could have simply said ""me too"" I think that it's a time to wait, given the evidence to date and the two recent moves, which I agree were not insignificant I would be in favor of ""B"" and keeping the same borrowing for now, with asymmetrical language But, as Bob    5/17/88  suggested, I'd be comfortable with going an additional $100 million now with symmetrical language   Six; and six are voters   Just say the intermeeting period   It means you recognize what you saw   Tom, let me ask you to comment on something a bit more mundane and workaday I think how we employ a device such as this has a lot to do with whether or not it's useful in the first place And I wonder how we could reliably use it without so diluting it that it becomes punchless As I look back four quarters, and also include the current quarter, I notice that the first month in four out of the five quarters grossly exceeds the parameters on the upside Then are those--   Well, I have a chart here that the Board's staff puts out on annualized growth rates on a month-by-month basis; it  -30-    5/17/88  doesn't go back very far but it does go back a year; and it includes April, so I'm taking the liberty of including this quarter For some reason--and maybe there is a reason--[monetary growth in] the first month of each quarter, four out of the five times, is way over the parameter On both sides of the first months, there are much lower figures And I ask myself what we would do if we [were operating under] your proposal It says that no quarter would be permitted either to exceed the upper limit or fall below the lower limit Well, in four of the last five quarters--taking the liberty of including this one--you have a huge number in the first month, which kind of comes out of the blue, because it follows two much lower months, and then in turn, is followed by two much lower months And I ask myself what would we be liable to do if we sat down at this table when we just got a brand new figure that was way over [the upper limit] in the light of the pattern we have seen here in the last year or so How could we protect ourselves against that phenomenon?   Yes   If you look at the first month, it's like the kind of thing that Peter deals with every day, with regard to the maintenance period For instance, let's take October the October number was 11 percent on an annualized basis It was followed by November at 69 percent and December at 31 percent; it averages out fine But if we had sat down here and looked at that 11 percent in October we might have been moved to do something precipitous   April was 123 percent   That wasn't meant as a criticism, just as a problem you have to work through if it's going to be useful "
3442,1988-06-29," Manley, excuse me for interrupting you, but went further than that He said there will be no inflation  pressures generated by wage pressures He made that flat statement   That's a fast turnaround in two weeks   Mr Chairman, let me, if I may for just a moment, bring a slightly different point of view to this thing My main concern is that we need to have a good economy in 1989 and forward from there I'm asking myself what is liable to be the economic forecast forward from the second quarter of next year And the reason for this is I think it's very important that the next President, whoever he is [unintelligible]--  [Secretary's note The transcript of Mr Kelley's remarks ends in mid-sentence; in addition, there is no record of Ms Seger's comments on the economy However, a general statement of their views is contained in their dissents from the policy decision at this meeting Those dissents were included in the policy record of the meeting that was published several days after the following meeting The transcript resumes with Mr Kohn's report on the long-run policy alternatives]   Well, I will ""ditto"" Governor Heller exactly I would reaffirm '88 and go for II at this time for '89, for the reasons he just articulated   I'm pretty much where Gary Stern is I would prefer not to make a further move at this point and to have asymmetric language But I'm comfortable with your suggestion and would be happy to support it   That's right   I'd like to associate myself with that   I have a comment before we vote, if I may, for clarification   Before we vote-- As Norm just read it, the third line there would read that we were increasing pressure, which would be associated with alternative ""C"" The $50 million estimate falls far short, in my view, of alternative ""C"" And I would not use that word   I would use maintain as being better associated with a $50 million increase   I would start having problems with using the language connected with alternative ""C"" and also using asymmetric language "
3507,1988-09-20," Second   Mike, if you would for just a second speculate on the other side of the suggested policy recommendation for taking federal funds up to 9-1/2 and 10 percent--the possibility that that might induce a recession somewhere along the line What would be the implications of a recession let's say in late 1989 or early 1990 if you began to see the federal deficit burgeoning and so forth? What would be the broad brush of a scenario of a recession, given the larger picture of where we are on the deficit and the new president in place trying to get new policies established and so forth?   I wanted to very briefly express something very similar to what Governor Heller just expressed, and I won't repeat it I'll simply say I'm coming from the same place that he is I had expressed before my concern about what could happen in the 1989-90 time scenario If the black box kind of thing begins to happen and we  -22-    9/20/88  slide over into a recession before we have a chance to adjust further the fiscal/monetary mix and the trade/consumption mix and so forth, I'll continue to have those concerns I have a very low level of enthusiasm for running a high risk of inducing a recession in the near future Hopefully, we do have some slowing going on and to quote Ed Boehne from a few minutes ago, I think that this is not a time to rush to judgment So I would prefer to watch and wait a little bit and see how things go   Include me in   That's where we can get a free lunch "
3549,1988-11-01," So move   Well, I don't have anything to add either, but I will! I hear a lot of consensus around the table as to where we are now, and a lot of well-taken warnings as to what could occur in the future And those warnings seem to be cutting in a variety of different ways What that tells me is that we simply must do what we'll do anyway, and that is be very watchful But it's a little bit too early at this point to reach any strong convictions as to what should be done, or which way things are going Now, like Peter Sternlight earlier in the morning when he was giving his report, I thought it was a good theme for the day and that is ""steady as she goes""   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, but I am sympathetic with those who expressed some interest in going to symmetric language both on the basis of what might be happening in the economy and also watching very carefully what happens to the aggregates in the upcoming period But for now, I fully support your recommendation "
3587,1988-12-13," Mr Chairman, first of all I'd like to report to you that, on behalf of the Board last night at dinner, I congratulated President Hoskins for having achieved his first objective and that is getting alternative ""A"" clear out of the Bluebook   And he told me that he was working closely with the staff to get back to a three-alternative Bluebook, and they will be ""B,"" ""C"", and ""D""!   Mr Chairman, first of all, I certainly concur that the economy is very strong and certainly stronger than I had expected it to be And I would anticipate being in favor of some further tightening But I'd like to return for just a second to a point that Ed Boehne made a little earlier, and maybe try to come down a little bit harder on it That point is that I think we need to try to be sure to maintain a very broad perspective on what is going on in the economy and in our society more broadly and on how best we might be sure to achieve our long-term goal of price stability Over the foreseeable horizon in the next year or two, I think it's in nobody's interest to allow--that's too strong a word--nobody's interest to have a recession occur There are a lot of things that need to be straightened out We all know what they are the budget deficit, buying our way out of the thrifts, working our way through the Texas banks, chipping away at LDCs Large money-center banks and maybe some others are going to need to raise some capital for risk-based capital It's probably not too irrelevant to look forward to the fact that the GATT issue is beginning to accelerate; we had some first shots here recently on that, and if we wind up in an environment of protectionism as that heats up, I think it could be unfortunate If we are in a bad economy, I think banking structure reform might very well be a victim of that in the Congress If we have a recession in the next year or two, I think it clearly is going to exacerbate our ability to make progress in just about all of those different areas We could wind up kicking the deficit sky high which could bring a terrible dilemma, in my view, to the FOMC because I don't know whether such an event would be highly inflationary or deflationary or maybe one then the other successively and both bad Clearly, it could put both the Administration and the Congress on the defensive across the board on a lot of issues that could be serious So, in short I can envision a scenario where if the economy were to go south too far too fast, we might wind up spending many more years trying to get to price stability than we would under some alternative scenarios I would simply like to say that it's my hope that as we do go forward here, we'd be very careful as to how aggressive we get We don't want to wind up with a Pyrrhic victory   Mr Chairman, I fully support your suggestion I would only add that as I have listened to the comments around the table about the gong-ringing possibility, it has been expressed as merely a matter of timing We may very well indeed need to ring the gong I don't think we need to do so now, because I think that there is at least some possibility that we may not need to ring it at all So, I just would like to have that possibility on the table "
3612,1989-02-07," Second   Mr Chairman, I have some concern about becoming too much of a Johnny one-note in this Committee when I speak but I would like to reiterate my point that we [should] look at monetary policy in a very broad context of the overall picture of the United States--its social and political and indeed international course and the economic mix I think there are some very major problems in the United States, and indeed in the world, that could be severely exacerbated if we are too aggressive, too fast S&Ls, LDCs, the budget deficit and what could happen to it under several different kinds of scenarios And I think that our anti-inflationary efforts, to which we all subscribe, deserve to be considered in that larger context In the meantime, for now it seems to me that as far as inflation fighting goes there are some pretty good things going on The dollar is behaving very well; the aggregates continue to be very slow, which is good; everybody, I believe, is pleasantly surprised at the sluggishness of inflation relative to what they might have expected  -20-    2/7-8/89  given what they saw going on a few months ago I'm not necessarily convinced that it's baked in the cake that we won't continue to be pleasantly surprised In short, I think we very well may need to do more as time goes on and, of course, we should watch that very carefully But for the moment it seems to me that things are going as well as they could and we should be quite careful not to create more problems than are already out there in the world, perhaps influenced by this body but not directly under the aegis of this body   Mr Chairman, I favor alternative ""I"" I think that with the 4 percentage point bands we have plenty of room to conduct policy either with number ""I"" or number ""II"" For that reason I wouldn't be upset with ""II;"" but in the interest of longer-term flexibility in the out period, as you suggested early on, I think it makes sense to move this in a more gentle manner I would also restate what Governor Johnson said early on if we do alternative ""I"" here we are lowering it by 1 full percentage point, which I think has plenty of message effect for now and leaves us the flexibility we'll need to do more easily what may be necessary as time goes on   It has been repeated many times   That's the [unintelligible] language   Yes   That explains why you have ranges in the first place   Mr Chairman, I think this has been an excellent discussion; there is a great deal to be said on both sides of these issues It's not surprising in the light of all the ambiguity out there; I think it's rather what one would expect As I consider how to come down on this issue, I'd have a great deal of concern if we were doing nothing now--as everyone here would But I don't think that's the case For one thing, as I understood our expectations at the last meeting we were expecting the funds rate to settle basically on the shy side of 9 percent In fact, it has been on the plus side of 9 percent So, to some extent, you could say that we already may have gotten one extra tranche of tightening than we had expected to get at our last meeting And I fully support that I think it was entirely appropriate and was well done Nevertheless, it has been there The aggregates are growing very slowly and I think that's entirely appropriate; but I would be concerned if they went very much slower than they are I think it makes some sense to try to hold them around where they are The dollar has implications when it goes in both directions but I think the way it's going now it is on the strong    2/7-8/89  side and supports an anti-inflationary stance Whatever the yield curve may be telling us, it is inverted enough that it is clearly on the anti-inflationary side So, I think we are moving cautiously and appropriately and I am very comfortable supporting your proposal "
3638,1989-03-28," Second   Second   Second   Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman I'm sensing that the theme of this conversation is that it's time for a pause, and I certainly share that Consequently, I can comfortably support your suggestion But I would like to repeat what Governor Johnson said a little earlier when we were touching on the matter of lags, and that is Have we put into place already enough [restraint] that will get us what we want? It's in that sense that at this moment I'm in no hurry to tighten While I would agree that we certainly don't want to be perceived as backing off in any way--that caveat having been given--I really personally would prefer symmetric language "
3664,1989-05-16," Governor Johnson just covered exactly the points I wanted to raise, Mr Chairman, so I pass Thank you   May I come back again?   Don, could you explain that? From where we are right now on M2, given the prospect of perhaps a 3/4 of a percentage point higher funds rate, it's a little unclear to me how we'll wind up at a substantially higher M2 for the year than we're running now   Am I hearing you say that part of that depends on this 3/4 of a percentage point increase coming late in the year?   If it comes late in the year it clearly won't   Okay, thank you   Mr Chairman, I agree with the thrust of most of what I'm hearing said around here But at the risk of becoming a bit of a Cassandra of the FOMC, which I certainly don't want to do, I think that we're probably getting to the point where it should be on the table for us to keep a weather eye out to the possibility of a substantially worse result than anyone has heretofore addressed Governor Angell and others have talked about the aggregates and their slowness; that has been going on now for two years with a little hiatus in the winter a year ago when we had the stock market problem It has probably been more severe most recently than it has at any other time over that period With that as a background, we now see an economy that is slowing to an extent that I think surprises all of us a little, compared to where we were at the last meeting or even compared to the Greenbook that was written hardly a week ago How far and how fast can this go? I'm not sure that we can be very confident that we're not beginning to see the first of some downside momentum here I'm not predicting that; that's not where I am, but I do think that we've reached the point where we need to keep a weather eye out for that Governor Heller points out that the prospects for exports are getting a little less rosy It's hard to see housing and construction coming back I don't think there will be any fiscal stimulus; we may actually get some reduction in the deficit but I certainly wouldn't anticipate any further stimulus from that I hope that fixed investment will hold up; I will keep my fingers crossed on that one That puts it all back on the head of the consumer and we all know the consumer can be very fickle Again, I would emphasize that that's not my forecast and it's certainly not my hope But I do think that it's worthwhile for us to begin to keep that on the table as a part of the consideration   Mr Chairman, I strongly support your suggestion In the light of the surprisingly weakening economy that we see now, I think that is eminently called for On the borrowings, Governor Johnson noted that we've been running pretty much at $565 million for some time now, so I could support either $500 million with leeway up $65 million or $600 million with leeway down $35 million "
3706,1989-07-05," Moved   Mr Chairman, we continually and, of course, properly discuss the risks and how they vary--from inflation kicking up as a result of too strong an economy versus making progress on inflation as a result of the slowdown I find myself very much with Governor LaWare; he really made my speech and I certainly won't repeat it But one word that I think was in his remarks bears some emphasis, and that's the fragility of this situation However you assess the risks, it seems to me that the fragility on the down side is quite substantial and should be recognized as an element therein Another thing that I think was in his remarks that I'd like to emphasize is the consequences of which way these risks fall If we wind up with a somewhat stronger economy than we think, then inflation will probably carry along for a while and it's hard to say exactly how it will behave But I don't hear anyone saying that there is any risk of inflation running away from us on the up side On the other hand, I think the consequences of seeing a downside result could be very severe indeed, in terms of the larger social picture of the country and where we are and what we're trying to do in this country And I think as we assess the risks, however you come out on where the risks are, it's useful to think in terms of the composition of those risks and the consequences of having the risks fall out in either of the two directions that they could go So I think it's worthwhile to consider those two aspects fragility, which seems to me to be wholly on the down side; and the consequences of the result that we might realize in either direction, which also seems to me to be far more severe on the down side, should it work out that way   Mr Chairman, I find myself very much down the same track as the last several speakers There is a high degree of uncertainty here that I think we need to recognize I certainly appreciate Ed Boehne's point that long-run price stability is a means toward the larger end of sustainable prosperity In terms of signal effect, I think there are other signals that are important to send to the market and to the economy and the most important may be stability of performance on the part of the Fed Moderation and balance would be some of the hallmarks of achieving that stability signal As a consequence of all of those things, I would urge that we maintain the current ranges   Second   Mr Chairman, I certainly support your prescription I would like to suggest when it's in order--now or later--a reordering of the presentation of our list of concerns in the policy directive Would that be in order now? Or would you prefer to do that later?   Thank you, Mr Chairman I assume we're proceeding to discuss the ordering of our concerns   I wanted to make a suggestion along that line, if I might First of all, in the spirit of your comment that anything that goes into these directives that is different from what has been there heretofore is very carefully scrutinized, we should think about it carefully In that spirit, my suggestion is more in the nature of putting something on the table rather than trying to push for its immediate adoption I would suggest that we consider reversing the order of the first two of these considerations that appear in lines 63 and 64 of the operational paragraph and give more emphasis to the strength of the economy as opposed to inflationary pressures This arises out of the notion, discussed here earlier today and before, that in monetary policy price stability is a very important and essential precondition to a larger end--that it's the means toward a larger end of sustainable growth I think sustainable growth is driven by a wide variety of different factors as well as monetary policy in the interplay of all sorts of things We carefully tried to assess the risks to our forecast and whether or not the economy might turn out to be stronger or weaker than the forecast Everybody has slightly different views on that, but it does seem fairly clear and fairly consensual that the risks are for a slower economy than we have seen heretofore That's not really my point; my point, as I tried to allude to yesterday afternoon, relates to the consequences of events falling out meaningfully on one side or the other of the consensus forecast on the economy It seems to me that the consequences of the economy being somewhat stronger are not terribly severe For one thing, it's hard to see the economy being very much stronger than the forecast given the 30 months of aggregate growth history that Governor  -59-    7/5-6/89  Angell alluded to earlier and given the nature of the incoming evidence on what's going on in the real economy It's very difficult for me to see that inflation could get away from us in some way that we couldn't go back and reassess On the other hand, if events fall out on the weak side, I think that the consequences are very asymmetrical in the sense that they could be much more severe than if they should turn out to be on the strong side If we could be confident that we could fine-tune this soft landing and have a period of slow growth that would eventually, at some point down the line, begin to gradually turn up, that would be very nice But we all know we can't necessarily count on being able to do that And I am very concerned about the nature of the factors that Governor LaWare discussed yesterday afternoon that have to do with the fragility, particularly of the financial structure, at this time I certainly don't think I need to go back over that; everybody is aware of that But there are factors out there of very large magnitude, other than monetary policy, that could put us in a situation where we could have a downturn that could feed upon itself with very severe consequences in the larger picture of the economy and the society Indeed, should we get into a severe recession with ballooning deficits it could turn out to be very counterproductive in making long-term progress toward price stability So, it seems to me that largely as a result of the asymmetrical consequences of how events might turn out, this might be a time that we should give more priority overtly to what's going on in the economy relative to what's going on strictly in the narrower consideration of inflation So I would propose for consideration, either now or later Mr Chairman, that those first two considerations be reversed   Well, as I indicated early on, I entirely subscribe to that notion; but I did want to get that on the table "
3732,1989-08-22," So move  MRJOHNSON Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think we have had our usual excellent comments around the table this morning I have very little to add to those But it might be useful to take just a minute or two to look at the larger scene, if I may My sense is that there are a number of very important and very major issues that are at or reaching the stage where there could be some major breakthroughs or major breakdowns, whichever that may turn out to be The condition of the United States economy is a very, very important factor in every one of them and something that this Committee might well consider when  -35-    8/22/89  it looks at policy I will just run through a few of them in no special order On the domestic side, we now have a bill in the thrift area and we're moving into the resolution stage We all know it's going to cost an awful lot of money at the best But it seems to me that the cost could just go completely out of sight if we get into a recession scenario, particularly given some of the other real estate conditions that have been alluded to here this morning I think we all would probably agree that the fiscal budget deficit requires resolution, and it seems to me that somehow or another we are managing to approach a breakthrough there I hope it's going to happen; there has been some progress, and it's in the balance right now But one thing is certain, it seems to me, and that is that if we fall into a recession any resolution in the near term on the fiscal budget just goes into a cocked hat completely I'm not sure that much has been mentioned here before on this war on drugs But I think it has now gotten to the point where it has become a national economic issue Indeed, I think it's tearing into the whole social [fabric] of the country We're groping for a way to deal with that, but it's going to take money And that's going to be all new money; it has to come from somewhere Perhaps even more importantly, it needs to have the focus of our population and of our political leadership If we get into a recession scenario, that will probably pre-empt almost everything else and the war on drugs might well go onto the back burner--and in the process get worse for however long it takes to get it back on the front burner again And I think that would be devastating  Internationally, we have the great agony of the situation of the LDC debt We have managed, hopefully, to get a solution in Mexico--and very quickly I should extend my congratulations to all concerned But on the situation in the Philippines there's a long way to go If we fall into a recession scenario I wonder if the banks aren't going to turn out to be even more difficult to deal with than they already have been in those further negotiations On an even broader conceptual basis, it seems to me that it's fairly clear around the world now that everyone agrees that communism has failed and capitalism is the way to go We are past the stage where that had to played out but we're entering a new stage that may be even trickier And that is How do those communist countries get from where they've been to where they want to go? This country is a model for that and I think that we're going to be called upon to be of some help in various ways Poland is probably in the lead right now, but there are any number of others trying to get on that track And I think that it's important that we be able to demonstrate a steadfast strength in our economy as that begins to play out A bit more specifically, it seems to me that there's an opportunity now at long last to have a really serious disarmament situation develop We have made some progress on that; conditions seem to be right But I think that we ought to realize that the USSR is still the same type of country it was before; and if they perceive weakness on the part of the United States, economically or otherwise, or some divergence of our attention, they would be as [unintelligible] as they ever have been And we might well find ourselves in a situation where excessive defense spending has to keep on rolling So, for all these reasons I think that we have to be very careful as we assess this economy and try to calibrate it, to the extent that we can do that We have to be very careful that we don't push our luck too hard because there is a great deal at stake in this era that we're entering into right now Thank you  -36-    8/22/89   Mr Chairman, I favor ""B"" with asymmetric language I think we're much more likely in the intermeeting period to desire to ease than to tighten and I think the directive should reflect that Furthermore, even if one assesses the risks as symmetric or close to symmetric, I think the consequences of an error on the down side are far more [severe] than on the up side So, for both of those reasons I would prefer asymmetric language; but I could support symmetric   The way we're going--   I would appreciate having Norm run through the rest of that sentence, if he would "
3758,1989-10-03," Second   Approximately the same magnitude   Mr Chairman, I have adopted a self-imposed task of delivering jeremiads from time-to-time about things that are going on that are somewhat outside the economy and present a backdrop against which we need to apply policy I'm not going to repeat that this morning, but I would just like to get on the table the fact that there are a host of very important challenges and problems in the economy that are very urgent and on which, in many cases, we seem to have an opportunity to make some substantial progress They are not economic in many cases; but in virtually every case they are substantially impacted by economic events and economic conditions As I look at the economy, I'm close to where I think Governor Johnson and President Black and others are in that it's hard for me to see where meaningful strength can come from and relatively easy to see where weakness can come from And that gives me some pause I would suggest that we ought to be rather sensitive to emerging weakness and be quite careful that we don't induce something through policy that would turn out to be counterproductive to society in a larger sense   Mr Chairman, I support alternative B with asymmetric language toward ease That's where we are now and I see no reason to change it I concur with Governor LaWare that the risks on the dollar are certainly there; you articulated them beautifully But I also believe that that's going to have to be played out on a day-by- day basis It's a little hard to know how that's going to go I think that you and the Committee can and will adequately take that into account as events unfold Meanwhile, I think the potential for weakness in the economy and the consequences of it--if we get it and it gets away from us--are severe I may be a cockeyed optimist but I think there's a possibility that we will continue to get better inflation results than expected As a consequence, it seems to me that your proposal is appropriate   You'd get a pretty darn good argument if you did! "
3807,1989-11-14," Did you say national disaster?  -19-    11/14/89   Mr Chairman, I think one of the times when you have to be careful is when you get what you want, which is pretty much what has happened here It's a time to be careful because you have to develop a pretty careful view of what it is that you want to do next We have the slowing that we looked for and that does leave us with the questions that Governor Johnson raised a little while ago How slow is it going to get? How slow do we want it to get? And a more practical question is What are the best ways to influence the process properly? To me, this quest for price stability that we're all on and believe in is playing itself out against the background of some pretty powerful and large forces The inflationary forces we pretty well understand We have an overemployed and overconsuming economy and all that that represents But I'm haunted by what seem to be some underlying disinflationary forces that I wish I understood better than I do They seem to me to be having a powerful influence, perhaps, on the favorable results we've been getting over the last year on inflation Given the very full economy that we've got, inflation did not take on a life of its own to the extent that we might have expected it to a year ago It seemed to stop what upward momentum it had before there was really much of an apparent slowdown in the economy I wonder what underlies that? The major force that I can see is that there seems to be a tremendous amount of very low cost capacity in a wide variety of industries and commodities around the world And capital is doing a very efficient job of seeking that out and exploiting it and holding costs down I think the downsizing of GNP that you've spoken of very eloquently, Mr Chairman, is a factor It seems to me that we may be entering an era where we're servicing debt more than creating debt, which is deflationary I don't know what all those forces are, if I can use that word, but they seem to be manifested in this profit squeeze that we have going on now--with costs being pushed up and the inability to pass that on through prices That would be inflationary But it can't go on forever; something has got to give I certainly hope it's on the cost side But maybe a key conceptual approach from a policy standpoint is that we really don't want either side to win too terribly conclusively If inflation becomes dominant, we know what that scenario would be and that's unacceptable In the slowdown scenario that we have here, it may be time to begin to think a bit  -23-    11/14/89  about the power of those underlying deflationary forces--I guess I should say disinflationary at this point; they could become deflationary and lead us into some really serious problems that might be avoidable I don't know that that's something that we have to deal with right now but I think it's something that we should keep in the back of our minds and strive to understand or get a better grasp on-- at least better than I have Thank you   Along with mine   Mr Chairman, I support your suggestion of ""B"" asymmetric I think that weakness is far more apparent than strength and I think we need to be very careful with it here ""B"" is where we  -32-    11/14/89  are now and I would certainly hate to appear, however implicitly and indirectly, to be taking a stronger stance than we presently have I think it's extremely likely that any change that we would make in the intermeeting period would be to the accommodative side and that we should reflect that in the directive I also do not think that that precludes -he possibility that we can continue to make some small progress on inflation, as we have done in recent months and quarters "
3834,1989-12-18," Mr Chairman, I have to come at this necessarily from a non-professional economist point of view and I happen to have a share in trying to form policy So as I listen to this presentation, I try to ask myself What does it make sense to do? And I see a situation here where we've got huge uncertainties Many of them are in the model and are admitted right up front; they necessarily have to be there A lot of them can't possibly be in the model, even though we may know what some of them are Then, of course, there are a whole host of them we don't even know about that might [arise] as time goes on It's easy to see, as Governor Seger points out, that there are potential human costs here; and they are huge if we make a mistake We haven't taken a look yet at what the possible second five-years might be as a result of getting out to where we get in this model And what, of course, may quite possibly be the biggest threat of all of this is the political threat that we could very easily set out on this course, incur all of the costs, and have the political realities abort the process before we got the benefits That might be the worst of all worlds and, possibly, a fairly plausible one So, what might make sense is to do two things that sound fairly simple and simplistic, but may be a pretty good challenge in themselves One is simply to work to get the trends moving in the right direction without any terribly close attention to the slope of the curve--just get them moving in the right direction The second is to work very hard to damp the volatility around the slope of those curves To me the speed of advance is of secondary importance If we can get it moving in the right direction, given all of these uncertainties, I think sometimes we'll be able to make fairly rapid progress and other times slow progress; sometimes we'll be doing well to hold our ground If we get into a recession we might even have to take one step back But basically [we should] try to figure out ways to set up conditions where we will be able to get the slope of the curves moving in the correct direction over time, without having to give too terribly much attention to any one particular time period   [I knew someone was] going to say that!   Absolutely   You're right   Mr Chairman, I apologize for jumping the gun a little before the break; I didn't know where you were going with the second half of the afternoon But let me add another point It seems to me that if we set a specific time objective two things are going to follow--the second from the first If we think we're getting too much media attention and Congressional attention now on the subject of monetary policy, we ""ain't seen nothing yet!"" If we announce a firm policy and proceed to put things stringently in force toward that, I think we're going to have people looking over our shoulder like we never dreamed of before Indeed, we're starting to look over our own shoulder, which leads to my second point And that is, I think in the interest of our own credibility that we would run a risk--it may be even more than a risk, it would almost be inevitable I think--that we would have to overshoot We would have to set policies that would overshoot making that goal, and we would run a very severe risk if we did that That leads me to say that, as a practical matter, it seems to me that we would adopt a very tight specific time frame only if we intended to be absolutely single-minded about meeting it That would mean meeting it--whatever shocks might show up, whatever uncertainties there may be in the information that's available to us, and whether they should happen to have severe consequences--regardless of what other national priorities might come along that would have an impact upon by monetary policy And it's hard, indeed impossible, to foresee all those things When I spoke in terms of getting the trend in the right direction, Jerry, I'd be perfectly comfortable with a definition of getting a trend in the right direction as having a properly and carefully defined but very general definition of price stability by the mid-'90s That's a level of specificity that I'd be happy to live with as being a way to move toward getting trends in the right direction and sustaining them  -41-    12/18-19/89   When all else fails!   Yes sir   Mr Chairman, I guess I've learned to think like an economist in one respect by thinking on the one hand and then on the other hand On the one hand, it's very clear that we have a weakening economy and it's very clear that a recession is highly undesirable for a whole host of reasons--the fragility that has been mentioned and many other things That would argue, I think, for an accommodation to buy ourselves a little insurance for next spring, summer and fall On the other hand, I do have great concern that we    12/18-19/89  should to the best of our ability ensure that we keep the inflation trend moving in the correct direction And I think that argues for being a little cautious Also, in the area of reducing fluctuations around the trend line, that argues for being a little cautious particularly since the aggregates--M2 particularly--show a fairly high level of strength I definitely share your concern, Governor Angell, about the possible bind we could find ourselves in if the dollar should suddenly go south in a serious way So, on the one hand and on the other hand, Mr Chairman, I come out [balanced], which leads me to think that perhaps we ought to keep our cards pretty close to the chest for a while   Mr Chairman, I could be comfortable going in either of the two directions that have been suggested in this conversation As I look at the sack of apples and the sack of oranges, they weigh about the same on the scale My head tells me to hold fire and not change now, but my tummy tells me that the economy needs, and can get, a confidence boost if we do a small move now So, I come down on the side of concurring with your suggestion   May I make an alternative suggestion, Mr Chairman? I've heard a lot of discussion that I think was important today and yesterday in the area of foreign exchange and domestic financial markets as well I'm hard pressed to know what the order of these ought to be And it strikes me that if there's merit in that, one thing we might do is insert the word ""equal"" in line 63 before ""taking account""--that is, ""taking equal account of the progress toward price stability"" and so forth "
3861,1990-02-06," No comment   Well, Mr Chairman, let me put on the table something that I know everyone here is very aware of but that I don't think has been explicitly mentioned yet, and that is that we are living in a time right now of really incredible, momentous events in the world I won't try to run the litany and I don't want to be too dramatic But I think we may very well be in a time where there is a sea change going on that happens rarely in history I think it's very, very important that we have a reasonably comfortable economy for the Administration to operate in, given this environment and this geopolitical era that we're in And I think so far we have it As I  -22-    2/6-7/90  listen to the reports and read the statistics and read the Beigebook, indeed, I think the forecast that we all seem to share quite closely is satisfactory and meets that criterion But I also share a lot of the concerns that the two gentlemen on my left and right mentioned when they spoke I don't know what has happened to this corner over here, Mr Chairman Maybe you should separate us! But I share the concerns about what could happen and I think it's very, very important that we keep a weather eye out, particularly in the kind of environment that we share right now in the world  As far as monetary policy goes, I agree with everyone else here that it's essential first of all that we not allow [inflation] to increase, and indeed that we knock it down and make some progress toward stable prices over time Hopefully, we're doing that right now and can do it this year But I must say that, in economic terms, I don't think it's terribly shabby that we're holding [inflation] steady in the strong economy that we have had over the last couple of years, coming off of the kind of history that we've had over the course of the last ten years In historical terms and in political terms--political in the big good sense of the word political--I think maybe we should be willing to accept some risk that this is the best we can do right here rather than be too terribly macho in the direction of trying to knock inflation down very rapidly at considerable risk to some other issues that may be larger   Mr Chairman, I completely support all of the thinking that has been presented on alternative II and identify with that easily But I'd like to suggest that we consider leaving the ranges at the tentative rates that we set last summer, which incidentally are the same rates that we had in 1989 The differences are in M3 and in debt M2, importantly, is the same in the tentative ranges and in alternative II; the other measures have technical downward adjustments in alternative II As we look at criteria for the selection of ranges, I think it's important to try to project forward as much stability as we can, as much continuity of policy as we can and, insofar as we're signaling the market, as much clarity as we can I'm concerned that, if we make these small changes to two of the three tentative ranges and leave one the same, we may be projecting that there's some deep subtlety that really doesn't exist The message would be clearer and the policy would be in substance essentially the same if we left the tentative ranges in place   You can't describe it as alternative II anymore   ""B,"" symmetric, Mr Chairman I really have no new thoughts to add to those that have already been suggested   Some of you are still there!  -53-    2/6-7/90 "
3887,1990-03-27," Second   Moved   I would never, particularly coming from somebody who [was a banker] for 35 years! Mr Chairman, we always are looking for one more piece of data; that goes on forever But I am struck this time more than usual by the tentativeness of the data that we're looking at and the tentativeness of the forecast that we're able to make I hear it from the staff and I hear it going around the table here this morning in both the area of the real economy and in inflation expectations What's going on in the economy now is to some degree--and we don't know to what degree--the snapback from strikes and from storms and from the whipsawing in the auto industry Some of the industries that are showing some strength, like housing, have big seasonals at this time of the year And it's just really hard to tell how much of what is going on is sustainable and is real underlying strength I also share John's and others' concerns about what we may be in for in terms of the extent of the credit crunch and what the results of that could be  On the inflation front, the forecast is that what we have seen in the last several months is going to unwind to some degree I've been very disappointed, as I think everybody else has, in the numbers we've seen the last several months The expectation is that that's going to unwind to some degree, but by how much? We're going to have to see about that Meanwhile, as Governor Johnson pointed out, the PPI really is not validating that bad result that we've seen in the CPI and in the deflators So, I go back to what Bob Parry said a little earlier in the morning that what we need to do is to maintain moderate growth I agree with that I'm not sure what it's going to take to do that, on balance, with the other objectives that we have And like Gary Stern, I'm a little concerned that we not overreact to two or three months' worth of numbers and wind up whipsawing the economy I certainly share the disappointment that I hear everyone expressing; I agree 100 percent about the last few months and I share the impatience that goes along with that But given all that we cannot be sure of at this moment, I'm pretty cautious about what policy ought to do   Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation I think that it would be premature, based on the tentativeness of the data, for us to move as yet The decision is obviously between moving a bit in the direction of tightness or staying where we are And I would suggest that we're getting a little tightening through whatever degree of credit crunch is going on out there, and I think there's at least some Also, unless the G-7 does something to turn it around, my personal bet would be that for awhile at least we're going to see a rising dollar We certainly have it in the yen and I would bet that on balance we're going to get it in the trade-weighted calculation generally So, I would enthusiastically support your recommendation   Second "
3921,1990-05-15," Second   Well, Mr Chairman, when Mike finished his presentation a little while ago he made the remark that there are a lot of jokers still in the deck to be turned over I certainly agree with that But when you're playing a hand of cards there are those things that you know and those things that remain to be seen If we look at the things that we know, they don't look that bad Obviously, as the cards turn over, things could change a lot But we know, looking at interest rates, that we lowered the federal funds rate in December and interest rates have been up ever since then We have had some tightening done for us by the market Along with that, the aggregates have now slowed down a lot I don't want to prejudge or put words in Don's mouth--he hasn't made his presentation yet--but I suspect he thinks they're likely to speed back up But if they keep doing what they're doing now, then we're going to have a pretty slow rate of growth in the aggregates in 1990 Looking at the gross national product, the best guess is that its growth is now running around 2 percent and the two preceding quarters before that were 11 percent and 21 percent That's clearly slow; it could reaccelerate There has been talk around this table that at a 2 percent growth rate we could make slow progress, but nevertheless progress, on inflation If you look at inflation as measured by the CPI, we had an appalling first quarter but the two quarters before that were both under 4 percent; and I think the increase is probably slowing down substantially from that bad first quarter now  John talked about the credit crunch I think everybody would agree that there's something going on out there and we don't know what effect it's liable to have Nevertheless, there is some constraint and it could be substantial So, the things that we know, taken all- in-all, suggest that the state of the world is not terribly unsatisfactory I think our policy pretty much has done what we desired it to do; it's too early to say that it has been ineffective in making some progress on the core rate of inflation Core inflation could certainly change on the up side and, if it does, we undoubtedly will have to react But I think that's far from sure As a consequence, for now ""steady-as-you-go"" makes sense to me   ""B"" symmetric, please sir "
3945,1990-07-02," Mr Chairman, in the brief time that I've been on this Committee I can't remember an intermeeting period where it seems to me that less has changed I almost have the sense that since May 15th we've been in a kind of suspended animation, with no startling new strengths or weaknesses showing up Maybe the most important news is what didn't happen Inflation was scary in the first quarter; we all expected and hoped that it would slow, and fortunately it has done that So far the credit crunch hasn't eaten us alive It still could, I suppose, but usually these things have a way of either gaining momentum or losing momentum My sense is--and I hope it's correct--that it is not gaining momentum Short term, I have some of the same concerns that Governor LaWare noted in the sense that a couple of things that are going on are unavoidable One is in the area of construction Commercial construction, housing--real estate generally--has probably not seen the bottom yet; and I worry about whether it could drag other things along with it excessively The automobile industry has been borrowing from the future for some time and that's going to catch up with them sooner or later And I must say that the notion of answering slow demand with rising prices strikes me as bizarre, and that's what they have just done It's clear that things are going to change if we have been in a period of suspended animation; maybe no one will agree that we have But shortly we will know much more than we know so far about the fiscal outlook For better or worse, that's going to become clear quite soon And perhaps as the next year develops, we're going to know much more about the impact of foreign events on our economy They promise to be profound, perhaps more so than they have been in the past But it seems to me that, for now at least, we can feel pretty good about the fact that our strategy continues to look like it's working and that we are on track that we largely have the conditions that we had hoped to get, and that there is a reasonable prospect that the results flowing from that will be the ones that we had hoped for So for the moment, I feel that the thing to do is to sit tight and watch closely   Mr Chairman, Bob Forrestal summed it up well for me when he started us off this morning I think our strategy is on track There are good prospects that it will work acceptably and I think we have reason to be fairly pleased so far And I would like to give that strategy every chance to work I think that strategy definitely calls for an inflation result on the strategy II matrix, but I'm not quite sure what necessarily is going to be required in the way of aggregates growth to achieve that As far as 1990 goes, I am definitely of the school of targeting and budgeting that would say we shouldn't shift in the middle of the game If we are missing the targets, then we should explain why we are missing them but not shift the target at that point in time So for that reason, I would reaffirm all the ranges for 1990 and, if we miss on M3, explain the technical reasons why that happened For 1991 I would stay with 3 to 7 percent for M2 because, given where it is now and where it looks like it is going to be in the rest of 1990, I would not be comfortable with the prospect of having an even lower number, 2 percent, be in the range of acceptability So, I would leave the target for M2 in 1991 at the 3 to 7 percent we presently have I have been convinced by Don and others that the M3 realities have changed As a consequence, for 1991 I would go to the 0 to 4 percent range because of those technical realities On the debt side, I could be comfortable with either 4 to 8 or 5 to 9 percent   If that is a substitute motion, I will second it   It doesn't ring right   I will second Governor LaWare's remarks "
3968,1990-08-21," Second   Mr Chairman, I'll be brief because my observations are very much in the mainstream of much of what has been said this morning In the area of inflation, pre-Iraq I think the news was already disappointing in that we really had made very little progress And now post-Iraq, we have an oil shock that is a virtual cinch to pick inflation up substantially So, I believe we do have a higher inflation outlook There is some concern that it might be substantially higher; that's a very clear and unequivocal threat In the area of real economic activity, I think pre-Iraq we have been getting pretty much what we had asked for--maybe a little on the soft side of that, but no real nose dive that was in any way perceptible And today, we have even more softness in prospect as a result of the oil shock So, the recent events are certainly not a plus and they certainly add to the risk and to the uncertainty But at least there is not yet much evidence that the economy is headed for the tank So, we do have an exacerbated inflationary situation and I think there is a clear need that that be minimized in a way that is most sensible to the rest of the economy and its progress Economic activity per the Greenbook may still be okay; I hope we get the Greenbook outlook and I think that probably would be okay  One question that I ask myself is If we did try to help the economy through easing, would it work? Would the medicine turn out to be as bad as the disease is in the first place? I'm not sure; perhaps some percentage thereof I'm not sure what would happen to long rates in that event I'm not sure what would happen to the dollar or the inflation rate And I'm not even very sure whether we would get the response we would be looking for from the consumer and on the investment side if we did that   Mr Chairman, I fully support your recommendation for ""B"" asymmetric toward ease, but I'm not as sure in my own mind that we really are locked into an eventual ease I think we may be surprised with the strength of the economy I also think that if we do contemplate ease, we're going to have to assess that very carefully to make sure that it is efficacious if we do ease "
3990,1990-09-07," This is Mike Kelley I concur with the recommendation for all the reasons that have been recited and would add just one more And that is, that the budget summit is reconvening and I'm not sure that a move now would be construed in a context we would like I think there would be a linkage made there, and not a good one "
4010,1990-09-17," This is Mike Kelley As I try to think through the risks and [unintelligible] characteristics of an easing here, I imagine that we probably could buy some insurance for the first and second quarters of 1991 How much of that would play through to real GNP and how much to inflation, I'm not sure On the other hand, on the cost side it seems to me quite likely that we would have a further substantial drop in the dollar, which could be a problem for a long time to come And possibly we run the risk of a surge in the core inflation rate here that we probably don't have presently I emphasize core rate of inflation It also seems to me likely that we would get a rise in long rates, which might well offset much of the benefit that we would hope to achieve from an easing of short rates On balance, the reward that we might get from an easing seems rather ephemeral whereas the costs seem quite substantial and long-running So, I would favor hanging tight for now "
4034,1990-10-02," Mr Chairman, let me focus for just a moment on the budget deal that was struck this past weekend It seems to me that the basic dilemma we have been struggling with for months now has been intensifying recently; even before the oil shock, the economy was having some problems We have a perception that we are going to weaken substantially, largely driven by the oil situation But even before that I was disappointed in the level of economic activity--in the second quarter, for instance In the case of the financial system, we know there is a lot of pressure there and a great deal of credit stringency in the banking system that is playing back into the real economy Taken by themselves, these kinds of factors would push one in the direction of easing On the other hand, the inflation situation seems to look worse, again driven by the oil situation But even before that occurred there was precious little progress being made; maybe there was some deterioration So, there's a concern that [higher prices] are becoming embedded, which would lead one in the direction of firming  So, what we needed was a way to break out of the impasse And we now have a fiscal deal I imagine everybody would define the ideal fiscal deal differently, but this one I'm sure is not it I would hope that it's a new genre in the shabby history of budget deals; I would hope that this one is going to turn out to be firmer and to have less smoke and mirrors in it than those we've had in the past We don't know that much about it yet, but it looks that way I've been trying to find more reports on the teeth that may be in the enforcement part of this and I haven't found very much yet But there is some evidence that there are teeth in it and that's encouraging It is a multiyear commitment, which I think we all felt was very important And I think it has a good configuration to it it's about the right size early on and then grows as it goes down the line Could it be another snow job? Oh, sure it could! We could turn out to be as disappointed as we've been in the past But if it works, I don't think it needs to be all that it is cracked up to be in order for it to do a lot for us It could go far toward restoring our fiscal health; it could help the saving rate a lot It would by definition, I guess, help the saving rate a lot It should help investment a lot, which I think is the absolute key to the future of this country's economy In the area of reducing inflation, it would seem to me that there is the possibility of more progress available here than in anything that we could do at this point through monetary policy by cooling excess demand and providing relative strength to the dollar In general, we've all been talking about the malaise in attitude that we have around the country and I think it could go a long way to [reversing] that Again, I don't think it has to be as good as it's touted to be in order to be highly beneficial If it's not passed, we're quite likely to be due for a very painful trip through the wringer If that should occur, I think the Fed is probably just going to have to look to the long-term best interests of the country and kind of let the short term fall out as it may But if  -33-    10/2/90  it's passed, it can only help--and perhaps can help a great deal The question is How much? Keeping in mind the fact that we're still going to have very large deficits to be dealt with for the next couple of years at the minimum, I think that if it's passed, we should be looking for appropriate ways to support it   I support your suggestion, Mr Chairman "
4059,1990-11-13," I'm glad you amended your question to say 1/4   Mr Chairman, I agree that the two options that have been mentioned most here are the two best ones either to do nothing or to delete the sentence It is an anachronism now; it has been an anachronism for a long time I don't see any compulsion to do anything about it right now, given the fragilities that we're all intensely aware of and have been discussing and given the fact that the Fed is in many ways at the center of the scrutiny and the concern about the fragilities I've heard no hue and cry on the part of anybody to do anything about this issue I would suggest that in this environment we leave it alone, although I could support deleting it if we were going to do anything at all   That's why you leave it alone   Clearly a regional view   That's where they learned how to do it  SPEAKER(?) Texas railroad commission!   It's a zip code   Well, Mr Chairman, by late in the day when it's your turn to speak, you always run the risk that by then somebody already has expressed your view And David just expressed mine As a consequence, I'll try not to be redundant I've been increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the specific composition of what's going on here We have been going through a series of rolling recessions in this economy for a decade I guess, and I would argue that on balance it's been a very positive experience Industries and indeed all regions have had an opportunity to go through a planned decline, to restructure, and to come out of it stronger And they've been doing it against a background of overall strength so that it has been able to be done rather quickly Although it's never any fun while you're in it, at least it's about as good a process as you could expect and it's rather healthy But we have two sectors going now that seem to me to be rather unique, and they are very interrelated and very interactive And, of course, those two are the real estate sector, where we are grossly overbuilt, and the financial institutions David just gave us a good [overview] on that and I won't repeat it But it seems to me that these two in decline together have the prospect of having a materially different effect on the economy than maybe almost any other two sectors that one can think of because of all the leverage they exercise on the rest of the economy First of all, they are felt everywhere and are not just in a specific constrained region or constrained industry; it's a drag across the board Secondly, there is the wealth effect on confidence  -36-    11/13/90  and on people that has to have some effect on buying decisions And perhaps it will come to have an effect on debt servicing But it's obviously essential to the growth of every industry; and there's enormous leverage when credit gets tight, as we all know Also, these two situations feed on each other It's going to be interesting to see how that process exhausts itself The asset quality of banks is being dragged down by real estate; on the other hand, you can't work through the real estate recession because the lack of credit is pulling down the ability of real estate to be moved and cleared out I don't know where else that could occur where we have that kind of interaction We've seen automobiles and agriculture going into the tank and they were not terribly interactive Energy and textiles were going into the tank and they were not terribly interactive But these two are And taken in tandem I worry that there's the potential for very serious mischief I would hope that we're going to watch that very closely and perhaps take out a little insurance against the possibility that these are the two that could get away from us on the down side   I support it, Mr Chairman   We ought to call all the Fed watchers right there "
4079,1990-12-07," Yes, yes "
4097,1990-12-18," Well, Mr Chairman, I guess I'm the last leaf on the bush and there's certainly very little left to be said about current conditions, as Governor LaWare just remarked But I would like to try to resurrect a perspective that I first offered, probably a little prematurely, a year or so ago as to the underlying longer- term thrust of what's going on here It seems to me that what we may be seeing is the first downturn in what may be a rather powerful and long-lived deflationary era--a sea change, if you will I think there's considerable evidence underlying that On a worldwide basis almost all commodities are abundant food, materials, heaven knows in this country built space, and labor Capital can seek out low cost labor and is mobile enough to get there and put production in place on a low-cost basis It seems that monetary policy has been under tight control for some time; there's not too much of a problem in sight there Hopefully, fiscal policy is turning around Maybe the most important thing on an economy-wide basis in this country is that I think we've gone from an era of creating debt, which was inflationary, to servicing debt, which is deflationary And if there's anything to all of this thesis, I think it can explain a lot of the financial problems and a lot of the real estate problems that we see And it may be manifesting itself in this long decline that we're going through in corporate profits, where firms are being squeezed between the last of the upward thrust of cost pressures and the inability to pass that through in the form of prices I don't think this is a done deal There are a lot of things--monetary, economic, political, sociological--that could change this and abort it But if this is true, it has implications for how we view everything If this is true, we may have a stickier short-term situation--a little slower in the near term to come out of the recession, but a far more positive longer-term outlook as time goes along and we do come out The converse of that would be if we're in another episode of what we've seen before in the postwar era If that turns out to be true, we could wind up with a quick, weak recovery and then fall back rather soon and be very disappointed But if it becomes clear that this is a new era and a disinflationary one, I think the long-term perspective is really quite positive But that does leave us with a near-term challenge to facilitate the weaning of the economy off of the inflation kick that it has been on for so long and to avoid the potential for deflation and serious contraction that that could lead to Thank you   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
4139,1991-02-05," You were just in time, Dick!   I'll second Mr Corrigan   Yes, I'd be interested also   Playing for the championship for the Second Federal Reserve District!   Mr Chairman, I would accept the staff's forecast or something close to it--maybe a bit less robust--as probably the most likely outcome And, certainly, it's positive and desirable But the concerns I have turn out to be ones that have run through this discussion over and over again That is, I am struck in a way that I've never been struck since I've been here that the risk of war analysis is very, very heavily skewed on the side of caution If we get a recession that is mild and ends soon and the rebound that follows it, that is going to present questions for monetary policy, without any doubt But they will be happy kinds of questions, if you will, and they are going to be in a positive context Again, that's probably the most likely scenario  But I think the positive consequences that would flow from that result are not nearly as significant as their mirror image on the down side--the negative consequences that could flow if we get the opposite scenario If the situation turns out to be much more severe, along the lines that Jerry described a few minutes ago, that could have some very nasty consequences that are much larger in scope than their positive counterparts on the other side They're broader in scope as far as their impact on our society goes, and I think they are far longer-lasting in the effect they could bring That has some likelihood, whatever it is, and it's certainly greater than zero-- perhaps 15 percent I don't know [the precise number], but there is certainly the statistical probability that we could get a much more severe result If we do, and if we wind up with the seriously crippled banking system that John LaWare fears, for instance, it would be very difficult for that kind of a banking system to make it to the time when the economy was coming back around I'm not sure where the financial contribution and support would come from if the banks have been crippled before that outcome started to take effect  Obviously, the process of watching the banking system become crippled, if that should evolve, would have a severe impact on  -35-    2/5-6/91  consumer and business confidence and would exacerbate the situation We could have a very, very large deficit built up, which would have a very long tail as far as its consequences go a much larger debt burden; the further fragility that would result from leveraging up the economy; and all those kinds of things that would follow from the leveraging up that we're all familiar with I think it would foreclose--or at least for a very long time severely impinge upon--a variety of social and political options that we need to have available to us in this country as far as rebuilding our infrastructure goes, [ranging] from education needs to rebuilding bridges It would have a very severe impact on business investment down the line and on various elements of our international position And I would think that it would have to have severe inflation implications that really aren't necessary for us to have to undergo Another point that I don't think is inconsiderable in the long-term scheme of things is that it would have a very severe impact on the possibility of constructive banking reform in the near future We think that the time may have come for an effective reform movement And if we got into a very severe recession right now, that would certainly doom the possibilities of the passage of a good package in the near term So, we have a severe skewing that I haven't been conscious of in my thinking before, and I think it necessitates our looking at some things that sometimes we don't have to spend a lot of time on--a broader array of considerations and potential downside concerns as well as some very long-lived potential downside results that we would all hate to see ensue All of which leaves me intrigued with the thought of investigating and considering further scenario 2 on the last exhibit   Mr Chairman, I support alternative I, as you suggest I think we've been talking about two sets of effects that the ranges have the signal effect and the guidance for actual policy Looking back at Appendix B, I note that over a period of years actual experience does track along with our intent in the sense that both the ranges and actual growth have been coming down gradually--since 1983 in the case of M2 But in any one year [growth] varies substantially inside the range So, actually, any of these three ranges would give us ample room to conduct policy as we might need to in order to accommodate the events over the course of the year But in the case of the signal effect, I think we're rather locked in to alternative I If we were to raise the ranges, it would send a bad sign to the market relative to our inflation [credibility]; if, on the other hand, we were to lower them, it would send a bad sign to the economy relative to our desire to help check this recession Therefore, I feel comfortable with the actual policy guidance effect of any of the three, but the signal effect leads me to alternative I   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for all the reasons that have been articulated here I would like at an appropriate time, now or later, to suggest a change in the order of the priorities of our considerations in the operational paragraph I don't know whether you'd like to pursue that now or do it as a separate item   Yes sir, if I may As it appears in lines 72 and 73 of the operational paragraph we have stated for some time that our order of priority was ""price stability"" followed by ""trends in economic activity"" My suggestion is that, to the extent we'd like to be forthcoming in this document, it might be an appropriate time to reverse the order of those first two priorities That would be  -59-    2/5-6/91  consistent with the reasons for our recent actions and I think it would be consistent with the Committee discussion that I've heard here yesterday and today We have an awful lot at stake in this economy and that is what we've been discussing But I don't think that a reversal of that magnitude would in any way indicate a downgrading of our consideration of inflation It's certainly going to continue to be vitally important to this Committee, and it shouldn't and won't be forgotten But at this time I think, for the record, it would be a more accurate reflection of the reality of the Committee's concerns to reverse the order of those first two priorities   Well, I don't know where--   Somehow I'd like to have everything be first, but that's difficult My suggestion would be simply to reverse the first two   It doesn't look like we do   Consider it withdrawn for lack of a second! "
4166,1991-03-26," So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Well, Mr Chairman, once again I'm the last leaf on the bush and the day is getting long, so let me be brief As I contemplate this recovery, I'm mentally migrating West; I'm going to be from Missouri for a while! We do clearly see very positive sentiment, but there are just no data as yet to support it And I think Gary's point earlier is worth repeating We have to be careful about this confidence business because at some point if it doesn't begin to get fulfilled, it will reverse on us That could happen rather quickly and I'm concerned about that  A couple of the pillars of the recovery we're hoping for strike me as being a little suspect Autos are a big ticket discretionary item and as such they're fickle The numbers aren't there yet and we're going to have to see them, I think, before we can be sure of them Also, in the case of exports, the G-7 countries are largely in a slowing mode and we're in a stronger dollar period, so I have to worry a little about the extent and timing of how that is  -39-    3/26/91  going to run As for inflation, I am very chagrined and disappointed that the core rate is so sticky so far And as far as the Greenbook's projection goes, the staff doesn't show it improving meaningfully until the second half of 1992, and that's a long time away I hope that David's inescapable logic is correct and that Gary Stern's is correct; I think there's good reason to hope that it may be But we should have been seeing it by now and we haven't as yet  So, where do the risks lie? In which direction are they liable to fall? It seems to me that Dick Syron and Ed Boehne were probably right that they are approximately symmetric right now But I would like to close with this point While the risks may be symmetric in both directions, I don't think the consequences are It seems to me that the potential consequences of an error on the down side are substantially more severe if we don't get--or if there is a significant delay in getting--the recovery The banking system, as John LaWare reminds us frequently and correctly, is shaky We hope to get reform, which I think might well go away if the economy doesn't improve The budget deficit could really spiral up, with all sorts of consequences So, while the risks might be symmetric, we should be very conscious and especially alert to the concern about the asymmetry of the consequences   Mr Chairman, I'm happy to support ""B"" symmetric but I would personally have a slight preference for asymmetric toward ease because of the asymmetry I see in the consequences of a shortfall "
4188,1991-04-12," This is Mike Kelley in Portland, Oregon I'd like to come in at this point because that exactly expresses my sentiments, John I'm with you on that I ask myself if this combination of factors that we've been running through here this morning is not exactly what one would expect at about this sort of an inflection point [in the cycle] And I ask myself if it's not too early to [decide] that the economy requires further stimulus We have one good bunch of inflation numbers and I wonder if that's enough of a robin's flight to assure us that we have spring I think we should have had better inflation numbers before now and we haven't; and I would very much like to have their better tone verified a little more than by having just one set of them As I listen to the presidents about the real economy, it seems to be very mixed, not definitely down Again, I suspect that that may be about what one would expect in the way of a report at this point We always feel that we need more data; but to me this is one time when we really do need more data I would prefer that we wait to see how things are verified in    4/12/91  one direction or another However, I do agree with John that it's important--and others have said this--that we show a level of togetherness here if we possibly can do so So, I would not be completely opposed to making a move at this time if that seems to be the way that we should go   Yes, sir "
4202,1991-04-30, Is there any problem if they do nothing? 
4221,1991-05-14," Second   Well, Normand, will you please make a note for the next meeting that whenever Governor Mullins signals he wants to speak, put me down immediately ahead of him!  There's isn't much left to say, Mr Chairman As I read the statistics that are available to us, and more particularly as I listen to the reports from the Districts, it may well be that the bottom and the recovery are at hand, but they sure aren't in hand I'm confident that they will be and that we are reaching the bottom I'm not that confident about the outlook thereafter I'm not sure what kind of strength we're going to get out of a recovery or how sustainable it's going to be I don't think those are sure things I continue to have considerable concern about the drag that's going to be present with us for a while from balance sheets I'm sure Jerry is correct that balance sheets are beginning to recover both at the household and the corporate level But I also wonder if that doesn't have a long way to run yet And I wonder, as that process does run its course, what the implications are more broadly I don't see where our real strength is going to arise from There are some good straws in the wind but none of them look to me as if they're of the nature that they have the strength to push or that we can be very confident as to their sustainability The exception to that is probably the inflation outlook, which I think ought to help in a lot of ways that are both visible and invisible And, of course, there is a natural buoyancy to this economy that, as Mike and others have pointed out, usually leads to better results than one can see at any given point in time But I continue to think that perhaps the risks are not yet symmetric For the short term at least, they do seem to me to continue to be on the down side Confidence is the biggest fragility I see As John LaWare said just a moment ago and as Ed Boehne said earlier If confidence doesn't continue to improve and begins to deteriorate, it could lead to some potential real problems down the road But as far as our work goes, I do think that policy has provided us with a good deal of insurance against these gloomy possibilities It seems to me from a policy standpoint that it's a time to wait and see how things develop   Are you talking about 2600 to 2550 on the Dow? "
4258,1991-07-02," Second   And Sam Rayburn!   Yes, it surely is  -22-    7/2-3/91   Mr Chairman, I'm a good deal more comfortable than I was when we last met here in May At that time we hoped that we had a recovery at hand and now it's virtually certain it is at hand and probably in hand I find myself with a forecast for the remainder of '91 that's on the high end of the [members'] range It's strong inventory that does that But that having been said, I'm in the camp for '92 of still having some considerable concerns My forecast produces what I consider to be a good [result]; it's a bit under those of some people, but I'm concerned that the economy could well be tender for a good while for several reasons The first is the fragility in the banking system; that has been brought up by several people and I think everybody here is fully aware that it exists I think that's going to be here and it presents continuing risks, as John LaWare points out consistently    7/2-3/91  The second thing that concerns me is the heavy load of debt that has been built up over the '80s at all levels of the economy I think that's going to be a drag for some time In my view, we've crossed the watershed between the basic orientation to create debt and are changing over now to an era where it seems to me the orientation is more to service debt and try to bring it down That's going to take an extended period of time to accomplish and that's going to be a certain underlying drag all the time that it's at work  The third concern would be in the area of this inventory cycle As I understand it, it seems to be a substantially heavier component of the overall recovery that we're looking for this time around And after a little while--a couple of quarters or maybe three --that's going to run its course Then there are going to have to be some other sectors to pick up that slack when that ceases to be an expansionary factor And it's a little hard for me to see where that slack is going to get picked up Net exports don't look as if they're going to be any help; real estate generally and commercial construction in particular are going to be very weak for an ongoing period; government certainly doesn't look as if it's going to provide any stimulation--and I certainly hope it doesn't There may well be some help from consumers, but I have some question in my mind about that Some of these other things may turn out to be just a little better I'm well aware of Lee Hoskins' remark earlier today that things always seem to be a little better than we estimate, and I hope that that turns out to be the case here again But I think we're in for a tender period, at least through the next year So, that leaves me thinking that our policy challenges are, on the one hand, to do what we can do to sustain the economy--not hype it up but sustain it-- and to try to see that it has a chance to broaden as it goes along Clearly, at the same time, we have to get in hand and then maintain and hold this much improved inflation outlook that I think we all see But for the time being this is a time to wait a while and see what sorts of things begin to unfold over the next quarter or two   Mr Chairman, I strongly support alternative II and I think that case has been made pretty thoroughly by others But I would like to go ahead and offer my summary of where my thinking lies There are two concerns that have been mentioned Number one is the actual operation of policy, which is of course the most important thing But signals are also important As far as the actual operation of policy goes, we always have a challenge on both sides The primary challenge, of course, is to maintain the downward trend of inflation that we're all dedicated to, and that will be particularly important if this recovery flourishes But alternatively, we have to be able to provide for a sustainable and broadening recovery if it tends to falter after a bit Under alternative II, we would provide ourselves room to expand a bit if that turned out to be required and I think the probability of that is non-trivial And we would still have plenty of room to apply more constraint if that were required If, on the other hand, we tighten the ranges now, we'd be pretty much constraining our ability to respond if the economy did turn out to  -39-    7/2-3/91 -40-  falter after a time As far as the signal effect goes, we clearly have tightened slowly for as much as a decade now and within the framework of today's economy I think it's fair to say that we continue to do that And I believe that we're perceived as doing that I think the market perceives us as dedicated to lowering inflation, but it also sees us as trying to be realistic about the state and the needs of the real economy It also sees us as a bit frustrated as far as our inability so far to make visible progress on inflation So, in those contexts, I really question the need for an aggressive signal at this point I would even suggest that an aggressive signal might frighten the market in a way that would be counterproductive, if they come to see the Federal Reserve as tending to over-react to its frustration of not getting faster inflation progress So, signal-wise a perception of an increased level of aggressiveness at this point may be (a) unnecessary, and (b) possibly a little counterproductive As far as the actual conduct of policy goes, I think the present ranges give us plenty of room to provide more constraint if that's what time shows to be necessary and still provide us some head-room if trouble arises and we need to have some head-room   ""B"" symmetric, Mr Chairman "
4279,1991-08-05," Mr Chairman, this is Mike Kelley I'm thinking down two tracks that are very closely interrelated, of course First of all, if we tried to make a move that would force the Ms to get going again, it seems to me that in the light of all that Don has found so far we might have to make a very large move indeed in order to accomplish that directly and overtly--one that might make us all pretty nervous about its long-term consequences If we're going to get the Ms moving, I think it has to happen in reverse at this point; it's going to have to come up through the real economy, maybe largely through the inventory cycle and other things I have been heretofore fairly comfortable with waiting to see how the real economy came along but I have to say that, in light of the reports from the presidents on this call this morning, I have a lot more concern about that than I did before "
4299,1991-08-20," That's right   Thank you, Mr Chairman When you say that a study has been done on this subject, that's giving it much too much credit We haven't done a study but--   Yes, some thought As I indicated to you in my memo of May 20, it seems to me that the Committee might well review the language that we employ in the operational paragraph wherein we indicate the areas of concern--theoretically, in rank order That order has not changed now for 38 months, and certainly [the economic] conditions and the nature of the discussions that have taken place around this table have changed over the course of that period To refresh the Committee's memory We established that language on June 30, 1988--or at least we established that rank order of considerations; the rhetoric has changed some Since that time there have been 5 tightening moves, 1 discount rate move in an upward direction when we went to 7 percent in February of '89, and the directives have had 6 tilts toward tightness We reversed direction in June of 1989 and since then there have been 17 easing moves, 3 discount rates changes in the direction of ease, and 9 directives that tilted toward ease And sprinkled throughout that whole period in both the upward and downward direction, there have been 9 symmetric directives So, a lot of water has passed under the bridge while nothing has changed here And it appears to me that we may want to take a look at that  In my view, either alternative 1 or alternative 3 in my memo would be preferable to what seems to be our current practice, which is simply not actively managing it I think [the current practice] is probably viable because it has become pretty much meaningless, but it's not very desirable for exactly the same reason If we don't feel that we want to manage that language actively--or more positively, if we decide that it's simply not very useful any more--then I think we should consider dropping it, or changing the rhetoric perhaps, or employing Don Kohn's additional thought that appears as number 4 in his memo, which I appreciate having The latter would change the recitation of the factors; it would keep them in there but blur their order of presentation  For what it's worth, I think that active management of that language is useful I know in my own case it's a useful pre-meeting discipline to think through that It seems to me that for the  -10-    8/20/91  historical record of the activity of this Committee it has real value So, I personally would like to see us keep it and come up with a system where we review it in a way that will keep it fresh and current but still not be an undue burden on the Committee I would appreciate very much having some other members' thoughts I'd like to ask Don Kohn first of all if he'd like to add anything   No, absolutely   Well, one rationale by which it could have been actively kept that way is for this Committee to have decided that it permanently wants to keep absolutely preeminent under any conditions this focus on price level stability And if that's what we want to do, then to me there is a better way to express it rather than to continue to imply that there's a rank order and that somehow or other price stability inevitably comes first We can do it in a different way and still make due allowance for that price level stability preeminence to be expressed   Yes, and then deal with the others   Right It's one paragraph up from the one I'm talking about   I totally agree with Jerry's concern It may indeed be insurmountable and, thus, we may want to look in other directions I would have no problem going in your direction, and I think that Don's [proposed] change could be a way to get at that And if we have another event of the magnitude of October '87, we can change the language on that occasion   That's it   I'd be happy to do that, Mr Chairman My sense is that there is a large common core of thought here among Committee members as to whether to do this, although there probably are nuances from every seat around the table We'll come back with some proposed alternatives   Sure   Thank you   Well, Mr Chairman, it has all been said and the hour is getting late I would just add one quick thought I certainly share all of the downside concerns that have been expressed around this table this morning and all of the nervousness not only because I get it from this group but from contacts outside as well But I do think it's a little early to make any judgments While we're getting an awful lot of anecdotal evidence that is of great concern-- and that needs to be given a lot of attention--I would also try to keep in mind that we have a good many economic series that are beginning to come along fairly well Some pretty slow but pretty firm trends are beginning to fall in place in industrial production, housing, retail sales, the purchasing managers survey, and others And certainly all of economic history and the thrust of analysis will tell us that a double-dip is unlikely Obviously, it could occur, but it appears unlikely As I try to formulate my own thinking, I keep in mind Tom Melzer's caution of a few minutes ago that we not get whipsawed by the data We also have to be careful that we don't get whipsawed too quickly by the anecdotal information So, I think it's perhaps a time to be a little cautious and see what emerges, along the lines that David just summarized   Mr Chairman, I certainly concur with your ""B"" asymmetric toward ease recommendation, but I would prefer the language in version I I don't want to quarrel about it; I'm not going to vote ""no"" over it But in the light of our long inertia, as we discussed earlier this morning, and the factors that we've discussed around this table that surround M2, the situation just doesn't seem to me of a nature that it would call for a departure [from wording] that we have been using for a long, long time So, I would prefer staying with version I but can accept version II "
4333,1991-10-01," So move   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that what we've all been talking about this morning and what is at the front of all our minds is a very straightforward question with a very ambiguous answer Is this economy faltering or is it going to falter? If we knew the answer to that question, we'd have a pretty good idea of what to do about policy The staff forecast is that it's not faltering and is not going to But I think the staff and everyone else would agree that the question is very much outstanding I would certainly concur with those who say--and I've said here before--that the consequences of a falter are very severe And we have to keep that very much in mind and be very concerned about it But it seems to me as we ponder policy right now that we have to keep in mind the fact that we have a good deal more stimulus coming from what has already been done Staff studies have indicated that the stimulus that we're going to get from easing actions to date is going to peak in late '91 and the first half of '92 The major part of it is still ahead of us We all know how much rates have come down Wayne Angell mentioned 450 plus basis points in the last 28 months The aggregates may be beginning to move; it is very tentative yet But I think one can make the case perhaps for this sticker shock and that the portfolio shifts are beginning to abate and may be in the course of beginning to move a little, which will help the aggregates We just had a drop in the prime rate Mortgages just went under 9 percent for the first time in a long time Yields on long-term Treasury securities just went under 8 percent There's some help still on the way It seems to me that policy help right now, to the extent that it can be provided and is needed for the economy, may be to reinforce the downward trend in long rates We have an incipient view now that inflation is going to improve, and we need to encourage that It seems to me that the best way to do that would be to try to see if we can't hold short rates for the moment   ""B"" asymmetric "
4355,1991-10-30," Mr Chairman, our usual posture, which I think is the correct one, is to look at data We usually find that the data are mixed in a situation like this and that leads us to cautious moves in one direction or another It seems to me that what we're mostly talking about here at this point in time is the matter of psychology or confidence rather than some careful analysis of impersonal data Just based on the data, I would concur with Governor Angell, but I do have a lot of concern about this psychology or confidence factor It's a softer thing but it also is a larger thing and a more difficult one to grapple with potentially So, it would seem to me that if we're going to do anything, it would be largely for reasons of confidence and psychology That would lead me to think that if we're going to do anything, it ought to be something more dramatic in the area of a discount rate move of 50 basis points that we allow to show all the way through There are two things that I would have a little difficulty with right now One of them is to move in a way that would look rather like business as usual and the other would be to tie a move or appear to tie a move to some specific piece of data, whatever it was This leads me to feel that we should perhaps think about this matter between now and Tuesday, have a very careful analysis of just what the data do tell us and a further reading on this psychology matter, and then see at that time whether or not we feel that we must move or whether the data will allow us to stand pat and try to sweat it out "
4374,1991-11-05," Mike, you substantially lowered your forecast for this quarter and the next couple of quarters and you have expressed in the last few minutes a concern that that still may be a bit too strong If for balance you wanted to sketch out a possible case on the up side--that the situation could develop a little more strongly than you have in the Greenbook now--what would be the elements of that positive case?   Let me ask, Ted, with the dollar having fallen recently Could that be reflected in time in further recovery of net exports?   Some think you haven't got a job!   Mr Chairman, I guess there's one thing that's clear and that is that things are not ebullient   We can stipulate that The anecdotal evidence we've had at the table here this morning could hardly be more negative We came out of the third quarter with a poor September and went into the fourth quarter with what looks like a poor October And the confidence data that we're seeing certainly don't give us any confidence Still, as I look at the data available to us, the third quarter, while not as strong as we had thought it might be, was not bad The Greenbook outlook, which is probably about the best estimate that we can make, is certainly not all bad And we have to keep in mind, as has been mentioned by several people, that we have a great deal of easing still in the pipeline, and I think that's very important So, I ask myself How can policy best help this situation? The first thing one has to say--and this has been said, too--is that a lot of what is going on here is structural and is not going to be susceptible to being helped by monetary policy It's just going to take time to work through But if we do feel that we want a little insurance for the middle part of 1992, cautious and modest easing would probably provide that And if we do feel that things are going to hell in a handbasket in a hurry, then maybe it's time--or would be at some point--to get very aggressive and ring the gong very loudly  One thing that I think is in everybody's mind is How do we improve confidence? I'd like to say a word about confidence; I think it may be a little more complex than meets the eye If we make  -19-    11/5/91  another small move, it probably will have a small impact We've made 10 small moves in the last 12 months And we can each make our own assessment of what the effect on confidence has been from all of that If we make a major policy move in an effort to improve confidence, it's not easy [to conclude] that it will have the result we want On the affirmative side, of course, rates would probably drop, the prime rate particularly Spending and borrowing would probably be helped at the margin But there are potential negatives to it as well For one thing, the Fed could come off looking panicked, which could possibly have very adverse consequences since we're seeing the data as being not that bad but people would wonder what the Fed knows that they don't know or what the Fed thinks that they don't think And particularly right here with the drumbeat of the White House in our ears, I think the Fed could come off looking politically dominated Both of those things feed into what I think would be very a poor situation if the Fed began to lose its credibility In my view, we're just getting that solidly in place now after a long time of feeling that we deserved it and weren't getting it And I would surely hate to see something happen that would knock that back If something were to happen just as we were beginning to be accepted as fully credible and we were called into question again, it might be a very long time indeed before we could get that credibility back once more  I think inflation expectations are beginning to wane in the economy and that's beginning to have a favorable effect And I certainly would hate it if we were to do something that would call that into question again and cause that confidence that inflation is receding to waver If it appeared that inflation were returning, once again we would be a long time weeding it out a second time That could have the effect of holding interest rates, particularly long- term rates, higher than they would otherwise need to be Also, there are the self-fulfilling elements of having inflation expectations [revive], which could make our job very difficult all over again  There are a couple of other risks that we need to keep in mind as we think about the desirability of a very strong move, to the extent that that is attractive For one thing, the stronger the move, the more likely it is that we would get a perverse effect in long rates I don't know how likely that would be or at what point that would [happen], but we have to think about the possibility that that could occur at some point The inflation battle isn't won yet I've always been optimistic that we can and will win it and I still am; but I'm not quite as comfortable--to use the word that Jerry used just a few minutes ago--as I was And frankly, the Greenbook forecast, which I'm sure is a very responsible and good one, isn't all that impressive to me in terms of the amount of inflation progress we're going to make over the forecast period through 1993 The dollar could weaken meaningfully if we got very aggressive [in easing] Of course, that would help net exports That would be good news for the short run but in the long run we'd have to deal with the inflationary consequences that could come out of that Another thing that has not been mentioned yet today is that we're going into the political season, and there's going to be an enormous temptation in this environment for fiscal stimulus of one sort or another I can envision the possibility, if we got a huge amount of stimulus moving through the pipeline, that we could be presented with some pretty tough choices We could either accommodate that fiscal stimulus, in which case we'd have monetary and fiscal policy both easing at the same time we have  -20-    11/5/91  this enormous deficit Alternatively, we could offset it by an earlier tightening than we might otherwise desire That could be very awkward to do from a number of different standpoints  So, in sum, if things are going very wrong either now or in the future, we might just have to bite the bullet and ring the gong and run the risk of getting lead poisoning from the bullet On the other hand, it's not impossible that things might turn out to be somewhat better or at least as good as they appear, in which case I don't think any immediate action would be required And to the extent that is what we see, we'd have a little time to watch and wait If we're unsure but would like to get some mid-1992 insurance--and we may well want to do that at some point--I don't think there's any rush to do it There is some time still available to affect the middle part of 1992, and a delay will give us an opportunity to evaluate just what risks we have and to pick a time and a method to do that carefully and methodically Mr Chairman, that's where I am at the moment   Mr Chairman, how would you propose to structure this technically? If there were to be a decision at this table to go down 25 basis points to be effective Friday, we have a couple of days to get through here that could be susceptible to some sort of leak to the market that could be of critical importance   Mr Chairman, I don't believe the state of the economy is quite to the point here that others seem to feel We may get there, though I hope we don't; I don't think we're there now I think there's still a lot of stimulus in train that is going to support us as time goes forward And I don't view a discount rate cut here as quite as riskless as we would like As a consequence, I would prefer alternative B but I do believe that asymmetric language is warranted under these circumstances I'm aware of the fact that you have said you would use it if you got it If that turned out to be the case, so be it   Mr Chairman, I'm very strongly in the camp with Governor Angell We have made a decision here and it becomes at that point a simple question of integrity With this auction going on, we now know what has been done and what will be done and it is only a matter of straightforward integrity that we have to go on and do it and release that information If we did not make this effective right away, in time, as the minutes come out, the fact that it was decided upon and then delayed would be known to the market and I think we would quite correctly suffer an integrity question and a credibility gap that we would deserve to suffer And that would be there for a long time   Just make an announcement--not let it happen through the market?   Not 1100 am? "
4416,1991-12-17," Second   Second   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Committee will recall that after our inconclusive discussion of this matter on August 20th, the Chairman asked me, with the good help of Norm and Don, to poll the Committee and see if a preference could be developed We appreciate the response of Committee members Everyone participated but I have to say that it still was not at all definitive We had presented three options The poll came out 7 for option 1, 7 for option 2, and 2 for option 3, which left us in a bit of a quandary As a result of that, we felt that we should at least come back today and put on the table again the two recommendations that were at either end of the spectrum [of alternatives] If you'll turn to pages 17 and 18 of your Bluebook, alternatives II and III there represent the two ends of the spectrum of possibilities that we discussed earlier Alternative II would represent the continuation of the current approach And if the Committee comes out of this discussion wishing to go that route, we'll have to look further at whether or not we want to change the order of what we have Alternative III on page 18 is the other end of the spectrum, which is to delete the entire matter and start over I would like to recommend, if I may, alternative I on page 17 This is the response to the initial alternative number II from the memo back last fall, which is to try to use elements of what we have had but restructured somewhat You've read that language and I won't repeat it This is an attempt to focus on long-term goals, which is the essence of the old alternative number II It also makes reference to the factors that the Committee considers in its directive That is in reference to the old alternative I, which called for continuing that Also, by watering this down and making it much more generic, it is an attempt to give, at least on an implied basis, some emphasis to the desire possibly to get away from this    12/17/91  system altogether So, Mr Chairman, my recommendation would be that we adopt this language in alternative number I on page 17 of the Bluebook with the understanding, of course, that this could be brought up and reviewed at any time and probably should at any rate be looked at by the Committee at least once a year   That's why it has not been a big deal   That was especially for you, Bob!   Sure   Mr Chairman, it's helpful to me as I look at the economy to think in terms of two separate sets of factors working together to retard economic growth One is a cyclical set and the other is a secular or structural set And they march to entirely different drummers, I believe The cyclical factors are the usual suspects that we find over and over again down through the years inventories, and so forth I think they probably would have been overcome by now--or maybe would never even have emerged--in the absence of the structural problems that we have The latter are much more important and they are much stickier And I think they are going to have to be allowed to play themselves through to correction in the interest of long-term growth and stability I would mention the debt overhang and several things that interplay one with another the real estate depression, the credit crunch in all of its different manifestations, and the very large fiscal deficit, which has several different kinds of perverse effects not the least of which right now is the inhibition it provides to any counter-cyclical fiscal activity And then, of course, there is the restructuring and perhaps downsizing in the services sector Those are pretty powerful and pretty important structural and secular trends that are going on The policy dilemma, as I would identify it right now, would be to allow these structural problems to go ahead and correct I think it would be a mistake for us to try to abort them to the extent that we could Obviously, we want to cushion them, but I don't think we ought to try to abort them We should allow them to run their course and, obviously, we all want to be careful that we don't lay a foundation for future inflation On the other hand, to the extent possible, we certainly want to try to ensure against having economic activity fall into a black hole, which I think haunts the back of our minds at this point And we also want to do what we can to [encourage] an acceptably strong recovery as soon as possible  Three sets of things go together with those conflicting desires in the way of activity One would be, obviously, the recent  -25-    12/17/91  weaknesses we've had in the economy; we've been over that and I don't need to mention that any further I do think it's important to stress maybe a bit more than we have this morning the stimulus that is in the pipeline from earlier monetary policy moves The staff informed me that as of yesterday we have approximately 3 percentage points at an annual rate of stimulus in place right now for 1992 spread out over the year almost equally from the first quarter through the fourth quarter; it recedes a little by the fourth quarter   Is it GNP or GDP, Mike?   Right At any rate, there is a lot [in the pipeline] that is going to come along That could turn out to be either a salvation or, possibly even before it's all over, a problem If we ease further, that obviously ups the stakes on both sides of that Net, it seems to me that monetary policy has already done a great deal We have eased every month this year from January through December with the exception of May, June, and July when there seemed to be a recovery underway and we stopped We started again in August, in what I think was a very early recognition that things were not continuing to go well There's a great deal that the economy has to do for itself in the area of these structural adjustments--things that I don't see as being very susceptible to a useful assist from monetary policy It may be that we've done enough or very nearly enough in terms of monetary policy now I think that policy stability is an important virtue in and of itself and that quick starts and stops in policy are undesirable And we could be getting close to setting ourselves up for one of those cycles So, my preference would be to wait and see here Obviously, if it appears that the economy is continuing to slide, we'd have to take appropriate action at that time I do have to grant, of course, that there is a good case for going ahead and easing The economy has reached lower levels [of growth] than I think many of us would have anticipated--certainly lower than I anticipated It's relatively low risk to proceed to ease a bit more and it might help some at the margin So, I would not demur from an easing, though I would prefer to keep our powder dry for a time at least   That's right   Yes   Shouldn't, not can't   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation but I do stand spiritually with Messrs Melzer and Black "
4451,1992-02-04," Second   In like spirit I will nominate President Corrigan   Second   That puts you ahead of the rest of us!   Mr Chairman, I have very little substantively to try to offer today, but I would like to put out one notion I am struck by the very strong consensus that I read in the press--and indeed it seems to be here as well--that the economy is likely to be ""flattish"" in the first quarter, that it will be a little better or that a recovery of some magnitude will occur in the second quarter, and that the economy then will move on up from there I share that view What worries me is that I have a bit of the contrarian in me, and I ask myself If we have this very strong consensus, it's probably wrong, but in what direction and how? Is it too strong or too weak? Again, I'm part of the consensus, but my suspicion is that we could very well see events prove to be on the stronger side If we were going to have a collapse, it seems to me that it would likely have been evident in the fourth quarter and would be underway now, and I don't sense that it is going on now And the longer that doesn't appear, it seems to me the less likely that it will It's probably too soon to rule it out, but [more strength than is projected] would seem to me to be the way things are liable to go We have some things going for us already that should help, maybe more than we know The short-term rates and the monetary stimulus that's in the pipeline should help The refinancing of homes is putting more spendable income into the pockets of people every day And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if this little uptick in long rates doesn't accelerate that [development]; and it might accelerate home sales as well I'd also bet that the white collar layoffs have seen their peak I think most CEOs who felt the need to lay off workers probably wanted to be able to report it in their year-end statements and got it done in the fourth quarter If there's anything to that, layoffs are going to decline and that should help confidence The credit crunch may be beginning to ease and the bank crisis may be beginning to ease We're hearing here today and we read that banks are looking for good loans My suspicion is that if they look, they're going to find them along the way Fourth-quarter earnings of banks were better; their stock prices are up; and the loan officers' survey says that nobody is tightening anymore So, maybe we will begin to get some relief there, although I don't think it's going to be very dramatic very quickly On balance, I'm with the consensus but if the consensus does prove to be wrong, I think it's going to be on the up side   You already voted for the budget; it's too late!  -21-    2/4-5/92   That's right   You didn't learn that last week at A&M did you?   Mr Chairman, I think this discussion has bracketed the situation very well The higher ranges are simply a non-starter The lower ranges are where we want to go but probably are not desirable now, which leaves us with the same ranges, those of alternative I And that's certainly what I would support As far as going into the upper part of the ranges, without enthusiasm I could support that for what I hope would be a fairly brief period of time But I'm not enthusiastic about it or lusting after that  As for the tunnel versus the cone approach, I have a lot of sympathy with the tunnel idea But I concur with your suggestion that this probably is not a good time to adopt it I'd like to see it stay on the table; I'd like to see us watch it closely and look at some different ways to do it and have it be a continuing part of the dialogue   Mr Chairman, I'm clearly for ""B"" And I will support asymmetry as well because if there's a move in this period, very clearly it's going to be on the easing side rather than on the tightening side But I must say that I don't share the presumption that we will ease that seems to be implied in conversations speculating on how the timing will work "
4475,1992-03-11," Don, do the differences between what you now expect and what you expected before fall within what you would normally expect as a forecasting error? Or are there some new factors that have shown up? "
4501,1992-03-31," He was carrying out the vital function of educating his fellow member here on a particular point   Mr Chairman, in my still fairly brief time on the Committee I don't recall seeing as much change in sentiment from one meeting to the next as has happened between February and now In the last meeting, most people shared a fairly strong consensus that the first quarter was going to be flat or maybe slightly up and that there was still a substantial balance of risks on the down side There were some reasons to hope that we might get an upside surprise and improvement somewhat sooner than expected, but that was a bit weaker case Now we seem to be having that upside surprise As we hear this morning--and it began to show up on the telephone call several weeks ago--most areas are showing distinct improvement And many sectors of the economy are showing a great deal of improvement Now the question before us is whether or not this improvement is going to sustain itself or whether it's going to fizzle again Certainly, there are forces that cut both ways; Governor Mullins and many others have run that liturgy and I won't repeat it There are lots of concerns and I have lots of concerns But [I'd make] two points First, as Jerry Jordan mentioned a while ago, there's an historical bias in favor of growth in this economy I don't think that has gone away; I think it's still there And secondly, more times than not-- maybe most of the time--momentum creates momentum and trends tend to sustain themselves I think we're beginning to have a favorable trend here and the more probable outlook is that it will sustain itself That would be my best guess, for whatever it's worth But it certainly does seem to be too early to be sure of that At the next meeting, or maybe the July meeting, we'll have a firmer feeling about it, I would hope, one way or the other For now it seems to me that this is the time to watch and wait "
4526,1992-05-19," I concur with Mr Syron   What is the time frame you're talking about, Jerry?   Mr Chairman, we are now five months into the year At the very first of the year, there was an extremely strong consensus that [economic activity] was going to start out very slow and then begin to gain a bit of momentum in the second quarter and be much stronger thereafter A contrariness instinct at that time was to ask the question ""Where is the surprise going to come from?"" because the consensus was too strong There was some indication that the surprise might be on the up side, and by the time we met in March it  -29-    5/19/92  was fairly clear that we were getting an upside surprise News over the last six weeks has been that it looks as if the first quarter was even better than [expected] So, it seems now that the question has shifted just a little to ""Is what we've seen so far something of a false dawn or are we going to continue to be favorably surprised on the up side?"" There is the usual array of factors and we've certainly been through them this morning On the concern side are the aggregates and the fact that housing has again slowed a bit Several sea anchors are still [restraining growth] commercial real estate, the defense slowdown, net exports, and the disappointment we all feel in the year so far with regard to the CPI ex food and energy As I look at that array it seems to me that people might say in the market that most of that has been there for a while And while it's still there it has had its impact  On the other hand, I think one can say that there may be, and hopefully are, a couple of emerging trends on the favorable side that haven't really had a chance to catch on yet One may be employment growth I've been taught since I've been here that the payroll survey on employment is more reliable than the household survey, and I accept that But it may be that early in a recovery here we are getting some leadership from the household survey I wouldn't suggest that employment has grown 350,000 a month, but it may be that the household survey is telling us that [employment growth] is somewhat stronger than we thought If the household survey is telling us good things, they are coming from the places that traditionally have helped a lot and that is small-business entrepreneurial activity and so forth, [and the statistics] may lag a little [before] the payroll survey picks that up The other [favorable trend] that may just be beginning to set in is in the area that we've called in short hand ""the credit crunch"" An array of factors is there As John discussed a while ago, banks clearly are stronger Their profitability is up; their liquidity is high; their balance sheets have come back; the loan officers survey indicates that they are getting a little more ready to lend money, and there are indications that that should continue On the demand side, there's a lot of anecdotal information that small and medium-size business credit demand is beginning to come back We know that balance sheets have been restructuring generally across the board, and consumers have been very reluctant to borrow; they might come back So, it seems to me that we could well be seeing an incipient trend toward a better climate for credit extensions There are some other things, too The dollar has been on the weak side We may get a little better [performance of] net exports as a result of that Consumer confidence is not high but it has been rising steadily, and it seems to me that it's very responsive to employment And if we do get the good news on employment that I hope is going to come, then maybe that will give a further boost to consumer confidence  So, I think it's possible to build a rather plausible, rosy scenario here around employment growth and a thaw in credit conditions more than anything else I'm not buying into that wholeheartedly; there are too many negatives still out there to do that But I think the odds are improving that real activity is going to continue to improve And there's a fair to good chance that we can hold policy where it is I certainly hope so because, if that's the case, I think that improves the chances [for continued expansion] for a while without our tightening too much as the economy strengthens And the  -30-    5/19/92  longer we can do that responsibly the better news there will be over the long haul   How about Art Buchwald?   I support alternative B with a symmetric directive "
4551,1992-06-30," Mr Chairman, my comments might follow pretty closely along the lines set by Governor Mullins and Governor LaWare   Well, I think I came out understanding where Governor LaWare is but I'm not sure I came out understanding where Governor Mullins is, at least at this moment At any rate, we've had our usual extensive and excellent economic analyses and it seems that we probably have a recovery pretty firmly in place But it's a frail child and there's certainly some risk that it could falter Policy setting would be a whole lot easier if things were either better or worse If [the economy] were recovering smartly, we'd pretty well know what to do; or if it were faltering badly, we'd probably know what we should do But we're in a broad gray zone here where we have a slow, tentative, stop-and-start situation that is hard to read That leads me to ask myself three questions, which I can share with you If that's where we are--in the slow, tentative gray zone--the first question is What is appropriate for the central bank to try to do about it? Secondly, if we do wish to try to solidify [the  -27-    6/30-7/1/92  recovery] or accelerate it, what is the best way to do that? And thirdly, whatever policy we put in place, what are its likely long- term effects?  On the first question of what is appropriate, I think this Committee and the central bank have several responsibilities The most basic one, a view I think we probably all share, is to foster and maintain the integrity of the financial system and its currency Then, of course, if the nation ever got into a crisis--a world war or something like that--we would have to do whatever it was necessary to do, no matter what, under circumstances like that I think we also have a responsibility to try to ensure that we don't strangle the economy for lack of money and achieve price level stability by rendering the economy comatose We could probably do that, but that's obviously not desirable So, if we do have a slow economy right now, I think we ought to ask ourselves if it is because we've followed an inappropriately tight money policy And it seems to me that the answer to that is fairly clearly ""no"" There is plenty of liquidity in the system We've all talked a lot about loan demand and so forth; it just seems pretty obvious to me that the sluggishness we're dealing with does not have its origin in overly tight monetary policy So, we probably are meeting our responsibilities there, at least so far and in the short run Beyond that, it gets pretty murky as to what is appropriate for the central bank to try to do The conclusion that I come to on my first question is that we're not in a situation that forces the central bank to put at risk its basic responsibility to the financial system of maintaining its integrity Surely, we want to do what is appropriate to help the economy in any way that we can But I think it's important that we do that without unduly running a risk to our primary responsibility  Turning to the second question If we do decide that we want to try to do something to accelerate the expansion through monetary policy, what is the best way to do it? If we ease policy, we do that against the background of all this financial restructuring that is going on, which we all understand and have talked about a lot I think it's critically important that it work its way through If we do ease policy, clearly we would probably get a lower prime rate; but I'm not at all clear that that would help loan demand or make very much of a difference, given this other [situation] Would it be a big boost to the monetary aggregates? I haven't seen any suggestion that that might happen And it's very possible that it might be counterproductive in the sense that it could drive up long-term rates If it did, it seems to me very likely that that would more than offset any beneficial effects we might get So, the conclusion I come to on that question is that the chances are at least 50/50 that the best way to help this economy, if our number one wish is to help the economy, is to stand pat  On the third question of what are the likely long-term effects of any policy either way If we stand pat and don't change, I agree that it is certainly not riskless, as has been pointed out here But I think the rewards that we could reap if we did stand pat and it worked out are very substantial indeed If we ease now, I see several risks that could ensue from that A couple of them have a pretty low probability; the third may have a little higher probability The low but I think non-zero probability is that we could set up [conditions] for an inflationary surge down the road If we were to ease and  -28-    6/30-7/1/92  should that cause a very severe deterioration in the value of the dollar and possibly unleash an incipient credit explosion, that could require a monetary policy response that would be destabilizing down the road That could cause some fairly radical kinds of upset to the process over time Maybe a little higher probability would be that we would succeed in what we wanted to do in accelerating the economy and in the process abort this restructuring process before it has a chance to work its way all the way through That would be very unfortunate in the sense that it would almost surely set [the stage for] a renewed weakness in the economy very shortly and it could possibly get us into a new downturn prematurely Perhaps a higher probability and a concern that I have would be in the area of Federal Reserve credibility Our credibility may be on the line right here We could do ourselves some serious long-term damage if we were to ease and if, however inaccurately, the market perceived that we were pandering to politics or that we were putting a premium on growth at any cost even if we had to accept a devaluation of the currency and the financial system to get it That could be very unfortunate I think we might be in a very important time right now in terms of testing our credibility If it's very clear that the wheels are coming off the economy and that things are going south, then I think we probably would have to ease and the markets would understand that and would not fault us for it long term But if an easing is seen as some kind of panic or a response to political pressure or what people would perceive as mistaken priorities, then I think our credibility would have had it for a long time And that would make our job down the road much, much tougher If we're able to stand our ground here and the economy struggles on through, which seems to me to be the most likely possibility, that could be a very, very major boost to our credibility and pay us huge dividends over time So, on balance, Mr Chairman, I come down for now, subject to how events unfold, saying that standing pat is our best bet to help the economy short term and long term   Well, Mr Chairman I strongly support your suggestion And for the reasons that have just been articulated by many, I don't think there's a thing in the world wrong with [acknowledging] uncertainty and [exercising] great caution in the face of basically changing conditions and a situation in which we don't know where those conditions are going to resettle I don't think any apology or any excuse whatsoever is necessary It would be a mistake if we were to try to bluff our way through and say that we know more than we know or alternatively, at the other end of the spectrum, if we were to stick our head in the sand and say ""Never mind, we are still going to fly on the same old instruments"" I don't think either of those courses would be credible The key to credibility and integrity here is to be candid about this situation We are working hard to reformulate the guidelines to policy [to foster] new understanding when that's possible to do I'm not sure when it will be possible to do, which is the only other point I would like to make I think we have to discipline ourselves and probably educate the Congress and the public to the fact that it may take some time before it's possible to do that again It may be a while before conditions are sufficiently stable for us to have some confidence that we understand where we are and for things to have settled down so we are able to reformulate our basic guiding stars   Mr Chairman, I support ""B"" and I would strongly prefer symmetric language; I identify myself with President Melzer and Governor Angell among others and their comments But I would not vote ""no"" on an asymmetric directive because I do share your concern and others' concerns that [the economy] could possibly be faltering seriously here, although I very much doubt that If it became clear-- and I do mean clear, at the risk of being what some would call too late--that we were having a seriously faltering economy, then I could support an easing Consequently, I would not vote against an asymmetric directive "
4586,1992-08-18," So moved   Mr Chairman, the last meeting turned out to be a little traumatic for me After holding forth at some length, I reversed myself less than 24 hours later on a discount rate vote So today I'll just try to throw in a quick speculative thought It seems to me that we're clearly in the same pattern that we've been in for some time now a slow, struggling recovery that has been severely inhibited by the financial restructuring in both the financial and the nonfinancial sectors To me so far--I would emphasize ""so far""--this recovery has been going along at a pace that may be a bit disappointing; nevertheless, it's still acceptable because it seems to me that the long-term health of the economy demands that we get this restructuring successfully accomplished In my view this financial  -26-    8/18/92 -27-  restructuring was going to happen and it could have been a great deal more traumatic than it is given the way things have evolved so far I think we may be able to see in retrospect that monetary policy has been very effective indeed over the course of this era that we're in rather than ineffective as some have alleged  Two things seem to be evolving and I'm hearing both of them around the table this morning One is that the timing of this breakout to a higher level of growth seems to be getting stretched out The second quarter was weaker than a lot of us had hoped it would be; the third quarter now looks as if it will be weaker than we had hoped, too I think most of us are reducing our forecast for the fourth quarter We haven't started lowering the first-quarter forecast yet, but we'll see about that! The second point is that we may be making more progress on inflation than many of us had ever dared to hope Year-over-year [measures of] the CPI began to break around year-end 1990 and the first quarter of 1991 when we went through that recession period The core CPI in the year 1990 according to the Greenbook was 53 percent; and the Greenbook projects 1994 at 25 percent even considering two back-to-back 3 percent growth years So far, the history has been that in the first quarter of 1991 year-over-year the core CPI was at about 5-3/4 percent; now it's at 3-3/4 percent That's a 200 basis points decline in the core rate of inflation over 18 months, and I think that's pretty impressive Clearly, the very slow growth period and the increase in unemployment and the concern in the country that we've been experiencing has had an awful lot to do with that Trying to put those together looking forward, it seems to me that if this sluggishness does continue to stretch out for a very long period of time, we may need to ask ourselves if we are beginning to be in danger of our disinflation trend overshooting and actually becoming a deflation, which could conceivably have pretty serious downside implications I continue to believe that it's very important that this financial restructuring be completed A great deal of progress is being made and I'm comfortable that our policy so far has been about right We've been doing pretty respectably at balancing the needs for a lot of this restructuring to work through and still have as healthy an economy as possible But having said that, I think this period does have to come to a conclusion at some appropriate point lest it start to feed on itself with some serious downside potential That could turn out to be the issue that we're going to be grappling with a little later in the year, though probably not just yet   ""B"" asymmetric is fine "
4612,1992-10-06," Second   I'm sure it's more than they have   It's a good idea!   Mike, returning for just a moment to the discussion a few minutes ago about how we measure things There have been some comments around here recently about the possibility that our inflation measurements may in fact be lagging the reality Could you comment on that?   If we may be meaningfully overstating the inflation rate, how does that play through to nominal GDP and real GDP?   If all these things are happening, where it must be getting absorbed is in even higher productivity growth rates   Mr Chairman, as I reflect on the period since the last meeting, it seems that a lot has happened but very little has changed That may be the one thing that makes this meeting so difficult for me certainly, and maybe for most of us We've been over all this; we're still struggling with a recovery I guess technically we're about to have to call it an expansion We should have crossed over into new high ground during the third quarter by almost any expected growth rate, for whatever that's worth We're certainly stretching out--forever it seems--the expected time to break out On the good news side, the inflation news seems to keep improving I believe the restructurings that have been going on, financial and otherwise, have been the big story of this situation and have been the cause of this stretch-out we're going through They need to be allowed to go through to completion I think it's very important for the long run that this be allowed to work through We've made a lot  -31-    10/6/92  of progress and I think policy has been about right in balancing the need to get inflation down, the need to allow these restructurings to continue and be completed, and the need to maintain something close to a decent economy in the process I still believe all those things But, as I said last time we were together, at some point this has to be completed At some appropriate point we need to see some solid progress Otherwise, as has been indicated this morning, we run an increasing risk of having this sluggishness begin to feed on itself And if indeed inflation is meaningfully lower than we're measuring it, we may slip into deflation without realizing it and that might turn out to be as hard to stop as inflation was  I'll breathe easier--I guess we'll all breathe easier--when we can generate some sense that there's an inertia of motion that is beginning to take over from the inertia of risk I don't get that sense yet Certainly, in the key area of employment, there's no sense of any dependable improvement Another issue that's beginning to gnaw on me is What is going to mark a completion of this restructuring process? Dick Syron touched on this a few minutes ago Where is the new equilibrium going to be? I've looked recently at debt service ratios both for households and corporations--debt service relative to income and in the case of corporations relative to cash flow--and both of those ratios are falling rapidly But if you look at their history back to, say, 1960 or so, it's hard to identify any natural support levels There is no easily identifiable equilibrium that one could say ""When we get to this place we're going to have it made and it will balance out"" There was no equilibrium at all in the '80s; it was just a steady increase in these burdens In the '70s there was something that might be called an equilibrium level, but it was at a considerably lower level than where we are right now In the '60s, when there was some equilibrium for a period of time, it was a good deal lower on both of those measures than where we are right now I can envision, I'm afraid, that we could easily fall back to that '60s level given the psychology that seems to be abroad in the land right now If that's the case, it might imply that we have a long way to go indeed I have to say in candor that I've been relatively comfortable so far, but I'm beginning to experience the first faint cringes of impatience As time goes on, I'm a bit more ready to see some signs that we are getting through this and I don't see them yet That's beginning to make me more nervous than I have been heretofore   Yes, it worked   Mr Chairman, as time goes on here, economic events are making the case for ease stronger and stronger But I do strongly support your recommendation for today because I do not think  -47-    10/6/92  this is a propitious time to ease I worry that we could set off a run on the dollar The traders are feeling their oats these days and they might just like to take us on, and we don't need that It's very important that the FOMC regain control of monetary policy, which I think we have largely lost to the market and the media I do not share the view that today is a day when we could look reflective rather than reactive Real rates are very low, as we've seen on the handout distibuted here this morning So, I don't think there is any strong urgency, on that merit, to [move] today I think it's desirable to get a reading on events as time goes along and desirable to have our powder dry in case some of these potential emergencies show up So, I strongly support your prescription   Mr Chairman, I may be the only one at the table who supports you on the merits of your case! [Laughter] "
4639,1992-11-17," Second   Everybody's leaving!   Mr Chairman, when David Mullins was speaking just a minute ago he was referring to several noted economists who think that maybe a little inflation wouldn't be such a bad idea after all It occurred to me when he said that that maybe a definition of a noted economist is one who abhors [monetarism] I have been thinking a bit like Jerry Jordan, reflecting on the flow of events of the last couple years Someone wrote that history is a river; it flows out of the past and into the present and on to the future  Last meeting and before then I guess, Mr Chairman, you said that you saw us as being poised between one of two models of the economy Either it is in a process of refreshing and rebuilding or else it is going to seize up I have to say I am becoming more optimistic all the time It seems to me that if the economy were going to seize up, it certainly has had every chance to do it The most amazing thing is that it has not seized up, given what is happening; I think it indicates an underlying strength in the economy that is just remarkable If you'll forgive me for running this litany that you're all familiar with, just consider the things that have happened in the last several years and are still happening None of these things has gone away; all of the drags [on economic activity] are still in place and are still playing through the de-leveraging phenomenon [goes] all the way through the different layers of the economy; the restructuring [continues], with the attendant heavy job losses and the heavy burden that has been on confidence [unintelligible]; and absolute depression [persists] in the construction and real estate business--a very big industry--with all the implications there One of the throw-offs has been consumer  -19-    11/17/92  confidence, a decline in confidence through the wealth effect on home values We have been through a banking trauma which in an earlier era would have caused what would have been described as a ""crash,"" I'm sure, and we'd still be deep into it just on that alone We're going through a defense slowdown, another big industry; that industry is absolutely in decline but even more than that its composition is shifting with various displacements going on which I think in the short term are every bit as much of a drag as the actual decrease in volume A newer factor, of course, is this world economic slowdown that is going on, weakening our exports which had been helping us in earlier years Now, that's a lot of stress on an economy And every one of those factors is still there; they are still dragging on the economy and they've all been at work for a long time except that last one, which may be just coming into its own  So, where are we? What has in fact been happening? Well, in the last nine quarters the first three of them were negative on GDP and the last six have been positive Two of the last three quarters were +29 percent and we have what now may be 3 percent or more GDP growth in the most recent quarter We're probably going to have 23 percent or more growth in GDP for the year, and that's not too shabby We are now on new high ground; we're not in a recovery anymore, we're nearing an expansion as of the numbers of the third quarter Our financial structure as a nation is strengthening in both the financial and the nonfinancial sectors as a result of the hesitancy in the banking industry and the de-leveraging I think one would have to say that our competitiveness and our productivity are going up largely through this restructuring process The banking system has certainly been battered but it's in place and hopefully wiser; it's certainly more fully regulated, heaven knows! And it is earning record profits right now Inflation is coming down and it's into the range where we're beginning to talk about having achieved price level stability On balance most of us here around the table this morning consider the latest news to be upbeat I'm sure the economy could still seize up; I don't want to suggest that there's no reason for concern But the longer we have the kind of results we're seeing, the less likely that is and the more it seems that we are indeed in a refreshing [stage of] rebuilding that I think displays an amazing underlying strength in this economy and one we can depend on as we look into the future   Mr Chairman, as far as the short-term policy goes, it seems to me that the outlook is stronger both in terms of the data that we're receiving and also the tone, particularly [as reported] here this morning We probably would all agree that it's very likely that we're going to get some type of [fiscal policy] program from the new President; he almost has to do that Taking these two factors together leads me to a strong preference for ""B"" symmetrical  As far as the ranges go, I would certainly concur that they need to come down I'm open as to exactly where I suppose that puts me in the alternative II case As far as the timing goes, if we were to ease today, then I would agree with Governor Lindsey that we should lower the ranges today in order to get those signals straight I hope that we are not going to do that And if we're not, then I would prefer to see us wait for a couple of reasons First of all, it's  -37-    11/17/92  clearly a technical matter and [unintelligible] And, obviously, if we did it today, it would be very out of sequence with the usual pattern that people expect from the Federal Reserve We're in this interregnum period right now and we're in somewhat of a news vacuum where the media is just [looking] for anything they can talk about There will be an awful lot of punditry if we move now and go public with it They are almost certain to get it wrong; they'll make too much of it and they'll make the wrong [inferences] It's very likely that they would opine that we've gone back to reemphasizing M2 well beyond the true posture of this Committee If they see that we do that based on this study, which is superb, they will think that we are saying ""Eureka! We've found it This is the answer and we're going to settle down right here on the basis of this new information"" That could cause some out-of-focus speculation in the marketplace and some out-of-focus perceptions of what [is important to] the FOMC So, I would prefer to stay in sequence and treat [the decision] as business as usual, as a calm and normal considered judgment when the February timeframe arrives   You might take a poll   I'm going with you   That's the key   Mr Chairman, the day is getting on here and it's just about all been said, I'm sure, but let me try to make one thing explicit that I think has been implicit in much of what has run through [the discussion] What is in the public interest? That's what we're talking about I think there are two components of that We have two public interest objectives here, but they're not of equal weight One public interest objective is the best possible public policy That's essential and that can't be compromised The other public policy interest is that there be timely disclosure; that's one of the basics of the political process of the country That's desirable The one is essential; the other is desirable when it does not compromise that which is essential The essential part--the best public policy part--I think is most closely associated with the issue of the deliberative process In my view, that's what we have to protect at virtually any cost The desirable public interest part is more closely associated with the timeliness issue So, it seems to me that we might be able to take a look and do some careful thinking about meeting that desirable public policy objective of disclosure a little more fully than we have today But I would not want to do anything that would impinge upon the essential part of this, which is the creation of public policy in a deliberative manner So, what we might do, Mr Chairman, on another occasion with a little more time and maybe a staff paper to go into it, is to take a look at the alternatives that would speak to timeliness but be prepared to take a very hard line on anything that impinged upon deliberativeness "
4660,1992-12-14," Well, I don't have any special insights but, as I said to the Chairman when he asked me the other day, I can't imagine in my wildest dreams that Lloyd Bentsen is going to go out of his way to support an initiative by Henry Gonzalez It would indeed be    12/14/92  revolutionary in his career at this late date "
4674,1992-12-22," Does it have to get out of your vault at all in order to be considered an import and an export?   That has been going on for a long time   That's the first sour note of the morning, really The main thrust of what we've been hearing this morning from the Districts is highly encouraging, though certainly not totally ebullient and appropriately so I would suggest that perhaps the character of the progress the economy is making here is not really changing that much; we may be seeing basically more of the stop/start kind of pattern that we have seen in the past, hopefully at a somewhat higher level but of the same general character That would imply that there will be downside news along with the upside news It would certainly appear that we're building upside momentum here, and that's great But it continues to struggle against these drags that we've had for a long time and that certainly haven't gone away the downsizing in defense, the real estate situation, the deleveraging, and the restructuring We know that litany It seems to me that we may be seeing the upside momentum struggling against these drags and slowly gaining the upper hand, but perhaps that episode isn't over yet Where does all of this net out? Well, one senses that the risks appear to be tilting in the upside direction, but it's probably too soon to be very sure of that; maybe they should be characterized as symmetric I took very much to mind Tom Melzer's remarks earlier of where we were two meetings ago and what happened immediately thereafter I think we'd all agree that gives us all plenty of reason to be humble when it comes to making projections I'm struck by the fact that so many people this morning have said that the tone of things is leading the statistics That's probably to be expected; on the other hand, it's not to be trusted either So, we undoubtedly have challenging times ahead and difficult choices out there Maybe they will come sooner than we think They're probably going to be on the up side, but it's too soon to be totally confident of that   ""B"" symmetric "
4697,1993-01-06," One other thing that might be a good idea would be to set a time when we would all try to send a response so that they arrive more or less at the same time It might be a mistake if they all were sent in one packet, but they should arrive more or less at the same time rather than be strung out over a couple of weeks   Friday a week, or Friday the day after tomorrow? "
4716,1993-02-02," So moved, Mr Chairman   Mike, on productivity growth we had a very gratifying 3 percent in 1992 but, although the expansion continues at more or less the same pace, you are projecting that productivity growth is going to come off rather badly over the forecast period to 18 percent and then 13 percent Why?   Arkansas is in the St Louis District!   Cleanup hitter, yes sir   You caught Norm Bernard's eye too quickly! It becomes a cleanup hitter to be brief and I'll try to do that, Mr Chairman I'm comforted, as I think all of us are, by the statistics in the last couple of quarters And I certainly like what I'm hearing from most if not all of the Districts about the tone of things While I do feel better, I must say that I can't really get comfortable as long as this restructuring continues and as long as all of these structural imbalances are still being worked away We cited the literature two or three times here today as we have many times before, and we've got some problems on our hands I think Governor Phillips hit the nail on the head a minute ago The tale is going to be told in what happens to employment If we get an adequate number of jobs in the next few quarters, this [recovery] will probably get going and be self reinforcing If we do not, then [the economy] could easily slide back And I think it's a pretty doggone close call as to which way it's liable to go This leads me to be in the camp of those who view the Greenbook forecast as being the best bet I guess it was Jerry Corrigan who said a while ago that he thinks it's probably going to be wrong but he doesn't know which way I think what happens in employment may turn out to be [the key to] which way it swings I will remain concerned about the downside risk until we begin to see these imbalances and restructuring begin to work their [way] out of the economy, and I don't see that yet So, I continue to fear that we have some downside potential there, although I'm optimistic that we're going to get over the hump and achieve the Greenbook forecast or better   I'm afraid that's right   Well, Mr Chairman, I can also very happily support your suggestion and I will do so We're dealing with large uncertainties, vitally important unknowables, and we don't use [M2] anyway for running policy While a logical case can be made for various [ranges] that are a little higher or a little lower--one can be made as logically as another--they are not that much absolutely different anyway So, it does indeed become a political question If one is not responsible for conducting policy, it's very easy to stay with the tried and true, or at least with what seems to be the tried and true That's done on a very sophisticated basis in academia and in a much cruder and more simplistic basis politically and perhaps largely in the media But we are responsible, and we cannot rely on  -51-    what has seemed to be tried and true even though it might silence some  critics in the short run  We know that it could get us in very bad  trouble in the long run; we just can't do that  I'm delighted to hear  comments around the table this morning, and certainly would like to  add my voice, about the need to explain these facts in much more  accessible ways and maybe to use more available and hitherto ignored  channels to get out the story of what we're trying to do, why we're  doing it, and how we're doing  We need to do that in language that's  accessible to the media and the general public and our political  critics and our political friends  So, I think the suggestions that  Bob McTeer and others have made are right  Perhaps we're being forced  into it; we'd prefer not to be there; historically, we may not have  had to do it but that's where we are today  But to return where I  started, I certainly think that your suggestion is as politically  viable a way to project these targets as any other would be      ""B"" symmetric   Let me make one quick comment if I may As we consider changing how we do things, I'd say that the discussion that took place here before the break today is a very, very dramatic example that we might consider That was a very important discussion, a very useful discussion, and one might speculate that it simply would not have happened if we'd been on some other regime such as those that have been suggested as possibilities   And we get our own [spin] "
4757,1993-03-23," In defense of the summary notion, we're in a sound-bite situation here People don't have long attention spans They get impressions very quickly and those impressions are very hard to shake once they get them I think the summary would provide for a much wider audience than the professional, careful reader, and that's an important audience It would provide a quick, easy, access to [the essence of] 20 pages of the policy record that people are not going to read in many cases A few will; fine, they should But this will give access to the lazy, the overworked, the distracted, or the ignorant   That I think is valuable And it can be done in a way that presents the FOMC's story in a light that we approve of as opposed to relying on some reporter who may not understand what he's    3/23/93  reading and who plows through the policy record and picks out a phrase here and there that suits his purpose and presents the Committee in an erroneous light   He may be, but if on the front of the release there is an executive summary, I think that will tend to be what gets picked up by a very large percentage of those who give it any attention at all That's important and I think it's a positive   Thank you, Mr Chairman First of all I'd like to thank David Mullins for his good balanced commentary on the inflationary outlook a few minutes ago and I certainly share [his views] I must say that if we are looking at the re-emergence of some inflationary pressures, what scares me most about that is that we could wind up looking at it in a stagflation-type context How did we get there? Well, I'm very encouraged by the comments that I hear from around the country that the uptrend continues and seems to be gathering strength That's certainly good news and I share the feeling that I hear around the table that we're in less and less danger of having this economy swoon out on us On the other hand, I don't see the economy as being very likely to run away on the up side to say the least If the Clinton program goes through, we're going to be looking at some level of fiscal drag beginning to set in during '94 and [continuing] thereafter The old constraints that we've been living with for a long time have not been excised yet The 50 mile per hour head wind may have slowed down some to 25 or 30, but we certainly haven't gone into a calm We have a lot more defense restructuring to go through At least on the consumer side, if not on the corporate side, we have more debt restructuring to do in my opinion The outlook for net exports certainly doesn't begin to improve over the forecast period and may be deteriorating further The economy was carried by the consumer in '92 and I worry that the consumer doesn't really have that much reserve buying power building up yet Consumer debt is off a little in terms of the service-to- income ratio, but that's mostly due to lower interest rates not to lower absolute levels of debt As we know, the latter were at an all- time high recently and I guess they're still [close to] an all-time high even though they're off their peaks But none of that leads me to believe that we can have much confidence that consumer spending is going to continue to carry us the way it has so far, particularly if, for whatever reason--inflation fears or whatever--interest rates begin to rise again That could have an effect on the consumer and just about everything else, and we could possibly be a part of causing that to occur Then, of course, there is [the question of] what the broader monetary aggregates may mean, and I certainly don't know what  -31-    3/23/93  that may be Nevertheless, they have been extremely weak and continue to be so; and as we speak they seem to be weaker than ever Taken all-in-all, I think the Greenbook's path is the best one; I hope we get it; it's the most likely one But if we are looking at the possibility of a re-emergence of inflation here, and we could be, then I really fear that stagflation may be the context within which it could occur And that, it seems to me, would [cause us to face] some very, very special and very painful kinds of considerations   It surely is   ""B"" symmetric, alternative language, Mr Chairman, for all the reasons that have been mentioned "
4781,1993-05-18," Second   Mr Chairman, with the emergence of the most recent data, it seems to me that we now have before us about the widest spectrum of fundamentally conflicting possibilities that I can remember I have attempted to make a bit of an inventory of what those possibilities are and what some of their implications might be, just to help my own thinking along If we were to make a straight- line projection [based on] the most recent data, we'd wind up with stagflation, which obviously would be a very serious situation But there are a number of other possibilities and each carries a different set of implications In the area of real economic activity, I think there may be two basically credible paths we could find ourselves on The first is that the first-quarter data are signalling an emerging decline--that things are indeed beginning to go back downhill and that we might even be looking at the possibility of a new recession down the way That's possible but it seems to me highly unlikely We have a good bit of momentum going; jobs are being formed net of all the restructuring that's going on; new claims are flat; the credit crunch is easing; the consumer is returning; our competitiveness is improving through productivity, which is the good way, and through a somewhat softer dollar in some cases, which may not be so good a way Nevertheless, competitiveness is [improving] So, I would doubt that what we're looking at is a fundamentally weaker economy that is going downhill But if that is what emerges, then we're going to have to reverse a lot of the thinking we've been doing  What seems to me much more likely is that we've been looking at some type of a blip in the rather moderate upturn that we've had for eight quarters now I noticed that of the eight quarters we've had in succession that have been basically positive, four have been lower than the previous quarter, which is rather interesting So, it seems likely that we're looking at a blip And the question is what's going to happen after that blip  -28-    5/18/93  The first question, obviously, is When is the blip going to be over? It may last a little longer; it may still be going on But is the Greenbook basically correct? Are we looking at an extended period of slow or sluggish growth? Is it going to be somewhat stronger than that, maybe a good deal stronger than that? Each of these [scenarios], it seems to me, takes us in a different direction But regardless of which one begins to emerge, there doesn't seem to be any compelling impetus in real economic activity that we can see [as cause] for concern right this minute I think there will be time to have this very murky situation begin to [clarify]  In the area of inflation there may be three possible scenarios working here The first one--which I think all of us hope is the case and which has a fair probability in my mind--would be that the things we've been seeing the last several months are indeed aberrations and that the disinflationary process that we've had is still more or less in place I hope that's the case It seems unlikely to me that we're in an incipient rising new [inflation] trend, that the game is over and [inflation is] on the way back up Now, we've been talking about that all morning And a number of possible explanations that would lead one in that direction are out there That may turn out to be what is happening, but it's very difficult for me to see how that can be, given the fundamentals of the slack in the economy In my mind the highest probability would be that we're looking at some rough bottoming out process in here, and that may be the toughest of all to deal with If we are looking at a rough bottoming out process with the kind of economy that we have now, it would really be disappointing to still have 3-1/2 percent or so on the CPI And what should be done about it? When we think about what should be done about that, if that's the case, we have to have a context or a view of what is happening in the real economy If we're going to have an economy that will start to accelerate soon and strongly, then it's fairly clear what we'll need to do as soon as that becomes apparent If the first quarter is the start of a new decline, then we have some very fundamental economic problems that I'm not sure I understand, and maybe nobody understands What in the world would be going on that would lead us to this kind of configuration? If we have the Greenbook's economy, continuing sluggish growth, that gives us a nice philosophical policy question to answer Do we try to restrain this kind of economy in order to push inflation lower? If we did, would it work? Or as you suggest, Mr Chairman, are we perhaps looking at some other kinds of problems that appropriately would require some other answers It seems to me that this is the type of question that we're going to need to address in the next part of the meeting   Mr Chairman, we've been around this bush a number of times now I would support no change with an asymmetric directive The reason I like the asymmetric directive is that I think it reflects the fact that this Committee is on top of the situation and is concerned That is the case and I think we should have an asymmetric directive for that reason That does not mean that I necessarily think we're going to use it If we move to tighten now, it seems to me the reason would be because we have the perception that inflation has indeed already set in on us and has to be countered now, or maybe it should have been countered sooner The way to counter it is to tighten money; and the reason we tighten money is to restrain something Well, if we had a strongly accelerating economy, it would be clear that it needs to be restrained We have something less than that--the Greenbook economy or worse What is it we want to restrain? There are not any excesses that I can clearly find It seems to me that if we want to tighten, we've got to be very clear why To simply say ""to counter inflation"" really isn't enough If there's something we want to restrain, let's decide we want to restrain it If it is a matter of restraining expectations, let's be very express about that and be very careful that we take a good look at whatever secondary effects--in the way of hard effects--we might set off in an attempt to counter a psychological or soft effect in the area of expectations Now, that's not to say that we might not need to tighten at some point; but I think we ought to be quite careful about tightening in the face of a perception of an expectation-driven inflation without some other harder evidence to go along with it "
4804,1993-07-06," So moved   I'm glad you asked!   Mike, on Chart 12, referring to the household sector, down in the lower right corner you have the cash flow burden and the fixed-rate mortgage is shown But I wonder if you have it for all consumer debt?   Yes   How far is that overall debt service level still above what one might call the ""norm"" back a few years ago, maybe in the '70s?   I'm sorry I missed it Okay  -11-    7/6-7/93   That's what I was looking for, thank you   Mr Chairman, the theme all afternoon here has been about expectations and perceptions, and I'd like to make a few comments in a couple of areas along that same line First, it seems to me that fiscal policy may be coming back into our dialogue a bit more strongly, assuming the dominant role that it may have had in earlier eras Recently I think the economy has been working on its own dynamics, and monetary policy has been key while fiscal policy has had its effect largely by its absence I think it's coming back Like monetary policy and the course of inflation, I think fiscal policy has two facets to it One relates to how the numbers actually flow and the other is this matter of expectations and perceptions And right now expectations and perceptions in the form of uncertainty are very, very dominant No doubt the numbers are going to begin to have an effect as time goes on and, as the Greenbook says, [that will happen] as tax policy gets settled and some of these other issues such as health care begin to have their own numerical impact, which undoubtedly is going to be contractive But I have an idea that over time sentiment may just start to flow the other way because I think this uncertainty has a life of its own So to some extent, maybe a large extent, when clarity begins to emerge--almost regardless of what that clarity tells us--it's going to help We may get more help from the clarity side than a contractive impact from the actual effect of the numbers I have some fear in saying that because the reality could be so negative! [Laughter]  Secondly, on the outlook for growth, we all look for an engine for growth in the various components of GDP and we can't find one It's just not there But there may be another, if you will, off-balance sheet engine that's at work and has been at work all along And that is just the basic restless, nervous energy of the  -33-    7/6-7/93  American people and the inherent optimism we undoubtedly have I ask myself how, in the face of all the very severe shocks we've had in the last several years in this economy, we've been able to experience a mild recession followed by eight straight quarters--this will be the ninth--of recovery from the recession And all of this has occurred in the face of these famous head winds we've been talking about for a long time I think the answer may lie in this very positive underlying attitude toward progress, this restless energy to improve things that is still in my opinion very much the dominant ethic of the American people and the American economy Our nation's basic orientation in that direction may prove to be the engine that isn't there in any specific quantitative component of GDP Right this minute I think that's being repressed by these uncertainties, just to kind of close the circle But as these uncertainties begin to clarify and take on identifiable characteristics, we quite likely will get a breakout on the up side from that inherent dynamism   Mr Chairman, I perceive very little difference among us on substance This is a matter of perception, and I think David is right that we've already spent more time on this than we should I certainly would be comfortable for you to argue in the way  -59-    7/6-7/93  you are most comfortable with on this matter of perceptions However, for my part, if we change in the middle of the year for the succeeding six months only, that would be the riskier course in the sense that I think it runs the risk of changing the nature of the message that we're sending When we send a message out at the first of the year about the succeeding year, it's the best forecast we can make It sets a benchmark similar to budgeting for the year; it gives a benchmark against which to evaluate and analyze performance, analyze events, and make comparisons But when we change in the middle of the year for the remaining six months based on six months' experience, I think that changes the range into becoming a target Ed made that point a while ago And that sets up a whole different set of dynamics We're indicating that we're determined to hit that target and that we think we know how to do it That puts pressure on us to do it And particularly given the dynamics of velocity that we've discussed here, that is not something that I think we want to allow ourselves to get into Once again, I think it's a matter of which argument you are most comfortable making, and I'll certainly support you either way But if I were the one who was going to go up and present this testimony, I'd be more comfortable supporting no change for this year and then changing over to alternative II for 1994   How about unreal M2!   Mr Chairman, we're talking about a very narrow range of differences here and, regardless of whether one's personal preference is asymmetry or symmetry, the overriding point right now with this narrow range of differences is that we not change And as a consequence, I will support your recommendation   Let's just press on   I think what you said, Mr Chairman, was that the letter is the best you have seen of those he has sent to us [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I'm under the impression that the fact that we have this one-week blackout on either side of FOMC meetings is in the public realm now, that it is well known   It's obviously not accepted by the press, but they are aware of the fact that that policy does exist in the FOMC   That being the case, there is no reason why we should not simply decline openly to accept a question and answer time wherein mistakes can so very easily be made Just say no "
4832,1993-08-17," I'll move it, Mr Chairman   Second   Well, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that I'm in the consensus that I'm hearing around the table this morning We've been for a long time taking two steps forward and one step back and that seems to continue Some of the head winds we've been sailing into are diminishing Real estate is beginning to stabilize; banks are strong again and seem to want to lend; deleveraging is slowing down Some of the head winds continue The foreign economies continue weak; defense spending continues to go down There are favorable and unfavorable new factors We've had a lowering of long- term interest rates for some time, but one could call it a new factor that it has gone into this very dynamic phase in the last several months I think an important favorable factor is that the budget fight is simply over Never mind how it came out; it's settled I think that's going to help a lot On the negative side, of course, is the fact that that budget deal contains some very serious taxes, as  -24-    8/17/93  we've heard here in the last few minutes We've had some very good news and some disappointing news The very good news is that more and more it seems that last winter's inflation surge was temporary I've now learned that the new danger I didn't know about before is called ""speed"" effect And there has been some disappointing news in the sense that, at least in my case, I expected real economic activity to improve more quickly and strongly than it has So, the realities don't seem to me to have changed much However slowly and torturously, the economy does continue to improve Inflation now seems to be trendless, albeit at much too high a level So, for the moment at least, I guess I would summarize by saying Have a nice vacation We're going to have work to do very soon, I'm sure   I very happily support a symmetric directive I would like to underscore what has been implicit in many of the comments--Tom Hoenig just now was quite explicit about it--that what we're doing here is making a directive It is a directive to the Open Market Desk and its purpose first and foremost is to instruct the Desk about what we expect over the intermeeting period There is a secondary effect and a secondary purpose in the area of signalling There is a large inevitability about that and it has to be considered; it probably occasionally has to be dominant, but I would say only very occasionally The order of importance of these two is distinctly in the area of first and foremost to provide direction to the Desk And that direction to the Desk at this time certainly is that there's unlikely to be a change over the next five weeks "
4857,1993-09-21," You bet   I'm pretty close to where Governor Angell was at the end [of his comments] It seems to me that on the economy we have a rather tight consensus with a couple of important exceptions today There was consensus around the Greenbook type of view, and that certainly includes me Very frankly that worries me a lot! I mistrust it; my contrarian antennae are twitching I was interested yesterday in the Wall Street Journal that Keynes reminded us that the inevitable never happens   Good point I don't mean to be facetious when I say that the thing that concerns me the most right now is that I don't know what I should be most concerned about Where's the balance of risks? If you look at the things that we're able to analyze and make some responsible comments on, the risks seem to be quite balanced And it seems to me that the things we can see are unlikely to take us very far away from our consensus view It seems to me that if the consensus were to break, it could most likely be because of some unanticipated or unexpected event And it seems to me that the world may have more than the usual potential for that right now; it always has potential for it But there are some things out there that I think could change things radically It's easier to see the bad things than the good ones The failure of NAFTA, which could impact on GATT, could cause a rather severe dislocation of international trade at least for a while Many friends of mine in the Southwest are terrified that oil may collapse below $10 a barrel, which could have some pretty severe impacts There are a couple of major economies that we all know are in a very shaky state The former Soviet Union has various civil wars going on; optimism in the Near East runs very high and it better be brought to pass or [the repercussions] could be  -28-    9/23/93  more severe on the down side than ever, and so forth I think there are up side [possibilities] too It would not be out of the bounds of the imagination to see job growth start to pick up; the potential for that has been alluded to a couple of times this morning If that were to happen, it could have a dramatic impact in terms of a resurgence of confidence I think Americans like to be confident, and we haven't been for a long time We could see a pretty strong bounceback in confidence, which could cause a real surge in the economy All in all, Mr Chairman, in August I said that I thought we should all enjoy our vacations because we'd have work to do soon enough But it doesn't seem to me that the time is here yet And I honestly don't seem to be able to generate any very clear notion about what it may be when it comes, either as to timing or circumstances or extent or even direction Thank you   ""B"" symmetric "
4911,1993-10-22," Well, there's no reason to rush ahead with August and September if they're not going to be released for three years anyway We have time to get this settled over the course of the next several weeks and then get on with it I basically agree with Wayne's suggestion, but I don't think waiting a brief period of time until this becomes clearer is going to in any way hurt or even slow up our ability to have those things in the files in a timely way  SPEAKER(?) Mr Chairman, I have to assume I'm--   Before I lose the floor, may I say one other thing, please? Excuse me for hesitating there, but I'd like not to lose track of John LaWare's suggestion that we think in terms of two past time [periods], one being 1976 until the senior member presently sitting got here The second--   We would go back to '81; I'm not sure I understand that point But at any rate, the very deep history first of all is less interesting, except to the Anna Schwartzes of the world perhaps But we can think in terms of trying to protect those far- distant past participants and be willing perhaps to be a bit more forthcoming with [meetings involving] those of us who have an opportunity to participate in clearing the release of these things   No, that's right It should take care of all of the presently active members of the Committee "
4927,1993-11-09," [Unintelligible] on the wrong side of the scale   Then they will not draw the money in the traditional sense   A question to Charlie If the Treasury decides to go to $6 billion, will they be looking to us to go to $3 billion?   While I am perfectly prepared to do either, we are going to have to decide which   It's $30 billion   Right "
4942,1993-11-10," Bill, in addition to creating the standby [facility], would they go ahead and draw down the first tranche of $1 billion?   Yes, sir "
4958,1993-11-16," May I make sure I understand the answer? Virgil, did you just say that if there is a subpoena that requires us to turn this information over and we do so, then there is nothing to protect that information from release by the [Congressional] Committee?   But that would be at his discretion?   He certainly has   Virgil, I wonder how much more comfort we might have if it were possible to get something in the way of a firm official position from the Justice Department relative to FOIA and the Archivist relative to the [Federal] Records Act You have very interesting but very preliminary expressions of opinion from them To what degree do you think we can be comfortable that that's where they would come out if they were to opine formally Would they formally opine at all?   Right   And you feel that's as much as we can get prospectively?   Yes   Mr Chairman, proceeding along as we have, I certainly concur with what I've been hearing from virtually everyone that it's time to be pro-active I think the regime that we are under now and have been under has been the best way to make public policy But I'm afraid that I have come to the conclusion that that's not viable any more, given the evolution of FOIA and the understandings as to what FOIA means So looking at what might be done, first of all for the past meetings I concur with your proposal and I don't think there's anything further that I can add to what has already been said about that  As for going forward, I prefer alternative number 4, which provides for the lightly edited transcript Substantively I don't see a great deal of difference between a lightly edited transcript and a Memorandum of Discussion I see some moderate advantages and disadvantages to each but nothing compelling either way But in my judgment I am afraid that a Memorandum of Discussion type document is just not as acceptable as it was in the past It should be perfectly acceptable but I'm not sure that it is We live in a somewhat different age than we did in the '70s I regret it We live in an era of suspicion of government Appearance has become enormously important even to the detriment of substance in many cases, which I think is enormously regrettable and not warranted but nevertheless is the case And I am afraid that today's reader will wonder in the case of the Memorandum of Discussion if he's not getting a little spin and he will be uncertain that he is receiving [an account of] the proceedings with full accuracy Now, I'm perfectly comfortable myself that they would be [accurate] I don't have the slightest doubt about that But if we are going to be forthcoming, and I think we must be, we would be more satisfactorily forthcoming to go the route of the lightly edited transcripts Consequently I would prefer that for that  -32-    11/16/93  reason I would have a strong preference for a lag of five years over three for reasons that President Hoenig and others have expressed But if we have to go to three, I don't think that would necessarily be a deal-breaker   Going back?   My first choice is lightly edited transcripts; my second choice would be [releasing] both raw and lightly edited transcripts   This is a very knotty question   But the errors get preserved  -44-    11/16/93   Yes, definitely   Five and three   Lightly edited transcript first; MOD second   I think they're bundled That's Larry's word and I think he's correct I think if we go one route, turning the tape recorder off is a much more sensible way to go If we go with either alternative number 3 or number 4, then I think we leave the tapes on and get permission to erase them from the Archivist   I would agree   Somewhat to back up Bill McDonough, if we do decide to delay, it wouldn't surprise me a bit if we all got a letter by the day after tomorrow asking for our independent--and undiscussed with anyone else--opinion of what we would like to see done going forward   And do what with them?   So would I   Second   Well, Mr Chairman, I'm about where I've been for some months now I see very little evidence of an important change My definition of that in my lexicon would be a moderate growth expectation, fits and starts, a surge perhaps here in the fourth quarter but not sustainable, with a slow acceleration--in fits and starts--over time I think there are enough positives in the forecast to sustain that growth, not the least of which would be a continued reduction in your famous head winds In all probability all of the positives will sustain that moderate growth path I think we have to recognize that there exist considerable restraints in that forecast that should prevent an upside breakout, [including] fiscal restraint, the further impact of new taxes, and a saving rate that is already at the bottom of its historical range Also, restructuring continues and defense [outlays] will continue to decrease; net exports will not be helpful and may decrease or get worse as well; and intermediate and long rates have shown some spontaneous rises I emphasize that I come out on the positive side of this, but I do think we have to recognize that there are some pretty powerful restraints out there  I'll relate one anecdote that I would share with those who weren't there The Federal Advisory Committee was in here a week or so ago and they were asked what their forecast for the economy was They had a very, very strong consensus at between 2-1/2 and 3 percent centering on about 28 percent Just to see what it might elicit, we said Okay if that's the consensus, think contrarian a little bit and tell us where you would see the risks to that forecast Interestingly enough, the way I heard it--others who were there may have heard it differently--they were almost unanimous in seeing the risks on the down side, not the up side, for whatever that's worth  On inflation, I just don't see any pickup visible Inflation is still falling on a year-over-year basis by almost every measure We still have slack in the economy, although capacity utilization may have to come off of that list with this latest report But certainly [we have slack] in labor markets and world activity generally and sentiment continues to be weak So, I see no reason to look to a short-term move in that regard In short Steady as she goes   ""B"" symmetric "
4986,1993-12-21," Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman First let me say that I think your remarks early in the meeting concerning Governor Angell's departure were very well taken He may leave us physically but his influence is certainly going to remain His statement of a minute or two ago was a beautiful cameo that he's leaving [with] us for that point of view And I want to tell you that I appreciate it  I think most of us feel that appropriate policy is largely in the hands of how strongly one feels about growth The main question, of course, is the pace that [the expansion is] liable to sustain through next year Are we looking in this strong fourth quarter at a sustainable, very strong rate or will it ease back somewhat from there? I have a long list of factors and I'm sure everybody else does, and Mike expressed it very eloquently earlier so I won't go back through all of that But to me there is somewhat harder evidence for the ""ease back"" hypothesis than for sustained, very strong growth I was a little surprised just a moment ago to find myself with the same factors that Bill had, only with a reverse interpretation I suspect the consumer will ease back, largely because consumer saving is at an all-time low and very strong consumer expenditures will drive that lower They could [remain strong] but consumer debt is right at a record in terms of its relationship to disposable personal income And that very, very high ratio will have to be sustained in order for strong consumer expenditures to continue It seems to me that housing is very likely to ease I can't imagine that something like this 143 [million rate of housing starts] that we just saw will hold The tax increase will kick in; what its effect will be remains to be seen I understand it will only hit higher incomes, of course, but it will nevertheless be there Defense cuts will occur I hope it's true that the deficit number will continue to get lower, providing a drag Foreign economies may well start to look better than we have been  -22-    12/21/93  thinking recently, but that's not going to happen overnight And [their sluggishness] may well continue to stretch out as has seemed likely for some months now  The sustained strength case is very strong; Al started the meeting with a very strong and credible statement about that And it just makes this [policy decision] a terribly close call; I guess, as Ed Boehne said, we just don't know I think the first quarter is liable to start strong, just as an echo if nothing else But is that sustainable? I remember this time last year--obviously we don't have exactly the same situation as last year but we had that huge fourth quarter last year--that it took the subsequent three quarters to get any meaningful momentum going again Not even the third quarter, just past, was all that impressive Are we going to get some of that? We might well, even though probably not as severely So, on a very close call it seems to me that the factors calling for some pull back from what we apparently have in the fourth quarter is the strongest case If the Greenbook forecast or something close to it is correct, then the possibility or the likelihood of running into inflationary problems is some quarters out yet; it's hard to tell how far It will depend on exactly how that goes and how fast the gap in the GDP gets closed If [the economy] is somewhat stronger than the Greenbook, that's the toughest call of all for me, and I don't know what to say about that If we believe that it's considerably stronger and that [the strength] is sustainable, then we should move immediately But I'm not quite there I'm cautious about January, particularly, because of the likely echo And only if things continued to accelerate right on through January, would I start to get impressed by that because I think January is probably going to have some strength to it any way one looks at it So all in all, that puts me into the wait-and-see camp   Mr Chairman, this choice gets tougher and tougher First of all, I subscribe to your prescription Factors on all sides of this have been exceptionally well articulated this morning And every one of them has a high level of validity, but we have to make a choice I certainly support your prescription Timing seems to be the issue now in all of our minds The pace of the economy, I guess, is largely going to determine that I am agnostic on the timing issue at this point I could easily see it being a while, as Governor LaWare suggests; and it may need to be sooner than later We'll just have to see And I appreciate your desire that we all do this together And that we will do   Mr Chairman, in the first part of your statement, did I understand you to say that Chairman Gonzalez has indicated that the approach you're taking would be acceptable?   He's requesting to have people come here and listen to the tape?   His people   So, the only difference in your suggestion from what he said would be acceptable is that we'd have some other [Congressional staff present] as well?   Well, in that case, Mr Chairman, I fully and happily endorse your approach I think we definitely should be forthcoming I had played with the idea of suggesting that we go ahead and fully release it, but if this would be agreeable to Chairman Gonzalez and he would make the suggestion himself that we do this--   I didn't know that   Available for review   We ought to do it "
5016,1994-02-03," Mr Chairman, I have the high honor and distinct privilege to nominate officers to serve until the election of their successors at the first meeting of the Committee after December 31, 1994 For Chairman of the Committee I nominate Alan Greenspan and for Vice Chairman, William J McDonough  SPEAKER(?) Second   Thank you I move the nominations cease  SPEAKER(?) Second   You're a little slow but thank you! It's been moved and seconded and the nominations have ceased   I guess we vote All in favor--do I do that?   All in favor say ""Aye""  SEVERAL Aye   Opposed? Mr Chairman, it unanimously passes Congratulations on your election to another term as Chairman of the FOMC, and congratulations, Mr Vice Chairman   Second    2/3-4/94   Mike, on the unemployment rate, the new and the old series, am I correct that our rule of thumb is that the new will run about 1/2 percentage point higher?   You've got to get politically correct!   Mr Chairman, my sense of the course of events is in flux As far as the strength of the economy goes, I had been thinking up through the time of the last meeting that we were indeed going to have a strong fourth quarter but that we would be looking at some substantial moderation after that The fourth quarter now does appear to have come in meaningfully stronger than I had thought and that seems to be accompanied by considerably more momentum than I had anticipated The new data that we've been receiving recently look quite strong to me The purchasing managers' report across all of its components looks strong--in new orders, the deliveries stretching out, and the prices paid We also got very strong housing numbers and very strong new orders data In short, the new data suggest to me that the economy has more momentum than I would have thought; and in fact it strikes me that it wouldn't take a whole lot for me to begin to use the word that I've heard a couple of times in this go-around--an emerging ""boom""  There are a couple of concerns that worry me Number one is that consumer debt seems to be accelerating, and this is at a time when the ratio of consumer debt to worth is still at an all-time high It never came off; it just flattened out The debt service rate came down with lower interest rates but not the level of absolute debt And if we get a surge from here, we are going to be setting all kinds of new records for the ratio of debt to income That is of particular concern as it would relate to the data that Larry Lindsey gave us a while ago That's pretty worrisome in my mind Also, we seem to me to be experiencing a rather euphoric stock market; it's up 11 percent in the last four months and 6 percent since our last meeting, for goodness sake! These kinds of developments give me concern that we could possibly be heading for something that might look distressingly like a bust somewhere down the road  On the inflation side, if we look at things with a fairly long-term view, they still look pretty good But like Tom Melzer--I had written down in my notes a couple of things he just mentioned--I have concerns Number one is that fourth-quarter CPI of 34 percent, which looks a bit ominous Also, in a world full of capacity, just about all of the commodity price indexes that I've had access to, both domestic and international, seem to have a rather persistent upward drift I certainly wouldn't try to say that an inflationary surge is upon us or is inevitable But as John Wayne used to say in his Indian movies, ""There's dust on the horizon!"" [Laughter]  -26-    2/3-4/94   Mr Chairman, I think this is a very important question It's had a very good airing, and I don't have anything to  -39-    2/3-4/94  add to what has been said I fully support your request and recommendation   Mr Chairman, I'm in the camp that prefers 25 basis points I am not sure whether we are early or just right or late; I don't know how history is going to judge that But I am reasonably confident that we're not seriously late and that conditions are not in the process of running away from us on the up side I just don't see the economy as overheated now I see it as in the process of approaching full employment but still with some meaningful soft spots President Parry among others mentioned some important places where that's still evident in the economy I just don't think we need a strong shock What we need is a new policy momentum We have been in a momentum of rest for a long time; I think we need to change that and now is the time to do it But I believe the 25 basis points would establish that; it would put a new framework in the marketplace and a new orientation to policy In my view that's what is needed at this point rather than a more serious move than that   So we are are adjourned or recessed or whatever  [Coffee break]   The same no change in the ranges and no release of 1995 forecasts "
5055,1994-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman As was said early on, our job here, of course, is to assess risks And I think most of what we have heard today has been centered around the risks that we see in the upside direction I certainly can't disagree that that is probably the most likely scenario, but I would like to inject a couple more notes of caution into that if I may I don't disagree that these risks are probably the most compelling argument But I do think there are good reasons not to assume overly confidently that that's the only scenario I think there is a probability that's considerably above zero that we may be a good deal further away from this full utilization flash point than we think we are  First of all, the Greenbook forecast points to a considerable slowing in the real economy It describes the consumer as neutral going forward from here I'm not sure what that means, but I agree with it [Laughter] I have spoken before about the very heavy debt load that consumers have; as of now it's all still there And as Bill McDonough mentioned a few minutes ago, we may have some nasty shocks in the wealth effect area that people are about to find out about Indeed, going forward from here, I think almost all of the major sectors are projected to slow After this quarter, unemployment ceases to go down in the Greenbook projection and capacity utilization stops going up I find it hard to ascribe very much of that in 1994 to the effects of a slowly rising federal funds rate, though there may be some effect at the margin Now, more slowing is projected for 1995, and I can associate that a bit more with a rising funds rate In short, that projection just doesn't look anything like a runaway boom to me  The foreign economies, particularly the G-7 countries, have a very slow recovery under way, if indeed it is under way And the projection is that their under-utilization gap never does close at all over the forecast period, and their inflation stays low and indeed gets lower as time goes on This tells me that our net exports are going to be a continued heavy drag; there is going to be continued heavy pressure for other economies to export to the United States at  -33-    3/22/94  very attractive prices, and I think that implies a rather strong pricing discipline on our own domestic producers I'm not sure the International Finance staff here would agree with that; I think they believe that effect is more limited, and historically I'm sure that they are correct But in the foreseeable future, I think foreign competition will continue to have a strong disciplinary effect on prices in the United States  In the area of productivity and unit labor costs, we have recently been seeing a rate of growth in unit labor costs that has been substantially below the inflation rate In 1993 it was 9 percent The Greenbook projects that to jump a lot next year to 29 percent, which would be very adverse if it happened But even if it does happen to that extent, I still don't see 29 percent as being an inflationary flash point But is it going to happen? The reason given for that very adverse development is that productivity has been running much better than trend, and it's got to get weaker in order to come back to trend That just might be a tad academic It may be that the folks out there in the real world who are fighting to make a living may not realize that they've been performing way above trend; they may feel they have to keep it up in order to survive [Laughter] My impression is that they are doing that So it's possible that we will continue to see a substantial improvement in productivity that may be more secular than cyclical, as the case may be  Interest rates cut both ways On the one hand, I would certainly agree that real rates are low and stimulative, and that's a very important point But on the other hand, this 70 to 100, maybe 120 basis point increase in long rates that we have seen, however you want to measure it, is a powerful restraint We can talk all day about whether they are real increases or not real increases and to what extent one way or the other But the fact of the matter is that it's a large increase and it points to very substantial restraint right now The Greenbook projects that long rates are going to come back down in association with a rise in the short rates; that's happened before and conditions may exist today where it will happen again But it's hardly a cinch bet That could be an important constraint  Finally, there is the matter of inflation trends themselves; they are still improving Three years into an expansion, the 12-month change in the core CPI last month, the latest figure, was the best we have had in a long time I realize, of course, that when we talk about trends we're looking backward and we need to look forward One reason that these trends have been looking so good in the face of an expansion has been the fact that we have had a weak recovery, but then one reason the recovery has been weak is because there was a weak recession before it; we started out at pretty good levels Trends change slowly most of the time The first thing they've got to do is to stop moving in the direction they are already moving, and in this case they haven't yet Then later they may reverse Certainly, there is evidence that that's going to begin to happen The last time we met I used the phrase ""there is dust on the horizon"" Certainly, some prices are rising; there is no doubt about it Maybe this trend will reverse faster than trends usually do, but I don't think it is completely insignificant that so far that is just not happening The trends are still in the direction of slowly declining inflation Over the previous 12 months, the PPI change was almost flat The core CPI  -34-    3/22/94  last month, as I mentioned, was the lowest it has been in a long time, at 28 percent and on a downward trend so far  Is there danger that we are going to get behind the curve or alternatively, if we do move now, that we could conceivably choke off the expansion? I seriously doubt both of those But I do think it's possible that we have a situation here where the economy, at least for a while, is behaving in some new ways It could be that if we are not being pushed hard right now to move--if we are not in danger of getting behind the curve--that it might be worth keeping our powder dry for a little while to see how some of this plays out Thank you   Mr Chairman, I too believe that rates are too stimulative and I think we ought to seek a neutral policy stance, wherever that turns out to be I also believe that the robust expansion hypothesis is probably the most likely, however robust may be defined And certainly both of those points suggest that the funds rate should be moved up On the subject of timing, I do not believe that the real economy requires a tightening move at this point but I think the markets probably do; so I can go with 25 basis points I do find the 25 basis points argument compelling and I'd have real trouble with a move of 50 basis points As far as asymmetry goes, I don't think for the traditional reasons that that is the best idea on its merits, but I also agree with Larry Lindsey's suggestion that it would be confusing However, I will not dissent over that   I would prefer symmetry   Mr Chairman, I think we should announce it on the merits of the case The time is here to do that As far as today is concerned, I would be uncomfortable holding this decision overnight and letting it be announced in the traditional way of Desk action tomorrow I think that would be a mistake I am in favor of letting it be your announcement rather than the Committee's for the reasons that Governor Lindsey and President McDonough discussed   The chairman departed the scene! "
5076,1994-03-24," Mr Chairman, if there are no further comments, I assume that a motion is necessary because a vote is to follow It is my pleasure to support the proposal and I so move it "
5108,1994-05-17," Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation and I would particularly like to associate myself with Governor LaWare's comments about the elegance and appropriateness of the statement that you proposed "
5132,1994-07-05," Second   Mr Chairman, I have been comfortable with all of the policy moves we have made this year The primary reason is that it certainly has seemed to me that we needed to remove the stimulus from policy that was there for a long time and was no longer appropriate But I have had questions throughout the spring as to what the real economy might require after we eliminated that stimulus The questions were primarily in two related areas It's clear that we are approaching full utilization of resources in the economy, but it has been unclear to me just how close we really are More important than that, as we move into that zone, what sort of momentum will the economy have that might push us into an overheating-type situation? Related to that, over the time horizons that the FOMC can usually and reliably work with, how likely are we to set off some type of  -34-    7/5-6/94  inflationary episode? In support of that line of questioning, I have been reciting a litany of factors and I am not going to repeat those, but it does seem to me that the recent information, on balance, has been stronger than I would have expected The first quarter of 1994 has proven to be stronger than it first looked to us and the second quarter looks stronger than I expected earlier We have talked about the decline in the dollar and the foreign economies beginning to strengthen The hours numbers recently have been remarkably strong, and employment looks as if it might be as well I am not prepared to say that all my questions have gone away, but it does seem to me that so far events seem to be more on the side of strength in the economy Momentum is certainly greater so far than I would have anticipated We have been getting reports today from around the Districts that some slowing is beginning to become evident; we will see how much of that takes hold and how quickly But from where we apparently have been recently and appear to be today, if that momentum is clearly still in effect very much longer, I am going to have to move in the direction of thinking that we may need to do considerably more in the area of policy changes   Mr Chairman, on the aggregates first, I am right where I seem to hear a lot of other people are For 1994, I would not change them I don't believe in changing targets or for that matter budgets in midstream unless there's some very, very compelling reason to do so, and I certainly don't see that here In the same vein for 1995, I would think to signal a prospective change now would require that we have some very clear reason for doing so and a pretty firm intention that we will want to do so early next year, and I don't see that now We may well change the ranges when we get there, but we will have six more months of experience and facts at the time and we will be at the start of the period that we are forecasting I see no reason to call a shot this far ahead  With regard to the release of a 1996 forecast, by a narrow margin I think it would be undesirable Many of the reasons that have been cited here for doing so--primarily along the line of more openness--are quite significant and important, and I don't feel as negative about it as I did when I came in this morning But I still think it is going to be very, very difficult to keep people from ascribing a goal to this forecast instead of just simply viewing it as a forecast and a very soft one at that I am afraid that we would leave an implication that we will try or possibly can cause this forecast to materialize Obviously, that would be over-promising what monetary policy can deliver I also fear that the related thought process on the part of interested people would set up a whole new type of speculation for markets to play with, and they have enough already   I would leave the debt range unchanged for now, Mr Chairman, but I would like to see us do some work--perhaps the staff could give us a paper--on the implications of changing it to a lower level for consideration at our February meeting I think that would be very helpful   Who released that information on the governors' lunches? [Laughter]   I support your suggestion, Mr Chairman, with ""B"" asymmetric As far as an announcement goes, I like Ed Boehne's suggestion also I would like to add that I don't think it's desirable that we tie ourselves into knots here trying to define asymmetry It's not necessary for us to achieve precision there To me, it's just a broad indication of a bias, or a leaning, or a concern, or whatever qualitative word you want to use, and that is  -75-    7/5-6/94  quite adequate and quite useful to have available I am comfortable to leave it at that "
5171,1994-08-16," Second   It disappears in the rounding   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think this has been a good session in getting most of the factors out on the table, and I'll try to be brief First of all, I still have some question in my mind as to just how much danger we are in here as to inflation being in sort of a scary take-off zone I think there are still some important factors that are holding it in check I would particularly note that the forecast for unit labor costs is still very low Even out through 1995 it never gets much above 2 percent, which should be a big deterrent In that regard, even though my bullish forecast on productivity has got a little egg on its face from the most recent numbers, I'm still optimistic that productivity is going to continue to increase at a significant secular rate Certainly, I think it's fair to say that we haven't seen much in the way of an increased thrust in compensation, construction probably being an exception to that Secondly, foreign inflation and its influences continue to be  -25-    8/16/94  low Inflation is low in the countries that basically have high costs because they still have big production gaps that are apparently going to stay in place for the indefinite future Those countries that have higher inflation tend to have very low cost structures in the first place, so they ought to be able to keep the pressure off prices So I'm not sure how much imminent danger we really are in, that there is more than just a troughing or perhaps an upcreep in prospect But for all of that having been said, it is clear that we are either at or very, very near capacity, however that is defined, and there is a lot of momentum present that shows every prospect of carrying us past that As a consequence, it seems to me that the risks are clearly on the up side both for activity and inflation I'm put to mind of an old saying of my mother's who used to like to say to her children, ""a stitch in time saves nine""   I support your proposal, Mr Chairman, for all of the reasons that have been expressed "
5195,1994-09-27," That shows you how much demand there is for more hair! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman First, very briefly a quick summary of where I am The inflation news since the last FOMC meeting certainly has not been very helpful, but I don't think there is much evidence that inflation is going to take off on us We may have some inflation creep on our hands as the Greenbook suggests, and I'll speak a little more to that in a second In real activity, as Mike Prell and many others have observed, there is an impressive and, certainly to me and perhaps others, a surprising amount of momentum still out there and that may be slowing When we gathered last time, we tightened 50 more basis points and that, of course, is only just now going to start to have an impact The impact of earlier tightenings is, of course, still in the process of unfolding So in short, I think we have an interlude here to see what develops The slowing may spread and stretch out a little On the other hand, it may turn out to be very brief and we may continue to get very strong data that may call for another move rather soon  If I can take one more minute, Mr Chairman, let me share with you a concern that I have If inflation creeps up at all, and it certainly appears that that is likely, many here could regard that as insignificant or temporary and not be terribly concerned about it But I think we probably need to be prepared for a rather major and stronger bout of inflation jitters in the economy, and we may want to think about how we might be able to handle that There is a perception that the economy is in a very mature, perhaps even a late, stage in the cyclical expansion Everyone perceives that we are operating more or less at capacity now For a long time in this country, people would expect in a period like this to see inflation take hold and be at its most virulent I think that until we actually go through a full cycle without a substantial inflationary surge, there is going to be a concern that history will repeat itself, and I can understand that And if inflation starts to show some upward creep, there almost inevitably will be some concern that, okay, the game is on, here we go again  There are at least two risks in that First of all, it could have a certain self-fulfilling prophecy element to it through the expectations channel and it may make itself stronger than it needs to be or might inherently be Second, I can see it forcing long rates considerably higher than we are comfortable with or think that they ought to be through an enlarged inflation premium That could be an overly and unnecessarily negative event So, I have a concern regarding what we may be looking at in the marketplace in the near future, Mr Chairman Even if we are not terribly concerned based on the specific evidence that we see at hand, I think there could be some market concerns that would work their way through the economy in a negative way   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5220,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, it seems to me the situation is unequivocal At this point in the morning, I have very little to add that's useful Virtually every bit of information that we have gotten and certainly the reports around the table this morning have indicated that we have an extremely strong expansion It may be accelerating I don't expect this, but if somehow nothing were done, I think we probably could get rather quickly into a runaway boom situation The inflation teakettle isn't whistling yet, but I think the temperature inside of it is rising rather markedly There is no need to go back over any data; we are all familiar with them As far as I'm concerned, the only question before the house is in the next part of the meeting That is, what is the best way to deal with this situation?   Mr Chairman, I have had in mind an intermediate target, if not a final target, of about 100 basis points The question was when and how to get there I have been holding out hope that perhaps we would not have to go too much further than that My preference would have been to do this in stately 50 basis point steps I think that's the more elegant way to proceed But I am afraid that that has been taken off the table Your analysis for the 75 is persuasive, and I would no longer be that comfortable with 50 I also would favor symmetry   Elegant   Mr Chairman, I think that if we were to withdraw in that way, it would create a wound that could very easily be opened at almost any time It would indicate a continuing disarray in US financial management to any serious observer, official or private I think it could have very deleterious consequences in an ongoing way and in ways that would be impossible to foresee There would always be a question about where US policy was and where the Federal Reserve was relative to the Treasury Furthermore, I think that frankly it would be a display of unseemly arrogance if the central bank were to walk away from its Treasury in that manner, essentially being seen as thumbing its nose at the government or maybe holding its nose I just don't think that that would sit well with other governments; I don't think it would sit well with the Congress We see ourselves as wanting to be independent in managing monetary policy for very good reasons, and I don't want to poison the well for the wrong reasons I am afraid that would do it   Second "
5244,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, in the spirit of ""contain yourself to what you see,"" what I see is what I've heard all morning--a very strong economy where the risks are rather heavily skewed to the up side Let me take just a minute to mention two other matters The first, which has been alluded to a couple of times this morning, is that there may be more substance than many of us think to this whole notion that we have some kind of a new economy with a lower propensity  -24-    12/20/94  toward inflation I am referring to this whole mix of arguments that we may have a lower NAIRU, a new level of competition, world markets with lots of capacity, much higher productivity, and probably less significant wage pressures than one might expect with this level of employment I have had a lot of sympathy with that argument for a long time and spoke to it several times at our meetings during the spring I don't much doubt that that has been present and is present in the mix of the economy right now I think it probably is a significant reason why we have done as well as we have so far relative to the amount of growth and the amount of inflation that we have experienced But I rather doubt that we can depend on that mix of considerations to carry us very much higher in the level of capacity utilization than we already are experiencing without having that mix of considerations exhaust themselves with higher inflationary pressures showing up  The other thing I'd like to mention is that I am worried about and puzzled by the formation of consumer debt I think there has to be a serious downside risk there, either short term or long term Consumer debt is off the charts on the up side in relation to consumer income or net worth, and its growth should slow There are precious few signs that it is slowing so far, but there is a short- term possibility that what we are seeing now is that the consumer is indeed shopping until he or she drops and that maybe the wallet will close after Christmas Inventories could start to build up quickly That is something to watch immediately after Christmas If we don't get some slowing in the near future, then I would worry that that is going to imply some other types of problems further on down the line that could perhaps be even more serious Thank you   Mr Chairman, in appreciation for Governor Blinder not giving his thermostat speech I'll forego giving my inflationary teakettle speech! [Laughter] But I do think that given the momentum that we observe that it is overwhelmingly likely that we are going to need to go up at least some more; and it does seem to me that once one becomes convinced of that, then it is desirable to do it quite soon in the expectation that that is the best way to head off having to do too much That said, I think it certainly would be a good idea to hold off until after the year-end pressures At that point, we ought to take another very hard look at it For today, I certainly support your ""B"" asymmetric approach "
5280,1995-01-13, Open ended 
5298,1995-01-31," I nominate President McDonough   Either   On the last point that you made, Mr Chairman, about when to turn off the tape, there is a way to accomplish that and that is by doing it in a negative way instead of in an affirmative way In other words, what is at issue here, I believe, is an appropriate record, whatever that may be, of monetary policy discussions I would argue that it would be unfortunate if this Committee left itself in a position where it was unable to talk freely about whatever it might want to talk about other than monetary policy I do not know what those issues may turn out to be, but I certainly would like to have available to us the opportunity to discuss off the  -23-    1/31-2/1/95  tape anything that we might want to discuss Our monetary policy discussions, properly defined, do have to be appropriately recorded for posterity Beyond that, if we want to go the route of maintaining the ability to discuss whatever--Mexico, personnel matters, you name it--off the tape, all we have to do is to adopt a policy that says we will tape monetary policy discussions, period   Precisely   Exactly   I take it your point is, of course, that what is taped ought to be broadened to include perhaps central bank considerations as opposed to somewhat more tightly defined monetary policy considerations?   Make a public announcement   Strike ""confidential"" Just say ""matters""   You would make a good terrorist! [Laughter]   As a member of the subcommittee, I want to associate myself with what Ed just said   Me, too   Ever   We can say the balance of the week of the meeting   We certainly have   Mr Chairman, it seems to me there are two potential ways to go here one is primarily quantitative and the other  -50-    1/31-2/1/95  primarily qualitative I guess there are some hybrids I would be very leery about a predominantly or entirely quantitative approach because I think it might very well imply performance that we would not be able to deliver or might not even want to deliver under some circumstances Either of those developments would be intensely counterproductive over time In the case of qualitative-type goals, it is hard for me to see how the Fed is going to do itself much good or to cause much good by unilaterally stating such a goal I just do not see that as being very helpful to our credibility For one thing, every one of us has repeatedly put forward publicly our commitment to price level stability There should not be any question in anybody's mind as to where every person at this table stands on that issue If we did announce quantitative goals and there subsequently was a shortfall, it would be extremely counterproductive even if the shortfall was for a very good reason It would impair our credibility tremendously  Now, if we are going to have to testify on a specific proposal in the Congress--it used to be a Neal proposal and now perhaps it will be a Mack proposal--I think we are going to have to look at it quite specifically If it is too soft, it will be somewhere between useless and worse If it is too rigid, that would probably be a mistake also because there has to be some allowance over time for shocks, external events of all different sorts Gary just mentioned the relationship between fiscal policy and monetary policy We all agree that it is terribly difficult to fine-tune, perhaps impossible I think we would have to look at the specific proposal to see if there is adequate flexibility in it, appropriate timeframes, appropriate social welfare goals, and so forth and then delve into the details We are just going to have to see what is proposed rather than try to make a broad general statement today or sometime in the future   Mr Chairman, looking at the possible courses for the economy, one end of the spectrum would be that the expansion is slowing now, or it soon will be slowing, and that the slowdown will be adequate A real doomsayer would say that the economy already is locked into an excessive downturn At the other end of the spectrum, one could make a case that the expansion is roaring along unimpeded at 4 percent plus and we are soon going to be into a true boom/bust cycle We very seldom in this life get the extremes one way or the other  There is, of course, a big broad gray area It might be described as a bit of a slowdown now, or soon, but one that may not be enough to accomplish our policy objectives, and, looking ahead, the expansion is very likely to reaccelerate Along that broad spectrum, history tells us that inflation will appear under those conditions When will it occur and how strong will it be when it does? Are we getting that slowdown? Well, my guess is that we probably are to some degree I won't take the Committee's time to go through all the different components; you all know what they are We probably will get a little slowing, led maybe by autos and housing, less inventory accumulation, the Canadian and Mexican situations, and of course a  -95-    1/31-2/1/95  good bit of monetary policy tightening earlier that is still going to hit But that slowdown may not turn out to be very deep, and it may not continue if policy were to remain unchanged  We still have booming consumer confidence As the Committee knows, I have been very concerned about the consumer for a long time I thought consumers would get conservative a long time ago They have not yet, and I am about ready to capitulate in the short run I do not see that happening any time soon, given where we are with new job formations and so forth Business investment will continue to be strong We have a weak dollar and the foreign economies are beginning to come back, other than the two immediately adjacent to us I have a hard time seeing real interest rates as being what one would call high It seems to me that they are more on the high side of neutral at this point  All in all, it seems to me that the risks are still tilted to the up side What we are most liable to get in my view is a little slowing that is not adequate to realize our policy objectives and an expansion that is likely to reaccelerate later Following Governor LaWare's lead of eschewing any comment on policy, I will stop right there   Yes  -99-    1/31-2/1/95   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman   Second   Second "
5320,1995-03-10," It shows our view that a strong currency is in our national interest   This is Mike Kelley I feel pretty much the same way I am concerned that whenever we intervene in a half-hearted way and get overwhelmed by the market, as occurred at the tail end of last week, it just adds to the market's feeling that sovereign entities--central banks and finance ministries--have become impotent and that the markets can do whatever they want with impunity That makes it much more difficult to try to affect the market later on I regret the fact that the intervention came off looking that way last week If we intervene again soon, I think we might add further to that impression of weakness and impotence   It seems to me that if that is what the policy is going to be, someone ought to articulate that policy We came off looking as if we tried to stop the dollar's decline and failed If all that gets said is that a strong dollar is in our national interest and that is the total substance of what officials say publicly, then  -11-    3/10/95  we may wind up with the worst of both worlds--looking like we were trying but failing miserably, when that really was not what we were trying to do in the first place   Unless somebody else would like to go in my place!   I'll try to do that Bill and Peter and Ted are going to be there as well, and I'm sure we'll all be trying to get a sense of that "
5339,1995-03-28," Move it   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to lean into the wind a little here as several have done, particularly the Vice Chairman when he spoke just a moment ago I don't think there is  -32-    3/28/95  much question that the expansion seems to be slowing right now, and I certainly respect the strong logic in the Greenbook about the expectation for upcoming quarters But I have to say that as of right now, from what I can see today, I am agnostic about the course of the upcoming quarters and the balance of the forecast period While I am not prepared to bet very heavily on it, I surely would not overly discount the possibility that we are going to see a reacceleration here or at least a considerably lesser degree of softening I had a list of factors here; almost all of them have been mentioned One that I would like to repeat was mentioned by the Vice Chairman a minute ago I have never known whether the old saying that history never repeats itself is correct, or the one that says that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it But we should keep in mind that for the last two years in a row we have had a configuration of a fourth quarter going into a first quarter that looks very much like the one we have right now Certainly, some things are a lot different right at this point, most obviously interest rates, but we have had this kind of configuration for two years--   Three years? I'm sorry I didn't go back far enough in my research The economy is still forming new jobs at a rapid clip--500,000 or so in the first two months The related earnings will be kicking into the spending stream I am not sure what may happen on inventories, but certainly we still have a very low historic inventory-to-sales ratio, which leaves a lot of room to build inventories Factory orders are still strong; backlogs are still rising Nominal rates all along the yield curve are well off their highs, and real rates are certainly down from where they were I don't think we can call the real rates high by any reasonable standard that I can see That may reflect the slowing that we have right now, but it also could set the stage for some reacceleration later I have been anticipating that the consumer would run out of gas before now, and that has clearly been wrong Now it seems that the consumer is still quite solvent With the stronger stock market and bond market that we have had recently, I would expect that confidence will continue to stay high It is still high, maybe a little off its peak, but nevertheless still quite strong It will be interesting to see how the lower dollar plays out As Ted said a few minutes ago, the band of uncertainty is very large But a great many observers feel that the dollar could easily go lower over time from where it is right now, even if the decline may be somewhat overdone on a short-term basis in the last couple of months It seems to me that that could give us an upside surprise on the export side All in all, if you use the baseline forecast in the Greenbook and ask yourself where the risks are around that, at the moment it would seem to me that they are still on the up side, with a meaningfully larger chance that we will see a stronger economy versus the baseline forecast than a weaker economy   Mr Chairman, I certainly think there is every reason to ""wait and see"" today I strongly support ""B"" I did speak earlier about my feeling that as of now the risks could be seen as skewed to the up side My understanding of the use of an asymmetric or symmetric directive is exactly the same as you just articulated, Mr Chairman On that basis, it would seem to me that the likelihood of needing to go up further is strong enough that I would prefer an asymmetric directive However, let me say that I think that the emergence of that upside potential, if it does develop, may well be a meeting or two out in front of us So we may really want to wait and see today in the sense of adopting not only ""B"" but also a symmetric directive I could support that, although I would prefer asymmetric "
5371,1995-05-23," As a follow up, would that review also include the absolute size of passes and their impact on the composition of the permanent portfolio?   Right   Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we are in a classic wait-and-see period here The expansion is obviously slowing and there are a lot of factors, which have been well aired here this morning, that could take the economy in the direction of either greater near-term or longer-term weakness or strength It is just too early right now to be making firm judgments about what the economy is going to look like over the forecast period In the near term, it would seem to me that the inventory cycle and how that plays out is the dominant factor If final sales hold up, it is hard for me to see how inventories are going to be a terribly big problem Inventory- sales ratios overall are still modest I think there are good reasons to believe that final sales will hold up and maybe rebound some We have the wealth effects from the stock and bond markets Confidence is still high Long rates are down and that should help housing and maybe cars to rebound Those tax refunds that were delayed should kick in here at a very opportune time And particularly if that plays out well, it seems to me that the out-period risks continue to be largely on the high side That has been stated in a number of contexts by several people who have spoken already, and I am still very much in that camp So, I think we are some distance away--I am not sure how far, of course--from a decision point But in my view we are at least one meeting, maybe a number of meetings away Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support ""B"" symmetric "
5397,1995-07-05," Mr Chairman, when the economy is experiencing a slowdown, we can't be comfortable about its potential length or depth until it is over--and this slowdown is not over I feel that particularly strongly in light of many of the reports that we have had around the table so far today But that said, I still have to be on the more sanguine side as I watch the data that come through here The consumer does not look as if he is scared to death Retail sales have come back some already, not strongly, but nevertheless they are not falling any more Credit is still flowing nicely, maybe in the view of some a little too strongly With regard to the surveys of consumer confidence, the Michigan survey has now turned back up just a little The Conference Board survey is still showing a little weakness, but both surveys are at fairly high absolute levels Capital spending was certainly going to slow down from its earlier pace, and I guess it has, but it still looks good Orders and backlogs are still up Housing and autos appear to be stabilizing on the most recent numbers that we have received, and certainly the strong rally in long rates has helped that The stock market must be helping sentiment and certainly the wealth effect that goes along with that All those good things being said, however, it is hard to find where there is a strong growth engine anywhere that is really going to kick this economy into overdrive One of them that could have done that, the outlook for net exports, seems to be increasingly cloudy When one can't find real strength anywhere, that could, of course, presage further weakness But it does seem to me that the odds are against a deepening of this slowdown and that the odds favor an economy that is coasting upward toward a sustainable growth rate For my part, I would put that rate somewhat above that in the Greenbook  Turning to inflation for just a minute, the battle for price level stability certainly has not been won yet, but I must say that I feel better about that prospect than I have at any time I can recall since I have been here The evidence on inflation and its course is positive Everybody here is familiar with that evidence so I won't recite it But it does look now as if inflation may be peaking cyclically somewhere right in here If so, we are entitled to take some satisfaction from that It would represent considerable progress both in terms of a substantial reduction and also the fact that a    7/5-6/95  secular downtrend has been going on for a long time and is continuing To be sure, we are not at price level stability and we have to keep our sights on it  A couple of observations if I may Number one, I think this Committee has always envisioned attaining price level stability as a project to be accomplished over some period of time If in fact the rate of inflation is peaking right in here for this cycle, that will occur at a pretty high level of economic activity I think most of us anticipate that we are going to go back to a sustainable level of economic growth that should not kick off any new inflationary pressures If this expectation is at all reasonable, then I think we are in a fairly comfortable position for the moment Second, I think it is of key importance that we maintain the secular downward momentum toward price level stability That has been in place for a number of years now, and I think it still is I believe it is the number one duty of this Committee to make sure that the secular downward trend continues in place But if all of this is in the ballpark, I do think it may imply that we have more flexibility for positive kinds of reasons than we have had since I have been involved in this whole business We do have some flexibility to move responsibly if there should be a desire to do so I'll stop right there   Mr Chairman, I would prefer alternative I for 1996 In the case of 1995, I would also prefer alternative I because I have a problem with changing benchmarks in the middle of the stream I think we lose a lot when we do that in terms of our ability to discuss and judge changes that have occurred intra-period Certainly, we can conduct policy just as well without making this change But I think we can also have a better and a cleaner discussion in this Committee, in the press, wherever, without the distraction of having made a change right in the middle of the year and having people trying to read into that something that was not meant to be there in the first place, however clearly we may explain it So, I would prefer to stay with alternative I for 1995 and for 1996 as well   Mr Chairman, as I said yesterday, I think that we have the flexibility here to move for positive and affirmative reasons as opposed to negative and defensive ones Based on my reading of the likely outlook, I don't see us as driven primarily by the specter of a collapsing economy, although I would certainly concur that the downside risks are still there Rather, I see the likelihood of a moderate and sustainable noninflationary growth period ahead of  -69-    7/5-6/95  us coupled with a cyclically plateauing inflation rate that is still in a secular downward trend I find all of that rather attractive It gives the Committee room to move within the context of maintaining its posture relative to a steady focus on attaining price stability The positive reasons to move have been articulated around this table, and I won't try to recite all of them again I do think that 25 basis points is plenty for us to move today The major significance will be the change in policy direction as opposed to the amount of the move, and I share the Vice Chairman's concern about the risk of roiling the financial markets in destabilizing ways I believe that whatever we do, 25 or 50 basis points, there is going to be speculation about what comes next, either way I also favor 25 basis points because it is not at all clear to me what our next move may be or when it may come For that reason, Mr Chairman, I also would prefer to see a symmetric directive, although I certainly can support asymmetric if that is the way we are going to go "
5422,1995-08-22," Second   Second    8/22/95   Thank you, Mr Chairman There is no doubt that the Greenbook is not exactly correct It never is; it can't be and it's not expected to be But that said, I think the staff did an exceptionally good job this time around in assessing what I see as a very tricky period I find the economy that they project to be highly credible I also think that it's a very acceptable one at this time but not permanently By not permanently I mean that over the longer term we still have to keep the inflation rate on a secular downward path We are not at price level stability yet, and we are still determined to get there  What do I mean by acceptable at this time? Well, I think there are many very big questions out there whose answers are going to have to unfold over the coming months Virtually every one on my list has been discussed this morning, and it's rather awesome After all the rhetoric runs its course, what is really going to be the deficit reduction that we are going to have to deal with? Second, has the NAIRU changed and if so by how much? Third, have productivity trends really improved as many think? If we are on a higher trend, how much higher and is it a sustainable one? Fourth, a lot of the good results that we are getting now, I don't know how much, has to do with the so- called traumatized worker How long is the American workforce going to remain quiescent without the compensation increases that it thinks it should get? When employment is as strong as it is right now, I don't think we can depend on having permanently favorable results in that area This has been a rather big key to the present happy macro situation where we have a high capacity utilization rate and a relatively low inflation rate We all feel rather good about that Fifth, will households continue to take on more debt? That obviously is the key to consumer spending Consumer debt is rising again toward its all-time high of several years ago We all know that in many past years we had a much lower level of consumer debt than we are carrying now One has to wonder if people are going to want to return, at least partially, to those standards of prior years Then, of course, there is the matter of whether or not we are overstating inflation and if so by how much That was a very interesting but not particularly critical question when we were at higher levels of inflation, but as we begin to move into the zone that could be considered price level stability, that question starts to become very important indeed  -25    8/22/95  The answers to all these questions, and more I am sure, are going to have everything to do with shaping monetary policy as we go along into the future How is it going to shape up? I certainly don't know, but the point is that for now it seems to me that we have a good balance in the economy and we are moving toward an appropriate degree of momentum That puts us in good shape to await the unfolding answers to some of these critical questions and in a pretty good position, I would hope, to be able to react appropriately as those answers start to become available   As do I, Mr Chairman "
5446,1995-09-26," I am not going to try to pick up on that analogy!   Let me make a brief intervention because like so many others and the way Mike Prell started this morning, I see very little change from where we were in August Relative to the Greenbook, I continue to believe that the risks, if that is the proper word, are on the up side and I am in the camp that would be closer to the more bullish of the three scenarios that Mike Prell presented this morning, for all the reasons that he discussed  I would like to offer a thought or two about the fiscal deficit situation First of all, 1996 is an election year, and we are talking about deficit reductions that would be put in place by legislation that is not yet passed, although the new fiscal year is upon us Assuming they do get passed, it will take some time to get them largely in place So, I would be surprised if it turned out that there was a great deal of additional fiscal drag in the year 1996 It also is worth noting that in the last three fiscal years the deficit has come down from a level in excess of $280 billion to probably less than $160 billion in fiscal 1995 That is a lot of deficit reduction in a 3-year time period And yet we had 3 percent plus real GDP growth in 1993 and 4 percent plus growth in 1994, and 1994 was the year when the biggest part of that deficit reduction took place Deficit reduction has a lot of positive impacts, and in the aggregate whatever deficit reduction does take place--and I hope a program will be enacted--I think there is every expectation that its negative effects can easily be overcome by all the positive impacts that get thrown off from it In August I remarked on what seemed to be an exceptional number of rather basic questions that, taken together, are largely going to dictate the nature of monetary policy in the years to come They include issues concerning the trend in fiscal policy, the level of the NAIRU, the need for improved measurement of the inflation rate, the trend of productivity, the longevity of this absence of wage pressures that we see today, and the persistence of household debt formation It is going to take a while for a lot of these things to play out, but I do think we are in a good position right now to wait and see how all this evolves Thank you   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for many of the reasons that were mentioned by Presidents Melzer, Parry, and Hoenig   Mr Chairman, I am pretty much where Gary Stern was but maybe in terms that are a little different I certainly support the thrust of this bill unequivocally in that it gives primacy to price stability as a means toward a larger end But I am not totally comfortable with virtually any hard-wired legislation that I can think of, even with legislation that is as flexible as this bill appears to be The good news is that it is consistent with what we have been doing, what we foresee we would like to do, and it eliminates the onerous provisions of Humphrey-Hawkins I am a little concerned that over time, in ways that we can't foresee, we might very well have some combination of economic and possibly political circumstances that could inhibit us in the pursuit of an appropriate monetary policy if this legislation were in place The alternative would be to get us back into a situation where we might have a law that we would have to ignore as we have ignored certain aspects of the Humphrey-Hawkins law for very good reasons I think ignoring a law that remains on the books over a long period of time is completely unacceptable, and I would hate to remain in that situation in the context of new legislation   If flexibility is the objective, then ultimate flexibility would be not to have any legislation at all  SPEAKER(?) That will never happen! "
5471,1995-11-15," Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman I must say that I welcome the more optimistic projection in the Greenbook this time For what it is worth, my judgment would be right with the staff  -36-    11/15/95  Despite the long-in-the-tooth expansion that we have had, I have believed and continue to believe that there is more potential for upside surprise than downside I am sure it is not an immutable law of economics, but it seems to me that the US economy has a natural tendency to rise unless something pushes it down On balance, I don't see anything right now that looks to be sufficiently strong to produce that result If you look down the list of the different elements of GDP, and Al Broaddus ran through that list to some extent a while ago, on balance it looks moderately positive with some components being stronger than others, as one would expect That is what the Greenbook says; that is where they are  That said on the optimistic side, I must say that I do want to identify with Governor Lindsey on his remarks about consumer debt He has done a lot more serious work on it than I But I have been, and I think Larry has been, crying ""wolf"" on this subject for some months now Obviously, we have been premature so far, but I think some day we are going to have a reckoning on this I don't know when that might be or how it might play out when it comes Perhaps because I feel a little bit bruised about having been Chicken Little so far, my best guess is that it is probably going to be out beyond our present forecast period If we are going to get a shock, I think that could be where it will come from It does seem to me that it is going to take a shock to push this economy into unacceptable economic sluggishness We live in a dangerous world, of course, and the potential shocks are out there Consumer debt is one of them We can easily identify others One is what is going on politically right now, and what impact that might have One can envision a shock from fiscal drag, although I certainly cannot see that happening in 1996 at this point Net exports could be disappointing; I hope not At any rate, if we get a shock, it is difficult to anticipate where or when it might come If we get a shock, we will just have to deal with that Other than that I have to say I am pretty optimistic  On the inflation side, with the very high utilization rates of our human and physical resources, I think we have been getting remarkably good results It is a little difficult for me to see how the inflation picture is going to improve, although I guess in recent months it has had a slight tendency to improve Maybe today's news will be a straw in the wind in the other direction But so far, it is very difficult to see much by way of upside push there I do think that given our high utilization level, an upside risk potential could become apparent as time goes on, and we will have to be very careful about that going forward   It looks the way it should!   Mr Chairman, I can see the argument that the real fed funds rate may be a tad on the high side, but I have to say that so far it's hard to see where it has put much of damper on credit extensions or the stock market or the housing market I can easily envision the possibility that events may unfold, conceivably fairly quickly, that will make a policy change desirable, but I certainly favor ""no change"" for now There are two broad reasons in my mind for having an asymmetric directive, the second building on the first The first is to send a signal about some imminent perceived risk The second is to facilitate an imminent policy move I just don't see either of those as germane right now, and consequently I would strongly prefer a symmetric directive   We are now averaging down! "
5496,1995-12-19," Second   Mr Chairman, it does seem that fourth-quarter growth is somewhat slower than the torrid pace of the third quarter, and that slowing may be in response to that torrid pace But I continue to be quite optimistic that this slowing is not very likely to be indicative of an undue weakness beginning to set in I certainly concur with the thrust of Mike Prell's briefing earlier I  -22-    12/19/95  think there are some important trends that are going to have an impact in the near term and a little further out in the future stemming from the remarkable decline that we have had in long-term interest rates over the last year We still seem to be able to create jobs in this country at a rate of roughly 100,000 per month, and the unemployment rate has stayed steady at 5-1/2 percent Credit availability still seems to be quite ample Debt formation is going forward a bit more slowly than the very rapid pace of a few quarters ago, but that is welcome Retail sales are certainly unexciting; the anecdotal evidence about Christmas sales is not strong, but the most recent monthly data that we have, for November, were really rather good So, that sector of the economy may be all right, and I think with the lower interest rates, housing is going to be all right and probably autos as well Consumer sentiment continues to be strong, a bit off its highs perhaps but still strong So, these developments and others leave me pretty comfortable with the Greenbook forecast, which essentially showed no change from November I liked it then and I like it now Basically, it calls for growth near potential as the highest probability  We have to ponder what might change this outlook As far as an upside breakout goes, it is difficult for me to see where that is liable to come from in the foreseeable future I would think that an upside breakout would have a fairly low probability There is always the possibility of shocks, and if we get one of those, we will have to deal with it But it would seem to me that if one wants to focus on a concern, we might see in the further reaches of the forecast period a general exhaustion at the margin of growth-creating demand, maybe a weakening of investment I don't see that as a very high probability in the next several quarters But further out in the forecast period, I think that concern grows because we do have a very mature expansion on our hands  On the inflation front, I think everyone has remarked, and everyone realizes, that inflation continues to be remarkably well contained I am particularly impressed with the way that unit labor costs continue to behave Productivity is still growing very nicely, and the ECI is flat In the inflation area, the foreign outlook certainly appears benign, and commodities generally have behaved well recently In sum, I just don't see strong pressures on policy at this time, one way or the other This leaves us with the rather rare luxury of having a bit of rather low-risk discretionary room to maneuver I think the question for the next half of the meeting is going to be how we intend to use that   Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation As I said earlier, I see no strong pressures for a change in monetary policy at this moment one way or the other, and under those conditions my normal instinct would be to not move I think the risks are symmetric and relatively small at this point But of course we know policy does work with a lag and as this expansion continues to mature, I think the risks are more likely to turn to the down side as time goes along As a consequence, I can support 25 basis points as a useful and modest move I certainly concur with the spirit of your proposed statement "
5519,1996-01-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman It happens that I am the senior member of the Board present, and so I have the honor of asking for nominations for the Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee for the year ahead   Thank you Is there a second?  SEVERAL Second   I hear a motion and a second Any other nominations? Hearing none, I declare the nominations closed All in favor say ""Aye""  SEVERAL ""Aye""   Opposed? Congratulations, Mr Chairman   At the Chairman's request, I will proceed very quickly to the Vice Chairmanship where nominations are now declared open   Thank you Any seconds?  SPEAKER(?) Second   That one came a little slowly, Bill [Laughter] Any other nominations? If not, I declare the nominations closed All in favor of Mr McDonough for Vice Chairman signify by saying ""Aye""  SEVERAL ""Aye""   Opposed? Congratulations, sir Mr Chairman, do you want to proceed from there?   Mr Chairman, I will nominate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   Mr Chairman, as you know the current Greenbook projection is quite similar to, but perhaps a little weaker than, the last several forecasts The main new weakness is that occurring in this quarter, and that does appear likely to materialize, given what we know now Thus, I would agree that the Greenbook's assessment of the entire period is probably the best one that we can get If I could get a guaranteed delivery on that outcome, I would buy it even though it does not project any further improvement in inflation over the projection period But, of course, there is no guaranteed delivery, and we have to look at where the possible deviations might occur  -25-    1/30-31/96  First of all on the up side, it seems to me that a breakout, defined as growth well above trend in the near or intermediate term, perhaps should not be taken totally off the table but it appears to have a very low probability The Greenbook's trend projection goes down the middle and, of course, it does not anticipate any great shock or surprise in either direction If we don't get any major shock, I think the Greenbook forecast is very, very likely to materialize It is very attractive It extends near-trend growth over a substantial period, projects moderate unemployment and a somewhat lower than the generally accepted level for the NAIRU, and it projects relatively low inflation I would add Al Broaddus's caution that this projection shows some acceleration of wage increases, and I think that is quite likely to be the case later in the period Unless productivity also increases materially over that period, we may see unit labor cost and production figures in 1996 that could add to inflation in 1997 and beyond Downside shocks are always possible, and when the economy is operating at a level that is a little weaker than before, it takes somewhat less of a shock or disappointment to knock it off stride In my mind, the downside risks are somewhat higher than I had earlier thought because the expansion does appear to be slower than I had hoped or expected Thank you   Mr Chairman, I am quite attracted to the arguments that Governors Yellen and Lindsey make and, frankly, it troubles me a little to reject those and go for Alternative I Nevertheless, I am choosing Alternative I for the simple reason that to change the ranges would involve a certain fine-tuning of the dials that we don't know that we want to do, we don't know that we need to do, and we don't even know that we can do As a consequence, I will stay with Alternative I   Al, can a layman ask for some edification here? I think you had in there--   I think part of your proposal included a guideline for 1996   My question is, if monetary policy exerts its impact with a lag, whether we are currently in a position to do anything to affect 1996 beyond events that are already in train or policies that have already been implemented   I am going to be very disappointed if we don't achieve your guideline in 1996, and I have some confidence that we will But I think that will be a result of developments and polices that are already in train  -39-    1/30-31/96   Mr Chairman, I agree with those who feel that the economy is probably all right, but I also think that the downside risks clearly are elevated I also believe that it is quite likely that the equilibrium federal funds rate is lower than it was earlier Consequently, a somewhat lower rate is not inconsistent with what the Committee's goals have been all along and will continue to be With the inflation outlook as good as it is for the near and intermediate terms, all of this leaves us with room to move, and I support your recommendation as an insurance policy "
5543,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me that economic activity is tracking along the Greenbook path about as we had expected and hoped I want to associate myself particularly with Ed Boehne's comment that the remarkable resilience of this economy has been the most interesting development recently This certainly is not surprising, but it is highly gratifying Perhaps the only surprise is the very early and rather strong reemergence of strength in the economy, and along with that a more credible upside risk and its mirror image, a little alleviation of the downside risk going forward This seems to leave us with a high likelihood of a quite satisfactory economic performance in the period ahead I agree with Vice Chairman McDonough that the risks appear to be symmetric, perhaps not terribly strong at this point, but it seems to me that they are moving in the upside direction My main concern at the moment is that all of this looks just a little too neat and too pat I can't quite trust it We know that challenges are going to emerge, and I suspect they probably will arise somewhat sooner rather than later We will just have to be alert to what those challenges turn out to be and when they are going to appear  -16-    3/26/96   We must be in great shape if we are having a break at 930 am!   I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5565,1996-05-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe we may just now be entering a very tricky and important period The Greenbook shows a very near-term deceleration in GDP growth to a 2 percent annual rate Despite that, the staff foresees, as do many others here, an inflationary creep even without a minimum wage bill If we get that bill, I think the rise in inflation might come sooner and become stronger In my view, we have been riding the crest of a really remarkable period Growth has been satisfactory We have had an unemployment rate of around 5-1/2 percent, which of course is seen as being at or below the NAIRU, for well over six quarters now GDP is at or near potential In spite of that, inflation has remained quiescent We certainly do not have the price level stability that we want to achieve, but inflation nevertheless has been flat and relatively low So far, no significant trend is visible in the statistics The Greenbook and other forecasters project some change in this starting very soon--in the third quarter--and going forward through the forecast period and beyond We are all very jealous of the progress that we have made; we certainly want more; and we probably would see a persistent rise in inflation, even if it were a slow rise, as very dangerous The question is whether it will happen and if so, when  If we look at GDP growth in recent quarters and the Greenbook forecast for the upcoming quarters and include the 35 percent growth rate projected by the staff for the current quarter, we find that the average for this quarter and the previous three quarters is a growth rate of 25 percent However, GDP growth has been accelerating over the last three quarters If one looks at this quarter and the next three as projected in the Greenbook, they average a little more than 24 percent but display a slowing trend That is the projection The big downshift in GDP growth is expected to come in the period immediately ahead, in the third quarter, after which such growth is projected to flatten and stay around 2 percent It seems to me that this outlook is quite credible, quite likely It seems to be centered on sectors like housing, capital investment, net exports, and government expenditures We have seen long rates rise; we have seen the dollar rise; we have seen the deficit go down, so this outlook is quite plausible If we get that pattern, it seems to me that it is also plausible that inflation might continue being dormant We may even find that the economy's potential is a bit higher, closer to the 24 percent or 25 percent growth that we have been experiencing and expect to experience on average With such growth rates, inflation might remain benign, and that would be an extremely positive development On the other hand, if the economy continues to be stronger than expected, as we have seen recently, and if it stays this strong much longer, we certainly could face a highly increasing likelihood of greater and perhaps somewhat more virulent inflation than is projected in the Greenbook  -21-    5/21/96  I will close where I began I think that we are possibly at a very important watershed There are some very important months immediately ahead   Mr Chairman, as I said a little earlier, I think we are approaching but are not quite yet at a watershed, and as a consequence I don't have a view at this point concerning what way the water is going to flow when it flows Clearly, there has been a shifting of the risks to the up side On the other hand, it is a clearly plausible prospect that we will get a distinct slowing in the expansion rather soon If we do get that slowing, it seems to me that the history of the past two or three years has to give us some pause about just how ""baked in the cake"" an inflationary rise may be It could well turn out that if we get a distinct slowing, we will continue to see a pattern of stable inflation At any rate, it doesn't seem to me that time is of the essence at this point I think ""watchful waiting"" makes good sense I prefer symmetry for precisely the reasons that Ed Boehne just stated, and I won't repeat them But I must say that, for all of this, I am sitting very lightly in the chair about this business, and I would not object to asymmetry   Mr Chairman, I would like to associate myself with Governor Lindsey and Governor Yellen as an opportunist I think there are a couple of other problems with this exercise When we are looking ahead in terms of an expected result, that is a forecast We come out with a point estimate forecast for that period in time I think setting a goal is a different exercise For one thing, people set goals differently One of the pleasures of my job is that I get to discuss goals with all 12 Reserve Banks They all have a different definition of how to set goals, and I don't know why that should not be true here Some people believe in setting a goal that involves a lot of stretch, making it literally unachievable, so the issue is how close they can come to it Others like to set goals that can be achieved with just a reasonable degree of effort Both of those approaches are valid as long as people know which one is which, which one to follow If we tried to establish a goal as a Committee of 19 people, I am not sure how we would do it  Secondly, my working vision of how this opportunistic approach works is to get ourselves, as we have, into a downward sloping channel We expect to have a little fluctuation inside that channel with regard to the performance of various indicators, but inflation would be pointed downward toward price level stability How we articulate exactly what inflation will be as a point estimate at a future point in time using an opportunistic strategy is a little difficult for me to conceive So, exactly how one sets a goal in a quantitative sense if one is basically of an opportunistic inclination is a little difficult for me to see "
5588,1996-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting, I observed that I thought we were entering a watershed period I believe that we are now in that period, although I think it is too early to tell just which way the water is going to fall when it falls Certainly at this time, we have an economy with a good head of steam Many have remarked on that And we could be looking at a pickup of inflation; that prospect could certainly raise its head If we are convinced that the likely scenario is intensifying inflation and that it is baked in the cake, then I think it is time for action It is better to adjust policy sooner rather than later, once we believe that But I still must question whether or not that is the case If we look at the past four quarters including the second quarter and assume 4 percent growth for the second quarter, four-quarter GDP growth would be a little over 25 percent Over most of this past period, many observers here and elsewhere have believed that the economy was at capacity; we started talking about that some time ago And yet where are we? Most of our inflation measures--the core CPI, the core PPI, and the GDP deflator--are flat on a rate-of-change basis or else the rate of change is beginning to drift down in some cases Foreign inflation is half that in the United States Unit labor costs currently are rising at a rate of around 23 percent, and they have been decelerating over the course of this four-quarter period The capacity utilization rate has been flat at about 82 percent Unemployment has been flat at 55 or 555 percent; there are two 56s in there Commodity prices are now falling almost across the board, including virtually all industrial commodities, gold, oil, and even a large number of foodstuffs  I think the third quarter may be a time when we will get a reading on the watershed When we are talking about a four-quarter change, folding in one quarter forward could make a lot of difference If the third-quarter growth rate is going to be another 4 percent or so, then the four-quarter rate of change will accelerate to about 27 percent If the growth rate is going to fall back to 25 percent, which is still above the Greenbook forecast, we would then be talking about a four-quarter rate of change falling back to 24 percent and we would have a declining trend So, the current quarter will make a lot of difference in terms of judging the trend  If we look at the Greenbook for the rest of the forecast period of six quarters out, as Mike Prell noted the staff has projected a trend rate of growth of about 22 percent, a flat unemployment rate at 55 percent, a flat capacity utilization rate, unit labor costs rising at a 25 percent rate without much trend, and  -34-    7/2-3/96  no acceleration in the growth of activity over the course of that six- quarter period One certainly can argue that that may be too modest a forecast on the output side and that the rate of inflation may rise during that forecast period That is the risk We have had a very fickle expansion for 20 quarters or so now The rate of economic growth has changed its direction something like 11 times in those 20 quarters, so the rate of expansion has repeatedly sped up and slowed down Even if the risk is to the up side, it may not be that great a risk If we look at the last two years and where we are today, and particularly if we focus on the last year to date, it is hard to generate much conviction out of that experience that we necessarily are going to see any inflation impulse at all, given economic growth in line with the Greenbook forecast Certainly we could, but it seems to me that if the economy runs a course similar to that over the past year or two, at the worst increased inflation will be rather slow to materialize and will not have very much muscle behind it So, there is some chance in my opinion that we may be able to continue to ride the crest of this really remarkable period for some time to come Beyond that, who is to say which way the water is going to flow?  Mr Chairman, the tale is not yet told in my view I do agree that the risks are on the up side, and as a consequence I am sitting very lightly in my chair   Mr Chairman, I have no strong feeling about the ranges themselves, but I do feel strongly that the management of the issue is important In that sense, I strongly support your recommendation   Second   Mr Chairman, it is very correct to be suspicious of the notion that this time things have changed That is a classic trap It is frequently a loser's cry, and I find myself very uncomfortable supporting that notion By conventional standards I think the case to move now is somewhere between strong and compelling But I also think that there are very strong indications that things have indeed changed Maybe the better question--it is at least for me--is whether this change is temporary and whether it will turn around very soon If it does go back toward a more conventional experience, will it look the same as it did historically? I would compare this to the recent history of M2 that we discussed earlier this morning M2 tracked along very well, very conventionally for some number of years, went badly off the track for a while for reasons that were hard to understand at the time, and now seems to be coming back again The nature of the M2 episode is beginning to be better understood That may be in the process of happening here as well But the presumption either that things have not changed or, if they have, they will immediately return to the traditional relationship, carries its own dangers and its own uncertainties The better part of valor is to try to get as good a reading as we can get as things progress before we commit one way or the other As a consequence, I strongly support your notion of a ""B"" directive and can support asymmetry   Mr Chairman, I have never been completely clear as to exactly what kind of an obligation these swap lines were What are we obliged to do? It seems to me that whenever there is a likelihood that a central bank will want to draw on its swap line, that involves a full-blown discussion and negotiation anyway A swap agreement is not a right to automatic credit as I understand it As a consequence, it strikes me that its very existence may tend over time to be more awkward than helpful if other central banks presume that there is a right to credit which may turn out not to be desirable from our perspective at the time the drawing is requested So, for that reason and others that have been mentioned here, it seems to me that it would be a good idea for us to start moving slowly away from our swap agreements  An additional dimension that I don't think I heard mentioned here and that seems relevant to me would be the new level of participation and capability of the private sector to perform a lot of these functions We recently went through an interesting pattern with the Brady negotiations and the structure that came out of that Very recently, there have been interesting negotiations with Mexico that involved a third-party, private-sector group I think that that is an appropriate consideration as well  I would like to reiterate two things that Governor Rivlin and others have said First, we probably should have some idea of where we want to go before we leave where we are The second point is that I believe this is at least as much a political as it is a financial consideration As a consequence, as soon as we have our thinking together, I think we should begin to move very slowly and carefully out of these arrangements and to do so in the context of a broad range of considerations and discussions "
5614,1996-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the fourth quarter of 1994 the unemployment rate dropped rather precipitously from 6 percent and above, where it had been for some time previously, down into the 5-1/2 percent range where it has been ever since It also was right around that time that capacity utilization in manufacturing began to drop from its peak of around 843 down into the low 82s For the past eight quarters, including this one, we have been pretty close to living in an economic nirvana GDP growth has been right on trend 4 quarters over 2 percent, 1 quarter at 2 percent, 3 quarters under 1  -27-    8/20/96  percent The economy has been operating either at or very close to capacity with very little, if any, gap between potential and actual output Unemployment has been steady at around 55 percent, capacity utilization as I noted has been declining slowly, inflation is flat to down, core CPI has averaged 285 percent If it turns out that the core CPI has been overstated by a percentage point or so, that means that we have been even closer to an economic nirvana Other measures such as the deflator and the chain indexes have been lower in absolute levels but the trend has looked the same The expectation going forward in the Greenbook is for more of almost the same through 1997 capacity utilization steady at 82 percent, unemployment steady at 54 percent, and GDP growth right on trend at 21 percent At least that is close enough to trend for government work Government work, you know, is defined as measuring with a micrometer, marking with chalk, and then cutting with an axe [Laughter] But there is one big difference in the forecast that we have been discussing That is that inflation will start to rise, and that is projected to start to happen right about now The Greenbook shows the core CPI moving up to 3 percent this quarter and to 32 percent next year That would represent a half percentage point jump in a year's time, and I presume that if the forecast were extended, the trend would continue to be up from there, ceteris paribus Now, that certainly would not be acceptable to me or probably to anyone else in this room And I am afraid that the 3 percent increase that we got in the CPI in July could be a harbinger of things to come  If we are going to get this rise in inflation, how would it happen? We have been discussing all morning that it would be through rising compensation costs that would get passed upstream into prices If that is going to happen, several things in some combination have to occur First, the rising wages obviously have to drive unit production costs up materially We do see that beginning to happen, possibly through the ECI and certainly the new minimum wage law But the increase in production costs will have to be high enough to overcome productivity growth, which I continue to believe is under measured, and the flatter benefit costs that the Vice Chairman spoke about a few minutes ago That certainly could occur There is no doubt about that But the other question is whether some pricing power will begin to re-emerge in the economy We still have a world with a lot of slack in almost every economic sector There still seems to be fierce competition everywhere in the domestic economy I have not heard of any easing in the consumer's fierce resistance to price increases Also for this to happen, it would have to imply that business would be able to refuse to compromise their very strong profit margins Historically, of course, they have compromised them when they needed to I suppose that it would also imply the likelihood or need for a lower dollar These conditions for pricing power to re-emerge are not in view insofar as I can see  Nevertheless, could all of this come together and perhaps result in an inflationary surge? Yes, indeed; I do not think there is any doubt about that But can we be confident that is what will happen, especially very soon or starting now? On the basis of the long-term historical record, I think we probably would be persuaded that that is in fact extremely likely But on the basis of developments over the past two years, it is a little more difficult to be convinced It is quite possible that we could roll on along like we are for some time I do not know how long, certainly What  -28-    8/20/96  happens then is virtually anyone's guess in such a period Admittedly, that is a very sanguine outlook, and frankly I am not a bit comfortable with it It is dependent almost entirely on an early and substantial slowdown in the expansion, and I have a special concern in that regard given the possibility of a new inventory surge But the slowdown has to happen if that happy outlook is to ensue It seems to me that the risks are distinctly on the up side, but for the moment I would say let us continue to give it a chance   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5638,1996-09-24," Why don't you hire some decent help? [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think I am well aware and I am certainly deeply respectful of the arguments that would say that inflation is likely to rise and that policy should move now or perhaps sooner than now to prevent it Of course, this view is based, as we have been discussing, on two central facts--that the economy is very fully utilized and that compensation is increasing as a consequence These conditions clearly exist  I want no part of an inflationary rise I am sure no one here does But I also see a number of factors that have forced me to question whether such an event is inevitable, at least anytime soon or to a meaningful degree We have been talking about all of the reasons in prior meetings and again this morning in some detail I will not run through my laundry list; it is much the same as we have been discussing I would say that on balance I just do not see the evidence that moves me away from the judgment that I have been making for some time There continues to be, as has been discussed, no visible sign of rising price inflation yet If anything, it is continuing to go down, as Governor Meyer pointed out I think there are many tell-tale indicators, precursors, that would show that there are very few signs of inflation actually in the pipeline Unit labor costs are down from 1995 and they are forecasted to go down further Foreign inflation is benign Inflationary expectations are flat We see very little delivery tightness Commodity prices are flat to down Real interest rates are flat in a neutral zone And it does appear that we are getting the slowing in GDP growth that I think we felt was essential to maintain a steady policy We will see how that develops  With all of this said, I think nonetheless that the risks are clearly on the high side, and I continue to sit very lightly in my chair I did not arrive at this judgment easily, but I would say that I believe we should continue to give this thing a chance   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5662,1996-11-13," I move it, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to say first of all that comments around the table at these meetings are always insightful and very interesting, but I have found that to be particularly true this morning and I greatly appreciate it It also would appear that the discussion is moving along rather smartly today; we may get coffee at a more reasonable hour than we sometimes do! By my calculation, I am the clean-up hitter and I have very little to add to what has been said  Let me just summarize very briefly I share the strong general concern around the table that the tight labor markets and the attendant rise in wages could very well lead to price increases That still could very well happen, but we see very little evidence of such a development so far, and we will just have to watch that very closely The one big thing that is new this time, as we had hoped and expected, is that we now have confirmation that the expansion has slowed Looking ahead, our attention obviously must shift to whether the expansion is in line for a reacceleration with the dangers that  -27-    11/13/96  would be attendant to that, whether it will rock along near trend, plus or minus a bit, or whether indeed the economy may be in the early stages of a somewhat more serious slowdown The point has been made, and I share it, that as time goes on and events unfold, the risks are becoming more symmetric We cannot tell yet, and I am not prepared to adopt a symmetric point of view at this juncture, but it may be that we will be thinking quite soon of returning to a symmetric directive For now, it would certainly appear that the remarkable economic performance that we have seen for some time is continuing We should watch it closely and continue to let it run Thank you   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I also support the sentiments regarding symmetry expressed by Governor Rivlin and President McTeer "
5687,1996-12-17," Mr Chairman, I have very little to add this morning, and I will be very brief As we know, this was a very short intermeeting interval, and it seems to me that the incoming data have had very little significance for policy in the short run So, I believe that on balance the economic situation very much calls for the status quo The Greenbook always makes for fascinating reading, but I have to say that the current edition is as bland as any I have seen since I have been here, which I do not mean as a complaint or a criticism That is the way things are We continue to be in a period of watchful waiting; that is what seems to be appropriate in my view This period is not going to go on forever, but it does seem to continue at least for now I would like to add that I think that the risks continue to become a little more symmetric, but I am in no rush to change the direction of the intermeeting bias Thank you   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5712,1997-02-04," I will be happy to nominate Chairman Greenspan for that role   Second   Second    2/4-5/97   Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the midst of the enormous plethora of  data and impressions that one is subjected to, I have been asking myself what developments over  the recent past seem to be significant I would like to list six things--three of them because they  are moving and three because they are not  First are the three that seem to me to be moving, and I would have to put wage  pressures at the top of that list It seems clear that those pressures are present and probably are  strengthening as time goes along Where that is really important is in what it implies for unit  labor costs, and I don't think that is quite as clear I would like to know how many stories like    2/4-5/97  are out there I particularly like that example because I once ran plastic moldings  plants and I understand them I don't know how widespread that is and I don't know how  productivity and these wage pressures interface, but that is a very powerful input, whatever it is,  and it does seem to be moving in the direction of more pressure  The second thing is the fourth-quarter GDP, particularly the message there that the  consumer is back The question is whether this strength in consumer spending is going to hold  up and be long-lasting or whether it is just temporary and will follow the saw-tooth pattern that  we have become familiar with throughout this expansion Here again, I think we have a very  powerful force, but one that at this point seems to me to be completely inscrutable Consumer  confidence, the wealth effect, and job formations seem to indicate that it might have staying  power On the other hand we have the high level of consumer debt and a question as to whether  or not there exists a great deal of pent-up demand Those questions would indicate that GDP  growth might fade back to a sustainable rate If some of the supporting factors start to go away,  like the wealth effect through a stock market break, consumer expenditures could actually fade to  less than a sustainable level and could become a possibly serious downside risk at some point  The third thing is the recent movement of the dollar As we know, the stronger dollar  should tend to weaken exports It also should tend to hold inflation in check  There are three important things that do not appear to me to moving much I would  mention first the large number of inflation indices We are all focused on the CPI; we have been  talking about it a lot, but it is not necessarily that typical There are many other price indices that  are not moving up and indeed a number that are moving down Now, that is not determinative in  and of itself because the Committee has worked ahead of those series in the past, and I am sure it  will again I think it is significant that subdued inflation has been the trend for many quarters    2/4-5/97  now It has persisted in the face of what we have regarded over some long period of time as  being considerable upward pressure, and yet inflation by these measures still stays pretty much  the same This raises a lot of questions in my mind about what may be going on in the economy,  and I would love to get some answers somehow I don't know if we will  Another thing that does not seem to be changing much is that no new driving forces  appear to be emerging There are no new engines that seem likely to push the economy toward  either consistent strength or weakness We seem to be enjoying an extended stay on the  mountain top that Governor Meyer mentioned a week or two ago, and who knows how long that  may last  Lastly, it does not seem to me that we have much pressure on capacity utilization, and  without that I wonder how much inflationary pressure is likely to emerge in the economy My  bottom line is that I am very nervous about what may be happening as a result of the tight labor  markets and the associated wage pressures At the end of the day that may be more important  than the other five factors or anything else An enormously important question in my mind is the  enigma of the consumer I guess we will just have to wait and see how much that potential  strength stays there All in all, I continue to think that it makes sense to wait and see   Mr Chairman, I certainly support alternative I The reasons have  been well discussed and I don't have anything to add    2/4-5/97  It may be redundant but I would like to add the following It seems to me that we are  entering a new era of appropriate intellectual focus in all our concerns here I think we have had  the first airing of it this morning that I can recall For the last decade or so, we have been in the  process of trying to work inflation down in an orderly manner, and that has been our entire focus  What are the appropriate ways to do that? We certainly have not yet fully achieved price  stability, but I do think that we are now beginning to enter a zone where our focus should shift a  little, and we should start to think in terms of how to maintain ourselves in that zone over time  once we begin to get in it I would like to see some staff work and see us begin to have some  dialogue on such questions as what price indices we should be targeting or what combination of  indices As someone asked, what are the appropriate levels of those indices given the  methodologies involved in their construction? At what levels of these indices can we feel  comfortable that we are achieving what we want to achieve? If zero is where we would be  comfortable, that would have to imply that there are some deflationary tendencies in some  sectors of the eonomy How do we feel about those and the impact they might have on the  economy? How do we deal with an upward drift in inflation? Do we accommodate some of it or  do we hit it over the head instantly when we are already in a zone of price level stability,  however defined? These are the kinds of questions that I do not think we have faced before, and  maybe it is a little ahead of the curve to think about them right now, but I would like to suggest  that we start to do some work in that area   Thank you, Mr Chairman I completely support your proposal; I  believe it is the right one I also think that suggestions that we may need to move in the near  future are probably correct, and I would support that as the most likely probability But I am a  little uncomfortable with what may be an excessive amount of prejudging that policy action I  am a bit haunted by the fact that we all saw emerging pressures that were clearly going to lead to  an outbreak of inflation a year or 18 months ago, and here we are I do not think we should  forget that The outbreak is still ahead of us The pressures are still there They may be more  intense, and a rise in inflation may start tomorrow morning; it may already have started and we  cannot see it yet But I think we should be a little cautious about prejudging what we are going  to have to do at any point in the future Thank you "
5736,1997-03-25," Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman For a number of meetings now, the  economy has seemed to be deja vu For some time, we have felt that we were looking at a  fully utilized economy, one with tight and tightening labor markets that seemed likely to    3/25/97  begin to show escalating labor costs and from there escalating inflation--in short, an  overheating economy But that has not happened so far In fact, inflation is flat to down  according to many statistical series Our expectation has been that the expansion would slow  to growth at about trend and that this might allow us to experience a quiescent inflation rate  for some period of time or indefinitely This is a very rosy scenario It certainly has seemed  quite plausible, and it has been working for a long time Our policy has been to stay alert,  stay asymmetric, but basically to wait and see While I have never been very comfortable  with it, I certainly have been solidly in that camp  But now I think the very strong first quarter that we seem to be experiencing calls  into question the continued viability of that scenario Growth for the past four quarters  including this one is going to be somewhere in excess of 3-1/2 percent That is certainly well  beyond anybody's estimate of potential in an economy whose resources already seem to be  fully utilized And it now seems that there is very little that is likely to slow that growth  materially We talked about all the factors this morning job formation and the purchasing  power that it creates, surprisingly strong construction, both residential and nonresidential,  sky-high consumer confidence with jobs plentiful, and supportive wealth effects If  consumer spending should slow in the near future, I think we probably would get an  inventory pop that would keep things going Certainly, there is a potential for slower growth  if we were to get a stronger dollar or a bear stock market There are other potential shocks I  am sure, but they seem to have a considerably lower probability  The very strong and persistent job formation that we have seen is very likely in my  view to start to take its toll on costs The unemployment rate has been held up as high as it  is by the fact that the labor force has been growing at an unexpectedly high rate The labor    3/25/97  force participation rate is now at a record high, I believe, or very close to it If the rapid  growth of the labor force were to slow, the unemployment rate would probably go down  substantially and costs would probably and perhaps inevitably rise But if that labor force  growth somehow continues, we will have to wonder about the quality of the new labor and  what is going to happen to productivity and costs as a result Certainly, there is some other  combination of potential developments in the labor market Some employers who are not  chasing their firm's stock price will simply restrain production, slow growth down rather  than allow their costs to rise I am sure that many will be able to keep their productivity  growing There are employers who are causing jobs to migrate to lower cost areas, though it  looks as if Utah is off the list [Laughter] Many are going offshore That is happening, but  we have to wonder whether there is likely to be enough of that to affect aggregate indicators  of economic performance There certainly are a lot of things or combinations of things that  could stretch out the benign era that we are in But given what we see happening in the  economy right now, what we know about the utilization rate of economic resources, and what  seem to me to be the highest probabilities in coming quarters, it may soon be time for us to  consider pulling up stakes and moving the camp to higher ground [Laughter]   I started to say something like that, Mr Chairman, but I thought  that was just taking it too far   I would not want to see us get under water [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I support the 25 basis points and I support the  symmetrical directive on its merits   Mr Chairman, one suggestion for your consideration   About two sentences from the bottom, you list inflation first and  growth second I would suggest reversing the order in which you say those two things   We have to do that for sure "
5758,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman Earlier when President McTeer was  about to begin the ""tour de table,"" reference was made to the recent episode of the so-called  ""Republic of Texas"" If I understood President McTeer correctly, his reply was that the  Republic of Texas and the Eleventh District are about the same thing As Chairman of the  Bank Affairs Committee, I can verify that that is correct [Laughter]  The outlook for the balance of this year and next appears to be heavily weighted in  the direction of offering a very attractive period of continued growth, a high level of  utilization of the economy's resources, and an inflation rate that may begin to growl but  almost certainly not to roar Given that likelihood, I think it is appropriate to focus, as the  Greenbook does at the end of its first section, on the forces that might be influencing the  trend of events going into 1999 and out from there Addressing the latter point, how should  we think about policy for 1999 and forward?    5/20/97  Let me outline briefly two strands of thought in the context of our national  economic goal of maximum sustainable growth, which we at the Fed believe requires price  level stability as a prerequisite for success First of all, we reversed policy at the last  meeting After holding our fire for many quarters in the face of rising labor market  pressures, seeing a very strong surge of activity in the first quarter, which was counter to  expectations, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points In absolute terms,  this is a modest move, but such impact as it will have has not yet fully been felt I believe it  carried two meaningful psychological messages First, there is a new policy paradigm in the  sense that the basic thrust of monetary policy is now toward tightening And second, the Fed  continues to have no intention of permitting inflation to get a grip on the economy I am  entirely comfortable with that decision In my opinion, it clearly was the right thing to do  With that decision behind us, where do we stand today? The pace of economic  activity, while still moving forward, appears to be slowing The employment cost index  moved up modestly in the first quarter Most commodity prices are flat to down Unit labor  costs do not appear to be accelerating Profit margins continue to be strong and deterioration  there should provide us with an early warning of inflationary change There appears to be no  fear of inflation embedded in the yield curve As I peruse the Beigebook, I have to go back  to check the date because it continues to read precisely the same as it has for well over a year  My best judgment from all of this is that growth will continue, and we are seeing likely but  not definitive signs of incipient inflationary creep But in terms of our stated national  economic goal, that does not seem to pose a clear and present danger  Moving to line-of-thought number two In the absence of a settled notion of the  definition of price level stability, I think a responsible judgment can be made that we are now    5/20/97  either in that zone or very close to it If the CPI measurement is about a percentage point too  high, the real CPI is now increasing at a rate between 1 and 2 percent Almost all the other  price indexes indicate a steady rate of inflation in the 1 to 2 percent range, although some  measures, including the core CPI, suggest that inflation may be beginning to edge up The  Chairman's qualitative definition of price stability, namely that we are there when inflation  concerns are removed from economic decisionmaking, appears largely to be in place If we  are in or very close to the price stability zone, again in terms of national economic goals, the  relevant question becomes how we hold the economy there and keep it robust  First of all, if higher-than-trend growth continues or resumes soon--and it well  may; I think the growth risks are on the upside--that clearly would seem to require additional  tightening, perhaps a good deal of it But if the economy returns to a trend rate of growth or  slower than trend, there may be a significant probability, given the economy's performance  characteristics over the past two years as a guide, that we will not need to adjust policy for  some time and indeed there is no absolute certainty as to which direction we may ultimately  move Further, we do not satisfactorily understand why the economy is working so well  right now If we were to cut its momentum back too much too soon, we might forego a  precious opportunity to learn more about what could be some critically important new  realities In my view, the risk/return ratio of alternative policies evaluated against national  economic goals provides ample reason for waiting to see what happens as events unfold  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I had intended to say something much like what  President Boehne just said Let me simply associate myself with his remarks and concur  with your recommendation "
5779,1997-07-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman By my count, I am the cleanup hitter here  in this excellent tour de table Nearly every thing has been said, and I will be very brief It does  seem that we finally are getting a slowdown in the expansion, albeit a quarter later than expected  The inflation news continues to be very good, with none of the indices surging, a few beginning  to show signs of drifting upward, and most still either flat or drifting down on a 12-month change  basis I continue to try as best I can to scan carefully for emerging pressures in the inflationary  pipeline I've seen very little pressure for a number of quarters, but recently there have been  straws in the wind that some new pressures may be starting to emerge such as the expected  increase in the level of import prices and so forth The glaring exception, of course, is our  remarkable labor market; everybody has talked about that So far, price levels have been very  little affected by the low unemployment rate and the rising ECI, as our unit labor costs of  production have remained very stable However, the Greenbook is now projecting a substantial    7/1-2/97  and sustained acceleration in unit labor costs beginning almost immediately, and time will tell  about that While the condition of the economy today remains excellent, tensions and pressures  continue to build as one looks forward over our forecast horizon If the rate of expansion  remains moderate, this remarkable era could continue well into the future However, if growth  should reaccelerate strongly in the short run, the Committee may need to reassess conditions  quickly and critically Looking further out in our forecast period, I would like to be more  confident than I am of the Greenbook's projection of substantially slower growth through 1998  It seems quite likely to me that growth will exceed the Greenbook projection over the forecast  period, especially if there were to be no additional monetary restraint until the middle of next  year For now, however, it is steady as she goes She is going very well so far Thank you   Mr Chairman, one part of this fascinating discussion leaves me a  little nervous There are many intriguing questions here that we can ponder We can spend a  great deal of time doing so if we allow ourselves to focus on such questions as what is money,  and are prices necessarily the most relevant way to measure whatever we will want to measure in  tomorrow's world These are important questions, but we must not lose sight of the fact that we  have to manage policy and the related question of how we should manage policy in a low  inflation era We are in such an era We may not be at price level stability, however someone  may want to define it, but we are in a low inflation period Most of the price indices that we look  at show inflation rising between 1 and 2 percent and the trend is flat A few indices are in the 2  to 3 percent area, but I don't think any are over 3 percent at this point Much of the discussion    7/1-2/97  on price level stability is focused on inflation rates in the 1 to 3 percent area We have to  manage policy in that framework, and there are some rather imminent questions  Larry Meyer raises probably the most basic question, and that is, what is socially  optimal in this era? If it is a range, what is the range? Should policy respond differently to  inflation when it is at a low absolute level than it does when it is high? A one percentage point  difference in the inflation level may mean something entirely different when the absolute level is  5 or 6 percent as opposed to when it is 1 or 2 percent And if policy should respond differently,  how should it respond? If we are going to get down to lower levels of inflation, we are going to  start having more and more pockets of deflation How should we think about those, and to what  extent is that an acceptable condition? In sum, low inflation has its own problems as we all  know But we have not had to face them, and I think we could very well get ourselves in a  situation where we may need to face them So, there are some very practical problems that we  need to work on even while we are thinking about these longer-term, perhaps a little more  theoretical, kinds of concerns I guess my plea is, let's give a large amount of attention to those  nearer-term problems while we are dealing with the others   I concur, Mr Chairman, with alternative I I don't think I can add  anything to the many valuable comments that have been made around the table   That change would give her six months' worth of new material!   I would retain the traditional wording until we explain to the public  how and why we are changing it; the explanation should be released in advance of the actual  publication of the reworded directive   Mr Chairman, healthy humility is a virtue in the eyes of the Lord,  and I think you have given voice to a certain level of humility that we all feel in the light of our  lack of understanding Happily and fortunately, the conditions that we do not understand are  favorable, and so far they are holding I think your recommendation accommodates these  uncertainties It recognizes the state of affairs as they exist, and it anticipates the most likely  course of upcoming events So, I support your recommendation "
5804,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the seven weeks since we last met, I have  been doing my best to search the data and read and listen as carefully as I could to see if I can come  up with any convincing information that indicates things are beginning to change Other than    8/19/97  various straws in the wind, I just cannot find any There certainly are some straws in the wind Al  Broaddus mentioned some important ones that would indicate some strengthening in economic  activity, and others have as well But it should be mentioned that there also are some straws in the  wind blowing in the other direction that would indicate a possible slowing or at least not very much  acceleration in economic activity, and possibly some easing in inflationary pressures The dollar  has continued to strengthen on balance; long-term interest rates have eased on balance; the yield  curve is flatter and lower; the PPI has fallen for seven straight months; inventory growth has been  too strong; consumer sentiment is still quite high but is off its peak; gold prices--for anyone who is  interested--are lower; capacity utilization is down a little; and non-oil import prices are expected to  continue soft There are straws in the wind that are swirling, I would guess, in all directions  I have no intention whatsoever of climbing into any of Peter Fisher's boxes, [Laughter]  but I must say that we should be careful about making too much fun of the so-called new paradigm  pessimists because I don't think that deflation is completely impossible All in all, the message to  me is that the risks are probably still moderately to the upside, and we should, and will certainly,  stay very alert But basically, it is steady as she goes   Leave it alone   Well, Mr Chairman, I would say that you are in error in one respect It  is not everybody's second choice It is my first choice   I accept, Mr Chairman "
5827,1997-09-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman As we head for coffee in the next couple of  minutes, it seems to me that my notes may be a bit of a composite of what has been said around the  table As I began to focus on this meeting, I asked myself first and foremost ""what is new?"" The  answer that came back is ""so far, not much"" The data story today seems to me to be very much as  it has been for some period of time now strong growth, tighter labor markets, and very little  evidence of pressure on unit costs or prices As I look at the inflationary pipeline to try to get some  clue of what may be coming our way, it is very hard to find very much in the way of new pressure  There is some, but not very much  With regard to indicators of economic activity, we are all very conscious of what is  happening in the labor market We have been discussing that at length On the other hand, we see  no pressure on unit labor costs In my view, I don't see much pressure emerging in capacity  utilization, except perhaps New York hotel rooms, Bill (McDonough)!   With respect to financial indicators, one can find very little pressure in  the yield curve or in interest rate levels On the other hand, household wealth continues to rise and  there is abundant liquidity in the economy From the foreign side, there seems to be very little in    9/30/97  the way of new pressure, and from the side of commodities or what one might call goods inputs,  none at all  So, on its face, the appropriate policy once again looks like steady as she goes,  asymmetric, high alert In short, little visibly has changed And yet, one has to feel, or at least I do,  a certain heightening tension driven mainly by the fact that the slowdown we had been expecting  did not happen It is not happening now, and there seems to be very little likelihood that it is going  to unless it gets a boost or a jolt from here or elsewhere During the past four quarters, growth has  averaged 38 percent, which is very strong Unemployment has come down over that period from  53 to 48 percent And no matter how guilty one may feel about harboring heretical notions about  lower NAIRUs or higher productivity or shifting paradigms or whatever, one thing for sure, as  many people have observed, is that there are limits somewhere What is going to keep the  economy from pushing right through them, wherever they are? There is plenty of liquidity  available at reasonable rates We are beginning to worry about M2 Household wealth continues to  rise; consumers are very confident; jobs are abundant Our foreign trade prospects seem to be  favorable for more domestic growth There is no meaningful fiscal drag The Greenbook calls for  two more strong quarters before any slowing occurs, and when it does occur, it is at least in part  being pushed by the possibility of a stock market break and rising interest rates  Mr Chairman, at the last meeting you commented that there are signs that we may be  running out the string, and it seems to me that those signs are multiplying   I concur, Mr Chairman "
5850,1997-11-12," Thank you, Mr Chairman Most of the incoming evidence we have  been talking about suggests that the economy is continuing to grow very robustly, quite likely  well beyond what even an optimist like me would like to think of as sustainable growth  Certainly, it is true that there are widespread and credible expectations of a more or less  spontaneous slowdown Inflation indexes continue to come in remarkably subdued, and I must  say that it is hard to see how monetary policy could be falling behind the curve, at least so far    11/12/97 83  Nonetheless, absent extraordinary circumstances, I for one would be wrestling strenuously this  morning with a question of whether or not the time had arrived for preemptory action  However, as we know and have been discussing, extraordinary circumstances do exist  in the form of turbulence in Asia and excessive volatility in many financial markets We will not  be able to judge for some time what the fallout of all these events may be, but it is certainly  highly likely that they will act to some degree to damp the pace of the expansion I can readily  envision the possibility that the impact, once all of these dominoes have fallen, would be at or  perhaps beyond the severe end of the range that we presently envision If those events were  coupled with a policy tightening, this instability could easily ignite a very undesirable and  excessive chain reaction This concern, together with the comforting belief that our policy is not  falling behind the curve at this time--although I must say I am not nearly so sanguine as I was  earlier about that--presents anew the line of reasoning that leads me to the same old conclusion,  ""steady as she goes""   Wrestle   I am sensitive to that!   I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5875,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman At our November meeting, at least some  of us were thinking hard about tightening policy in the face of very strong economic growth, but  we were deterred from doing so by the problems of Asia The Asian turbulence, the severity of  which was and still is difficult to judge, introduced major uncertainties, and we felt it unwise to  stir that bubbling pot further with a shift in policy Basically, I believe that constraint still holds  The domestic economy still looks quite strong, with what has come to be a rather standard array  of driving factors Those factors still seem to shift about but not to weaken on balance  Inflation, of course, remains dormant at this time However, we do face some important  changes The Asian concerns have intensified substantially, and their likely impact on our GDP  appears to be growing I, for one, would bet that the news is likely to get worse before the crisis  is over For the domestic economy, the Greenbook and many analysts see a slowing in prospect  that goes well beyond the Asia impact It is driven by reductions in rates of growth in    12/16/97 55  investments by businesses and households and a slowing in inventory accumulation To make  this bet, I would ask for somewhat better odds, but there is a good probability of such an  outcome  So, I find myself once again favoring a ""steady as she goes policy"" but with these  added thoughts Number one, upside risks seem to me to have moderated a bit while, number  two, significant downside concerns have now emerged Taken together, while quite substantial  in both directions, those risks seem roughly in balance This is indeed a remarkable time Thank  you   Mr Chairman, as I said earlier, I think this is a remarkable time in the  sense that we face very substantial risks, both up and down This leads me to support strongly  your proposal for a ""B"" symmetric directive But there is another interesting reason for  symmetry this time It relates to some asymmetries that I see in terms of the time frames within  which these different sets of risks might present themselves The downside risks primarily  revolve around the Asian situation, and if that situation blows up and forces some kind of policy  easing move, that is liable to happen reasonably soon and probably fairly dramatically On the  other hand, the upside risks that have been with us for a long time are liable to emerge over the  longer term and more slowly As a consequence, we would have a better opportunity to respond  if that is the way to go So, the short-term risks seem to me to be more on the downside, and we  presently have an asymmetric directive toward tightening I would prefer not to face the  prospect, should it emerge, of going all the way from an asymmetric directive toward tightening  to an easing move in an intermeeting period If we were to adopt a symmetric directive now, I    12/16/97 83  believe we would then be very well positioned to respond to whatever might emerge as time goes  on, whenever it might emerge Thank you "
5901,1998-02-03," After long and careful consideration, I nominate President  McDonough   Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman We're coming down the home stretch  here, and I'm afraid I am going to be quite repetitive, but I will press ahead briefly  Inflation, of course, is still showing no signs of rearing its ugly head even as the domestic  economy rolls along strongly We had a very strong fourth quarter and this quarter looks  strong so far We surely are going to get at least some slowing from developments in  Asia But as I look for reasons to expect any slowing from non-Asian sources--in other  words for domestic reasons--I find it quite hard to uncover any, and I would be loathe to  predict very much downside from domestic developments In fact, it seems to me that the  domestic scenario is distinctly one of upside risk, although we certainly should not ignore  or forget the possible downside shocks that Governor Rivlin listed  Asia, of course, is the major unknown of which we are aware, and it potentially  skews the risks in both directions in the following sense I was struck by the phrase that a  writer used in yesterday's Financial Times when he observed that the Asian impact needs  to be just right If it is, that's going to be really good news In fact, that is exactly what is    2/3-4/98  being predicted by most observers and indeed in the staff projection we looked at a little  earlier If developments in Asia slow the US economy just enough but not too much,  that would be a very nice outcome But if that assessment is wrong, the risks could  certainly be skewed in either direction If the Asian impact is meaningfully stronger than  projected through metastasizing to other countries or for whatever other reason, then it  obviously could cause a downside jolt that the Fed might need to respond to  Alternatively, if the impact turns out to be meaningfully weaker and the crisis  either is or for some time appears to be contained and its effects rather modest, that then  opens the door to the high probability of a strong run by an already buoyant American  economy In that case, our longstanding upside concerns may very well be realized and  we might have to respond So, which way will it go? Will it be about right, stronger, or  weaker? I think we're going to have to wait and see, and meanwhile, once again, steady  as she goes   I also prefer alternative I, and I would like to associate myself  with Governor Meyer's remarks We have to formulate these ranges against the realities  of our forecast for the real economy I am not attracted to alternative II, but I feel a lot of  attraction to alternative III because of the consistency of its ranges in terms of their  interpretation and their consistency with price level stability But I agree with Governor  Meyer that this probably is an unwise time to move to that alternative So, I would prefer  to stay with alternative I and look for an opportunity to go to alternative III, or whatever  the alternative III numbers might be when we are prepared to make that move   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5927,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman We are reaching the time of the day when  all has been said Between the briefings and the excellent comments that we have heard around  the table this morning, I think we have a good understanding of where the economy is and what  the issues are, and I'm not going to repeat all of that Let me just add that I see very little, if any,  evidence that this expansion is slowing now or likely to slow very much It seems to have a  tremendous amount of momentum Consumer confidence is sky high Employment conditions  are superb Personal income and the wealth effect are very strong The cost and availability of  credit are attractive Inflation fears seem to be diminishing It seems likely to me that it would  take a very substantial shock to slow this economic expansion down very much, let alone bring  to an end this era of very strong and attractive economic growth  We have focused on two potential shocks to the economy that are an important key to  the outlook--Asia and the stock market In the case of Asia, I have no doubt that we will get a    3/31/98  We have focused on two potential shocks to the economy that are an important key to  the outlook--Asia and the stock market In the case of Asia, I have no doubt that we will get a  trade shock As Vice Chairman McDonough just said, it now appears that we will avoid the  worst of the impacts that we saw as possibilities just a few months ago I had been thinking until  quite recently that our forecasts that the Asian impact was going to be ""just right"" were probably  reasonably accurate, but I am beginning to lean to the view that the Asian impact may turn out to  be somewhat less than ""just right"" 1 appreciated Bill Poole's comments to that effect a little  earlier, if I understood him correctly  In the case of the stock market, I have no doubt that sentiment is going to change  some day I remember that after a brilliant period for investors in the 1960s, we experienced  what amounted to a 14-year bear market starting in 1968 and lasting until 1982 I am not  predicting that outcome, but some day the euphoria we are witnessing now will change The  change may occur today, next month, next year--who knows However, left to its own devices,  there is a great deal of momentum in the stock market also Serious weakness that could have a  material impact on macroeconomic performance could be a long time off  In short, I agree with others who have said over the course of the morning that the  risks now clearly appear to be to the upside In my view a move to tighten is becoming  increasingly advisable, although I do not think the case for such a move is compelling today I  would agree with the comments of President Minehan a little earlier that our job now may be to  consider carefully the timing of a policy move that we increasingly are seeing as necessary  Thank you   Mr Chairman, I strongly support your recommendation  Relative to the discussion about a possible announcement, I would have a very strong  preference for not making one today That preference is based on a longer-term reason and an  immediate reason The longer-term reason would be the one that has been expressed around the  table, namely, that this would have a precedential impact and one that we should consider  carefully, not just rush into I will say parenthetically--we are not going to debate that issue  today--that I have very great reservations about the whole idea  More immediately, I believe that if we were to make a new type of announcement  today that the market has not seen before and does not expect, it would come as quite a shock  and be very confusing Why are they doing this? Why did they make this announcement and  not change policy? I can see the potential for a reaction of fairly major proportions that would  not be at all what we are setting out to do So, I would be very hesitant about that    3/31/98 "
5953,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman This Committee is always confronted  with complexities and conundrums Over time they tend to be largely matters of degree and  perhaps relative significance at a given point in time, but today it seems hard in many cases to  know how to get the sign right A few key examples, starting with Asia At the time of the  Humphrey-Hawkins meeting in February, most of us felt that the impact of Asia was going to be  just about right in that it would give us just enough slowing I think that is pretty much the view  that the staff and the Greenbook still carry However, in just 90 days we have been through two  clearly identifiable cycles of how we have felt about the Asian impact on the US economy It  looked as if it was going to be more benign around the time that we met last, and now, as President  McDonough and others have observed, things look very ominous again  In the case of the interaction between productivity and compensation, which is  obviously a key determinant of costs and hence prices, it is hard to read either productivity or  compensation trends right now We have new calculations on productivity, which I enthusiastically  welcome, that suggest far more improvement than we thought earlier On the other hand, in the  area of compensation we have had an ECI in recent quarters that has been remarkably benign,  particularly the latest reading which actually was down To what extent are we entitled to rely on  that kind of information and for how long? If both of these factors behave at all positively, and I  think there is a significant chance that they might do that other things being equal, this virtuous  cycle that we have been experiencing could go on for a very long time  In the case of inflation, the CPI shows very clear signs of moving up on an adjusted  basis One way to look at those adjustments is to say that some time back we were at price level  stability and didn't know it; now we are in the process of losing it But as President McTeer and  others observed, there are virtually no other price series that confirm this deterioration    5/19/98  What about inventories? We have had an amazingly strong accumulation of  inventories recently, and yet the aggregate levels do not look excessive I'm sure there will be a  drag of some sort from inventories, but how much and when is it going to happen?  We just cannot know yet how all this is going to develop and net out I feel that we  will have to tighten policy, but I do not believe that we should tighten policy now I lack the  confidence to sit tight because I think there is too much uncertainty to say that we are sitting tight,  but I do suggest that we should sit still [Laughter]   I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
5979,1998-06-30," Second   Mike, on Chart 10 you have a fairly dramatic decline in the growth  rate of real personal consumption I understand that part of that comes from the peaking of the  wealth-to-income ratio--the stock market weakness What other factors create that downdraft?   Thank you, Mr Chairman A strong thread has been running through  the discussion all afternoon relating to the stark difference between the domestic and the foreign    6/30-7/1/98  outlook It is leaving us with an unusual and bifurcated decision mix that I find rather  uncomfortable If we think about the United States economy domestically and in isolation from  foreign impacts, we see a very, very strong economy It is coming off a very robust first quarter  Job formation continues strong, unemployment is very low, business and consumer sentiment is  sky high, credit is readily available on reasonable terms, the federal budget is balanced, the stock  market is strong, and so forth It is true, of course, that first-quarter growth was heavily  influenced by inventories and that part of the economy is probably in the process of rebalancing  But I think of inventories as having a rather transitory influence that is going to hit the economy  in one direction or the other from time to time, and we have to look past that Looking forward,  it is very hard for me to see the domestic economy slowing spontaneously to or below any  reasonable definition of sustainability for any extended period of time That scenario clearly has  the potential of being inflationary at some point My fear is that we may be close to that point  An incipient inflationary trend may now be starting to become visible, and I think that trend  should be countered  However, internationally, as we know and as we have been discussing, we perceive a  totally different view of the world Asia is the centerpiece, especially Japan We have been  discussing that at length and I will not replay the discussion The problem is not only Asia  Western European economies look very good right now, but they have a major challenge on their  hands in making EMU work Of course, they have clawing  on their doorstep Much of Latin America is fragile as usual, and it seems to me that they are at  a watershed where they could very possibly institutionalize a major, strong, and lasting  breakthrough, which would be wonderful, or they could fall back into stagnation for another  decade    6/30-7/1/98  It seems to me that for the United States to embark on a round of policy tightening  right now could be very destabilizing from an international standpoint How do we position  policy in view of this bifurcation? The Federal Reserve creates policy obviously in the national  interest of the United States But the state of the world around us is certainly part of that national  interest for obvious reasons In my judgment, the precarious state of the world economy seems  to preclude tightening by the Committee at this time, or maybe I should just say at this meeting  The international impact may yet prove to be just the right thing to offset the rising pressures in  our domestic economy, and we may indeed get the Greenbook's soft landing scenario I hope so  But I have to say that I do increasingly fear that at the end of the day we may have to pay a high  price for delay   Mr Chairman, I also would not make a change now in the ranges for  either of the two time periods In the case of the second half of 1998, I agree with President  Minehan that the Humphrey-Hawkins Act primarily focuses on what the Committee plans for the  aggregates That implies that we are setting ourselves a benchmark To change the ranges in the  middle of the year would be to destroy the value of that benchmark and fuzz up the reasons why  it was adopted In the case of making a change for the year ahead six months in advance, a  reason for doing that might be that the Committee wanted to signal a major change that was  ahead And we may--I emphasize may--have a candidate for such a change here if we want to  send a signal that the aggregates are now much more on the front burner than they have been  But I would say that if such a signal is desired, it might be better approached by developing some  kind of information release and having the Committee debate it and perhaps adopt it, rather than  simply changing the ranges at this meeting I think a change at this point could prove to be  counterproductive    6/30-7/1/98   Mr Chairman, I am in sympathy with virtually everything every  speaker has said, and I support your recommendation   Mr Chairman, I strongly agree with President Boehne, and between  what you and he just said, you have preempted the substance of the statement that I wanted to  make But if you will indulge me, I would like to go ahead and try to expand on what Ed  Boehne said  I did sit on that earlier subcommittee, as Don mentioned, and I strongly supported the  changes that we adopted in early 1995 But I would have a very strong concern about making  further changes such as those that are discussed in the Lindsey paper There is a presumption, of  course, that information released about the activities of a public body is basically a good thing,  and I would concur with that view if the information meets two criteria The first is that it will  be useful and helpful to society, and in this case I think we are talking about the market and its  participants and balancing in a positive way the beneficial and potentially harmful effects that  may exist from that perspective The second criterion would be that there be no negative impacts  on our critical policymaking processes, as Ed Boehne suggested, or that policy's intended result  is not outweighed by the benefits of an earlier release In my view, the notion here to release    6/30-7/1/98  immediately fails on both of those criteria Let me comment on both of them Before I do, I  would like to make a few points  My first point is debatable, but I believe that if we start making regular  announcements, we will very soon find ourselves locked into doing it all the time whether we  like it or not Be that as it may, I would like to call your attention to the statistics in Table 1 on  page 12 of Dave Lindsey's paper That table records 152 decisions They include 69 decisions  to change policy and 83 decisions not to change The table also shows the tilts that existed at the  time those decisions were made I am considering symmetry to be a tilt in this analysis Eighty  of those decisions were accurately foretold by the existing tilt at the time that they were made  That is 526 percent of the total Seventy-two were inaccurately foretold by the existing tilt, or  474 percent That is not a very impressive guideline to future decisions I think that is good  news and bad news The good news is that it clearly shows that the FOMC is always looking at  incoming data with an open mind and is not being trapped by any previous sentiment The bad  news is that while immediate release would obviously reveal what the FOMC members were  thinking as a group at the time of a meeting, the tilt is very close to being perfectly worthless as a  predictor of what the FOMC will in fact do Fifty-fifty would be perfectly worthless in this  analysis  As for the two criteria, the first has to do with the net impact on society and how it  appears to the market What would be the possible objectives of the earlier release? The first  might be a better understanding of the Federal Reserve on average over time, as Don Kohn says  on page 4 of his memo To be sure, achieving that objective is highly desirable, but I don't  think it necessarily has anything to do with early release of the directive In fact, as I hope to  show momentarily, early release actually would be counterproductive to that objective With    6/30-7/1/98  respect to the market's functioning, remembering this 526 to 474 inaccuracy split, the market  professionals who watch the Fed closely will immediately know those facts They will learn  nothing that they do not already know, and they are going to continue to do their own analysis  and act accordingly In the case of the general public, I believe that they would very soon  become quite disillusioned with the lack of follow-through that they would perceive, because  they are just going to look at our actions; they are not going to study the reasoning and the  carefully crafted language in our releases I personally have no doubt whatsoever that those  unfulfilled tilts would harm the credibility of this Committee to the public Would it damp  volatility? I don't think so because in the short term, the tilt has no forecasting power The  speculators would respond with a ""ho hum"" and perhaps feed the information marginally into  their assessments Their odds on the direction of the next policy change might shift a little, but  the volatility in the market would continue as speculation continued  I would have a concern that immediate releases would leave us wide open to political  demagoguery by persons known to all of us Take this 474 percent of the time when the  operative tilt is not followed I can hear it right now, ""the Fed is misleading the public,"" ""the Fed  is manipulating the market,"" ""the Fed is indecisive,"" ""the Fed has no integrity,"" and so forth  When we announce a tilt toward tightening, we will get an incessant drumbeat until that gets  settled one way or the other If we eventually do not act, then those who engage in demagogic  rhetoric will say that they forced us to back down If we do act to tighten, we will get the same  rhetoric we get now If we announce a tilt to ease, the demagogic rhetoric is going to ask us why  we are hesitating, why we are dithering; the easing clearly is desirable; it clearly is needed; you  are already late Then, if we do ease, they will claim to have forced us to ease, but that we  should have eased by 50 basis points, not 25, and we were too late anyway    6/30-7/1/98  That brings me to criterion number two To release information is good unless it  affects the policymaking process and its results in a seriously perverse manner, and I think it  would do that in three ways Two of them have already been mentioned The first is that this  Committee would in my view lose credibility with the general public, and that would weaken our  ability to conduct an effective monetary policy Secondly, I think the political demagoguery  would be dangerous in the sense that it would be very hard for us to ignore The worst but not  unlikely result would be that at some point we might feel obliged to assert our independence and  act in a way that would be harsh and perhaps premature  Thirdly, as Ed Boehne said a minute ago, I think that our symmetric/asymmetric  convention has been very useful It depressurizes uncertainty It legitimizes uncertainty and it  legitimizes delay when delay is appropriate It helps build a consensus I think that regular  announcements would ultimately cause us to lose the use of that very useful convention If the  FOMC wants to change policy, then it does so and if it wants to decide on ""no change plus a  tilt,"" then that should be the result But if we were immediately to announce the tilt without a  policy move, it is very likely in my view that the announcement would move the market at least  some of the time, possibly the equivalent of about one-half a policy move or maybe more, but  sometimes the market would not react at all We would never know As we sat here and voted,  knowing that the tilt was going to be released, we would not be able to anticipate with any  degree of certainty what the effect would be on the market That would create the likelihood of  an unintended and unpredictable policy change I believe that after that happened a couple of  times, we would feel burned and we would very soon cease to use the symmetric/asymmetric  convention I think that would be a very important loss in a couple of ways It would frequently  force the Committee into timing decisions on a basis that it would not otherwise choose and that    6/30-7/1/98  might be unwise Secondly, again as Ed Boehne said, I think it would remove a very useful and  legitimate consensus-building tool  I do not think it is any accident that there is no other central bank of significance  anywhere that uses such an immediate release In my opinion, we should not do it either I think  we have it right at this point Let us not try to fix it "
6004,1998-08-18," That inventory will be up! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman The morning has moved well along and I  am the last in the queue, I believe, so I will be very brief At the last meeting, the Committee was  wrestling with the very uncomfortable dilemma of having two sets of concerns that pulled in very  different directions We have been wrestling with the same concerns all morning The question  for today seems to be what has changed over the last few weeks The answer perhaps is that not    8/18/98  much has changed fundamentally and definitively, but I think there are some potentially very  significant straws in the wind Thanks to inventories and Asia, the expansion slowed dramatically  as expected in the second quarter, confronting us now with the question of whether or not this  moderation will settle in as a new regime as suggested by the Greenbook I thought the case that  was made there was quite impressive But if the stock markets still have the stamina for one or  more bull runs left in them, confidence could be reinforced and we could again easily find  ourselves in an excessive growth mode for much, perhaps all, of the forecast period That  obviously could present significant difficulties in the long run My assessment is that domestic  risk remains on the upside but perhaps not so heavily as earlier The next several months should  tell that tale  Internationally, one is hard pressed to identify any news of improvement To the  contrary, deflationary pressure seems to be increasing Japan appears to be fumbling the ball,  which may further endanger the entire region Long-held fears of contagion with some boost from  weak oil prices have become reality and have impacted Russia and parts of Latin America The  downside risk seems to have intensified outside our borders, calling even more strongly for  caution  We still have the bifurcated mix of factors that existed on July 1 My sense, however,  is that for the moment at least, the upside domestic concerns may be a bit milder while the  downside international concerns may be cause for even more caution While both of these straws  in the wind now blow in the same direction and suggest a softening expansion as a rising  probability, I do not think that this warrants a change in our policy stance at this time But we are  moving toward more balanced risks   Mr Chairman, I can certainly accept your ""no change""  recommendation As far as the symmetries go, I can accept symmetry without great angst because  I think there clearly is a strong case for it But I would prefer to stay with asymmetry because the  basic structure of the risks that we have been living with for some time is still intact in my view  There is a case for reorienting our directive a little by moving toward symmetry, but for me  economic conditions have not yet changed enough to change the policy stance To repeat, I can  certainly accept symmetry "
6026,1998-09-21," Mr Chairman, I will simply say that I concur with the thrust of the  comments that have been made and support your going ahead with this But I would also like to  say that on the basis of purely domestic considerations I have some of the same slightly hesitant    13  thoughts that Al Broaddus and Gary Stern mentioned   I concur with that, Mr Chairman I think this probably is more a matter  of timing than anything else But I am very comfortable with your proposal "
6045,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, when we discussed this issue earlier, I spoke at some  length against the idea of early release and I still feel the same I would like to restate my views  briefly, if I may, even though most of my concerns already have been expressed First of all,  please recall that the Lindsey paper that supported our earlier discussion showed that over the  past 12 years, the tilt in place at the time of each FOMC decision was in the same direction as the  decision itself only 527 percent of the time In the other 473 percent of the time, the decision  differed from the existing tilt Thus, the tilt has been nearly perfectly worthless as a predictor of  policy decisions [Laughter]  In my view, this and other problems give us three reasons not to change our  announcement practices, and they provide me with a notion of what the results would be if we  did First, this record shows that an early release over the past decade would frequently have  misled the general public, which is only concerned with deeds and not the fine nuances of  economic reasoning As a consequence, I am convinced that with early release we would  experience a severe loss of credibility that is the lifeblood of our policy's effectiveness Second,  early release of an asymmetry would often be the equivalent of a policy move that the  Committee had just decided not to take, and the Committee could never know as it voted what  forces it might inadvertently be setting in motion an hour or so later when the announcement was  made Third, if an asymmetry were in place at a meeting where the issues were close, the very  existence of a publicly known 6- to 8-week old position could influence the adoption of a less  than optimal new policy    9/29/98  As a consequence of all this, I am confident that, after being burned a couple of times,  the Committee would simply cease to employ this very useful convention That would be a  shame because the tilt legitimizes the uncertainty that is frequently present and the delay that is  frequently appropriate, and it also aids materially in building a consensus In sum, I can see no  helpful elements to an early release regimen and many serious negative consequences  On the rewording of the directive, truth to tell I like the existing language and I would  be a little sad to see it go Everyone who is interested and needs to know understands it perfectly  well, and more importantly it constitutes a bit of quaint Americana that we should cherish  [Laughter] That said, I would support a change if that is the Committee's wish, and either of the  two wording options and the suggested amendments are perfectly acceptable to me Option 1 is  fine, but I think there is much to be said for Option 2 because of its greater continuity with the  present practice Thank you   Americana   Mr Chairman, events are moving quite rapidly It was only last July  that the Committee began to get concerned about the emerging bifurcation being introduced by  an ongoing very strong domestic economy interacting with a deteriorating international situation  In less than 90 days, policy risks have shifted dramatically to the downside If the Committee  should respond to this situation this morning by easing policy, I will support that decision but not  without considerable hesitation and misgivings While growth in overall economic activity  clearly has been slowing recently, our domestic economy remains remarkably robust Though  decelerating from earlier this year, final sales remain strong; labor compensation is rising; new  jobs continue to be created; consumer sentiment remains high; long-term credit is available at  rates not seen in decades to support housing and motor vehicle sales; and the stock market has  slipped but it has not collapsed If this beat goes on for long, the slippage in capital spending  could soon reverse and an up-cycle in inventory spending could once again emerge  It may well be that we will experience no more than the moderate slowing of the  expansion that we have long expected and for which we fervently have hoped The odds have  become lower that this is all the weakness that will occur yet it is highly questionable in my view  that slower economic growth alone would call for an immediate reduction in interest rates Of  course, far more is involved as this situation plays out against a background of ailing world  economies, fragile financial markets that could turn very ugly very quickly, and a continued  quiescent inflation rate in the United States I am concerned that we are now at risk of falling  behind the curve It would seem on balance that we have an opportunity here to take out a  modest and relatively inexpensive--in terms of risk--insurance policy, and I believe we should do  so Consideration of actions stronger than that should await the unfolding of future events  Thank you    9/29/98   Aha! [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I support your 25 basis point move, and I prefer  symmetry for two reasons First, that is what the facts of the situation call for in my judgment  Secondly, lowering the fed funds rate could well ""spook"" this market if such a move is combined  with an asymmetric directive The market might see the Committee as badly frightened rather  than responsibly concerned This could induce the very sequence of adverse events that policy is  intended to discourage in the first place Should evolving conditions so warrant, we can just as  well move policy further from a symmetric directive "
6069,1998-10-15," Mr Chairman, this is Mike Kelley I agree with a great deal but perhaps  not everything that Alice Rivlin just said Her analysis of the situation and that of others who  have spoken all seem to go in the same direction That is, as each day passes the economy is  slowing a little more It certainly seems more and more likely that our policy is on an easing path  and that we have further to go But I have a concern in that we eased just 16 days ago and that  was the first move we made in a very long time To move again so soon would very clearly not  be a business-as-usual thing to do If we do it, I think we are going to have to very careful about  the message that we send We have discussed the economy, so I will not go over that again We  have three vectors here, two of which look pretty much the same as they did two weeks ago The  latter are the real economy in the United States and the real economy around the world Some  weakening clearly is occurring The delta, to the extent that there has been one in the last two  weeks, is clearly downward The dynamics are in the credit and capital markets As Alice Rivlin    10/15/98  and others have suggested, if those markets should implode--maybe that is too dramatic a word,  but if they should deteriorate badly--they could very easily and promptly take the real economy  with them, and we could find ourselves very quickly behind the curve  If the Committee judges that a substantial deterioration of that kind is a strong or  imminent possibility, then I think we should act, and I would certainly support that action even  though it obviously is not business-as-usual But if this situation does not reach that level of  urgency, then I think we should be very careful about our timing I would be concerned that if it  is not a situation of substantial deterioration or perhaps does not appear to be, then a move right  now would run the risk of making it seem as if the Fed believes that it got it wrong the first time  and we feel the need to act very quickly to correct our error If that were the perception, I  think the market could rightly conclude that the situation as seen by the Fed must be far worse  than we thought it was in late September and that there is some kind of policy panic or disarray at  the Fed  I see two major problems if that should be what is perceived Number one, I do not  believe we got it wrong the first time, and I think it would be very destructive and quite  unnecessary to convey that impression today Secondly, I would be concerned that such a  perception could induce the very type of financial market panic that we are seeking to prevent in  the first place If we do make a judgment that the credit and financial markets are such that the  situation is dangerous and action is required, I will support that judgment Under those  circumstances, if that is where we are, I think we probably should consider moving more strongly  than our usual 25 basis points in the federal funds rate I also think we should give very careful  consideration to what we say in our press release We should basically acknowledge the risks that    10/15/98  we see for the economy and make sure that those risks are what the market sees us acting upon  and not those that I mentioned a minute ago Thank you   Mr Chairman, this is Mike Kelley After the discussion that we have  had here this afternoon, I concur with the recommendation of a 25 basis point reduction in the  funds rate today I also think that we should lower the discount rate and that the Board members  should discuss a little further whether the reduction should be 25 or 50 basis points "
6094,1998-11-17," The problem that I have with a longer time frame is that we review  the tilt sentence routinely at every meeting We may not come to the same conclusion from  meeting to meeting, though we tend to do so more often than not In any event, the tilt adopted  at a given meeting is operative only in the intermeeting period because we always review it at the  next meeting   Mr Chairman, I am on record as in favor of taking out the sentence  that has been under discussion, and that is still my preference I do agree that the sentence is  redundant, but I also think that it would be confusing to the public Its subtleties are rather deep  I have no problem with the sense that the sentence is attempting to convey I certainly agree  with the Vice Chairman that this Committee, under your leadership, does not have a problem in  this area at all But I find the sentence confusing, and for that reason I don't think it serves us  well I also would like to repeat that I support the notion of changing the timing reference in the  previous sentence from ""in coming months"" to ""in the intermeeting period"" as suggested by  President Broaddus   Mr Chairman, I have no doubt that Peter has a real problem that  needs to be worked on, and I wish I had an answer for him However, I very much identify with  Presidents Jordan and Poole in that I would prefer to stay out of this market It seems to me,  Peter, that given the very small size of these issues, if you buy indexed bonds in the same  proportion that you buy regular bonds, you would be buying so few that you probably would not  alleviate the problem in this market   I guess it's a new notion to me that we would be promoting the  market by buying some of these bonds and retiring them from circulation   Thank you, Mr Chairman I will bat cleanup here The fundamental  worldview of hawks and doves is always evolving, but I do think that both of those birds are  alive and well To oversimplify, a hawk's view of policy today might well be that, with the US  economy strong and the world's financial structure shaky, our policy should be to insure that our  financial system remains a rock-solid anchor to windward That is the best thing that we can do  to help both the world and ourselves, hence a bias toward firmness A dove's focus might be on  the US economy as the engine whose forward drive is essential to the world's stability and    11/17/98  recovery, and US policy should insure that that engine stays in high gear, hence a bias toward  ease  I find much that is appealing in both of these arguments and I don't want to have to  choose one path over the other Fortunately, if we stay focused on the same mission that we  have pursued for so long--namely, seeking maximum sustainable growth fostered by price level  stability--I think we can reasonably seek both of those objectives, and the best policy, as before,  still lies there  How do we identify that policy path? As always, that comes from assessing the risks  and trying to determine how strong they are and where the balance lies I believe the balance of  risks has migrated to the downside, particularly as it relates to the likely timing of potential  shocks To be sure, upside risks remain and could readily resume their dominance of only just a  few months ago First of all, of course, our primary concern for many quarters now is still with  us Economic activity is still very strong, labor markets are still very tight, and that means that  inflation is still a major potential threat But I believe that that scenario is of diminished  probability for all of the reasons with which we are familiar The good news timing-wise is that  if we should see that scenario evolving, its latent risks should materialize slowly enough for us to  have time to counter them if need be  I worry more today about the potential for very serious mischief that could arise in the  stock market if it should boom to new highs That could put us in severe jeopardy of a crash that  could bring down a great deal more of the world and, indeed, our own economy with it My  hope is that, as a slowing economy results in declining corporate earnings, this market will  self-correct in an orderly way However, a real crash has too high a probability to give me much  comfort, and easier policy may heighten the chances of a plunge in the market    11/17/98  The downside risks seem to be growing and, perhaps of even more importance, could  burgeon much more quickly, perhaps severely and without much warning The international  risks, we know, certainly have those characteristics There could well be others yet to unfold in  this dynamic environment That the US economy is slowing seems to be a growing probability  While that may be desirable within limits, once a downward trend gains momentum, it is hard to  know how far and fast it may go and what it might take to arrest a decline if that becomes  necessary In today's world, I think that is a more than usually important factor  I do think we should keep a wary eye on deflation There are some signs that its  impetus may be slowing, but in the context of an increasingly sluggish US economy, if that is  what should ensue, it could become a real danger  To sum up, Mr Chairman, I do not believe that we are behind the curve, but I do  believe that the ground is shifting Perhaps we need to shift a bit more with it I see little reason  to wait as any upside risk would likely emerge rather slowly over time, whereas the existing  downside risks could appear suddenly and soon The respective time frames are quite  asymmetric My mother used to say ""a stitch in time saves nine"" We have taken two so far, and  three might do it   Mr Chairman, I unequivocally support your recommendation, but I  must say that I have a lot of sympathy with the views of those who would prefer to maintain a  steady policy "
6117,1998-12-22," Mr Chairman, the Greenbook and most forecasts foresee a slowing in  the US economy I share that view because, after all, as we've heard this morning, the  manufacturing sector is slowing and related to that net exports continue to deteriorate, although  we hope the rate of change will decelerate Consumer savings have gone all the way into  negative territory, and for that and other reasons consumption seems sure to slow Investment  has been on a tear for a long time That seems bound at least to moderate to a more normal pace  Profits are already slowing, which implies risks to the stock market and an attendant wealth  effect And so forth  However, what do we see going on around us? The fourth quarter of 1998 appears to  be substantially stronger than we had earlier believed, giving the economy a lot of momentum  going into 1999 Interest rates have been coming down since our last meeting The effects on  the real economy of our earlier rate reductions are only beginning to kick in The dollar is a little  weaker, which will be stimulative if it continues, as it is forecasted to do New job creation    12/22/98 44  continues to be strong Unemployment is actually going lower it would appear Consumer  sentiment remains high Retail sales are strong, particularly in the cyclically sensitive areas like  housing and autos With an important possible exception of Brazil, which many have  mentioned, foreign financial pressures on the real economies in many areas seem to be easing at  least for now To date, there has been no great change evident in the pattern of inflation  All in all, Mr Chairman, at this moment I am not at all clear in which direction the  next policy move should be, let alone when it should occur   I agree with your recommendation   Mr Chairman, I think I would prefer option 3, although I don't feel  strongly about most of the differences I would delete the sentence Ed Boehne talked about on  potential changes in the funds rate because I view it as more confusing than helpful I do feel  rather strongly about taking out the ""in coming months"" phrase, which appears in both versions,  options 2 and 3 I think it is irrelevant because we always review our stance of policy at every  meeting ""In coming months"" has no meaning and could easily be harmful in the sense that it  might appear to commit us to a direction for policy over whatever period some people might  interpret as ""in coming months"" And our views on that could change quite radically  On the final sentence on the monetary aggregates, I have no strong feeling I don't  think it is doing any harm and the day may well come, perhaps soon, when we would be glad to  have it in there So, I would leave it alone   Mr Chairman, I will go along with this suggestion out of respect for  the majority view that I know exists and also your effort to try to resolve the issue But I do so    12/22/98 84  with considerable trepidation For one thing, I think it is going to put you particularly as well as  the rest of the Committee in the position of having to make some very difficult judgments as to  when we should make a statement and when we should not More often than not, that is  probably going to be a very close call The second observation I would make is that once we  start this, no statement immediately becomes a statement Let us not kid ourselves about making  a statement occasionally We are going to be making a statement at every meeting, even those  where we make no actual statement   I believe that the market will come to see our lack of a statement as  indicating that there was essentially nothing going on at the meeting and that everything is just  rolling along at wherever it was perceived to be before And I think that is a statement It will  be an implied statement  I also have considerable skepticism about whether we would have the ability to go  back to the current status quo should that turn out to be desired I think President Parry hit it on  the nose when he said it was a step in the right direction It is a step! [Laughter] It will clearly  be difficult to go backwards should we subsequently, for whatever reason, desire to do so But I  will go along for the reasons stated "
6140,1999-02-02," After long and careful consideration, I nominate Alan   Greenspan    That’s confidential!    Thank you Mr Chairman, I would not have thought it possible,   but somehow the Committee’s policy dilemma continues to deepen rather than to show   signs of beginning to resolve itself The economy continues to surge ahead We all, or at   least most of us, believe that it should and will slow But we have had good reason to   believe that for some time and yet the pace, if anything, has accelerated and there are few   signs of slowing so far If the pace of growth begins to slow as we expect, we likely will   have to address the possible need for further easing at some point If, however, the   present pace or something close to it should continue, we soon will almost surely need to   consider at what point policy will have to lean into that strength in the interest of   sustainability I say this realizing fully the difficulty that such a policy move could   present internationally But even if one adopted the most optimistic reasonable scenario   of the strength and durability of the current virtuous cycle--and I am pretty much in that   camp--it is still necessary to realize that it has limits beyond which unsatisfactory   conditions begin to gain momentum At the pace the economy has been growing, we are   very likely getting close to those limits   In the Humphrey-Hawkins forecast made at this time last year for 1998, we were   well off the mark Everything turned out to be much better than we expected Growth   was stronger, unemployment lower, yet inflation quiescent The outcome was literally   wonderful Can we reasonably expect a repeat? I doubt it At the moment, working with   the available data, the risks appear to be decidedly on the upside But I can envision the   possibility, perhaps the likelihood, that this could be reversed very quickly for any of a   combination of reasons arising from the domestic or international, real or financial   economy   I continue to be uncertain as to which direction our next move may be or when we   should take it But my sense is that the upside risks will have to begin to dissipate soon   or they are going to need to be addressed     2/2-3/99 73    Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation But I   also would like to associate myself with the many concerns and reservations that have   been expressed by a number of members of the Committee   Let me add just one additional brief caution We frequently speculate about   whether or not this Committee should or should not be preemptive If we believe, and I   think we all do, that policy affects the economy with long and variable lags, then we   should keep in mind that we are always, every day, unavoidably being preemptive Even   taking no action at a meeting is preemptive, in the sense that any decision is going to   impact the economy a year or two years out, or however long those lags may turn out to   be I think it is useful to keep in mind that we are always being preemptive  "
6168,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman The basic condition of the   economy in this country is well known by everybody here It has been very well   articulated this morning and I will not try to recite again all the factors involved At our   last meeting I felt that the risks faced by policymakers were balanced but that if the   upside risks brought on by overly strong growth did not begin to moderate soon, they   would need to be addressed That moderation has not become evident as yet and the case   can be made that the time may have come to take a first step   I find myself pulled toward an asymmetric directive But two factors give me   pause First, an asymmetric directive, if immediately announced under our new policy,   would quite likely cause a spontaneous increase in market rates, especially since it would   come as a surprise to many Such a response might well turn out to be premature but,   more importantly, would be undesirable because of my second reason That second   reason is that we seem to be moving ever closer to what could become a very nasty war   in the Balkans Indeed, it has begun We all pray for an early peaceful solution, but we   cannot know what will happen At a moment such as this, if the Committee considered it   necessary to raise rates for whatever reason, it should and would do so If, however, the   Committee were merely inclined to get a preemptive jump on a likely threat, I question   whether it would be wise to do so at a time like this, rather than await further   developments in a potentially dangerous situation Like the military itself when it is   heading toward a fight, it probably would be a good idea to keep our powder dry    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6190,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting, and indeed for   some time before that, it seemed that the risks to the outlook were balanced, with a slow,   steady drift to the upside That continues with little sign of a significant moderating trend   setting in Like others, I have been expecting such a shift for a long time, but I would   like to be more confident than I am now that it will emerge spontaneously   Industrial production has resumed vigorous growth We’ve continued to   generate a quarter of a million jobs per month, which is wonderful of course Inventories   are low, and major cyclical swing factors like housing, autos, and capital spending, which   should have eased before now, simply have not done so Of course, I should note that we   have some contrary news on housing this morning The stock market continues to create   wealth Inflation remains remarkably quiescent, but here again I would like to be more   confident that this will continue The April CPI was a jolt of yet to be determined   significance But beyond that commodity prices may have begun to turn and, of course,   energy prices already have turned up Foreign growth should improve and will have an   impact on commodities and other import areas And unemployment in the United States,   driven by demand pressures, appears to be headed to 4 percent or lower The magnificent     5/18/99 45   productivity gains of recent quarters, even if they are largely continued, cannot be   depended upon to hold these forces at bay indefinitely   At the last meeting two factors seemed to inhibit the Committee from   considering any action and both of those have dissipated Six weeks ago any change by   the Fed would have been a great shock to the market, but not today The Balkans was an   important unknown then but, for better or worse, it now appears to be headed for a stand-  down To be sure, there are still downside risks and we have no clear and present   inflation danger And we could bask in this virtuous cycle for some time yet The   question before us, of course, as it has been, is how best to help prolong this excellent   economic era for as long as possible The emergence of an inflationary surge with some   gain in momentum would surely mark the beginning of the end of that No actual move   would appear to me to be required today, but it may well be time to assess how best to   start leaning into the wind Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I certainly concur with your   recommendation I am a little concerned, however, about the interpretation of the tilt In   my view the Committee should not feel that it locks us in to an early move Everyone no   doubt recalls that last summer our directive was asymmetric toward tightening for three   meetings from late March until mid-August and we never did tighten Subsequently, of   course, we eased in the fall Something unforeseen could happen again We should be   open to that possibility and remain flexible   One further thought, Mr Chairman I would hope that in our public statement   we will de-emphasize the April CPI number and stress the underlying trends that I think   are really motivating us  "
6213,1999-06-29," Go for it, Bill!    Thank you, Mr Chairman When the Committee made the third   of its three cuts last fall, which was the final one that brought the federal funds rate to the   level we have today, it was a close, difficult call After a good deal of soul-searching,   that action was taken largely--and please excuse the use of this old war horse once again   --as an inexpensive insurance policy, which could easily be reversed if the economy   appeared to be too strong Very soon thereafter what had at that time appeared on   balance to be financially driven downside risks began to migrate For a while, the risks   appeared to be balanced, but more recently they seem to have moved ever more clearly to   the upside   Two groups of factors seem to me to be driving this change For one, the world   economy generally appears to have survived last fall’s financial crisis and to be   beginning to turn upward This is a healthy and welcomed development, of course, but it   does cause problems for US monetary policy because several things that have helped   our policy mix may well be changing Our exports could increase, adding to already very   robust economic activity World commodity prices could firm; indeed, oil already has   done so The dollar’s foreign exchange value could begin to weaken, adding further to   exports and raising import prices in the United States All of this is potentially   inflationary     6/29-30/99 55   Then there’s our remarkably strong economy, which should slow on its own but   so far has refused to do so Consumer confidence is still sky high Real wages are rising   Wealth continues to grow Despite the recent hesitancy, the Dow Jones industrial   average is up over 14 percent so far this year, and that’s not too shabby Consumption   continues to increase at a rapid pace, led by the big-ticket cyclicals like autos and homes   Inventories are low and are likely to be a short-term source of further strength   Clearly, labor markets continue to tighten as the economy strains to keep up the   beat So far, strong productivity growth has made it possible to do so without visible   inflationary pressures But it seems to me that it would be a dangerous assumption to be   confident that this could go on indefinitely Things have been and indeed remain   wonderful But there are limits out there somewhere beyond which could lie serious   trouble   Policy must, of course, focus one or more years out, not on today And within the   context of that time frame, I think we’re quite possibly in the danger zone now and   should begin to respond    I concur, Mr Chairman    Very interesting    Thank you, Mr Chairman First of all, let me thank you for   those extremely provocative remarks I look forward to working on digesting them as   soon as the transcript is available to us But on a much more prosaic level, let me say   initially that I strongly support your recommendation I think there are two sets of   reasons to be cautious about moving too aggressively right now The first revolves   around the uncertainties of today’s economic situation, and in that regard I would make a   couple of points This economy could slow spontaneously In fact, it is doing so in the   second quarter relative to the first quarter If we look at consumption and include   housing as a consumption item, that represents over 70 percent of GDP If we throw in   capital expenditures, it’s well over 80 percent  I can think of a number of reasons why a   great many of those components could very easily grow more slowly Even if they     6/29-30/99 92   remain at a high level, their rates of growth could be substantially lower Just because   they haven’t done that so far doesn’t necessarily mean that they can’t or won’t   Secondly, and this is partly what you referred to, Mr Chairman, the trends of the   recent past could very easily extend for a long time Extremely strong productivity may   very well have a long life ahead of it Inflation may stay quiescent as it has been If the   economies of the rest of the world stay somewhat more sluggish than we are implicitly   thinking, that may happen; and it would have a strong impact   Lastly, we have a stock market that is in a very precarious position It’s very   fragile and I think very shock prone Investors can take their chances, but the concern is   that stock market developments could have a strong impact on the real economy   Another factor in play here--and this harkens back again to your remarks, Mr   Chairman, and to the dialogue with Don Kohn a few minutes ago--is the dynamic that we   may have set in place with our new policy of releasing the Committee’s views much   more freely I think our first venture out with an announcement of our tilt in May really   went quite well The markets seemed to understand it quite accurately and accept it for   what it was Why we did it was interpreted fairly well Markets moved And here we   are, we’re moving It worked okay this time around; I think the reaction was quite   responsible But I think we ought to be careful about being too comfortable that this is   always going to be the case This new policy we have now is being watched with   unbelievable intensity and apprehension, not just by market players but also by the man   on the street for perhaps the first time My sense is that it is broadly perceived by Wall   Street and Main Street that under the old regime, as they came to understand it, these tilts   meant very little to them but that under the new regime they probably mean a lot more   And they just don’t know what that meaning might turn out to be That is a perfect setup,   I think, for a very serious misinterpretation or overreaction on the part of the public To   avoid that, this Committee should be very judicious and very cautious in how we bill this   policy and its announcement I fear that if we do more than just a 25 basis point   tightening today, then we are going to run a wholly unnecessary risk of losing control of   events here and of very possibly creating substantial and unpredictable mischief Let’s   remember, of course, that we can tighten any time we feel it’s necessary; and we can do     6/29-30/99 93   it, and have many times, from a symmetric directive We can so indicate in the   announcement that we release this afternoon Thank you  "
6236,1999-08-24," Second    Second   CHARMAN GREENSPAN All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    Second    Peter, if we are ready for a more nuts and bolts type question here,   I’m wondering about the timing of this It seems to me highly desirable, if we are going to   do this, to do it as rapidly as possible But there is a lot of work to do How is this going to   flow as far as the timing is concerned for these inquiries, preparations, announcements,   putting it in place, and so forth?    If you can meet that timetable, that would be excellent I think it is   pretty ambitious, but we need to try to do it that way    Second    Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe I am the final hitter in the lineup   today and the day is getting on, but let me offer a brief summary of the situation as I see it,   although this is admittedly rather repetitious The economy continues to exhibit a great deal   of fundamental strength though we may be getting a bit of the long-expected slowdown   However, the consensus expectation for the second half is for growth of 3½ percent or likely     8/24/99 69   more than that, which would mark a return to a pace above a sustainable level Left   unconstrained, this could go on into and perhaps through next year, which would introduce   substantial additional upside risks So far, the overheating this threatens has been more than   damped by strong productivity gains, with important assistance from special world cyclical   factors While this could well continue for a time, it seems to me increasingly dangerous to   depend too heavily upon productivity alone to hold inflationary pressures in check, as the   reinforcement provided by a weak world economy seems likely to be dissipating If   overheating were allowed to occur and ignite a cost-driven rise in inflation, it could be quite   difficult to deal with Serious downside risks to economic activity exist, as always, with the   most readily identifiable potential culprits liable to be the sky-high stock market and the still   fragile world economy and exchange rate structure as well as the ever-present possibility of   exogenous shocks But at this juncture the downside risks would seem to be of both lower   magnitude and probability than the upside risks   The federal funds rate is still 50 basis points below the level that existed prior to the   financial crisis of a year ago While one cannot by any means say that all vestiges of that   episode have disappeared, conditions have improved markedly I can see little motivation in   recent experience or likely short-term prospects for continuing all or perhaps any of the   remaining degree of stimulus put in place at that time Thank you    I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for all the   reasons that have been expressed around the table  "
6258,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman As we’ve all been saying, the economy is   resurging after its second-quarter slump and the inflation news continues to be highly favorable   It’s amazing to me that policy formulation can become more difficult when all the news is good,   but it has Recent news has made our choices still more difficult As I look at the available policy   alternatives, it seems to me that a perfectly plausible case can be made for at least three different   policies And there is a perfectly plausible rebuttal argument against each Yet choose we must,   and I’ll leave that discussion for the next phase of our meeting   Let me make two brief observations Many supply side factors that have contributed   importantly to this favorable inflation performance are shifting adversely Cheap oil has gone   away; bargain commodity prices are firming; the dollar has ceased to strengthen and has begun to   reverse; world demand for US exports is beginning to increase, further straining our labor force;   and interest rates have been rising Our strong productivity surge has obviously been of vital   importance and appears to remain vibrantly in place  But going forward, we must judge if it’s safe   to depend on that almost entirely to keep rising cost pressures at bay   Secondly, the demand side looks increasingly frothy to me Consumption is surging, even   as consumers continue to run with a negative saving rate And that, I think, introduces the danger   of fragility Consumer sentiment is rising again from a consistently elevated reading We will   shortly get a new reading, but to date new job formation continues strong, with many reports of an   inability to fill job openings We seem to be entering an inventory cycle of unknown dimensions   Capital spending remains very strong and purchasing managers report slower deliveries and higher     10/5/99 40   prices Housing activity appears to be slowing, but auto sales continue to fly higher and higher,   defying gravity   This Committee has been correct for several years in allowing the economy free rein to   grow, and I feel comfortable that we have responsibly timed a course reversal in recent meetings   Is it now time to rest on our oars a bit?  Perhaps, and a strong case can be--and has been--made for   that But I think it’s worth noting that the fed funds rate today is ¼ point below where it was on   September 29th of last year, the date of our first downward move At that time the unemployment   rate was at 45 percent and the level of real GDP was 4 percent lower than today The rate of GDP   growth in the third quarter of 1998 was 37 percent, slightly slower than the rate now anticipated in   the third quarter of this year We must take great care not to risk losing the degree of stability in   prices that we have worked so long and hard to achieve and that has served our economy so well   Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman As I listened to the go-around, I found myself   identifying with those who would have preferred to go ahead and tighten today But I am   comfortable supporting “B” asymmetric, basically for three reasons First of all, both in the context     10/5/99 66   of what we’ve talked about here today and also for a number of other reasons, I’m delighted that   the window still appears to be open for action in November Secondly, there is an abnormally   strong flow of data that will be coming in over the relatively brief period of time between now and   our November meeting, and that should be of great benefit to us Thirdly, how we do it is part of   the reason for supporting “B,” in my opinion We talked about this yesterday in Roger Ferguson’s   working group, and I am beginning to feel--I don’t think I was alone in this view--that it could be   very counterproductive if we did something in a new way today It would be ad hoc We haven’t   really thought it through in terms of where we’re going or where we want to wind up But more   importantly, the market will not be prepared for it at all It would introduce an additional   complication at a time when we don’t need any additional complications It could induce   considerable confusion, possibly volatility, and unfortunate speculation So I’d be very careful   about doing something new and different that was a departure from our past practices I think that   would be highly undesirable The market is only now beginning to become a little more   comfortable with the procedures we have recently adopted, and to change them on the fly scares   me   What then does that call for? This is a change in the directive and it represents a change in   the Committee’s central thinking if, as I believe, we have a consensus for “B” asymmetric And I   think the most straightforward way to handle this would be to adopt an asymmetric directive,   announce it to the public, and append a brief explanation to our statement    And it would be a departure from what we’ve done for the last few   meetings   SEVERAL That’s right    Yes, sir  "
6280,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman By this time of the morning most of what   needs to be said has already been said But let me briefly summarize how I see the state of play   and offer several comments that I hope might be useful as we move toward our policy   formulation   It seems clear that the economy remains very strong, with a lot of ongoing momentum   True, we do see some better defined indications of slowing activity, with housing apparently   topping out and quite possibly autos as well Other air pockets may well appear, but the   momentum remains impressive New jobs continue to be created in substantial number, driving   unemployment down even further Consumer sentiment has rebounded from its brief and     11/16/99 40   shallow dip The stock market paused for a time, but recently the strength appears to be   broadening and the market seems to be moving into a new up leg Foreign economic growth   looks both more solid and more rapid--possibly a very potent influence on our own outlook The   year 2000 is an election year and those are generally strong Inflation remains quiescent One   should always look for signs of serious potential weaknesses or a slowdown, but other than the   ever-present danger of shocks it’s hard to identify very many looming in the forecast period In   short, the risks seem distinctly on the upside   My formulation of the key question before us is How and when might today’s   healthy strength deteriorate into unhealthy overheating? And the obvious second question to be   addressed shortly is What policy today is most likely to be beneficial a year from now?   Let me make several quick observations First of all, stronger world growth is highly   desirable However, it does complicate our inflation outlook A lower dollar, stronger export   demand, and a higher level of world resource utilization all put new upward pressures on our   price level This is an important reversal of the favorable disinflationary impact we got from a   weaker world in the past several years   Second, the baseline Greenbook forecast calls for some tightening over the forecast   period but still projects a rising rate of inflation through 2000 While a case can be made--but   not by me--that the rate of inflation likely to be reached by the fourth quarter of 2001 would still   be within acceptable limits, I’m concerned about what that rising trend might imply for policy   This Committee could be required to make very strong tightening moves to counter it   Finally, there is the apparently strong growth in the rate of productivity improvement,   the Chairman’s second derivative It has served us wonderfully well But going forward from   here, what are the parameters of its likely impact?  At one end of the spectrum the improvement   could continue for some period of time, but as the Chairman observed it will not do so   indefinitely, with overheating potentially a subsequent condition At the other end, while the   probability may be low, it could disappear very soon and we could find ourselves scrambling to   avoid the consequences To me perhaps the highest probability is that the rate of change will   remain positive but will not be strong enough by itself to hold off the cost increases resulting   from stronger world growth, the wealth effect, and ever tighter labor markets And an earlier and   stronger rise in prices could result     11/16/99 41   At the last meeting the Chairman summarized his analysis by observing that we are   not far from where we want to be and we’re not behind the curve I agree But we may need to   move further in order to be sure that we stay there Thank you    I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I am sympathetic with much of what has been said   around the table, particularly President McTeer’s views and those of Governor Meyer and   President Minehan But I really do believe that Ed Boehne has it right, that we just cannot do   this by Committee I hope you can find some ways to make some changes in this draft that will   accommodate the views that are being expressed  But, basically, I think we have to leave it to   you after you hear what the rest of us have to say    I would welcome an opportunity to review a little further the   language that was suggested about the Chairman’s latitude to act between meetings I have no   problem with the substance of it, but I would like to work with the language a bit more   Concerning the wording in the announcement that Roger referred to at the end of his   remarks, I would strongly support alternative I--describing the balance of risks--because I think   it’s appropriately informative and accurate And I like the fact that it avoids implying in advance   that a determination has been made by the Committee to move one way or the other We do not,   in fact, make such a determination We review the situation from a zero base at each meeting   So, in my view, what appears in alternative I is the more appropriate presentation of how the   FOMC leaves each meeting  "
6305,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman I raised my hand this morning mainly to   be recorded as present and participating in this section of the meeting [Laughter] That’s   because little seems to have changed in recent weeks The economy apparently continues to   have a strong head of steam, the inflation news continues favorable, and productivity growth   remains strong Barring a significant shift in momentum or some external shock from Y2K   or elsewhere, it appears likely that more tightening could well be required over the forecast   period, with the Committee focused more heavily on how much and when That outlook is     12/21/99 39   juxtaposed against the substantial tightening of recent months that has not yet had its full   impact on the economy, and which could possibly provide all or most of the restraint   necessary in this episode Consequently, it is fortunate that the challenging millennium   rollover period, which is now at hand, is also on its merits an appropriate time to rest on our   oars just a bit and assume as low a profile as possible Thank you    Mr Chairman, I can certainly live with either In my view they are   almost as broad as they are long I do favor the symmetric language because I think it is our   clear intention at this point not to change policy, and symmetry is the way to say we are not   going to raise the funds rate I do have one concern--with apologies, I think! It does seem   possible that this Committee might feel forced into an intermeeting move as we get into   January--well after the Y2K experience but before the February meeting If that is a   possibility, then the language of the symmetric directive tends to foreclose that when it says,     12/21/99 56   “At its next scheduled meeting the Committee will assess…” I think we could fix that,   again with apologies    I’d simply remove the word “scheduled”   SPEAKER(?) That’s right We could have an unscheduled meeting    Then it would read “at its next meeting”    Yes, I’ll start, Roger I don’t know that I can add much either to   Roger’s excellent memo or the summary he just gave or to Bill’s very cogent disagreement,   which everyone has given an enormous amount of attention to I’m in the majority that   favors Option 1 First of all, I would like to say relative to the analytics and other concerns   that there are sophisticated market analysts who make a very good living--I carefully do not   say earn a good living--opining, criticizing, and questioning the Fed Some are academics   and they have academic purposes, and others are either speculating or doing the intellectual   work for speculators on the basis of the way they read the Fed I doubt that any language   exists anywhere that will foreclose this process completely I don’t think either of these   options or anything else anybody would be able to craft can achieve that end, much as I   wish we could   I believe that our objective here is to be as informative as we can while ensuring to   the best of our ability that we are accurate and clear about what we actually say We want to   take care not to mislead the public, either explicitly by saying more than we intend to say or   implicitly by opening up possibilities that we could be misunderstood through the   implications that somebody could draw from what we say I think all of our discussions   have been focused on how best to do that The facts are that at each meeting where we   adopt a tilt, bias, or asymmetry or whatever you want to call it--or decide not to do so--it   doesn’t mean any more than what our proclivity is at the time of that meeting It can’t mean     12/21/99 63   any more than that because conditions always change, as we know, and considerations   always change That’s why we have a zero-based review at every meeting that we have   And the record will show, I think, that the tilt evaluation has very little or no predictive   power concerning future policy moves over any particular time period And in my view, we   should be very careful not to leave any impression that it does   In my opinion, the best way to do that is simply to place the weight of the evidence   on the scales as it relates to our two objectives, which we have in this proposed statement-­  price stability on the one hand and sustainable growth on the other Then we should   articulate how those scales read at the time we are looking at them They will either be   balanced or they will be weighted toward a danger in one direction or the other If we feel   that we have to expound further on that, it can be done through a statement released to the   press That is where I come down    And one would have to try to do that within the context of what we   knew at that time--   --not what we know today, which is considerably more More   weight has been given to the risk of inflation than we knew would be the case at the time   that statement would have been made    Two opposed  "
6328,2000-02-01,"  Thank you  After long and careful consideration, it is my honor to   place in nomination the names of Alan Greenspan for Chairman and William McDonough for   Vice Chairman     Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The afternoon is getting on and by my   tally I am the final speaker  But let me say a few brief words, if I may, about momentum in the   economy and productivity, where the trends that have been in place for some time seem to be   continuing, and about inflation, where it seems to me a change is now potentially close at hand    Momentum in the economy clearly remains strong  The record highs of the stock market and   consumer confidence are resulting in continuing strong consumption  Investment spending   remains high, manifested by rising durable goods orders and backlogs of unshipped goods  So          78  far, housing has not collapsed--perhaps being supported by a shift to adjustable rate financing as   mortgage rates rise--and export demand is rising  If sustainable, it’s a bright outlook    Productivity gains continue to be very strong and I believe may be enhanced further in the   upcoming period as a fallout from the Y2K episode Millions of managers and proprietors of   economic units--large and small, profit and nonprofit--have attained a new level of awareness   and know-how in the high-tech arena  That’s truly a wonderful prospect   But I am concerned that the price level picture may now be changing in an   unfavorable direction  As we know very well, we’ve enjoyed a superb mix of rising activity and   declining inflation  This has been made possible mainly by the surge in productivity, but   productivity gains have not done it all  There has been significant help, and many of those   helpful factors are going away  As we expanded, much of the world was in a slump until   recently  Consequently, we have seen the dollar rise, helping to hold down import prices even as   we went on a buying spree that ballooned the trade deficit but absorbed considerable excess   demand  Weak export demand also has freed domestic capacity to fill domestic demand  We’ve   enjoyed weak commodity prices and for a time collapsed energy prices  All of that has either   ceased to help us or actually turned negative, with the tenuous exception of the notoriously   capricious energy prices, which may fall again   Domestically, as new jobs continue to be created--to our society's great benefit--our   remaining available labor pool gets thinner, less skilled, and less motivated  As demand   continues strong, the effects of that development have to show up in costs at some point and may   be doing so now  It may be too much to expect any likely level of productivity gains to carry   almost alone the burden of maintaining price level stability in the near-term environment  A   number of price series are beginning to move  Industrial commodities, the ECI, core           79  PCE, the CPI, the GDP deflator, and other measures had been stable at low levels but recently   have been showing at least tentative signs of moving upward  It is too soon to declare this a   trend, but I suspect a trend may become increasingly apparent  It is still only a trickle and far   from a flood, but I believe it is now our job to insure that it is not allowed to become a flood  I   look forward to discussing how that can best be done while maintaining a healthy rate of   economic growth  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After listening to this discussion, I have   to say that I have reversed the position that I came in here with this morning  The question for   me is How permanent is this higher rate of growth that we now perceive?  If it is permanent,   then I think we ought to move to alternative II  But I note that the concept of what sustainable   growth is has shifted meaningfully in the past several years  And it seems to me that it could   very well shift again, possibly in either direction  I note that, for very good reason, we are able   to recognize and, if you will, formally accept these shifts of what is sustainable only with a   considerable lag  So, if the dynamic here involves what is sustainable growth and it moves   around and we are able to perceive it with confidence only with a lag, then I think we run a   considerable risk of being out of sync a lot of the time  If we go chasing this explicitly by   moving these ranges around, I think it will be very hard to explain and very easily misunderstood   or misinterpreted by the public  And I see no compelling reason to do it     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for all the reasons that   have been expressed  I think it’s exactly the right thing to do  But I do want to say that I feel a   good deal of identification with the remarks of President Broaddus and others around the table    "
6353,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  While the data are moving around a bit,   as they always do, it seems to me that the situation facing the Committee today has changed very   little since our last meeting  As has been the case for some time, as we all know, we see   extremely strong demand driving the economy toward overheating on the one hand, but on the   other we see to date only the scantiest evidence of rising price pressures as a result  However, it   continues to appear highly likely that at some point strong demand will force heightened price   pressures  Consequently, I see little choice but to stay the course that we have been following    Thank you      I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6373,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Once again it seems that the basic   conditions facing the Committee are little changed from those prevailing at the time of the   most recent several meetings, except that perhaps many now familiar concerns have been   escalating further  The economy has turned in another remarkable quarter, and recently hard   evidence has begun to replace earlier perceptions that compensation increases are accelerating   and some measures of inflation may now be on the move  There is little point in further   reciting the factors at work here  It appears clear from this discussion that most, if not all, of   those around the table see the risks as continuing to be heavily on the up side, with further   policy moves in order  As the Bluebook discusses, the operative question is  By how much?   There are a number of reasons to feel it is unlikely that inflation is suddenly about to   surge  Among other factors the dollar remains remarkably strong  Oil prices appear to have   peaked and commodity prices generally have flattened out  Productivity increases continue   to hold unit cost increases at bay  And the impact of policy easing in the fall of 1998 should   be dissipating while the tightening over the past year should increasingly be kicking in  I   believe we are still on or perhaps still ahead of the curve, although some inflation creep      76  seems inevitable  However, any signs of economic slowing are scattered at best and quite   inadequate in my view to provide confidence that the needed easing of activity is likely to   occur without significant additional policy moves  It is helpful that both the real economy   and financial markets today seem to be presenting us an unusual window  The more   aggressive policy path is both expected and by many considered acceptable and is thus likely   to present less risk than the more conservative alternative in the near as well as the longer   term  I believe we should grasp this opportunity  Thank you       I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for all of the   reasons that have been stated around the table  "
6397,2000-06-27,"  Thank you  Mr Chairman, we’ve been seeking a slowdown in the   expansion for a long time and perhaps we have it at last  Often when the economy moves into   what could be a paradigm shift, this Committee must go through a period when it is uncertain   about how to read the course of events  This appears to be such a time when policy decisions   have to be made  Please be patient with a 20 second review of recent history  In the fall of   1998 we eased policy not because a weakening economy called for it, but rather in response to a   looming international crisis that required quick, strong action  The pre-existing level of the fed   funds rate was restored over the second half of 1999, but the easing was no doubt a factor in the   strong surge of growth from mid-1999 until now  So far this year we have taken rates 100 basis   points higher, with half of that done only a month ago  Today the easing of 18 months earlier is   going away and the increases of the past five months are kicking in  If we believe it is certain   that further tightening will be required, it might be best to push ahead right now  Alternatively,   if we believe the opposite, we ought to tell that to the market with a symmetric statement and a   no change directive  But it is probably not that simple  We are in what I would call “maybe”   time  Maybe productivity will continue to be so strong that costs will stay in line and   overheating avoided for some time to come  Maybe the NAIRU in this era is a lot lower than   we thought and consequently the danger we perceive from it is a lot less than we believe    Maybe the consumer, having bought everything in sight and run his and her debt service load   back up to the old record levels in the process, will continue to buy but at a more subdued pace   and thus will extend the moderating consumption pace of recent weeks  Of course, all these           70  suppositions could flow the other way  Maybe consumer spending, capital expenditures, and   the stock market, joined now by exports, will go ballistic again  Maybe, maybe, maybe  All   these maybes plus $3 will buy you a grande size latte at Starbucks!  [Laughter]     But the good news is that there are some important certainties and near certainties  In   my opinion, near certainty number one is that inflation likely will creep up further but is   unlikely to explode in our faces over the forecast period  Near certainty number two is that   sales of housing and autos, two large cyclically sensitive sectors, are both slowing from their   peaks and seem likely to stay at lower levels for some time  Near certainty number three is that   the federal surplus is burgeoning and will provide a drag on growth at least through the early   months of the next Administration, which is our forecast horizon     Certainties in my opinion include number one--while we know little about it as yet--  that there is a slowdown of unknown magnitude presently under way  Certainty number two, as   we know of course, is that there is a substantial additional impact still in the pipeline from   tightening already in place  And certainty number three is that by our August meeting we will   be in possession of a large amount of invaluable additional data  We will know all about the   second quarter, including GDP, ECI, unit costs, and corporate profits  And we will have June   and July employment reports, data on consumer spending, and inflation numbers, among other   things     All of this tells me, Mr Chairman, that before moving ahead we are in need of more   data and some time to assess it  Fortunately, both economic conditions generally and the   calendar seem to be ready to accommodate us  Thank you     Several vehicles will be there     Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation  But I would like to   add that I hope the statement we release to the public will be quite strongly worded  I think this   recommended action is exactly what the market consensus expects and I would hate to see an   overly euphoric reaction to it, which I believe is quite possible  We may indeed need to tighten   more--perhaps quite soon and perhaps by a considerable amount  And I hope we put the market   very clearly on notice to that effect     However, I would like to see a statement today that is a little   stronger than the words we have used in the past     Fine  I just want to put it on the table  "
6421,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I apologize that I have no handout, [laughter]   but I’ll try to make up for it by being brief  The incoming data that we’ve been reviewing all   morning really need no repetition and I would only add that on balance they seem benign and   favorable to a truly remarkable degree  It may be a midsummer night’s dream but I think the recent       65  data could contain the seeds of a near-utopian extension of our recent superb era  If a modest   downturn does set in for an extended period, productivity improvements could continue to hold unit   labor costs flat  And if we have the good fortune to avoid the potential negative shocks from both   known and unforeseen sources, the stage would be set  We would experience sustainable growth,   higher real incomes, slower but continuing job creation, and steady, perhaps at some point receding,   inflation  The only other thing one could ask for is major league baseball in Washington!    [Laughter]   That is an enticing but quite plausible prospect to be sure, but it would be folly to adopt it   as a locked-in scenario and I would not suggest that we do so  The real world is still a difficult and   challenging place  Inflation is creeping up, the current account deficit does continue to grow, the   stock market and consumer debt are dangerously high, and household savings are dangerously low    Hot spots, both economic and political, do glow threateningly around the world  And the favorable   outcome relies almost entirely on a continuation of productivity increases unprecedented in recent   decades  If all this were not so serious and important, and if this Committee were not so squarely in   the middle of the vortex, it would all be great theatre  At any rate, to wait and to watch intensively   seems the best posture for today     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6443,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over time it has seemed to me that there is a   certain recurring rhythm to the work of this Committee  There are times when we are faced with a   need to reassess the appropriate fundamental course of policy and other times when we are focused   on questions of how much impetus may or may not be needed to move further along an established   path  And then there are occasions when an intermediate-term objective appears to be being met,   which raises a new set of issues and puts us into a period when it is desirable to wait and see what   incoming data tell us about evolving conditions  We may be in such a wait-and-see period today    We now appear to be in an economic slowdown, which most if not all of us have been seeking  And   new questions present themselves  How long-lasting and how deep will this slowdown prove to be?    How will the course of inflation react?  Will inflation slow with the economy, continue to creep   upward regardless, or perhaps accelerate in response to conditions previously in place?  Many      71  scenarios have a certain plausibility, but I believe the Greenbook baseline is as good a bet as one can   make today, and it calls for a wait-and-see approach for now  I believe that represents the rhythm of   the day and, therefore, that the present policy stance remains appropriate     I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6465,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is now pretty well beyond question that   the economy is in a slowdown, and this leaves us clearly facing new, quite different questions   than those we have been grappling with over recent years  The fact that these new questions are   precisely the ones we would have anticipated earlier this year when we thought ahead about   dealing with an emerging slowing economy does not make them any easier to answer now that   they are at hand  The two fundamental questions I see as operative today are first, how deep and   long-lasting will this slowdown prove to be?  And second, will inflation flatten in tight   correlation with a slowing economy or will it continue to drift up, driven by the momentum of   earlier conditions and/or perhaps by an economy that does not slow enough for long enough?   Concerning the slowdown, there is evidence of it all around us  We have been   examining it all morning and it is quite possible that weakness will foster further weakness    Governor Gramlich and Presidents McTeer and Hoenig listed factors that could cause that  But I               69      believe it may be a bit early to get overly concerned about the downside potential  There is still   substantial strength out there    Let me cite a few factors  For openers, in my view the Greenbook forecast can hardly   be considered weak  Consumer confidence remains very high and is perhaps rising again  And   consumer spending in the weaker third quarter was considerably stronger than in the more robust   second quarter  In general it seems to be holding up well  Job creation continues--slower but   hardly anemic--and incomes continue to rise  The stock market has stalled, but except for the   more egregiously overvalued stocks of a few months ago, it is still quite elevated by historical   standards and holding up well so far despite having plenty of excuses to crater  Business   investment is likely slowing from its earlier unsustainable pace but shows no sign of collapse    Fiscal policy is likely to become more stimulative under the new president, regardless of who he   may be  The economies of our trading partners as a group are projected to continue to grow--at   around 4 percent--which should cushion an incipient decline here  Certainly the potential exists   for the situation to weaken quickly and perhaps even precipitously, but I'm not sure that that's the   most likely scenario as of today   Concerning inflation, what I see happening is that from a low base it is now sluggishly   but clearly moving up  Perhaps in today's high productivity environment this might be more   easily reversed than in prior eras  But I feel that the longer this uptrend goes on, the harder it   will be to stop  And should the economy reaccelerate soon, inflation may well accelerate with it    The interrelationship of compensation costs and productivity will continue to be key, as will   energy prices  We will watch closely, of course  Fortunately we have time to watch and to   evaluate  Between the easing of upside risks on the one hand and ongoing substantial               70      momentum in the economy on the other, there would seem to be no urgent need to change either   rates or rhetoric at this time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support your   recommendation  I fear that if we went to neutral language, it would be read by the   market as the first step in an easing cycle  Many in the market expect that and I think   they would see a change of that sort as confirming their belief  And I believe that could   prove to be very seriously and importantly misleading  The Greenbook and at least some   of us here see a further tightening as the most likely next move  Obviously that could be   wrong  It could even be wrong quite soon  But I do not see any need to make a change               92      now  Maybe we'll want to do that at the next meeting; maybe we won't  At any rate, I   see no need to be preemptive based on the evidence that’s before us today     Machine or hand count?  "
6490,2000-12-19,"  One more comment on inventories?  As one who in an earlier incarnation   had responsibility for managing inventories, the technology that’s available to managers today is   light years better than we used to have some time ago--not only information technology but many      22  other things as well  As a consequence, there's a micro control capability, absent an absolute decline   in final demand of course  That ability to micro control is going to lead, I think, to more little saw   tooth type variations in inventories rather than the large waves that we saw earlier  And I would   submit that the likelihood is that the inventory recessions that we remember historically are a thing   of the past     But perhaps increasingly     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Things have been moving fast recently  Two   meetings ago we thought we might have a real slowdown at hand but could not yet be sure  At the      57  last meeting it was clear that a slowdown was under way but its characteristics were not yet   ascertainable  Today we are confronted with several recent weeks of strong and concerning   downside data  While a softening was expected, I have been surprised at the often seriously   weakening news about autos, consumer confidence, corporate earnings, retail sales, high-tech   expenditures, and foreign economic growth, among other things  Clearly, the balance of risks has   shifted substantially downward   However, considerable strength remains, albeit less robust in almost every sector While   credit extension has slowed and asset quality concerns have appeared, banks remain very healthy    Indeed, many interest rates have fallen, which will bolster activity  And while productivity increases   may slow with economic activity, the basic momentum in productivity growth remains strong    Business investment spending is slowing but continuing, with capital deepening remaining a   corporate imperative  Oil prices are easing, but remain shock-prone and it must be noted--and has   already been noted--that natural gas prices are on a tear  New jobs are still being created, although at   a slower rate  I would argue that the composition of the decline in the stock market from the   intergalactic levels of a few months ago is more a sign of the market's strength than of its weakness    My main worry there is that market prices are still very high by historical standards   I would make two key observations, and each leads to a key question  Observation   number one It is clear that the economy is transitioning to a lower growth level, and within limits   this is welcomed  Question Will this decline bottom out spontaneously at an acceptable growth   rate, perhaps not too far below trend growth, or will its momentum carry it dangerously lower?    Observation number two By most measures inflation is off its lows and is slowly rising  Question   How will inflation behave in this slowdown, characterized as it is by an intensely competitive and      58  high productivity growth environment?  Will inflation stall out quickly in this environment or will   momentum carry it on up, driven perhaps by rising unit labor costs?   On balance, it would seem wise to begin to move to counter the new weakness, given all   the uncertainties and the lagged response of the economy to policy shifts  But how and by how   much?  Making a policy decision today in this situation reminds me a bit of how I feel upon   checking into a hotel room and finding it too chilly  I'm confronted with how to reset a strange   thermostat of unknown properties  Several clicks in the warming direction are available, but how   many clicks will most likely result in a comfortable temperature when I return in a few hours after a   dinner meeting?  My usual response is a firm but cautious reset to start with, knowing that additional   warming clicks are available if it stays too cool, but minimizing the likelihood of inducing   overheating and having to spend the night in an unpleasant and unnecessary sweat!  [Laughter]     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6512,2001-01-03,"  Well, you might at least let me volunteer!  [Laughter]     I would like to nominate Alan Greenspan to be Chairman of the   Committee and William McDonough as Vice Chair     I was behind the curve on that one, sorry  I thought you were going   to ask somebody else     All right, I nominate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York     Mr Chairman, this is Mike Kelley  I certainly support your   recommendation  I think it’s just the right one  On this matter of how our action should be   framed, I have a little disagreement with some of my colleagues here about the notion of     1/3/01 18  explaining it as a reduction in the real interest rate  To my mind that’s a rather abstract concept   for the general public  As I see it, the economy is transitioning from an earlier unsustainable rate   of growth to what we hope will be a somewhat lower and sustainable rate of expansion  That   process necessarily implies that during the transition we’re going to see some softening or falling   off of activity in some sectors  And that’s what we see, although I would certainly agree that the   softening has been a little more pronounced and has occurred more quickly than we had expected   or hoped  But this was to be expected in an economy going from an unsustainable growth rate to   a sustainable one  I think what we are attempting to do here, as you said a little earlier, is to   reach a point of stability in this downward transition process  And that's the way I would like to   see it explained        "
6534,2001-01-30,"  Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve learned an enormous amount   from the papers, and I appreciate that  I also want to say that I’ve learned an enormous   amount from the comments that have been made around the table here today by so many   different people   I have to confess that I’m still having trouble getting over an acute state of   denial  [Laughter]  To me the way we have been operating, through the exclusive use of     1/30-31/01 50  Treasuries, is just so overwhelmingly the best way to do it that I find myself having a   terrible time being attracted to any of the various alternatives on the table     One thing that we haven’t pursued in talking about the alternatives is the   concept you introduced, Mr Chairman, about this being an interim problem  That raises   quickly the question of how big a problem we might face and for how long  I’m not sure   we have thought about this in that context, or at least I haven’t  I was viewing these   alternatives as basically involving an approach that would be carried forward more or less   indefinitely into the future  But because I feel so strongly about trying to stay with what   we have been doing, if at all possible, I believe we ought to give Al Broaddus’ idea a   serious look  There may be fundamental flaws in it; I certainly haven’t thought it through   so I don’t know  But if it would help us to get through an interim problem, then we ought   to try to see if it is an approach that should be pursued   I also strongly suspect, even given the presumed sanctity of the Social Security   Trust Fund and the way its assets will increase and then decrease, that the political   institutions down the street are sufficiently inventive that they may very well find ways to   make this problem go away  So it may not become an issue that we need to worry about   at all  Nevertheless, we should look at the problem and alternative solutions  We must   do that, and it is right for us to do that     I don’t have a set of solutions to propose  I have not tried to come up with   that  The ones that have been made around the table are all very good and all have strong   points  I would like to make one negative point--it has been made before--but I feel quite   strongly about it  And that is that when we do new things, if at all possible we should try   very hard to avoid putting in place operations that are going to have an impact on the     1/30-31/01 51  markets  Investing in equities would be the worst  But almost anything we do is liable to   have an impact on the market, and we must give very, very close attention to trying to   avoid that or at least minimize it  I say that because once this institution puts its   imprimatur on any one of these markets and begins to put money into it, I believe the   impact we will have on that market will go well beyond the amount of dollars that we   may be investing in it  If we do enter markets and begin to distort their performance, I   think it’s a very, very short step from there to distorting the optimal investment flows   across the economy  And if that starts, it’s a very short step from there to distorting the   social distribution of assets that are appropriated across our economy and across our   society  My concern, if it’s fair to talk in terms as broad and grandiose as that, is that this   begins to take us well beyond our role and even beyond the scope of the problem we’re   trying to solve here  So I would be extremely careful about what we do because its   impact will ripple across the economy, well beyond the direct ways that we can   accurately identify and that these studies indeed have already accurately identified     Don, it was fairly late in the morning when the Chairman   articulated the concept that this problem may turn out to be an interim one  It could be   reversed and go back the other way  To me there is a fair probability that if we view this   whole episode in that context, it may change the way we look at some of the alternatives    Of course, how big the problem will be and how long it will last are issues with very   wide parameters right now  At any rate, I would suggest that you look at this from that   point of view and see how it might influence where we might want to go rather than think   of it as an open-ended matter     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In our perpetual journey along the   economy’s mythical curve, we came to a sudden hairpin turn late in the fourth quarter of   last year  With a quick and aggressive maneuver, I believe we’ve stayed on track, but   this passage is leaving us with a new landscape to negotiate  To belabor the obvious,   there is no doubt that we are now in a slowdown of potentially ominous proportions    And yet, as the Greenbook recognizes, this could still prove to be a growth pause  After   all, we’ve seen such pauses before in this expansion  And once we get this worrisome   inventory correction behind us, we might be off to the races again  Indeed, there is still a   lot of strength in place especially in the huge services sector of the economy  Among   other factors, the banks are still healthy and open for business with rates much more   attractive than several quarters ago  Labor markets are still tight, with unemployment   still very low  And recent retail and other anecdotal evidence has been more upbeat  The   very intensity of the inventory correction under way holds promise that unless demand   implodes--and that’s an important caveat--that correction will soon run its course  There   does not seem to be much reason for a serious collapse and good reason to expect   renewed strength  But to me an early return to very strong growth also seems unlikely     Consider three of the major drivers of the recent boom  The first is consumer   durables  Over the past twelve quarters, its growth was in the teens in five quarters and     1/30-31/01 164  in two of them it was well above 23 percent  But that rate fell to minus 5 percent in the   most recent quarter  Furthermore, consumer debt service burdens over this period rose to   levels that match the high of the late 1980s  It's hard to see a new boom very soon in   consumer durables   Business fixed investment, another major driver, has traced much the same   pattern  In the past twelve quarters it grew at annual rates in the teens in six of them,   with growth in the first quarter of 2000 at 21 percent  In the most recent quarter it was at   or near zero  Capacity utilization has fallen substantially below its average level  It's   hard to see a new boom there soon     Finally, the stock market rose steadily from August 1982 through March 2000,   with the S&P 500 reaching a price-earnings ratio in the mid-30s  Today that measure is   still well over 20, matching the previous high of 1992  From that level it’s hard to see   much room for another sustained rise in the market that would rekindle the wealth effect     In summary, Mr Chairman, I believe we are at an important juncture  I’m   optimistic that the economy can and will soon be okay, but I see a clear and present   danger in the very short term  While this inventory correction runs its course, consumer   behavior may be the key  If the consumer decides to go into hibernation, the entire   economy could easily follow in a self-fulfilling prophecy  I hope we will aggressively   counter that possibility now and then see what emerges in the spring  Fortunately, the   outlook for inflation seems to give us a comfortable degree of room to maneuver  With   two quarters of sub-trend growth already registered and the current quarter plus one to   three more in prospect, the inflation outlook over the forecast period seems favorable    Thank you     1/30-31/01 165    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6558,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There's very little that I can add at   this point about the economy, so I’ll be brief  But let me try to summarize the situation       3/20/01 75  It was 100 percent predictable well in advance of the economic slowdown that   going through such a period would be painful  We are now in a slowdown and it is   painful  It was almost as certain that after a period of slowing a time would come when   we would welcome an upturn but would have to go through a very disconcerting stretch   of uncertainty about whether an upturn or more decline was in the cards  We seem to be   in that stage now  In recent days we’ve all been studying the data, reading analyses,   receiving briefings, and sharing ideas  The bottom line would seem to be this While   there are good reasons to believe that the economy will soon turn up--and I believe that is   the highest probability outcome--we cannot know or be overly confident that an upturn is   in train  It is still possible that the various negative forces existing today will drag us into   further weakness  Our policy choice must be made in the face of this very fundamental   uncertainty     In golf, which I play poorly, club selection before a shot usually presents the   player with three options--an aggressive choice, a central tendency, and a conservative   choice  [Laughter]  Each option usually has its own plausibility  In different situations a   player might well go with any of the options, depending on his or her objectives at the   time and an assessment of the risks  Shortly I expect Don Kohn to tell us that in this   game a conservative choice is to ease 25 basis points, 50 basis points is a central   tendency, and 75 is aggressive  Of course, the loudest voices in the gallery want us to go   for it, but that doesn't mean that we should  In deference to your request that members   not discuss policy positions until the next part of the meeting, Mr Chairman, I will   withhold further comments until then  [Laughter]     3/20/01 76    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me comment briefly about   each of the choices along the spectrum of alternatives that are most plausible here   Twenty-five basis points is the most conservative possibility  With inflation   quiescent and quite likely to stay so for some time, I just don't see any necessity to keep   such a tight hold  Indeed, I perceive that it would be quite risky to do so  So that   alternative has little attraction for me at this time   The most aggressive choice is 75 basis points  While the financial markets are   clamoring for it, the data from the real economy seem firmer than such a move might     3/20/01 92  imply  Most particularly, I fear that the message a 75 basis point move would send   would be totally wrong  People in the real economy might perceive us to be in panic,   which we are not  Stock market investors might see us as trying to save them, which   would not be correct but could nevertheless create a serious moral hazard that might be   quite difficult to eradicate  And this move would take short-term rates down toward a   low level, which could begin to constrain our options should further easing become   necessary  Finally, there is at least some small possibility that a strong, early upturn in   the economic expansion could make even this level seem too low in the not too distant   future, which would introduce an entirely new set of dynamics   So, I believe that 50 basis points is the best choice and that asymmetry toward   weakness is the correct tilt because I think the risks are still on the down side  Thank   you     I have the language we used in December if nobody else does     Would you like me to read it, Mr Chairman?     The comparable sentence in the press release of December   19th read  “The Committee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic   situation”     No  "
6577,2001-04-11,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Many people have expressed the   desire to stay away from intermeeting moves and in general I think that certainly makes   sense  And if we did that in this case we would have a host of data available to us by the   15th of next month that we don’t have right now  So I think there’s a very good argument   for waiting until our regular meeting    But if we feel that we definitely are going to need to lower rates, and if further   it is desirable to have an intermeeting move, then the question obviously becomes   whether to do it now or wait until some other day over the course of the next 10 days  In   that case, on balance I think I would prefer to go ahead  With all of the data that are   coming out over the next several days and, of course, the normal course of daily events, I   can envision many different scenarios that would end up making it less rather than more   desirable to do it some day in the near future  I think that’s a distinct risk  Is today   necessarily not as good a day as we will have some time over the next week or so?   It’s   not at all clear to me that that is the case      4/11/01 24   So, I would like to support Ned Gramlich in that I believe there is an argument   to be made that when the data are as mixed as they are now, there may a positive benefit   in moving ahead of the data  That would indicate that we are not moving in panic but   just that the general situation requires lower rates, and we could go ahead and make the   move on a day when there is not a specific data release, whether it be good or bad  In sum, I’m comfortable to wait because I don’t think it’s critical that we move   right now  But if we are focused on whether we’re going to do it today or soon, then I’d   prefer to go ahead today  "
6597,2001-04-18,"  Mr Chairman, this is Mike Kelley also in Dallas  I support   your recommendation  I do share the concern that several others have expressed about   the timing, but I think that is a bit of an imponderable at this point and probably moot    We’ll see how it goes  I believe the economy calls for this move, for all the reasons that   have been recited at this conference call  That being the case, I think we should go   forward     "
6619,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Are we beyond the crisis stage of our   deep slowdown and are we now entering a firming and turning period?  Much of the market’s   recent action and sentiment indicates that that is likely the case  And certainly if increasing   difficulty in arriving at a firm conviction about monetary policy is symptomatic of a sea change,   then I, along with Bob McTeer, probably am an indicator that we are there  I hope and   cautiously believe that that is the case and that the economy is bottoming out  Recent incoming   data suggest that it is  Last week initial claims fell  April retail sales were robust  Consumer   sentiment showed an improvement  Both headline and core CPI are moving upward ominously,   possibly suggesting renewing strength in the economy  The inventory correction seems well   advanced  Our high-tech problems look to me more and more like another episode of sectoral   rolling recession that we have often seen before in industries such as energy, construction,   defense, agriculture, autos, and others  They seldom drag down the entire economy by   themselves     So, things are starting to look better  But a closer inspection reveals that much of this   news is quite tenuous  Initial claims are a helpful but volatile series, and we have only one   favorable week to go on  Obviously, we’ll need much more to know if the rising pattern is     5/15/01     70   reversing  And with unemployment likely to go higher, that seems questionable  April’s strong   retails sales were accompanied by downward revisions to previous months  Stronger consumer   sentiment needs a lot of confirmation  While the CPI is rising, the PCE and other price series are   not  And while a great deal of inventory reduction is taking place, inventory-sales ratios are still   very high in many sectors     As for the rolling recession in the high-tech sector, it could prove to be more   troublesome than most of its predecessors  It is occurring simultaneously with a number of other   problems and imbalances in the economy including--in addition to the concerns already   mentioned above--record household debt burdens, over-investment by business firms and over-   spending by consumers, higher energy prices, a bear market for stocks, and a worldwide   slowdown  Can all this be handled at the same time that our most dynamic sector of recent years   is going through its own rolling recession?  It is a concern  Possibly fiscal and certainly   monetary policy could help provide the needed extra boost to pull us through to renewed growth   To sum up, Mr Chairman, I believe we are winning, but the fat lady has not yet sung    I suggest we would be well advised to keep the easing pressure on now, hope this is the last time   it is necessary to do so aggressively, and then we will be free to focus more clearly on price level   stability in future periods       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I would   add that I am concerned that too overt a comment today about the possible ending of this easing   process might well be a bit premature for two reasons  First, it would be premature if some of   these downside probabilities that we’re concerned about materialize; if they do, it could be a   problem to have said that  Second, if this release will have an asymmetric tilt--as I think it should   because it’s the only honest thing that we can say now--then that coupled with too strong a   statement about ending this process could send the market a very confusing message and have a   counterproductive impact      Mr Chairman, I’d like to support Governor Meyer, particularly on   softening the statement at the very end of the second paragraph  I believe “threatens to keep the   pace of economic activity unacceptably weak” is a bit stronger wording than we need to use  I   think the language he suggested, “continues to weigh on the economy” is both accurate and   adequate  "
6642,2001-06-26," Thank you Let me return for just a minute to the projection for   restored growth next year It's pretty clear that the impetus for that is going to come from fiscal   and monetary policy and maybe the cessation of this inventory cycle  You have essentially a   trend growth projection for next year of around 35 percent growth  Where is this going to   manifest itself in the various sectors of the economy?  What do you see leading us back out here?    Are capital expenditures going to come back and be a leader again?  Are we going to see renewed   growth in housing and automobiles? What sectors are going lead the return?    Right That's where the impetus comes from but where does it   manifest itself?    Well, next year will be fairly balanced then, if I'm hearing you correctly   in terms of where the growth is going to show up    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The condition of our economy has been   thoroughly examined by the other Committee members  There's little I can add to their   comments, and in the next segment of the meeting we will decide what all this implies for policy    So let me take a minute of the Committee's time to comment on a concern that I believe bears on   our policy strategy going forward   I think it's important in today's situation to be mindful of the distinction between the   level of economic activity and the momentum in its rate of change  Momentum has been lost, but   the economy continues to operate at a very high level  To be sure, our measure of capacity   utilization is at a near-recession level, unemployment is rising, and manufacturing is very weak      6/26-27/01 123   However, the volatile light vehicle and homebuilding industries are holding near their very strong   recent highs  Personal consumption expenditures continue to rise, albeit more slowly  And while   we have seen small net job losses in the past several months, they are but a small fraction of the   very strong gains made over the past several years, and most of those people are still at work    While unemployment is rising from its recent historically low level, there is a very good chance   that it will not rise above what many would consider to be the long-run NAIRU, implying that the   labor force would still be quite fully utilized when this cycle bottoms out  The stock market,   despite a vicious shakeout in some of its segments, remains quite elevated overall   In sum, one hopes that this is the worst economy we’ll ever experience  And it would   not be so terrible if it were just to rest here for a while  But it will not do that, which raises the   question of momentum  The powerful upward thrust of the economy broke in the third quarter of   last year when GDP growth came in at 22 percent and it has been sliding downhill ever since    That quarter followed a year--from the third quarter of 1999 through the second quarter of 2000-­  when growth was 61 percent The decompression of this decline has been painful and   frightening Without having done any research to verify it, I suspect that this fall has been about   as steep as that which occurs in a substantial recession  Yet GDP isn't falling; it just isn't rising    Momentum is our problem, not the level of activity  Will the economy regain momentum?  Its   ongoing strength, bolstered among other things by Fed easing, the tax cut, and the conclusion of   the inventory correction, makes recovery the most likely bet  But fragile confidence, fragile   financial markets, stalled capital expenditures, and many other threats could readily kick us into a   new further and possibly severe down cycle  So far the expected upturn is not in clear view and   this ongoing weakness must be appropriately addressed in the near term     6/26-27/01 124   As for myself, I remain confident that we will successfully deal with the loss of   momentum  But I worry that if we are too successful in doing so, we could quickly rotate into an   overheating problem initiated by the high level of activity from which the regained momentum   arose That would be most unfortunate, in my view, if it were to occur  In the past 2-3/4 years   we have been through one major tightening and two major easing cycles, totaling some 500 basis   points in policy moves, disregarding sign  While there were good and sufficient reasons for all   this, in my view that is more than a desirable amount of policy volatility over so short a period of   time  I am convinced that the economy does best in an era of small and infrequent policy   changes, just as it does best with low and stable inflation  I hope the Committee will seek to find   ways to dampen this volatility over time  When policy needs to change, of course, we must   change it But let's work very hard to do much less, in the interest of making sure that we do not   unduly whipsaw our economy and thereby perhaps inhibit rather than enhance our efforts to   achieve maximum sustainable growth over time   One further cheery word on this subject To any others who, like me, worry about   overdoing this easing cycle, we may as well relax because if we are going to sow the seeds of a   future inflation, I fear that we've probably already done that  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I agree with your suggestion  I must say I do so   reluctantly in one respect because I would really like to stop lowering the funds rate at the level     6/26-27/01 146   where it is right now But the downside uncertainty is still too high and the psychology is still   too fragile, so I think another, smaller easing move is the best way to go today    "
6669,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As usual, by this time our discussion has   thoroughly dissected and evaluated the economy, and little remains to be added  So please   indulge a short-timer for a few concluding ruminations     First of all, it’s necessary to acknowledge, as almost everyone here has, significant   disappointment in the data that have come in over the intermeeting period  The main driver of   this slowdown, capital overhang drying up capital expenditures, looks no better  The inventory   correction, to my great surprise, drags on still  The world economic outlook looks even more   bleak, with political and financial tensions threatening to exacerbate the situation further    Although housing somehow continues to levitate, recent auto sales may be hinting that the   consumer is tiring, which could become a serious concern     Not everything is negative, of course  Industrial production and labor market   conditions may be stabilizing  The tax rebate checks are flowing, Fed easing should be kicking   in, inventory balance is coming into view, and energy prices are falling  Nevertheless, on   balance one must be concerned At the last meeting, there was speculation that the balance of   risks might be moving toward symmetry  At that time, I expected to be firmly in that camp by   today While I am indeed edging in that direction, I’m not ready yet to drive down the tent pegs   and settle in I’d like to, but I just can’t   Shifting the subject a bit, two strains of recent media comment strike me as   wrongheaded First there has been the suggestion that monetary policy isn’t working  Have   these people given any thought to what this economy might look like today if policy had not   changed this year?  If anything, I’d suggest that policy has worked more quickly than usual and   precisely where it was needed most, shoring up consumer and stock market confidence  And     8/21/01 59   now the traditional lagged impact of policy should start to be felt   Second, one is already starting to hear complaints that a recovery will be weak when it   comes  Here again I wonder if our critics have pondered the implications of a strong rebound?   Given the very high absolute level of activity that we have even today, I hope and expect that the   recovery will be moderate  An early boom beginning from here would lead quickly to major   new problems     Mr Chairman, in my view monetary policy is not part of the economy’s problem   today And going forward, I see monetary policy as having only a marginal role in the solution    At the first of this year a strong policy response was critical and I’m proud of the way this   Committee responded at that time  But now I feel that if we visibly but modestly support the   natural forces of recovery and remain patient, we can be most effective   Let me conclude where I began  Obviously, on balance things are still weak  But I   continue to believe in the mantra of recovery initiated by tax and interest rate cuts and rebalanced   inventory positions, aided by lower energy costs and now, perhaps, a somewhat lower dollar    But we cannot ignore our serious investment collapse, a very dangerous world situation, and the   possibility of a tiring consumer  What really concerns me most of all is that we must remain   concerned at a time when we expected to be relaxing a bit  It’s just possible that we may have   problems ahead of us that we do not yet see  At any rate, we’re not out of the woods yet    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
6708,2001-09-17," Before the Committee begins its deliberations this morning, it   may be appropriate to observe a moment of silence   Let us each in our own way remember those who have lost their lives in last   week’s terrible catastrophe and those who grieve for them  Let us each in our own way   ask for wisdom for our leaders as they guide our nation through the critical days ahead    And particularly let us each in our own way ask that we, on this Committee and its staff,   who have been charged with conducting an important part of our nation’s economic life,   be guided to appropriate healing actions in carrying out our responsibilities  [Silence]   Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, this is Mike Kelley  I concur with your   recommendation  "
6729,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, my congratulations to   the Greenbook staff for a fine job under impossible conditions  However, as the authors     10/2/01 68   themselves are at pains to point out, this and all other forecasts today can have only a   limited credibility  This is evidenced by the quite appropriately wide spectrum of the   alternative scenarios, several of which are virtually as plausible as the baseline forecast   itself Yet policy must be made  How are we to meet that necessity?     I felt earlier and feel today that monetary policy made its most important   contribution to reversing this cycle over the first half of the year, and I’m proud of what   was done by this Committee  Given what is already in the pipeline, together with the   possibility of somewhat lower rates, policy seems very supportive  Changes from here   on will likely play a relatively minor role compared to developments in fiscal policy,   consumer confidence, and the progress of the war on terrorism  Monetary policy was, in   my opinion, a key positive force earlier, but the focus today may be to ensure that it does   not become a negative factor in the economic equation  How could that happen?   In the short run, this may be one of those very strange times when appearance   could be the most important reality  The Fed is on the recovery team, of course  But we   must be seen to be on that team by the man on the street, both on Main Street and Wall   Street  To be so perceived will be a positive force for recovery, whereas to be seen   otherwise could be a major negative  As our nation struggles to recover from a major   trauma, surprising the markets could be an additional trauma we just do not need right   now This condition will hopefully change soon and the day will likely come when a   policy surprise will be appropriate, but not today  Fortunately, Mr Chairman, inflation is   most likely going to trend downward over the forecast period, giving the Committee   some further room to maneuver and time to reverse course in an orderly manner       10/2/01 69   I believe the Committee will soon be facing two successive sets of challenges   and the sooner the better in each case  The first will be when and how to terminate this   easing cycle when the economy stabilizes  We obviously are not to that point yet  I hope   the end of our easing process will be followed shortly by the second challenge,   determining how and when it will be necessary to begin to damp the enormous amount of   stimulation that has been and will be pumped into this economy first by monetary policy   and soon by fiscal policy  I believe the Committee may be entitled to take some   satisfaction in the role policy has played in recent years, but the future will probably   prove to be at least equally as challenging as the past  What is needed today, however,   seems pretty straightforward  Thank you    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    "
6752,2001-11-06," I really should pass at this point!  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the time   of our last meeting, the economic horizon already appeared dark, but there was little hard data yet   available to judge the severity of unfolding events  Since then we have gotten considerable   information that indicates that we have on hand a steep and rapid decline that may be starting to feed   on itself in a vicious cycle It’s not a pretty picture   It continues to be my view that monetary policy played a crucial and appropriate role in   the economy over the first half of the year  But we have now entered a period when its influence   will be subordinate to the unfolding of other events, political and military, domestic and   international, and how they impact on net with the psyche of the American consumer  Our challenge   today is to identify how monetary policy can most usefully assist in assuring a positive outcome, and   that will be discussed shortly  This will be an interesting exercise because even if everyone had   precisely the same view of the economic outlook, several different policy prescriptions can be seen   as the best way to go   Although fiscal actions under consideration have been discussed earlier by several around   the table, please let me make a brief comment on the expectations that a temporary investment tax   incentive may induce a significant early spurt in capital investment  Obviously, such a tax break is   quite attractive and tempting  However, given the present environment of extremely low capacity     11/6/01 69   utilization, rising unemployment, and weakening demand, this gambit may prove disappointing    Beyond whatever level of capital spending will occur regardless of events, a great many firms,    especially the smaller ones that constitute half or more of the nation’s production, are likely to   conclude that attractive as this incentive may be, they simply cannot afford to acquire nonessential   additional capacity when their existing capacity is so underutilized and the outlook is so uncertain    Larger and stronger companies who have more maneuvering room in managing their capital   structure are better candidates to accelerate their investments  However, they may wait and see until   the last minute before the incentive sunsets before making major discretionary commitments  If that   day is in the second half of 2004 it may come too late to be of much help, as the tale of the economic   recovery will by then have long since been told  If the economy is rebounding, they will be   investing anyway and the incentive would be unnecessary  If the economy is still in the doldrums at   that time, this incentive is unlikely to smoke them out, and policymakers will be searching for   stronger medicine  Thank you    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    I think the word “necessary” is good  "
