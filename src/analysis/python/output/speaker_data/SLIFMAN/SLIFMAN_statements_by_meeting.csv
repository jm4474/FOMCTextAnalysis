584,1989-08-22," What the Chairman said is correct There is the issue of whether or not the claim is accepted; then it shows up in the ongoing benefits But the BLS in most instances knows who's filing the claim, so they can sort of monitor these things since it's an administrative count And they normally will note it, as the Chairman has said   Clearly, if that were the case, under those circumstances we would have to do something that was a combination of a [net] change for all other items and then worry about the level of inventory investment It turns out, however, that in this instance that's not really the case   So it's not a problem this time "

2533,1995-08-22," Let me add just one other comment that works in the other direction There are other changes that BEA is considering implementing over the next several years One in particular that would work the other way would be the inclusion of software as final output At present, when software is not bundled with the computer, it is counted as an intermediate product If output of software has been growing faster than other output, that would push up ""true"" output growth There are some other things that are service-related where BEA is planning to implement new procedures to try to get a better handle on service output, such as this issue with software Those things won't be reflected in the next benchmark this December, but they will be reflected in the following benchmark revision In fact, it may well be that productivity is growing faster and that we just are not measuring output properly   Only in the most recent quarters The statistical discrepancy doesn't have a particular trend to it   In the most recent couple of quarters   I don't think that's a trend phenomenon "
4945,2003-05-06,"  I don’t think so  We’ll look into that issue       I don’t have a good answer for you  We’ll have to look into it   May 6, 2003 23 of 115   "
