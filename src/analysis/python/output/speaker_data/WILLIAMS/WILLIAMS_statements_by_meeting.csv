151,1976-08-17,"  Yes  Is there any steam left in the consumer?  The inflation rate’s gone  down the last three quarters, particularly the unanticipated or surprise inflation rate, which     8/17/76 - 17 -    should contribute to a decline in the personal saving rate  And also we know that consumer  sentiment seems to be up  Do you see further steam left in the consumer part of the recovery?    Yes, we would support alternative B  We’d like to see an expansion in  the band of the federal funds rate, may be out to 1-1/2 percentage points  And I would certainly  support Governor Coldwell’s [recommendation of] taking a close look at the reduction in the  reserve requirements with respect to the membership policy  "
237,1976-11-16,"  As we see the same softness in retail sales, we have one unique feature  in California; we have experienced a drought, at least until the last weekend or so  We have  [had] summer continuously through November, and this is resulting in [unsold] goods that would  normally be sold as weather changes in the fall    We see the same softness that the others see in retail sales  One unique  feature in California has been the weather--we have been experiencing a drought  We’ve had  summer weather practically through the present time except until the last weekend  Several of  the retail stores have mentioned [that] they have stocked goods for fall and winter that are not  moving at all  One other feature that one of our directors mentioned, which is a very good short- term indicator--corrugated containers and envelope stocks have dropped rather precipitously in  the last 35 days, and this is usually a good indicator of business conditions  This has really  changed in the last month    This would be the orders that they are receiving from buyers    We would favor a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the discount rate   This could probably be done in two steps of 1/4 each  We think this would give a better  alignment with the federal funds rate, and it would also give a lift to business expectations  We  would also support a slight easing of policy  We think that this can be done under the  established or the existing ranges rather than changing the ranges  We would favor alternative B,  although we could support alternative B as modified by Chairman Burns  "
732,1978-04-18,"  Our directors would agree with Mark Willes and Phil Jackson in that they  are very concerned about inflation  They are very concerned about the large government deficit  and the lack of concern of some in Washington about this deficit  Also, our staff would agree with  Henry that the March 62 percent unemployment rate places us within the zone of a fully employed  labor force, which I think is a little bit different from the staff [view]  I also want to ask a question  about the unprecedented growth of consumer debt and whether this will have a dampening effect  on consumer spending over the next few months      Thank you      Yes, we would advocate staying with the current ranges      I don’t think there is any big advantage one way or the other  However,  monetary policy is a consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee and, therefore, we would  urge the consensus view--provided you use the name Balles rather than Williams if they ask you  the name!      I have a feeling that I may be getting in over my head, but we voted today  to maintain the same long-run target ranges  M1 and M2 have been within those long-run targets  and, therefore, I have trouble figuring out why we don’t set the same short-run targets that we have  for the long-run targets       4/18/78             45    No    "
1111,1979-06-27, We would agree with Frank Moms’s position that there’s a fair  case for suggesting that we should [orient] our policy on the side of ease We would [build on  the action] that we took at the last FOMC meeting  
1158,1979-07-17," Yes, Mr Chairman With respect to reactions to the President's speech, I would agree with what Ernie Baughman has just said With respect to monetary policy, we would agree very strongly with Frank Morris and Bob Black that we ought to stand pat at the present time We would suggest that if there is a move for raising [interest rates] that the discount rate be raised before the fed funds rate [because] it's 75 to 80 points below the funds rate and raising the discount rate would have the announcement effect without tightening the financial markets [unintelligible] "
1180,1979-07-19," Yes, I would agree with Tom Gainor that for all the reasons stated we should go to 10-1/2 percent on fed funds and move the discount rate up to 10 or 10-1/4 percent "
1295,1979-10-22, We would certainly agree with the Chairman’s  recommendations Dave Eastburn clearly set forth our views and we  would support everything Dave said We would also agree with Larry  Roos about the announcement of targets  
7000,2002-01-29,"  Under the Taylor rule, policymakers would need to weigh the  deterioration in economic performance associated with the zero bound against the  benefits of lower inflation in establishing an overall price objective  And to be sure,  not all of those benefits are captured by the model  The existence of a tradeoff raises  the question of whether there are other ways to design policy so as to mitigate the  effects of the zero bound in a low inflation environment  That is the subject of your  next exhibit   According to previous research, policies that are more responsive to fluctuations  in output than the Taylor rule do a better job of stabilizing the economy; modestly  increasing the responsiveness of the funds rate to deviations in inflation from its  target also appears beneficial  There are two aspects to this advantage  First, such  rules reduce the probability that inflation will be well below its target if and when a  major disturbance hits the economy, and thus they essentially take away one of the  ingredients of a deflationary spiral  A second advantage of such rules is that they  reduce the funds rate quickly when the economy weakens, thereby limiting the  severity of major downturns, again reducing the risk of deflation   The middle table puts some numerical magnitudes on these advantages  For this  exercise, we assume that the more responsive rule reacts twice as strongly to  movements in the output gap as the standard Taylor rule but is the same in its other  dimensions  As can be seen by comparing lines 1 and 2, the more responsive rule  damps fluctuations in unemployment relative to the Taylor rule  And as shown on  lines 3 and 4, the more responsive rule is also more effective at keeping the economy  out of deep recessions In fact, the more responsive rule under a zero inflation target  is able to match or better the performance of the Taylor rule using a higher inflation  target However, as was the case with the Taylor rule, performance under the more  responsive rule drops off noticeably when the target is reduced below 2 percent but  improves little when the target is increased to 4 percent   As noted in the bottom panel, adopting more responsive rules—especially ones  with even greater sensitivity to economic conditions than the rule analyzed here—  brings some potential disadvantages as well  First, the greater responsiveness of  policy to changes in economic conditions implies heightened variability of the fed  funds rate and more frequent policy reversals  Although these differences have no  direct implications for economic performance in the FRB/US analysis, they may be a  cause of concern for reasons not captured by our model  Second, implementing a  more aggressive response to the estimated output gap amplifies the risk and  magnitude of policy mistakes owing to faulty data and mismeasurement of the  economy’s productive capacity  Lastly, because more aggressive rules drive the fed  funds rate quickly to zero when the economy weakens and rates are already low, they  increase the risk of triggering a confidence crisis if investors become unnerved                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 15 of 194  whenever the Fed has no more latitude for moving the fed funds rate down further   However, such possible effects on confidence play no role in the FRB/US model    For these reasons, the FOMC might want to consider policies that become more  responsive only when it is in imminent danger of hitting the zero bound  Such  asymmetric responsiveness is the subject of your next exhibit  As described in the  upper panel, to illustrate this idea we consider a policy that under most conditions  follows the standard Taylor rule but that lowers the fed funds rate more quickly when  economic conditions are sufficiently bleak  In particular, we assume that whenever  the standard Taylor rule would prescribe a funds rate below 1 percent, the funds rate  is automatically set to zero  Such a policy has the advantage shared by generally  more responsive rules of quickly bringing to bear the maximum monetary stimulus  possible to offset economic downturns or deflation, thus enhancing average economic  performance  At the same time, the cost of higher interest rate variability and the risk  of policy mistakes are lessened because the greater responsiveness of policy is limited  to episodes of economic distress   The middle table compares economic performance under the asymmetric policy to  that obtained with the Taylor rule  With an inflation target of 4 percent, the Taylor  rule only occasionally prescribes a funds rate below 1 percent, so the overall  performance of the two policies differs little  But with a lower inflation target, the  asymmetric policy mitigates the falloff in performance resulting from the zero bound  without significantly raising the overall variability of the fed funds rate  As shown in  lines 1 and 2, under the asymmetric rule the increase in the variability of the  unemployment rate is less when the inflation target is lowered from 2 percent to zero;  lines 3 and 4 show a similar result for the frequency of deep recessions   As noted in the bottom panel, one possible drawback of the asymmetric rule is  that it may be less transparent  In particular, communicating the nature of such a  policy to investors may be difficult, and the market may have trouble understanding  its full ramifications  This is because an asymmetric policy, unlike the Taylor rule or  similar strategies, does not always respond to economic conditions in the same  manner  Thus, the private sector might mistakenly interpret a sudden drop in the fed  funds rate as a temporary aberration rather than a systematic aspect of the rule  This  transparency problem could prevent the rule’s benefits from materializing if investors  do not correctly incorporate the implications of asymmetric behavior into their  expectations, in particular by pricing into bond yields the greater probability of a zero  funds rate during economic slowdowns   Your next exhibit considers another strategy for mitigating the effects of the zero  bound This approach, unlike the strategies that we have discussed so far, responds  not only to current inflation but also takes into account past deviations of inflation  from target  A key feature of such a strategy is that it involves a promise to keep the  funds rate unusually low following an episode in which the zero bound constrains  policy One specific example of this approach is price-level targeting, in which  policy is set so that the price level rather than the inflation rate fluctuates around a                         January 29-30, 2002 Page 16 of 194  predetermined target path  Under price-level targeting, investors expect that any  shortfall of the price level from its target will be made up later, so that a period of low  inflation will be followed by an offsetting period of high inflation, and vice versa       Policies that promise above-average future rates of inflation create the expectation  that the future stance of monetary policy will be relatively easy for a time  Thus,  even with the funds rate presently constrained at zero, this expectation about future  policy contributes to expectations of higher future inflation and relatively low funds  rates As a result, real bond rates fall today and stimulate real activity  This effect on  expectations thus reduces the severity of recessions and lowers the danger of  deflation Such policies have attracted a great deal of attention by some researchers  and have been advocated as a possible strategy for the Bank of Japan in its current  situation Model-based research, including work carried out using the FRB/US  model, finds that under the assumptions of rational expectations and perfect policy  credibility, these policies can be very effective in reducing the stabilization costs  associated with the zero bound     However, the effectiveness of such policies depends crucially on that  credibility—on investors’ expectations being consistent with the promised policy   Under certain conditions, investors may doubt whether policymakers will in fact carry  through on their pledge For example, the public may question whether policymakers  would really actively seek to bring about high inflation following a period of low  inflation, or vice versa, rather than being satisfied with just stabilizing the inflation  rate at the long-run target If investors don’t believe the promise, then real bond rates  will not come down, and therefore such strategies will be ineffective at mitigating the  effects of the zero bound   Your final exhibit lists the main lessons from this line of research  First, in a very  low inflation environment, the nominal funds rate can be expected to hit zero  relatively frequently But in general, such an event is not an insurmountable problem  The economy usually recovers despite the constraint on policy because most  economic disturbances are sufficiently transitory and modest in magnitude  That  said, if deflation sets in, the ability of the economy to recover can be jeopardized   Funds-rate-based monetary policies can mitigate the effects of the zero bound in  several ways—by not pursuing too low a rate of average inflation, by responding  relatively aggressively to changes in economic conditions, and by promising higher  inflation down the road in the event that the funds rate gets stuck at zero  Finally, it  pays to stimulate the economy aggressively when the probability of hitting the zero  bound is high; at least from the perspective of the FRB/US model, there is no  advantage in “keeping your powder dry” That concludes our prepared remarks      One point that Dave raised that is crucial in thinking about model-  based analysis is that we are using an estimated model on thirty-five years of data during which   we have not seen a period when the zero bound was a constraint  Nonlinearities may pop up        January 29-30, 2002 Page 26 of 194  during recessions for short periods of time but are not a dominant feature of the data in terms of   their average behavior  So we really are pushing the envelope a bit with respect to what a model   can do And we recognize that One of the questions that people often ask in thinking about this   is, Are we getting enough recessions, or is our model too stable?  And in fact, as Dave mentioned   and as we described in our paper, we get some whopper recessions or depressions in this model    The shocks that we have in our simulations I don’t think grossly overstate or understate the risks   to economic performance  But whether the economy would behave as the FRB/US or any other   model predicts in a situation like that, we just don’t know, in large part because we just don’t   have that experience to incorporate into the model    To be clear on the analysis that we did in our paper and that we talked   about here today, running at that higher inflation rate was really just to repair the damage that   had occurred because of the zero bound  So whether or not we had inflation or deflation didn’t   determine what we did  If inflation were below where you would have had it for your policy rule   because of the zero bound, you would offset that through an easier policy for a while  So your   average inflation would still be right, but you would not be inflating just to inflate      I’d like to respond to a couple of comments you made regarding how   the model was simulated, just so I can clarify a few points          January 29-30, 2002 Page 36 of 194   With regard to the assumption of rational expectations, what we did in   the paper and in what we reported today was to assume rational expectations, meaning that the   expectations people form are those of the model  We also assumed that fiscal policy comes in   aggressively after five years to stop a “great depression” from occurring or at least to limit the   damage  One of the implications of that is that after five years the zero bound is not constraining   policy anymore  Basically, fiscal policy is replacing monetary policy; that’s the way we think of   it So in your example, you could think of the zero bound in play for five years, affecting the   five-year bond completely  But the ten-year bond would have five years for which it wasn’t   affected, and the thirty-year bond obviously would be affected even less  So the way we did this,   when we bring in the fiscal policy I think that is closer to what you consider a more reasonable   way of thinking about this—that it would only be going on for about five years    The expectations are still rational in the sense that, if we had deflation   for five years, say, the inflation rate would start coming back to zero gradually depending on the   quantity dynamics  It wouldn’t jump to zero, but it would come back gradually    Right, and that would depend on whatever your target was  So with   regard to what happens in the “great depression” scenarios, it’s clear that our FRB/US model   breaks down under conditions such as a 25 percent unemployment rate  Again, with fiscal policy   coming in, the rescue package avoids these situations generally  Our analysis has few of those     January 29-30, 2002 Page 37 of 194  events occurring and, one could say, “contaminating” our results  In our paper I believe we   reported that with a zero inflation target, we would have a major depression once every century   or so So I think that addresses those two questions   On the quantity effects, it’s true that what we are saying is that if quantity effects don’t   matter—the monetary base doesn’t matter—this is what the problem would be  Clearly, if one   were to layer on the effects that Marvin was talking about, that could lessen or change the results   we would get I would note that at the Vermont Woodstock Conference, Ben McCallum looked   at the question of how big the quantity effects would be, and his conclusion was that normally   they wouldn’t be that big But that’s a point that I think one might dispute   "
7774,2005-06-29,"  I’ll be referring to the exhibits beginning on page 26  In my  presentation today, I’ll lay out a few scenarios that illustrate the potential  macroeconomic fallout resulting from a significant decline in house prices, and I will  examine policy responses that minimize it     I’ll start by describing the possible size of the current problem—assuming there  is one As pointed out in Dick Peach’s presentation, there are serious difficulties in  accurately measuring both actual and “fundamental” house prices  But, for the  purposes of my presentation, I will take as a working hypothesis that house prices  are high relative to fundamentals—or, in terms of the decision tree that Glenn just  laid out, I assume that the answer to his question 1 is “Yes, the asset price appears  misaligned” As Josh Gallin indicated, it would take up to a 20 percent decline in  house prices to bring the price-to-rent ratio back in line with fundamentals  With  housing wealth standing at around $18 trillion today, such a drop in house prices  would extinguish $36 trillion of household wealth  That’s equal to about 30 percent  of GDP  Based on a marginal propensity to consume from housing wealth of 3½  cents on the dollar, this decline in wealth would entail a nearly 1½ percentage point  increase in the personal saving rate  And, according to estimates from the FRB/US  model, it implies a 40 basis point reduction in the long-run neutral real funds rate   It may be useful to put these figures into context by comparing them to those  associated with the stock market overvaluation reached in early 2000  Stock prices                                                        June 29-30, 2005 18 of 234  at that time were arguably some 50 to 70 percent overvalued  Correction of prices to  fundamentals at that time would have implied a reduction in household wealth of  $67 trillion, equal to about 70 percent of contemporaneous GDP  In the event, stock  market wealth fell by $46 trillion between March 2000 and March 2001, and at its  lowest point was down $85 trillion  There is considerable uncertainty regarding the  magnitude of the effects of changes in stock market and housing wealth on  household spending; nonetheless, it seems clear the magnitude of the current  potential problem is much smaller than, and perhaps only half as large as, that of the  stock market bubble  Of course, if house prices continue to soar—and in the San  Francisco Bay Area, at least, they show no signs of slowing—the magnitude of the  housing overvaluation problem will rise as well     A cautionary note worth emphasizing is that the monetary policy cushion  available today, as measured by the prevailing federal funds rate, is noticeably  smaller than it was in early 2000 at the peak of the stock market    The first question that comes to mind is What should monetary policy do, if  anything, about the apparent overvaluation in house prices?  The answer to that  depends crucially on the answer to Glenn’s second question “Do bubble  fluctuations result in large macroeconomic consequences that monetary policy  cannot readily offset?”  Therefore, I now explore the effects of a bubble collapse and  the ability of policy to respond effectively to them     I consider three scenarios in which a housing bubble deflates relatively quickly  I use the FRB/US model to quantify these effects  Note that for the materials posted  last Wednesday, I based my simulations on the April Greenbook projection  I have  since updated the simulations, and the ones that I will be showing today are based on  the extended June Greenbook projection  In each scenario, I assume that house  prices fall by 20 percent relative to the baseline over the next 2½ years   In the first two scenarios, I consider the effects of exogenous declines in house  prices that apparently come “out of the blue;” the third scenario considers the  possibility of an interrelated decline in both bond and house prices  For each  scenario, I consider two types of monetary policy response  The first is the optimal  perfect foresight policy that is very similar to those reported in past Bluebooks  The  path of policy is chosen to minimize the sum of the squared deviations of the  unemployment rate and the core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price  inflation rate from their respective targets and the squared changes in the funds rate,  with the latter receiving relatively little weight  Perfect foresight means that the  policymaker today has advance knowledge of all future shocks to the economy  I  assume that the inflation objective is 1½ percent and that the unemployment rate  target is 5 percent, equal to the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU [non-accelerating  inflation rate of unemployment]  The second policy is one that responds only to  events as they occur and does not respond directly to anticipated future  developments related to house prices  For this purpose, I use a modified version of  the Taylor rule, with a coefficient of 1 on the output gap and of ½ on the inflation                                                       June 29-30, 2005 19 of 234  gap, and with the long-run natural rate of interest that appears in the rule varying in  accord with sustained changes in housing wealth and bond premiums   The second page of my exhibit shows the results from model simulations of a  20 percent decline in house prices, where only the standard channels included in the  FRB/US model are in play  For comparison, I have also plotted the baseline paths,  based on the June extended Greenbook projection but modified under the  assumption that monetary policy is set optimally in the way I just described   Because a decline in house prices primarily influences demand, not supply, it does  not pose a difficult tradeoff between policy goals  In addition, according to the  model, the macroeconomic effects play out gradually and are moderate in  magnitude, giving policy time to respond  The optimal policy calls for a path for the  funds rate that averages about 3¼ percent during 2007 and 2008—about 40 basis  points below the baseline path  Under this policy, the unemployment and inflation  rates are nearly the same as in the baseline  The very small rise in inflation reflects  the effects of the depreciation of the dollar resulting from the reduction in domestic  interest rates   The modified Taylor rule is able to mimic the outcomes under the optimal  policy reasonably well, indicating that policy need not fully anticipate future house- price declines to be effective, but can simply respond to events as they unfold  Note  that if the house-price decline were larger (or the marginal propensity to consume  out of housing wealth bigger), then the policy implication would simply be to cut  rates by proportionally more      In summary, assuming that the FRB/US model does a good job of capturing the  macroeconomic implications of declining house prices, such an event does not pose  a particularly difficult challenge for monetary policy  One lingering concern,  however, is that the model may be missing other important avenues by which large  movements in house prices affect the economy  I now consider a scenario that  entertains that possibility     In the second scenario, I incorporate extra-model spillovers from falling house  prices, presumably reflecting a decline in confidence and an extinguishing of  household spending that had been fueled by equity extraction from mortgage  refinancing, as described in the “heightened spending response” simulation reported  in the June Greenbook  Importantly, the demand spillovers are assumed to have a  very different dynamic from the model’s standard wealth effect They kick in much  more rapidly and eventually dissipate so that they have no long-run effects  As  shown in the next page of the exhibit, owing to the extra drag from these spillovers,  the optimal policy calls for a series of rate cuts, bringing the funds rate to 2¼ percent  by the middle of next year  The funds rate does not again reach 3 percent until the  spring of 2007 The optimal policy is able to stem the rise in unemployment that  would otherwise occur at the cost of a modest and short-lived uptick in inflation                                                    June 29-30, 2005 20 of 234  The Taylor rule, however, is not as successful  It fails to anticipate the spillover  effects and responds too timidly once they occur  Still, it contains the rise in  unemployment to only about ½ percentage point above baseline and moves inflation  slightly more rapidly toward the assumed inflation objective  I should note that,  given the uncertainty regarding the size and timing of such spillovers, the ideal  outcome in the optimal policy simulation exaggerates the real-world ability of  monetary policy to offset the effects of such shocks   As I noted before, the thought experiment behind these first two sets of  simulations is that house prices fall in a kind of vacuum, without any relationship to  other events  Some commentators have argued that the current high level of house  prices is the outcome of a history of very low interest rates and past house-price  appreciation that has given rise to irrationally optimistic expectations of future  appreciation  Indeed, a simple estimated equation relating the current price-to-rent  ratio to the user cost of housing and past house-price appreciation does a reasonably  good job of explaining much of the run-up in house prices over the past several  years  If this explanation holds water, a potential risk to housing prices and the  outlook in general lies in the path of longer-term interest rates—which have been  surprisingly low, given prevailing economic conditions—and the usual behavior of  term premiums  Bond yields could return to more normal levels and in so doing  contribute to a downward trajectory in house prices    I explore such a possibility in the final scenario, which builds on Scenario 2,  and is the subject of the next page of my exhibit  I now add the assumption that the  term premiums on long-term bonds rise by 75 basis points, relative to baseline, over  the second half of this year and remain at these levels  This aspect of the scenario is  similar to an alternative scenario reported in the June Greenbook  This shock to  bond premiums by itself reduces the long-term equilibrium real funds rate by about  70 basis points  Optimal policy calls for the funds rate to fall below 1 percent by the  middle of next year and for the funds rate to remain below 3 percent through 2008   The optimal policy is just able to contain the rise in unemployment without  confronting the zero bound  The Taylor rule, on the other hand, responds too  gradually to events, and, as a result, the unemployment rate reaches 6 percent in  early 2007   This scenario presents a difficult challenge for monetary policy, especially in  light of the looming zero lower bound on interest rates under the optimal policy   More generally, it highlights that the risks posed by a house-price decline are  magnified if they occur in tandem with other events that damp economic activity       In addition, as Glenn mentioned, a house-price misalignment may misallocate  resources to housing-related activities  These conditions suggest considering  Glenn’s question 3, whether an alternative policy is needed that aims to deflate a  house-price overvaluation before it grows too large—the subject of the next page of  my exhibit  The potential effectiveness of such a preemptive policy, however, is less  than clear The basic empirical relationship between house prices, interest rates, and                                                    June 29-30, 2005 21 of 234  other factors, upon which such a policy necessarily would rely, is imperfectly  understood and may have changed over time  Moreover, as seen in the earlier  presentations, there remains considerable uncertainty over the degree of  overvaluation  Thus, the successful use of monetary policy to reduce the magnitude  of a misalignment of house prices would be a daunting task, even assuming that such   a goal were deemed desirable  This concludes our prepared remarks      In the optimal policy simulations, from the beginning of the simulations,   which is the third quarter of this year, you know the entire future path of house prices and any other   shocks that I add  So you are acting in anticipation of those future price changes    That’s correct  That’s why I was trying to compare it with the Taylor   rule—which doesn’t have that aspect of responding to developments as they unfold—to see how   well that would do    All I’m doing is the latter—reducing the overall housing wealth by 20   percent relative to the base    In terms of the FRB/US model, the only way that house prices and   housing wealth enter is through the aggregate                                           June 29-30, 2005 39 of 234   So, one of the shortcomings, even of a model with several hundred   equations, is that it doesn’t have the distribution effects    I think that the Greenbook forecast, as I understand it—and maybe Dave   should talk about this—is predicated on a particular assumption about the future path of housing                                                       June 29-30, 2005 43 of 234  prices and takes into account the kind of models that Josh was discussing  The staff looks at all the   empirical evidence, just as they do for every equation on every aspect of the economy  So,   monetary theory would tell you to come up with the best, most reasonable forecast and adopt a   policy that is appropriate to that path but also consider, as you’re saying, all the risks and the   distribution of the risks  It’s along the lines of some of the charts in the Greenbook, which show the   distribution of risks and then contemplate the implications for the current set of policy options over   that distribution of risks    I think the basic idea in the economic literature is that you first want to get a very reasonable   path, and that would be more or less your baseline  It’s not a path, I should say, that just keeps   housing prices constant or keeps any asset price constant  It should be the best forecast of these   asset prices that you can come up with, but subject, of course, to the fact that these are very hard to   predict     That would be the standard policy    Right  The Taylor rule would just be one example, of course, of a policy   that takes into account the information you have up to that point  It’s not optimal in some sense    It’s just a simple equation  It does represent this wait-and-see approach  I was using the optimal   policy to illustrate what you would do if you knew everything  It’s kind of a comparison                                              June 29-30, 2005 44 of 234   In fact, the third scenario that I considered involved trying to emphasize   that point—namely that, at least by some measures that people have come up with, there is a big   difference in where bond rates are relative to standard estimates of fundamentals  It’s actually a   much bigger problem for the economy than just the house-price effect directly, at least according to   the FRB/US model  More importantly, it could be one of the factors driving a big part of the house-  price appreciation In terms of needing strong house prices to keep the economy moving, the way I   view your third question is that if it weren’t for the house-price run-up, monetary policy would need   to be easier, given current economic conditions  And I think that’s absolutely right   One way to think about my scenarios is just to reverse the signs, especially in scenarios 1   and 2, and think about it as this as the positive stimulus we’ve gotten from a 20 percent appreciation   of housing prices and this is the positive effect we’ve gotten from some other factors  Especially   scenario 1, I think you can see that way   The reason I mentioned the misallocation of resources toward housing-related activities in   my presentation is that in quite a bit of the economic academic research about bubbles, the emphasis                                        June 29-30, 2005 57 of 234  is that they actually lead to, as Glenn mentioned, a misallocation of resources  Therefore, these gaps   between fundamental prices and actual prices should appear in the policymaker’s objective function,   in addition to inflation, output and employment  So there is a notion here that that’s just another   problem that you would want to balance off if you could     Now, I’d like to emphasize in my closing remarks that the assumption that you could affect   the bubble is very problematic  As Josh himself mentioned, these relationships between housing   prices and interest rates are just not as strong as one would think and not as strong as economic   theory would suggest  "
9188,2011-03-15,"  I’ve been around long enough to know the tune  “It’s a Small   World”  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is a great honor and privilege to be   here  My immediate predecessors in this seat left big shoes to fill, both in terms of intellect and   wit  Regarding the latter, I expect I will fall well short in my ability to integrate references to   cultural icons like Lady Gaga into our discussions  I do promise, however, to keep my   comments about control undergarments to the bare minimum  [Laughter]   The intermeeting data have been mixed  On the positive side, the ISM survey has been   very strong, especially in manufacturing, and auto sales surprised to the upside  The drop in the   unemployment rate over the past three months has also been very encouraging  On the   downside, real GDP growth, both the last quarter and the current quarter, now look to be about   ½ percentage point weaker than we were expecting at the time of our last meeting  A portion of   this downgrade may be due to unseasonably bad weather  Still, my business contacts express   little enthusiasm about the pace of spending  Consumers appear very cautious about buying   certain big-ticket items, such as furniture and appliances, in part because rising gasoline prices   are draining their purchasing power and undermining their confidence  Looking ahead, we   trimmed our forecast for GDP growth this year by about ½ percentage point to about 3½ percent    This downward revision reflects the somewhat more subdued tone of recent data and also the   greater likelihood of near-term fiscal restraint from the recent spike in oil prices   March 15, 2011 50 of 165              Fiscal retrenchment is evident in all levels of government  State and local governments   have cut employment and compensation and increased taxes  And at the federal level, the   budgetary endgame is not at all clear, but recent developments point to a bit less fiscal impetus,   and deeper cuts and even a temporary government shutdown cannot be ruled out   The other notable factor restraining economic growth is the jump in oil prices  Various   estimates using a range of methodologies suggest that the recent rise in oil prices will reduce real   GDP growth this year by a few tenths of 1 percentage point  Indeed, the consensus on these   estimated effects is one of the very few things that macroeconomists appear to agree on  Given   the ongoing turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East, there is a risk of another jump in oil   prices, which of course would further slow the recovery  On inflation, increases in oil prices are   causing a sizable bump in the headline rate, but I don’t expect that to last for long or leave much   of an imprint on core inflation  Again, the research literature is in remarkable agreement that oil   price shocks have a minimal effect on core inflation in the post-Volcker period  President   Evans’s memo, which I greatly appreciate, confirms this   Another potential concern on the inflation front comes from rising non-oil import prices    Indeed, my business contacts all tell me they expect sizable increases in prices of imports,   especially from China this year  They also say that they will try to pass on these increases to   consumers, although their conviction on this wavers regarding whether they will be able to make   these increases stick, given the weak economy  In any case, it is important to remember that   imports account for only about 13 percent of the value of total consumption based on input-  output relationships  Perhaps more surprisingly, imports from China account for only 2 percent   of US consumption  Even for clothing and shoes, which are very import-intensive, only one-  third of value added is imported  The rest is domestic factors, including distribution and retailing   March 15, 2011 51 of 165              margins  So despite the increases in non-oil import prices, with 87 percent of consumption   reflecting domestic factors—notably, US labor compensation—I don’t anticipate that we will   be importing a significant sustained rise in inflation  Instead, we revised our core inflation   projection up only modestly over the forecast horizon  This revision primarily reflects a   projected lower path for the unemployment rate going forward, and, therefore, somewhat less   slack   Following the discussion of structural unemployment last time, my staff has reexamined   the benefits of using slack to forecast inflation  This question has been a subject of considerable   analysis and debate, both in research journals and at this table, of course  Resource utilization is   difficult to measure, and in normal times the effects of output or unemployment gaps on inflation   are frequently dominated by other factors, such as supply shocks  But in the current   circumstances, when utilization rates are far below normal, the effects of slack, I think, are more   evident  One way to gauge the importance of slack is to compare the forecast performance of   forecasters who use slack with those that do not  My staff has done just that, using the fact that   respondents to the Survey of Professional Forecasters report whether or not they use a NAIRU   concept in forecasting inflation  For the past three years, SPF forecasters who do use a NAIRU   have been about 30 percent more accurate in forecasting core inflation than the forecasters who   don’t  This accuracy advantage is consistent with research presented by Jim Stock and Mark   Watson at last year’s Jackson Hole conference  They show that measures of slack do help   forecast inflation after recessions  And given the significant amount of slack in the economy   today, I expect core inflation to remain low, averaging slightly above 1 percent this year and   next  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  We’re still falling   well short on both parts of our dual mandate, and I expect that that situation will continue for   quite some time  Therefore, the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy remains   entirely appropriate  The recent oil supply shocks don’t fundamentally change this calculus    This conclusion is illustrated by the very small funds rate responses to the oil and commodity   price shocks reported in President Evans’s memo, as well as other research using alternative   methods  Of course, the success of this strategy is dependent crucially on maintaining well-  anchored inflation expectations, and in the current circumstances, then, it’s important to note   there are still no signs that the rise in headline inflation is spilling over in any significant degree   to underlying price or wage inflation or into longer-run inflation expectations  Of course, as   many of you have already noted, we must watch these developments very closely and be ready to   adjust policy as needed   I very much like the wording President Kocherlakota came up with  I do have a slight   tweak to that  If you look to the phrase—let me see if I can read this right—“but it will pay close   attention to the evolution of overall inflation and inflation expectations,” given that we’ve gotten   rid of the “core” idea, I would suggest deleting the word “overall” there    And finally, I am opposed to excessive fussiness myself, so I do not   see the benefits, really, of the tapering    Can I ask a clarifying question?  Is this just about the two-day   meetings?    I think that’s what I was asking  "
9213,2011-04-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, would like to commend the staff on   their memo  It was very helpful in thinking about many of the practical issues involved in   implementing an exit strategy  I think these are very difficult issues  I have been listening to   each person who has gone before me, and I completely agree with the importance of flexibility   and with the principles that should be guiding the policy  Many of the thoughts that people have   already expressed I agree with, although I come to slightly different conclusions  I am actually,   in the end, going to be closer to President Kocherlakota in my views, but I think these are very   fine differences, and these are just difficult issues in terms of communication  I think we have to   recognize that going forward   In approaching the questions, I too found it useful to focus on what I thought of as the   underlying principles of what we’re aiming to do  To me, the most important consideration in   designing our exit strategy is to get the timing right in terms of the macroeconomic objectives   that we have  Obviously, we have the long-run objective of normalizing our balance sheet  But   in terms of the details of sequencing, I think that saying when to begin redemptions or drain   reserves or exactly how this is structured should not obscure or hinder our pursuit of the   appropriate policy stance   Now, in thinking about the different choices, I think the evidence shows that the effects   of the LSAPs depend on the expectations of the future size and composition of our balance sheet    That’s where I start from in terms of thinking about how this works  I view reducing the size of   April 26–27, 2011 51 of 244              our balance sheet as working through the same basic channels on the economy as increases in the   funds rate, and I see these as being substitutes in terms of the macroeconomy  I also agree with   President Kocherlakota’s point that both redemptions and sales affect the size of our balance   sheet, and I tend to think of those together as opposed to separately  However, there are some   critical differences that make these instruments imperfect substitutes in practice  They have   already been mentioned  I’ll briefly go through two of them  Although our recent experience   has provided us with a much better understanding of the effects of the LSAPs than we had just a   few years ago, there is still a great deal of uncertainty around these effects  I think the   uncertainties about the effects of changing LSAPs far exceed those of comparable movements in   the fed funds rate, and this high degree of uncertainty suggests, per the Brainard conservatism   principle, that we should follow a cautious and gradual approach to changing the balance sheet   going forward   Second, compared with the fed funds rate, the public still has limited experience and   understanding regarding the use of the balance sheet as a policy instrument  This suggests that   an active use of the balance sheet, as suggested in option 2, would face greater communication   challenges and risks of confusing markets, compared with using the funds rate as our principal   policy instrument  These considerations, along with the operational constraints, in terms of the   maximum size of asset sales, argue for a steady path of reducing our balance sheet that is   preannounced and well communicated  I don’t like the word “deterministic” because it   obviously could change in response to conditions  But there should be a relatively high hurdle to   modifying the path  I think this approach leaves the fed funds rate as a primary instrument of   adjusting the stance of policy either up or down in response to change in economic conditions   April 26–27, 2011 52 of 244              This brings me to another consideration in sequencing the exit strategy  the fact that the   short rate is currently constrained by the zero lower bound  To me, this argues for holding off on   shrinking our balance sheet until the short rate is well away from the zero bound so that we have   the needed flexibility to add accommodation through a rate cut if economic conditions warrant    Again, I’m thinking that the fed funds rate is the primary instrument that you move up and down   in response to a change in conditions  So, in this way, I think I would prefer to begin the process   of shrinking the balance sheet, both in terms of redemptions and in terms of sales, only after we   have instituted a few rate hikes, as envisioned in option 1   Let me go through the specific questions quickly  On number 1, again, I’ve viewed   redemptions in the same way as asset sales, so I would actually prefer to hold off on any   reinvestments until after we raise the funds rate  On number 2, I prefer a path of asset sales that   is preannounced and well communicated  And on 3, my view is that we want to lift off the zero   lower bound first in order to regain the flexibility to use that instrument as appropriate before we   begin asset sales  On number 4, I thought that was an apple pie question, and I’m all for apple   pie, so I agree with all of the statements in number 4  [Laughter]  I am in favor of eventually   returning to an all-Treasuries portfolio with a corridor operating framework  Thank you    And basically thinking of it symmetrically with asset sales    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, we’ve heard a lot about   disappointing news on the economy  There was some good news that baseball’s regular season   has begun  And as you all know from reports from John Moore, we follow very carefully the   relationship between the US economy and how the San Francisco Giants perform on the field    Unfortunately, like the US economy, the Giants got off to a lackluster start so far this year, but   these early stumbles haven’t yet caused me to change my assessment that they’ll both perform   well for the remainder of the year   The recent economic data and the anecdotes I hear from my business contacts have   generally fallen short of expectations in terms of economic activity and suggest upside risks to   inflation  Nonetheless, I still see a moderate recovery in train, with underlying inflation   remaining low  The open question is whether my optimism, both regarding the Giants and the   economy, reflects an accurate reading of fundamentals or just a form of denial  [Laughter]   April 26–27, 2011 126 of 244              Overall, my projection is very similar to that in the Tealbook, with the unemployment   rate falling only gradually over this year and next, and headline and core PCE price index   inflation dipping back down to around 1¼ percent next year as the effects of the surge in   commodity prices recede  I’ll focus my remaining remarks on just two issues  One is the   disappointing tone of recent data that David Wilcox commented on, and the other is the   implications of price increases of oil and other commodities   First, like the Board staff and most private forecasters—I am taking from what I’ve heard   so far from most people here—we have significantly revised down our forecasts for the first   quarter in response to the weaker-than-expected incoming data but have left our medium-term   forecast largely intact  For me a key question is whether these data might be signaling   significantly less underlying strength in the economy than we’re expecting  In this regard—and   this may be different from what President Lockhart reported—I am struck by how pessimistic   and cautious my business contacts sound these days—much more downbeat than a month ago,   let alone at the beginning of the year  Indeed, they speak of a crisis of confidence among   households who see gasoline prices going up, up, and up, and who everyday read tales of   sovereign default, nuclear meltdown, and war  One homebuilder says he sees no shortage of   qualified, interested buyers, but they are afraid to pull the trigger; they worry that if they lose   their job, they won’t find a new one   So far, despite the angst I sense from my contacts, I am sticking to the story that the   recent data have been a temporary aberration and that the pace of recovery should get back on   track  In this assessment, I am encouraged by the continued gains in payrolls in the   manufacturing sector and the resilience of consumer spending in the face of significant increases   in food and energy prices  And even though lending conditions still appear relatively tight,   April 26–27, 2011 127 of 244              overall financial conditions have continued to improve  Still, the weakness in recent data and the   lack of confidence I hear from my business contacts raise a red flag of possible downside risks to   the outlook   Second, prices of oil and other commodities have continued to move up  These are   unwelcome developments both for output and inflation  In terms of output, higher gasoline and   food prices are a drag on household spending  And I’m particularly concerned about how   they’re affecting confidence in line with the crisis-of-confidence views I mentioned earlier   In terms of inflation, rising food and energy prices are pushing headline inflation   uncomfortably high in the first half of this year  I expect that these price increases will leave   some imprint on core inflation  Indeed, my business contacts, very much like President Fisher   said, continued to stress that they expect businesses to try to pass on past cost increases  They   mentioned specifically China and other sources of imported goods, along with energy prices, and   they will continue to try to pass these cost increases on to their customers—in particular, they   mentioned the second half of this year  This is a comment that we have been hearing pretty   consistently for the past few months  I will emphasize, as I think I did last time, that they used   the word “try” in terms of passing this on, given the economic climate, but it is something that   we definitely hear, especially from retailers in our District   But I also expect these effects on underlying inflation, in terms of the inflation rate, will   be transitory, consistent with the academic literature, and President Evans’s recent analysis; here   I was referring to your analysis from the last meeting, but your new analysis would be consistent   with that, too  I’ll highlight two reasons for this expectation of muted second-round effects from   the bump-up in headline inflation under wages or underlying inflation  First, importantly, the   US labor market today is characterized by relatively little real-wage rigidity  And here I am   April 26–27, 2011 128 of 244              thinking about COLAs, or automatic cost-of-living adjustments, or other impediments in the   labor market  Now, this contrasts starkly with many European economies where institutional   features of labor markets likely contribute to real-wage rigidity and the second-round effects of   inflation on wages that were in evidence there  I think the United States is very different from   Europe in this regard, and that’s important in terms of thinking about inflation   Second, inflation expectations, I would say, remain remarkably stable in the United   States, despite the sizable swings in commodity import prices  Admittedly, households’ short-  term inflation expectations surged in the past few months, and this does raise the worry that   workers could try to bargain for higher wages, and that could potentially ignite a wage–price   spiral  I don’t see that as a major risk  Research at the San Francisco Fed has consistently found   that household inflation expectations tend to be overly sensitive to recent data  In particular, as   reported in the Tealbook, household inflation expectations are highly responsive to food and   energy price inflation  Futures prices suggest that the prices of most commodities won’t keep   rising at double-digit rates and will probably stabilize  And based on past patterns, as food and   energy prices stabilize, household inflation expectations should also come down to more normal   levels   In sum, I expect the recovery to remain on course and for underlying inflation to remain   low  But there are numerous risks to this outlook, and I’ll be watching the data carefully,   looking for signs of a shift in the underlying trends, both in terms of output and inflation  Thank   you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  Although we’re   experiencing a bulge in headline inflation—I guess I used “headline”—underlying inflation   remains low, and our forecast is that overall inflation will fall well below desired levels next   year, and I expect significant resource utilization gaps to continue for quite some time    Therefore, the current very accommodative stance in monetary policy remains entirely   appropriate   April 26–27, 2011 176 of 244              In terms of the wording in the statement, I actually like the changes that were made over   the weekend and in the Monday draft  I think it is important to recognize that inflation is above   desired levels currently and explain that we expect that to come down  I would also maintain the   description of longer-term inflation expectations as “stable” rather than “generally stable”  I   think this is an important point, as Bill mentioned  Both survey and market-based measures are   within the ranges that have prevailed over the past decade, and I think we should be careful not   to change the language on something important like this based on what has proven at times to be   volatile data  We see that in the Michigan survey; it popped up, and then it has come back down    We’ve also seen that in the breakeven inflation  So I definitely would keep the word “stable”    Thank you  "
9241,2011-06-21,"  To start, I would like to thank Mike and all of the System staff who   worked on this project, which has been going on for quite some time  I think this work illustrates   June 21–22, 2011 15 of 282              some of the valuable synergies between policy analysis and academic research  I especially   applaud the approach of comparing and contrasting alternative models, which illustrates the   tough modeling choices and tradeoffs that all researchers face when developing models for   policy analysis, and I think, more importantly, provides different perspectives on the economy   and policy   I have two questions for Mike  First, what do you see to be the key advantages or   insights of the DSGE models over, say, FRB/US in thinking about the current situation and the   appropriate stance of policy today?  And my closely-related second question is, what do these   models tell us about the impact of the events of the past three years on potential output—or, in   the parlance of DSGE models, the natural rate of output—and the output gap?   One purported advantage of DSGE models is they provide a theoretical basis for   distinguishing between shocks to supply and demand  Indeed, in many DSGE models, supply   shocks—that’s shocks to preferences and technology—account for a significant share of   economic fluctuations  This distinction between supply and demand shocks is a critical issue for   monetary policy because policy should respond differently, depending on the nature of the   shock  I am particularly curious about the New York Fed’s model, which shows very persistent   effects of the financial crisis on output  In the New York Fed model, does this primarily reflect a   decline in potential output or a very persistent output gap?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m comfortable with this approach  I   actually think it does represent what I heard to be the consensus at the April meeting  I am   sympathetic to the point that Presidents Rosengren and Fisher brought up about being somewhat   uncomfortable with the very specific timing, and I think it’s probably better to stick with the   general principles of the sequencing, and I would agree with removing “probably within a few   months” and the other case where we’re being very specific on timing  I agree with the general   idea of how the sequencing should go, but I will mention just one comment  I think you and we   all will be asked for the rationale behind this particular sequencing of steps  So here we are   agreeing on what the sequence is, but I know that we all will be asked by reporters why we chose   one instead of another, and I think we should have some more discussion, perhaps, about that    I’ll give you one example  This may seem to be a no-brainer to some—maybe I’m just   overthinking this or just not thinking hard enough about this, but I’m still not 100 percent clear   on why reinvestments is the obvious first action out of the blocks  Maybe if we have time at   some point, we could have a discussion about not only what the right sequence is, but also what   the talking points are regarding why this makes the most sense    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The intermeeting data have been   worrisome  The extent of the bad news is starkly evident in the Tealbook projection, which   shows a steep downward revision to growth this year and next—a remarkably large revision for   just two months  Furthermore, despite the deep cuts to the output projection, the Tealbook has   also shifted to a downside skew to the risks of the growth outlook  This combination of a   downward modal revision to the growth forecast and downside risk assessment is a truly   sobering development, but it’s consistent with what we see in financial markets, such as lower   Treasury yields, the faltering stock market, and the rise in high-yield bond spreads since our last   meeting  The key question for the outlook for both output and inflation is how much of the   recent news is transitory and how much reflects more lasting influences, clearly what a number   of you have already been referring to  Now, I agree that many transitory factors have been   working to push down output during the first half of this year  These include unseasonably cold   and snowy winter weather, Japan-related supply disruptions, and the spike in energy costs,   June 21–22, 2011 127 of 282              especially the $4 per gallon gasoline, which I think we still have in California even today    Indeed, my business contacts trace much of the source of the first-half moderation in consumer   spending to this spike in energy prices  They refer to both the direct hit to disposable income,   but also the psychological punch to confidence that staggered consumers  In this regard, the   substantial decline in oil prices and now, more recently, gas prices since our April meeting   should help   I remain stubbornly confident that the economy will bounce back from its recent   stumbles  The recovery appears intact, though with significantly less underlying momentum   than I had previously thought  Like the Tealbook, I expect economic growth to pick up in the   third quarter of this year and to average about 3½ percent over the second half of this year and   next year  With this return to above-trend growth, I expect to see renewed improvement in labor   market conditions   My business contacts provide two notes of optimism  First, my contact at a major   Japanese auto maker reports that the Japanese auto industry is returning output to pre-crisis   levels more quickly than initially estimated  Some plants are already operating at 90 percent of   pre-crisis levels, and they’re expected to be at full capacity shortly  Second, my contacts are   quite enthusiastic about the economic boom developing in Silicon Valley  To give just one   indicator, home prices in the Palo Alto–Cupertino area are up double digits from a year ago    New IPOs for private-share sales for LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media   companies are providing a shower of cash  But we’re nowhere near the craziness of the dotcom   era of the 1990s—well, at least not yet  My contacts stress several important differences   between the current episode and the dotcom bubble  First, any bubble-like exuberance is limited   to a relatively small set of companies, and even these generally have solid customer bases,   June 21–22, 2011 128 of 282              revenues, and in some cases, even profits  For example, Facebook, with reportedly well over   600 million users worldwide, is no Petscom  Furthermore, the broader tech sector, including,   for example, Cisco and Intel, has matured considerably over the past decade  Some of the most   actively traded tech stocks have valuations that seem reasonable, certainly by comparison with   the levels of the dotcom era  Finally, my contacts describe a very different financing   environment  The amount of venture capital in play is on par with its pre-crisis level, well below   the dotcom surge, and a healthy dose of investor skepticism is evident  Importantly, from a   policy perspective, I hear of no indication that near-zero interest rates are fueling the bubble in   the venture capital sector   Turning to inflation—and I guess this is my defense of core inflation—the story in the   first half of this year was a sizable bump-up in headline inflation, and the second-half story may   well be falling oil prices and an undershooting of headline inflation  These extreme movements   in oil prices over the past few years reflect the underlying economics of inelastic short-run   supply and demand in this market  Such idiosyncratic volatility is a reason energy prices are   typically stripped out to formulate measures of underlying inflation  Indeed, research shows that   including the measure of underlying inflation in forecasting models helps in forecasting headline   inflation, and this result holds across a variety of samples and specifications  Various   alternatives measures of underlying inflation all perform about equally well  The simplest of   these—that’s the ex food and energy core—I find to be a useful series to keep an eye on  It’s   also completely consistent with how we treat a variety of macroeconomic series  We look at   core capital goods, which exclude the volatile aircraft and defense categories, and core retail   sales numbers  Of course, I’m not—and I don’t think anyone is—arguing that core inflation   June 21–22, 2011 129 of 282              should be the goal for policy  It’s simply that core inflation has proven useful in forecasting   overall inflation and provides a straightforward summary statistic for underlying inflation   Let me turn to how I’m interpreting recent inflation numbers  Despite the dramatic fall in   oil prices since our last meeting, I’m actually a bit more worried about the outlook for inflation,   much along the lines of President Pianalto, and that’s because of the somewhat firmer readings   we have gotten on core inflation in recent months  It appears that there has been somewhat more   pass-through of import and commodity prices into the core measures than we anticipated, and   similar to the report from President Lockhart, my contacts have repeatedly stressed the pressures   they are facing from higher raw materials costs, energy and transportation costs, and price   increases from China  Still, they see recent price increases as a result of a confluence of a   number of factors that are raising the level of prices rather than indications of a much higher   inflation trend  This view is consistent with market-based measures of inflation expectations   having retraced their increases from earlier this year  Therefore, looking ahead to next year, I   see both headline and core inflation settling in at around 1½ percent   In sum, looking through the temporary factors affecting output and inflation, I expect the   recovery to continue, albeit at a more muted pace, and inflation to return to levels below my   preferred long-run goal of 2 percent  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  We are   experiencing what looks to be a transitory slowdown in growth, and a transitory bulge in   inflation  If I am still allowed to use this word, “underlying” inflation remains moderate, and the   recovery should gain strength over time  Given the sizable slack and the expected decline in   inflation, the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy remains entirely   appropriate  Indeed, I would like to echo President Rosengren’s comments  I worry that 2011   could become a replay of 2010, and we should be thinking ahead to what we would do if the   economy stagnates and the risk of sustained deflation reemerges   June 21–22, 2011 174 of 282              Finally, I have a comment on the wording of the statement  In paragraph 3 of alternative   B, I’m a little uneasy with the addition of the phrase, “The Committee decided today to maintain   the current degree of monetary policy accommodation,” which to me is vague and perhaps   misleading  The special box in Tealbook Book B makes clear that the degree of monetary   accommodation—and I am thinking in terms of stimulus—from our large-scale asset purchases   is actually declining by the equivalent of about a 25 basis point hike in the funds rate every other   quarter, according to our back-of-the-envelope calculations  This occurs in the Tealbook   because the date of the expected future normalization of the balance sheet is drawing near  I   prefer a simpler way to describe policy  I would delete the phrase about monetary   accommodation  Instead, my suggestion is to begin paragraph 3 with “To promote the ongoing   economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its   mandate, the Committee will keep the range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent”  And   then, “It continues to anticipate that economic conditions,” et cetera  I think this is clearer and,   in fact, in a technical sense, more accurate  Thank you    I intended for it to be “The Committee decided today to keep”    I want to add my thanks to the members of the subcommittee for their   work on external communications  I agree they managed to strike a reasonable balance between   the various aims of our external communication  These are difficult issues  I’m going to pick up   on the staff issue, and I appreciate, Governor Yellen, this idea of getting feedback and seeing   how this actually works  I’m going to mention one potential challenge and, I hope, a   constructive idea about how research can be done within the confines of this rule  The   guidelines—and this is a separate issue than President Bullard mentioned—restrict staff   economists from communicating with outside researchers, including academics, about any   analysis, methods, or models currently in use but not available to the public  Now, having been a   June 21–22, 2011 208 of 282              staff economist in the Fed System for 16 years, I can personally attest to the value of such   consultations with outside scholars  Outside experts challenge our assumptions, they challenge   our methods, and they provide a check on group-think  To take one example, the FRB/US   model, which I worked on for many years, benefited from the critical scrutiny and suggestions   that we received from outside experts  Even models regularly in use need further, even continual   refinement, and the same applies to models used for forecasting and the DSGE models we talked   about yesterday   I understand the concerns that led to the new restrictions on the staff interactions with   outside experts, but given that these interactions improve the quality of staff analysis and,   importantly, ultimately improve our policy decisions, we need to ensure that the staff continues   to receive ongoing feedback from outside experts within the confines of the new rules  Indeed,   staff may need more public outlets for current analysis, such as economic letters and blogs, so   that they are free to discuss their methods with outside experts  These public outlets and the   dialogue with outside experts that they foster contribute to greater transparency and   accountability for staff research and analysis  I’m speaking from our experience in San   Francisco with our Economic Letters, and our FedViews—but many of the Federal Reserve   Banks have done the same thing  Putting our current analysis and our policy-oriented or current   research out publicly frees you up to talk to any outside experts about the models you’re using   and the results you’ve got, and it allows you to have those very fruitful conversations  But if you   don’t have those outlets available—and I’m not thinking about academic research right now—  then you couldn’t talk to the outside experts about what you are using in your policy analysis    Thank you   June 21–22, 2011 209 of 282               We are in complete agreement  My point was, to the extent that parts   of the Federal Reserve System don’t have outlets for your thinking on current analysis,   modeling, and research, then it is going to be a clampdown on the ability to talk to outside   June 21–22, 2011 210 of 282              experts  In some sense, I think we should have more transparency about what we’re doing, and   we should make it publicly available like we’ve done in San Francisco and like many other   Banks have done for a long time  That way I can go talk, for example, to Jim Stock about the   inflation model that I’ve been working on because my model is out there in the public and   widely available  I think we’re agreeing, but I don’t think the Board, for example, just to be   specific, has an economic letter or something like that  "
9265,2011-08-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I view all 10 proposed actions as being   entirely consistent with the Federal Reserve’s role of lender of last resort in response to market   dysfunction resulting from a failure to raise the debt ceiling   In particular, I view actions 1 through 5 as consistent with our past practice and good   policy  Indeed, in such circumstances, communication of this “business as usual” approach, as in   the draft statement, would send an important message that might reduce uncertainty and help   calm markets  In principle, I would also support actions 6 through 10 in the event these market   segments showed signs of serious impairment  Indeed, it would be useful for us to begin   discussions regarding the appropriate thresholds for taking these actions  Specifically, under   what conditions would we implement action 7, “RPs to Address Pressures in the Treasury Repo   Market”?  My question is, would it depend on signs of spillovers from the repo market to other   markets, such as commercial paper, or obvious signs of a drying-up of liquidity in the repo   market?   I think it’s very important—and I’m going to echo here some comments by President   Kocherlakota—that we clearly distinguish in our public communications between these lender-  of-last-resort policies aimed at providing liquidity and monetary policy aimed directly at   macroeconomic conditions  To sharpen this distinction, I prefer action 10 over action 9—that is,   purchases of defaulted securities should be matched with sales of otherwise similar nondefaulted   August 1, 2011 26 of 53              securities so that these actions are neutral with respect to our balance sheet, and we should   explain clearly that the enactment of any of these programs will not interfere with our pursuit of   our mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment  That is, even if we see a large   increase in our balance sheet through these programs, we have the tools to add or remove   monetary accommodation as needed   Finally, by transacting Treasury securities at market prices, I think that will protect us   from the charge that we’re propping up the fiscal authority through our actions  Thank you  "
9290,2011-08-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The deterioration in the economic outlook   has been dramatic and equally disturbing  Early this year, the economy downshifted to a rate of   expansion that fell well short of the growth rate of potential output, which we’d traditionally call   a growth recession  Some of this weakness reflected transitory factors, and economic growth   should pick up modestly in the second half of the year  But even with that improvement, the   pace of recovery will be insufficient to make meaningful progress on unemployment until next   year  Moreover, I see significant downside risks to the forecast  Anemic growth and high   unemployment leave the economy especially vulnerable to further adverse shocks and a double   dip  The debt crisis in Europe provides one example of such a shock  Concerns regarding the   recovery’s vulnerability have been a major reason for the recent volatility in financial markets,   August 9, 2011 65 of 162              and I’m especially worried about the fragile confidence of households and businesses, which   likely took another big hit with the stock market downturn  Perhaps more worrisome is that the   self-correcting process, key to past recoveries, appears to be largely AWOL this time around    Despite our efforts to account for the effects of fallout from the financial crisis, we have   consistently been too optimistic about the pace of improvement in the economy  I have become   increasingly concerned that we may not have managed to avoid a Reinhart–Rogoff pattern of   weak and prolonged recoveries that have followed past financial crises  Perhaps this time is not   so different after all   The extent to which persistent headwinds are hindering the recovery can be quantified in   terms of the medium-term equilibrium real interest rate  In my comments, I will refer to a   particular model that I developed with Thomas Laubach some years ago  In this model, the   equilibrium real interest rate equates supply and demand over the medium term of several years    It changes in response to highly persistent shifts in aggregate supply and demand  A decline in   the equilibrium real interest rate would imply a negative shock to demand relative to supply  I   think this measure gets at the issue of supply versus demand shocks or persistent ones  Since the   outset of the recession, the estimated medium-term equilibrium real funds rate has fallen from   24 percent to nearly zero today  And for comparison, before the current episode, the lowest   reading that we had on our estimate was 18 percent during the headwinds period of the early   1990s  Other measures of the equilibrium real interest rate that we look at, as well as those that   are reported in the Tealbook, Book B, have also declined considerably over the past few years   I am also increasingly concerned that the sluggish pace of growth may permanently scar   the economy  The magnitude and duration of this downturn will mean that the millions of long-  term unemployed are seeing their human capital deteriorate or actually be destroyed, along the   August 9, 2011 66 of 162              lines of the comments of President Kocherlakota  I found the alternative scenario “More-  Persistent Spending Weakness with Supply-Side Corrosion” to be a very real risk, although not   quite yet my modal forecast    Turning to inflation, with oil and some other commodity prices having declined sharply   from earlier peaks, headline inflation is moderating  Core inflation also rose noticeably this year,   albeit from a very uncomfortably low level  Some of the rise in core inflation reflects temporary   factors that, as mentioned in the Tealbook, should fade in coming quarters  For example, our   staff has looked at the issue of pass-through of import prices, and we find that pass-through of   higher import prices likely contributed about 03 percentage point at an annual rate to core   inflation in the first half of the year  With non-oil import price inflation moderating, the impulse   to higher core inflation should also diminish in coming quarters  Indeed, my business contacts   tell me that the pass-through of higher import prices to consumer prices either has already   occurred or will be completed soon   In sum, I expect the recovery to continue, but at a frustratingly slow pace that leaves the   unemployment rate elevated for many years  I expect inflation in coming quarters to return to   levels of around 1½ percent, below my preferred long-run goal of 2 percent  Unfortunately, I   don’t see light at the end of the tunnel  The staff’s long-term projection sees us falling short on   both of our mandates through the end of 2015, the final year reported in the table  Apparently   the long run is just not long enough to reach our goals, at least without additional monetary   support  But that’s a topic I’ll leave for my comments later  Thank you    Okay  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative A  And given   the significant downgrade to the outlook for output and unemployment, and the heightened risks   to the recovery, I think an additional accommodation is needed for the very reasons that you said    In this regard, I, too, very much appreciate the very helpful staff memos on possible policy   actions for providing additional monetary accommodation  In following Governor Tarullo, I   have been changing my comments very much in real time, so let’s see if I’ve kept up with   everything  I support incorporating the more explicit forward-looking policy guidance as you   suggested  This step is a small one  It may help markets better understand our policy framework   and our intentions, and it may reduce uncertainty  But as Brian pointed out earlier, if you look in   the modal forecast, markets don’t expect us to raise rates until sometime in 2014, I think  And of   course, this is a conditional commitment, as the proposed language makes clear  But I don’t   think that’s actually enough  Based on what’s going on in the economy and the forecast for   inflation, I think we do need to go further, and I support extending the maturity of our Treasury   holdings as described in paragraph 4 of alternative A  Research by my colleague Eric Swanson   on Operation Twist shows that that policy indeed did reduce longer-term interest rates  His   findings are completely consistent with the research that was done on the effects of the first stage   August 9, 2011 114 of 162              of the LSAP program in the current episode  So I think that it’s a small step  I know it’s not a   panacea, but I do think it’s a step that would help, and it would have relatively small downside   risks  I also think we should be thinking about all the other options, and I agree with the idea of   a two-day meeting in September  I think one option that I am also in favor of is lowering the   target fed funds rate and IOER to zero, but I know that’s an issue that’s more complex  We’ll   have a good discussion of that at the next meeting  I also prefer, by the way, when I said   alternative A, the language regarding the downside that I think President Evans also   mentioned—“Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased”—which was in   paragraph 2  I think that’s actually an important piece of the language that’s missing in   alternative B  "
9316,2011-09-20,"  Well, thank you, Mr Chairman  I would just start off with a comment   about interest rates and lowering interest rates and the effect on spending  Nine months from   now I’m going to have my 50th birthday, and I’ve been promised a midlife-crisis sports car  So I   assure you that if interest rates are lower, I will spend more on that  [Laughter]    If there is a silver lining to our current predicament, it’s been that   these events provide a laboratory for research that has increased our understanding of the   effectiveness of monetary policy at the zero bound  Based on this research—and we’ve actually   September 20–21, 2011 64 of 290              reviewed probably about a dozen papers—I think it’s pretty clear that these types of programs,   both LSAPs and maturity extension, are effective policy tools that could help lower longer-term   interest rates at the margin  And I’ll just comment that the staff memo that we saw today shows   that either of these policy options would lower 10-year Treasuries between 10 and 25 basis   points initially, and that’s roughly equivalent to a 75 to 100 basis point cut in the fed funds rate    I actually view that as a very sizable policy action to the extent that these are equivalent, and I’m   going to come back to that in a second  I’d also just say that obviously these policies aren’t   cure-alls, but I still think we should use them as appropriate given the constraints we face at the   short end of the yield curve  I’d add that in the future, we’ll likely need to broaden the set of   securities that we purchase for the very reasons that President Kocherlakota and President Fisher   mentioned  I think we’ll need to consider going back to mortgage-backed securities—I know   that’s not a popular idea—so that we can make larger ongoing purchases without cornering the   market for longer-term Treasuries  Moreover, research has shown that our past MBS purchases   have had broad effects on private borrowing rates, making MBS purchases a potentially more   potent tool than Treasury purchases  And, as Brian mentioned earlier today, the MBS–OAS   spread relative to Treasuries has spiked upward again  That’s, again, I think, an argument for at   least contemplating broadening to that class of securities   In terms of reducing the interest rate paid on excess reserves, I think that would be   another way for us to provide a bit more monetary policy accommodation  It would also lessen   somewhat—I’m just repeating the comments that I think have already been made—the confusing   appearance that we are paying banks not to lend money while we’re trying to ease policy in   every other possible way  Cutting the excess reserves rate would push down short-term rates a   bit  I realize that’s a small change  I do think it would send markets a signal to lower their   September 20–21, 2011 65 of 290              expected path of policy going forward, which would help reduce interest rates all along the yield   curve—again, though, only modestly  And regarding President Rosengren’s comment about   how markets would respond or how much disruption you’d get, I also heard the same kind of   thing—that money funds are really a part of a suite of services that are provided  So I would be   surprised if lowering the interest on reserves to 10 basis points would cause a highly disruptive   reduction in the money fund market   Turning to monetary policy communication, I think that more transparency is desirable    Paragraph 2 of alternative A is a noble effort to communicate our long-run policy goals   succinctly, and it’s one that I support  I’m also sympathetic to the goal of providing conditional   forward guidance, as in paragraph 4  I think this is very difficult to do, though, based on the   wide variety of views in this room  And my main concern is that this approach will prove to be   very challenging in terms of reaching consensus on these thresholds  It’s very difficult to   satisfactorily distill our policy strategy down to just two numbers, especially during a time of   extraordinary volatility and uncertainty  Moreover, this approach focuses exclusively on the date   of liftoff from low rates and provides no further information on the intended slope of rate   increases after liftoff, which is equally or even more important for thinking about longer-term   borrowing costs  I do want to add that I think it’s essential that, if paragraph 2 makes reference   to an inflation rate of 2½, there is a reference, such as in paragraph 2, to our longer-run goal of   2 percent  I think having just the 2½ percent number obviously would be potentially confusing   So I am sympathetic to this approach  It’s very difficult to do in practice  Luckily, I   think there is a better way forward  I’m now not going to be the first person to mention this, but   I will tilt at this windmill myself  I think that it would be a better approach if we were to include   our individual projections about the appropriate path of monetary policy in the SEP  Like   September 20–21, 2011 66 of 290              Governor Tarullo, I see many advantages to this approach, but unlike Governor Tarullo, I will   strongly advocate for it  Releasing our funds rate projections would accomplish everything that   paragraph 4 in alternative A tries to do and, I think, much more  So let me emphasize a few   advantages of this policy  First and foremost, releasing our funds rate projections in the SEP   would clearly communicate to the public the most likely point at which we see the policy rate   lifting off from the zero bound  That could be mid-2013 or later or earlier, as the evolving data   warrant  Second, the range of our funds rate forecast would appropriately convey the   disagreement and uncertainty we face about the exact liftoff point  Third, as our output,   unemployment, and inflation forecasts evolve, so too would our forecast for monetary policy    This would give the public a genuine picture of the state-contingent nature of policy without any   of the oversimplifications inherent in the simple thresholds of paragraph 4  Fourth, the steepness   of our funds rate path after liftoff would provide very useful information to the markets that is   not currently conveyed by paragraph 2 or 4, and again, as emphasized in the memo, the pace of   tightening after liftoff can be just as important for influencing longer-term interest rates as the   timing  Fifth and perhaps most important—and I really think this is the most important idea—is   that having funds rate projections in the SEP, or at least having them internally, would help our   policy discussions at this table  It would give us a better understanding of the range of views on   the Committee and could help us better frame the debate about policy and the outlook  It might   even help us find greater points of agreement regarding the future course of policy  To   summarize, I support the use of forward guidance in principle, but I think we can do much better   by publicly releasing our policy projections in the SEP or at least having them internally as part   of our discussion  This would importantly communicate the most likely path of policy and the   September 20–21, 2011 67 of 290              uncertainty and state contingency of that path, and again, it would shape the public’s   expectations about policy after the liftoff point, which could be just as important  Thank you    My view was that, just as the SEP has done, it would represent all the   participants and be consistent with the forecasts of the participants    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The news since our last meeting has been   deeply discouraging  Job growth has been dismal for four straight months, and consumer   sentiment has plunged to levels I’d hoped I’d never see again  Several of my business contacts   report that their businesses and bookings took a nosedive in August  These are extremely   worrisome developments, especially when the recovery is so vulnerable  Since our last meeting,   I trimmed my GDP growth forecast for both 2011 and 2012 by about ½ percentage point each,   and compared with my forecast from last November when we undertook LSAP2, I have lowered   my GDP growth forecast for both 2011 and 2012 by 2 full percentage points, to put some   perspective on what the outlook looks like today relative to last November   Yet even the US data look good compared with the escalating crisis in Europe  Stresses   in the European financial sector continue to mount, and by several measures, such as spreads and   financial sector credit default swaps and market equity ratios, those strains are now comparable   to what they were in September 2008  If European leaders do not find a credible and decisive   solution very soon, I fear a full-blown financial crisis could erupt, and if this transpires, the   damage to our financial system and the economy could be severe  As already discussed, such a   dire scenario is laid out in the Tealbook’s “Very Severe Financial Stress in Europe” alternative   scenario  My staff explored other plausible scenarios with different assumptions about how the   crisis could evolve, but the message is clear throughout these  A massive European financial   crisis could stall the recovery and drive inflation into negative territory  My business contacts   September 20–21, 2011 136 of 290              are very worried about the potential failure of one or more large European financial institutions    In fact, they tell me they are seeking shelter from the brewing storm already and have moved   cash out of European banks  In fact, one contact told me that he is reducing his exposures to   US banks already   Uncertainty in US financial markets has soared to one of the highest levels in 50 years,   exceeded only by the recent financial crisis and the 1987 stock market crash  We face an   enormous uncertainty shock that could easily tip us into a recession  Based on his research on   the effects of uncertainty, Stanford’s Nick Bloom predicted back in June 2008 that the US   would fall into a recession, and he is now making that same prediction again  My staff examined   the probability of a recession using various statistical models  Looking at US data alone, they   found that the probability of a recession in the next 12 months is only about 20 percent according   to their models, but following up on Vice Chairman Dudley’s question earlier, we actually did   look at how adding European data changes those predictions  We included European economic   indicators in our recession prediction models, and the probability of a US recession when you   include the European data increases to about 35 percent  This number echoes the most recent   Blue Chip survey and the Wall Street Journal survey of forecasters from last week, both of   which put the odds of a US recession by the end of next year at about 1 in 3   Even if we avoid a recession, the outlook for unemployment is bleak  Now, of course,   it’s important to distinguish between cyclical and structural unemployment, and recently my staff   took a close look at the question of whether the large increase in the number of long-term   unemployed workers signals a sizable increase in structural unemployment, an issue raised by   President Lacker at our last meeting  According to one theory, the pool of unemployed workers   now includes several million people with intrinsically very limited employment prospects—that   September 20–21, 2011 137 of 290              is, they are structurally unemployed  For these workers, the odds of getting a job again are slim   to nil  A prediction of this theory is that the job-finding rate of the long-term unemployed should   have fallen to very low levels by now and be essentially zero for those who are out of work for   two years or longer  However, this prediction is at odds with the microeconomic evidence    Even the long-term unemployed are currently finding jobs at a rate greater than 10 percent per   month, and this job-finding rate is about the same whether a worker has been unemployed for six   months or for two years  Moreover, the rate at which the long-term unemployed are finding jobs   has risen this year and is now higher than it was in 2009  So this evidence suggests that a sizable   share of the long-term unemployed today are out of work because of a lack of demand rather   than because they are unemployable   More generally, the preponderance of evidence indicates a structural factor explains only   a portion of the rise in unemployment over the past few years  As discussed at the January   meeting and confirmed by subsequent data, careful empirical analysis of labor market conditions   indicates that the effective natural rate of unemployment reached between 6 and 7 percent, and   that’s consistent with the Tealbook’s estimates  Indeed, this analysis implies that the natural rate   is now declining somewhat because of the diminishing effects of extended unemployment   insurance benefits   So let me finally turn to inflation  The first half of this year, the rate of inflation rose   from very low levels recorded last year  In large part, this run-up was due to a spike in   commodity and other import prices and the effects of supply chain disruptions  These transitory   factors have now largely played out  The downshift in the outlook for the global economy is   reducing pressures on commodity prices, and domestically the weak labor market translates into   a lack of wage pressures  Throughout all of the upheaval, inflation expectations have remained   September 20–21, 2011 138 of 290              remarkably well anchored  Putting this together, the inflation outlook, to me, continues to seem   relatively benign, with PCE inflation at around 1½ percent next year   In summary, the outlook has darkened yet again  The risk of a recession is   uncomfortably high, and the situation in Europe has become increasingly dangerous    Inflationary pressures are receding, and overall the economic outlook is in many ways, I think,   much worse than it was this past fall  But I’ll comment further on that tomorrow  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  As I mentioned   yesterday, maturity extension is an effective policy tool that can help lower longer-term interest   rates  I was going to comment on lowering the interest rate on reserves, but I understand we will   get more memos on that between now and the next meeting  We will look forward to that memo   and that discussion next time  I supported pursuing this particular policy of maturity extension at   the last meeting, and I think the case for taking this step is, if anything, even stronger today,   given the deterioration in the economy and even greater downside risks  I also support   reinvesting principal payments from agency securities in agency MBS for the reasons discussed   yesterday, also summarized by Bill English  Specifically, I see this as lowering spreads on MBS,   September 20–21, 2011 204 of 290              and I also think, importantly, it creates space for further Treasury purchases  As Vice Chairman   Dudley said, there could be a very powerful signaling effect of this as well  This is the right step   at this time   Let me say a word about the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and how that has   changed since last November  Governor Yellen made these very same points yesterday, so I will   try to be very brief  Basically, we looked at where the forecast was in the November Tealbook   from last year and compared that with the forecast as of the current Tealbook  Regarding   monetary policy, I think it makes sense to be forward-looking and consider the forecasts, as   opposed to where we are currently   The November 2010 Tealbook forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 was   79 percent  Today it is 87 percent  And the Tealbook forecast for core PCE inflation next year   has climbed from 1 percent to 15 percent, an increase of ½ percentage point  Obviously, there   are factors telling you to have less monetary accommodation, and some saying that you should   have more monetary accommodation, relative to our forecast from last November  But when I   plug these forecast changes into a Taylor 1999 policy rule with coefficients of 1½ on inflation   and minus 2 on the unemployment gap, it implies a reduction in the funds rate of 85 basis points    Based on this simple metric—which only incorporates the information about the change of our   modal forecast—the change in the outlook argues for significantly more policy easing than we   thought appropriate back in November based on the outlook that we had at that time  I think   alternative B takes us a step in that direction   Finally, I would like to comment on the need for more contingency planning  I   completely agree with President Fisher’s remarks yesterday, and also the remarks of others who   followed on yours  I am very concerned that economic conditions could take a serious turn for   September 20–21, 2011 205 of 290              the worse, especially if the situation in Europe spins out of control  We need to think carefully   now about what we will do if the worst-case scenario materializes  In that event, we would   likely be employing unconventional policies and operating at the zero lower bound for many,   many years, much as Japan has  In contemplating such a situation, I am sympathetic to President   Bullard’s point that we need to get away from one-shot, fixed-duration policies that we have   used in the past, and move instead to a more systematic framework  In particular, we should   plan now about how we would conduct and communicate asset purchase programs that are more   open-ended and adaptable to changed circumstances  As I mentioned yesterday, I think we will   clearly need to broaden the set of securities that we purchase to include mortgage-backed   securities  Furthermore, I am increasingly worried that we could find ourselves in a situation   where the yield curve is essentially flat at very low rates, and the economic situation is still not   satisfactory  I think the traditional LSAP and communication policies may not be sufficient to   achieve our macroeconomic goals  If you look at Japan and Switzerland, they both currently   have 10-year government rates of around 1 percent  If we find ourselves in a situation like   that—even after we have used all of our LSAP and communication policies—we really do need   to think seriously about outside-the-box approaches to monetary policy, including the use of   emergency-type programs or other approaches  We need to be doing that planning now rather   than later  Thank you  "
9343,2011-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Successful communication of our policy   framework is especially important as we navigate uncharted waters of unconventional policies    A critical goal of our communication, to me, is to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations    During the past few years, the anchoring of inflation expectations has paid huge dividends  It   stemmed what could have turned into a sustained deflationary dynamic, and it also provided   monetary policy with greater maneuvering room for extraordinary accommodation with less   November 1–2, 2011 67 of 282              danger of high inflation  To further reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, I strongly   favor publicly stating an explicit inflation objective in the context of our dual mandate    I should say that I am one of the latter participants to go in this round, so many of my   further comments are going to echo comments of other participants  In particular, I noticed that   some of my comments are very closely aligned with President Rosengren, and some of my other   comments are very closely aligned with President Plosser  I am not sure how often that sentence   is uttered  [Laughter]    I, too, think it would be useful to make a general statement of the   Committee’s policy framework that we all agree on, and to publish that in the minutes, as was   done with the exit strategy  I actually think flexible inflation targeting is a good framework for   thinking about that  It is a big tent, as many people have already mentioned, but with this group   you may need to have a big tent like that, and so that is a good approach  As President Plosser   earlier said, the work that was done by the ad hoc group on putting together a one-pager about   the framework around a numerical inflation objective is a good place to start on that  I will add   that inflation targeting has proven to be a very highly successful strategy that has been used in   many countries   I do think we have to be careful in how we publicly describe our current policy   framework if we were to describe it as flexible inflation targeting  The problem, which has   already been mentioned by a number of people—and this is where President Rosengren’s   comments and mine overlap—is that flexible inflation targeting is a very elastic term  It means   different things to different people  For example, some inflation-targeting central banks have a   hierarchical mandate in which price stability is the prime goal  That is not how I interpret our   November 1–2, 2011 68 of 282              dual mandate or our framework  Explicitly identifying ourselves as an inflexible inflation   targeter could be misperceived as tipping the balance of our dual mandate strongly toward price   stability  This could complicate already daunting communications challenges, and it could be   seen as inconsistent with the mandate given to us by Congress  If we were to publicly describe   our framework as flexible inflation targeting, which I do support in principle, it is important that   we do so along the lines that Lars Svensson has done, and that is as a balanced approach, with a   significant weight on both parts of the dual mandate   With regard to communicating the optimal policy under commitment, such an approach   is attractive for the reasons that were laid out in the staff memos  Unfortunately, for similar   reasons that President Bullard mentioned, I think it is an unrealistic benchmark  In the jargon of   academics, our commitment technology is very limited  It is simply impossible for us to set a   predetermined course of policy that will bind future Committees    Another comment I will make on the staff presentations, which were really helpful, is that   the differences in the outcomes under the different policies that they look at—nominal income   targeting or inertial Taylor rule or optimal policy—depend critically on the expectations of   events that are many years in the future, another point that President Bullard and others have   made  For example, if you look at exhibit 2 from Mike Kiley’s presentation, it is striking that the   inertial Taylor rule and the nominal income-targeting rules actually yield essentially the same   unemployment paths, as I see it, up until 2017, yet the inflation rates starting from 2012 are very   different  I have dabbled in the dark arts of large-scale macro models, so I have some   understanding of how these models work  Events way out in the future can really feed back into   the present in a very strong way, and there is a lot of uncertainty about how strong the feedback   effects are of events five, six, seven years in the future on the actual inflation and unemployment   November 1–2, 2011 69 of 282              rates today  I am not sure if, in reality, the simulations may exaggerate the benefits of   differences in policy regimes  As President Bullard said, these simulations assume rational   expectations, and that everybody instantly knows the change in the policy regime  In practice, I   think there would be some learning and adjustment that would again reduce the differences in the   policy alternatives   Instead of thinking of optimal control as being the approach that we should be   concentrating on, we should aim to communicate as clearly as possible our current reaction   function  Policy thresholds could help in this communication  Alternatively, as Governor   Tarullo and I argued last time, and a number of participants have already mentioned, we could   include our individual projections about the appropriate path of monetary policy in the published   SEP  Then, as our forecasts for economic activity, inflation, and the funds rate evolve, the public   would get a clear picture of the state-contingent nature of our policy reaction function  Although   I have not yet studied the results that we were sent this weekend from the trial run of the SEP,   my reading of the SEP answers is that these are consistent with what I think of as a pretty clear   view of where policy is expected to evolve, with a liftoff apparently in early 2014 or so, with a   range of views on that  That range of views in the SEP about when liftoff is and what the policy   will look like going forward is consistent with the range of views on inflation and economic   activity  That would benefit transparency, and it would be consistent with our policy framework   and communication   Finally, I don’t believe this is now the time to switch to a price-level or nominal income   target  In theory, these approaches can work very well  President Lacker, and I think President   Kocherlakota, brought up the issue that you should be really evaluating policy frameworks in an   unconditional stance, thinking about how they perform on average  I and many other people   November 1–2, 2011 70 of 282              have actually looked at that issue in different models and under different assumptions  The way   I would summarize is that a very good monetary policy rule—a well-calibrated Taylor rule, or an   optimal control policy, or a nominal income-targeting policy, or a flexible price-level targeting   policy—all of these do really well if they are well designed  They do roughly equivalently well   in normal conditions  Looking at that question doesn’t give you an answer about which   framework you want  You really do have to think about the communications issues and also the   unusual circumstances that we are in today  At this time, switching horses in the middle of the   stream could confuse more than clarify, and ultimately could backfire  In particular, nominal   income targeting seems to muddy the waters  Investors care separately about prices and about   quantities  And, importantly, we care separately about prices and about quantities  Looking at   only nominal income, which mashes together prices and quantities, seems to me at this time to be   counterproductive and could undermine the anchoring of inflation expectations  Thanks    No, I’ll pass    Thank you, Mr Chairman  After all of the bad economic news   throughout much of this year, it’s refreshing to have intermeeting data that surprise to the upside,   albeit relative to very modest expectations  The inflation data have also been encouraging, with   core inflation trending lower    A key question for the outlook and monetary policy that we have actually been discussing   for a few years now is to what extent the modest growth we are seeing reflects a slowdown in the   growth rate of potential output  My trusty staff has reexamined this issue using a variety of   methods  The bottom line of their analysis is that the underlying growth rate of potential output   since the start of the crisis appears to be slower than we previously thought and still assumed in   the Tealbook  Specifically, we estimate that potential output will grow about 19 percent per   year, on average, over 2011 to 2014, and this slower rate of potential output growth primarily   reflects slower labor productivity growth owing to both a lower estimate of trend total factor   productivity growth and the subdued pace of capital accumulation by businesses  This finding of   slower potential growth obtains both from a careful bottom-up approach, similar to that   employed by the Board staff, and a top-down Kalman-filter approach to estimating potential   output  Looking further ahead, we estimate the long-run growth of potential output to be   22 percent  That’s 03 percentage point lower than in the Tealbook   As a result of this revision to our estimate of potential output, the level of potential at the   end of 2014 looks to be about 5½ percent lower than what we expected on the eve of the Great   Recession  So this gets back to President Kocherlakota’s point about, if you were to extend a   November 1–2, 2011 144 of 282              line from late 2007, where that would be  But nonetheless, actual output remains well below   even that reduced level of potential  And our estimate of the current output gap is around   5 percent  That’s about 1 percentage point smaller than in the Tealbook   The key factors underlying this large output gap are on the labor side  For example,   despite the steady growth in the working-age population, hours worked today are more than   5½ percent lower than in the fourth quarter of 2007  My staff’s analysis, along with the analyses   of many other economists in the System, consistently finds that this shortfall is primarily   cyclical, not structural   My near-term outlook has real GDP growth of about 23 percent next year—and careful   study of the tables we got shows that that is the slowest rate of growth projected for next year   among the participants—and about 3 percent in 2013  I think, again, this slower rate of potential   growth that we are assuming actually explains the fact that my forecast is somewhat lower than   typical  With output increasing somewhat faster than potential over the next two years, I expect   the unemployment rate to end this year at about 87 percent and to be 8 percent at the end of   2013, which is roughly comparable to the Tealbook   I think it’s important also to note something that Dave Stockton—David Wilcox—I don’t   know how I did that—[laughter]—something that David Wilcox pointed out earlier—several   hours ago  And that is, in our forecast, similar to the Tealbook, more than half of the decline in   the unemployment rate over the next two years is met with a decline in the natural rate of   unemployment  So the closing of the gap is actually quite modest   Another question that we’ve been grappling with is, if the unemployment gap is so large,   why haven’t wages fallen more over the past few years?  This question was taken up by several   leading economists at a recent symposium on US wage dynamics hosted by my staff at the San   November 1–2, 2011 145 of 282              Francisco Fed  Although the participants came from different traditions and used varied   approaches, a number of common themes surfaced  There was general agreement that wage   growth has been firmer than expected during the recent recession and recovery  Still, none of the   participants concluded that this signaled an absence of slack  Instead, the participants pointed to   an upward shift in the skill composition of those employed as an explanation for the resilience of   real wage growth  They also cited downward nominal wage rigidities, which are more likely to   be binding in a low-inflation environment, as a potential explanation of the relative strength in   wage growth     This situation is likely to continue, and my business contacts report little or no upward   pressure on wages  Similarly, I see no pressure for an acceleration in prices  Commodity price   pressures have come down, and inflation expectations remain well anchored  Furthermore, the   recent readings on core PCE inflation have come down from somewhat elevated levels seen   earlier this year, as expected  Over the past three months, core PCE inflation is about   1½ percent, and over the past 12 months, core prices increased 16 percent  Looking forward, I   expect PCE inflation to be around 1½ percent both next year and in 2013   Let me turn to the risks to the outlook  I regard the risks to my inflation forecast as   broadly balanced, which clearly puts me in the minority, with about equal risk of inflation   running at 1 percent or at 2 percent next year  Despite the sizable swings in commodity prices   and the worst recession in decades, inflation expectations have remained remarkably well   anchored, and core inflation has been stable through this period  I will mention a paper that   Dave Reifschneider and two of his colleagues here at the Board did, looking at what were the   surprises of the past few years in terms of output, unemployment, and inflation  What was   probably one of the most striking results is how stable inflation has behaved over the past few   November 1–2, 2011 146 of 282              years relative to a variety of DSGE or empirical models or FRB/US  The big surprise, in some   sense, is that inflation has been so stable despite all of the shocks that we’ve had  For that   reason, I view the inflation risk as broadly balanced but the uncertainty as not larger than history   The risks to the outlook for economic activity appear to be larger than average and   skewed to the downside  For example, our outlook assumes further improvements in credit   conditions and consumer and business confidence  Instead, the recent subpar growth and   elevated financial market volatility have, if anything, increased uncertainty  US fiscal policy   also remains a source of downside risk, and progress in Europe on solving several difficult   problems, notably bank recapitalization and debt sustainability, has been halting at best  And   this was written on the weekend   The recent uncertainty appears to be particularly pernicious in character  It’s not just   unusually large shocks to our models that I worry about, but it’s also the stuff that isn’t even in   our models—so Knightian uncertainty  And I have to say that purple squirrels were not in our   model, so that’s just one aspect of that  Let me see if I can read this  It’s not just the known   unknowns but also the unknown unknowns that seem to have persisted at a high level  For   example, the risks of a full-blown financial crisis in Europe are not well captured by our models,   and I have a hard time formulating precise risks to our economy in that scenario   Finally, Governor Raskin and I are just back from a trip to both China and Japan, but I’ll   comment on what we heard in Japan that made me especially drawn to the Tealbook “Lost   Decade” alternative simulation  In fact, many of the people we talked to in Japan predicted that   the US would soon, or within a few years, be talking about a lost decade for the US  In this   scenario, “persistently sluggish growth     has a corrosive effect on the supply side of the   economy”  Governor Raskin and I encountered people, as I said, who warned that these risks   November 1–2, 2011 147 of 282              were developing for the US  And based on their own agonizing experience, they stressed the   difficulties of pulling an economy out of a protracted slump  The large downward revisions to   US potential that I mentioned earlier reinforce such concerns   In summary, the outlook is one of sluggish growth and frustratingly slow progress on   reducing unemployment  Inflation looks to be trending to levels somewhat below my preferred   long-run goal of 2 percent    This was a comparison—I should have spelled this out a little more   carefully—of what our forecast or view of potential output was in 2007, before the recession    Basically, it was that trend line and seeing how much the decline in the level of potential output   in the end of 2004 is relative to that in 2007  It’s not just in the past six weeks    It’s 1 percent because our output gap is 5 percent  The Tealbook, I   think, is 6 percent in Q3  So it’s just a 1 percentage point difference    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I also favor   maintaining the “at least through mid-2013” forward guidance and including the word   “significant” in describing the downside risks  I think that’s accurate  In my view, appropriate   policy entails liftoff of the funds rate from its current level around mid-2014  This is similar to   the median of market participants’ expectations, so I don’t see a compelling need at this time to   try to move market expectations by changing our policy guidance   In thinking about the appropriate stance of monetary policy, I find it useful to consider a   variety of simple estimated and calibrated monetary policy rules  I’m less swayed by the optimal   control simulations, which are highly sensitive to the model and underlying forecasts, and I don’t   think they’re as reliable a guide for policy  But currently, with considerable slack, slow growth,   and fairly low inflation, the central tendency of these policy rules is completely consistent with   the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy  Furthermore, the central tendency of   these policy rules doesn’t predict lifting off from the zero lower bound until around mid-2014   Of course, simple rules are only partial guides to our policy decisions, and there are three   key reasons why we may want to adjust the prescriptions from these rules  First, because of the   zero lower bound, we haven’t been able to follow the prescriptions of the policy rules into   negative territory  So there’s no reason to think that we should follow them regarding the policy   liftoff  Indeed, much research, including work I’ve done with Dave Reifschneider, suggests that   November 1–2, 2011 200 of 282              policy should stay at zero longer than standard policy rules would suggest following an episode   at the zero bound  A policy rule based on our analysis suggests liftoff in early 2015    Furthermore, the normal channels of monetary transmission remain unusually clogged  Many   businesses and households are unable to take on new debt or want to shed existing debt, muting   the effects of monetary policy stimulus  If this reduced effectiveness persists, additional policy   accommodation is needed, and liftoff should be delayed relative to the simple rules’ prescription    However, working in the opposite direction, the simple rules ignore the sizable additional   accommodation from our unconventional monetary policies  The additional stimulus from lower   term premiums and longer-term yields suggests that our short-term policy could lift off   somewhat earlier than the simple rules suggest   I view these and other arguments that deviate from the policy rules as roughly canceling   out  So I remain fairly comfortable with the rules-based prescription of a mid-2014 liftoff as a   modal forecast  Importantly, I foresee a relatively modest pace of increases after liftoff, with the   funds rate ending 2014 at only 75 basis points   Finally, there are significant downside risks to the outlook for the economy, as we   discussed yesterday, and I therefore recognize that the date of liftoff could be significantly later   than mid-2014  And obviously, depending on the actual evolution of the forecast for economic   activity and inflation, we may need to change our policy guidance and use further large-scale   asset purchases or lower the reserve rates as needed, but right now I see alternative B as   appropriate  "
9384,2011-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The US economic data since our last   meeting have been encouraging  Car sales and auto production are up  Holiday sales are   running above expectations, and consumer sentiment, although still depressed, has rebounded    The labor market continues to improve, and the unemployment rate has declined  While the   recent US data have brought us some holiday cheer, I’m afraid that Europe is playing the role of   the Grinch who stole Christmas  [Laughter]  The euro area is tumbling again into recession, and   the European debt crisis lurches on   These events cast a pall on the otherwise upbeat news we have on the US economy  As   David Wilcox mentioned, real GDP growth looks to be around 3¼ percent this quarter, and I   wish such a pace of growth could be sustained next year and further on, but there are a number of   reasons to doubt that  For one, it’s important to remember that some of the recent strength in   spending and output is a rebound from very weak growth in the first half of the year  It’s helpful   to me to look at the four-quarter growth rate, and even with a strong Q4, we’re still looking at   17 percent growth in 2011, Q4 over Q4  It’s also important to remember that much of fourth-  quarter growth is coming from inventories and net exports, neither of which are likely to   contribute so much to growth going forward  As we’ve already discussed at some length,   income measures continue to disappoint  GDI grew at an annual rate of less than ½ percent in   the third quarter, and the recent personal income data suggest ongoing weakness  In particular,   December 13, 2011 38 of 198              labor compensation has been tepid, and consumer expectations of future income growth remain   extraordinarily pessimistic   All in all, I expect real GDP growth to be 2¼ percent next year, consistent with the   Tealbook  The risks to this forecast remain tilted to the downside  The Tealbook and my   forecast assume that the payroll tax cut will be extended for 2012  Should that not occur,   disposable income would come under further pressure  GDP growth in my forecast would end   up being close to trend in 2012   And like everyone, I’m very concerned about the situation in Europe, which could spin   out of control at any moment  But even if Europe doesn’t blow up, we still face a number of   significant headwinds, and one of those is uncertainty, as President Lockhart commented, and I   hear very much the same remarks from my directors and business contacts  By almost any   metric, uncertainty is elevated  Businesses are uncertain about the economic environment and   about the direction of economic policy—again, exactly consistent with President Lockhart’s   comments  Households are uncertain about job prospects and future incomes, and the looming   crisis in Europe only adds to the prevailing angst  I repeatedly hear from my contacts that these   uncertainties are prompting them to postpone large capital investments and delay more   permanent payroll expansion  As one of my contacts put it, uncertainty is causing firms to step   back from the playing field   But a key question for monetary policy is whether this rise in uncertainty should be   viewed primarily as a shock to demand, which monetary policy should lean against, or a shock to   supply, which monetary policy should not respond to  To address this issue, my staff examined   the quantitative effects of uncertainty on the US economy using a standard vector   autoregression, or VAR, framework and several measures of uncertainty taken from the research   December 13, 2011 39 of 198              literature that I think are related to what we hear from our business contacts  We included in the   analysis the VIX, an index of policy and regulatory uncertainty that’s been taken from recent   research literature, and responses from the Michigan consumer survey about factors that   consumers or households themselves say are restraining their buying   If uncertainty shocks primarily affect supply, then one would expect both unemployment   and inflation to rise following an adverse shock to uncertainty  However, if these shocks   primarily affect demand, then unemployment should rise but inflation fall in response to an   adverse shock  According to our analysis, over the past 30 or so years, uncertainty shocks of the   type that we currently face and we talked about, have acted on the economy like adverse   aggregate demand shocks  That is, in these models, following a shock to uncertainty,   expenditures on consumer durables and investment, short-term interest rates, and inflation all   fall, while unemployment and corporate bond spreads rise  This basic finding holds across all   types of uncertainty that I’ve already mentioned, including financial market, policy and   regulatory, income, and demand uncertainty   The second headwind is tight credit  Although we’ve seen improvements in credit   conditions, especially for households, small business lending remains an area of weakness  As   noted in the Tealbook, much of this weakness reflects a lack of demand associated with weak   growth in the economy and a small pool of qualified borrowers  The supply issues, including   supervisory pressures, have also been part of the story  Now, the good news is that our CDIAC   members say that broad supervisory pressures have eased this year and are no longer affecting   the lending decisions of healthy banks  The bad news is that a large number of community banks   are not that healthy  My staff examined the community bank data and confirmed that small   business lending of banks with CAMELS ratings of “3” or worse continues to decline, and   December 13, 2011 40 of 198              because many small businesses rely on banks with which they have long-standing relationships,   finding alternative sources of funding may be difficult  This suggests that a carryover from the   financial crisis continues to impinge on the availability of credit to many small businesses   Now let me turn to inflation  Inflation pressures seen earlier this year have clearly   abated  Indeed, recent data are coming in below expectations  Six-month annualized changes in   overall, core, and trimmed mean PCE prices are now all below 2 percent and heading lower    Compensation growth is still soft, and labor cost pressures are basically nonexistent  My   forecast for inflation hasn’t changed since our last meeting  I continue to expect PCE inflation to   be about 1½ percent both next year and 2013   In summary, after a rough first half, the economy has for now returned to a moderate   growth path, which will nonetheless deliver frustratingly slow progress on unemployment    Inflation is low, and inflation expectations are well anchored  If, however, Europe’s troubles   deepen, our recovery could be derailed and deflationary pressures could reemerge  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support Alternative B  Recent economic   data show that at best a moderate recovery is in train  Inflation is trending downward, heading   below 2 percent  We are currently falling short on both parts of our dual mandate, and I expect,   as many others, that this will remain true for many years to come  In these circumstances, the   current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate   Nonetheless, as others have mentioned, the expected outcomes are highly unsatisfactory    By my own calculations of a super long-run outlook that extends the Tealbook’s long-run   outlook [laughter], we will not achieve either of our mandated goals until early 2018, which is a   decade from the beginning of the recession  One way to improve on this dismal prospect is to   upgrade our communication of our long-run goals and principles and of our policy projections    This should help further anchor expectations and enhance the effectiveness of our policy actions    I will return to this topic in our discussion later today   As a final note, I want to return to a topic that President Fisher mentioned earlier today,   and he and I have mentioned in previous meetings, and that is that I am particularly concerned   about the possibility that the ongoing crisis in Europe could blow up with little advance notice    In that case, the market reaction, including massive safe-haven flows to the US, could drive the   entire Treasury yield curve down to very low levels, potentially making our current   unconventional tools of forward guidance and Treasury purchases largely irrelevant  As I have   said before, we need to plan now about the options we have if such a scenario materializes and   not wait until we are in the teeth of a full-blown crisis  Thank you   December 13, 2011 102 of 198               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am strongly in favor of both   communications initiatives  I was struck by the fact that I agreed with everything Governor   Yellen and President Plosser said in their remarks about this  I think I am going to repeat a little   bit of that, but I’ll try not to repeat too much of it   Let me first add that I am extremely impressed with the magnificent—someone said   masterful—job the subcommittee did in fashioning these proposals and finding what was an   effective middle ground on difficult and contentious issues  Based on this heroic effort and   accomplishment, this “supersubcommittee” could make short work of solving our federal budget   problems as well  [Laughter]  Mr Chairman, this is just an idea you might pass on to   congressional leaders during one of your meetings   Over the past several years, we have taken many important steps to improve our   communications and transparency  At each step, we have had a healthy debate about the   associated risks and benefits, and President Fisher’s comments reflect that healthy debate  I   come out on the other side of that  Ex post, each of these steps has proved successful, and the   hypothesized risks have not materialized  The initiatives before us today are a natural   continuation along this path  Taken together, these two initiatives will be a major step forward in   terms of transparency and accountability, and, importantly, should help our policy succeed in   these challenging times   Providing interest rate projections will help align the public’s expectations with our own,   and thereby improve the effectiveness of our policy actions  Furthermore, as our forecasts for   December 13, 2011 140 of 198              economic activity, inflation, and the funds rate evolve, the public will get a better picture of the   state contingent nature of our policy reaction function  As Spence mentioned, several other   central banks have successfully implemented this approach, and their experience gives me   comfort that the benefits far exceed the costs  And I, too, am a big fan of the dots chart, and I am   all for dot charts everywhere   Releasing a statement of our principles will also be highly valuable for the reasons that   others have already said  A consensus statement about our policy goals and strategy will help   anchor inflation expectations while underscoring our firm commitment to both parts of the dual   mandate  It also promises to be a valuable tool for explaining the principles that guide our policy   decisions  I have long supported publishing an explicit numerical inflation objective, and this   document achieves that   I have also written a number of research papers about the real world challenges   policymakers face when natural rates—say the natural rate of unemployment—are unknown and   vary over time  So I have long been concerned about placing too much confidence in our ability   to estimate natural rates with any precision  The language in the statement addresses these   concerns very effectively  It acknowledges the uncertainty and describes the range of   nonmonetary factors that help determine the maximum sustainable level of employment   Importantly, it also allows a separation between participants’ shorter-run assessments of   maximum sustainable employment and their views of the longer-run level—a point that   President Lacker just made  This language provides ample room for Committee members to   express their higher or lower views about the currently prevailing natural rate of unemployment    For example, I, like the CBO and the Board staff, currently estimate that the natural rate of   unemployment is somewhat higher than its longer-run value  I have a minor suggestion that   December 13, 2011 141 of 198              would further strengthen that distinction between our assessments of the prevailing level of   natural rates and the longer-run values  I would break into two the sentence that says, “The   Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments, and information   about Committee participants’ estimates of the longer-run,” et cetera, with the second sentence   starting, “With information about Committee participants’ estimates”  Basically, break that into   two so that we are not linking the Committee’s shorter-term assessments with their longer-run   estimates   I have a second minor wording suggestion to offer  Paragraph 1 starts with, “The FOMC   is strongly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate”  To me, the word “strongly” actually   weakens this declaration  It is like we are saying we are really, really, really committed    [Laughter]  I would drop the word “strongly” from here  Saying, “The FOMC is committed to   fulfilling” is good, or you could say “firmly committed”   Finally, I do think that the principles statement should be reaffirmed each year in January    The composition of the Committee changes  Document details could change over time as more   evidence and experience is accumulated on these issues  In summary, I strongly support moving   forward with both initiatives in January  I do have one technical question, not that important   right now, but would the idea be that the exhibit would be released prior to the Chairman’s press   conference, like table 1?  Or would it come out when the minutes are released?  I assumed it   would come out prior to the press conference     "
9408,2013-10-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support actions 6 and 7 in the event   the repo market showed serious signs of strains or impairment for the reasons that Vice   Chairman Dudley outlined  Also, in the context of an emergency, obviously, the Chairman may   need to authorize such actions on his own  But that said, I am very sympathetic to what   President Kocherlakota said  If we’re really thinking about this as part of our monetary policy   framework—in other words, if we don’t want repo rates to persistently be above 25 basis points,   or something that like—I do see that as something for the Committee to discuss and decide upon   a policy on that   In terms of actions 8 and 9, apparently I am beyond the pale  I agree with Governor   Stein’s comments fully  I would just add that in our public communications, it will be important   in such a situation to distinguish between our lender-of-last-resort actions to enhance liquidity   and our monetary policy actions aimed at macro stabilization  And obviously for actions 8 and 9   that’s a difficult challenge, and obviously the bar would be very high for taking these actions  It   would be very important for us to explain that these purchases or swaps would not in any way   interfere with our ability to pursue our macro mandate goals of price stability and maximum   employment  And I think it’s really important, as always, to communicate that, in our   October 16, 2013 47 of 50    transactions for our Treasury securities, we are transacting at market prices, and in no way   propping up the fiscal authority through our actions  Thank you  "
