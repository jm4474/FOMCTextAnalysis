7429,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7430,2003-12-09,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  You’ll find that we’re   fairly close to the center of gravity in this discussion  Let me start with the greater New York   region in the Second District, where we see growing signs of strength, most notably in the   financial and the business investment sectors  Early results from our forthcoming December   Empire Survey—I don’t think “Empire” refers to the imperial New York Fed—[laughter] show   widespread improvement in business conditions  A rising proportion of firms—higher than the   already high number in November—reported increases in employment and in the workweek    Notably, the December survey shows strong expectations for higher prices paid and received six   months ahead    The Securities Industry Association, as you may have read, projects that bonuses will be   up 20 percent from a year ago  The leaders of the financial community in New York generally   express growing confidence in the strength of the recovery, though they cite varying degrees of   concern about strategic or terrorism risk, about the caution induced by legal and corporate   governance accounting uncertainties, about the nation’s external imbalance, its fiscal deficit   trajectory, and about what one might call a modest erosion in the credibility premium that the   US financial system in some sense has enjoyed     For the US economy as a whole, we are encouraged by the breadth of the strength in   recent data and by signs, of course, that policy works  With consumer spending recently strong,   the initial signs of growth in employment, the strong response in capital spending, and low levels   of inventories, we feel more confident that the foundations have been laid for a sustained   expansion  Our forecast shows somewhat less confidence in the strength of consumption and in   the pace of employment growth than does the Greenbook, and we show a modestly higher   December 9, 2003 68 of 133    negative contribution from the external sector  But overall, we think the evidence supports the   view that the economy is growing at a reasonably healthy pace and will do so over the forecast   period at a strong enough level to begin to absorb the available slack   These factors and the initial signs regarding prices suggest a more balanced inflation   outlook  The extent of the remaining slack in the economy, the slow pace at which we expect it   to be absorbed, and the strength of productivity growth all suggest little basis for concern that   inflation will rise appreciably in the coming year  Yet the dollar’s decline, the run-up in   commodity prices, and the rise in some measures of inflation expectations suggest that the risk of   further declines in key price series has diminished     It’s important to note that we face a fair degree of uncertainty over many of the key   elements of this recovery  Consumption may decelerate more than we anticipate, as the force of   tax changes and monetary stimulus fade  The strength of underlying growth may surprise us still   and with that may come more modest job growth  The confidence necessary to sustain strong   business investment could still falter  Growth in Europe and Japan still looks very slow, even if   the downside risks have diminished  Emerging Asia is, of course, very strong, and there are   better numbers across most emerging markets  But many emerging economies remain very   vulnerable, with very large balance sheet exposures, weak institutions, and political systems very   open to populist pressure     The scale of dollar reserve accumulation and the exchange rate regimes that support that   demand for dollars seem unlikely to be sustained indefinitely  The combination of the sheer   magnitude of our external imbalance and the size of the gap in potential growth between the US   and other major economies will leave us exposed to considerable risk in financial markets, with   potential cliffs for the dollar and a sharper rise in interest rates  These risks and the troubling   December 9, 2003 69 of 133    fiscal trajectory mean that monetary policy will carry a greater burden for sustaining confidence   in US financial assets  The extent of the decline in credit spreads and the magnitude of   opportunities for the development of leveraged positions combined with the large scale of the   mortgage-backed market mean that we have to be attentive to the risks that will come from a   sustained period of low rates and to the forces that will be unleashed as its end approaches  This   requires careful attention, though it’s not clear what that really means for the policy judgments   ahead   On balance, we see the prospect of stronger real growth and a higher underlying rate of   potential growth, and we have greater confidence about a more benign inflation outlook  We’re   approaching a point at which we need to consider how to move to a more neutral, less   accommodating, policy stance  We will have time and perhaps reason to begin that discussion in   the New Year, probably sooner than we had thought would be necessary  I’ll wait for the   discussion on policy and our press statement to address those interesting questions  Thank you  "
7431,2003-12-09,"  I’m comfortable with both the policy recommendation and the   statement as crafted  I think the statement you’ve proposed is better than the alternatives  In my   view we’re at a point where it’s appropriate to dial back a bit the forward-looking signal we’re   sending  You’re proposing to do it in four different ways, and I think each of those is justified   and helpful  People say that there’s something of a paradox about policy and interest rates in   that, by the time we feel the need to talk about an exit strategy, it may be too late  I don’t think   one can make the case that we’re at that point yet, and I believe your recommended approach   gives us a little more flexibility as we confront the more difficult choices we’re going to face in   the first two quarters of next year  "
7490,2004-01-27,"  Let me just make a complicating observation, which is   that I’m not quite sure what we think we mean when we say we’re in favor of “gradual   evolution”  Many of you who have spoken today of gradual evolution have somewhat different   views about the future statement in terms of what the third paragraph should be  So I was just   going to ask this complicating question of you, Governor Ferguson  What does greater   flexibility in assessing the risks mean in terms of which direction you want to see flexibility?     Yes  I’m happy to associate myself with that   consensus     Coming new to this discussion, I have been more   moved by the arguments in favor of accelerating the release of the minutes than I am troubled by   the arguments against  But the arguments against are proliferating, and those arguments are   significant  Some of them I hadn’t thought through, and I believe they’re worth thinking about   carefully  My general sense is that we should try to get ourselves more comfortable than we are   now as a group with moving toward early release  Whatever ways we can get ourselves more   comfortable are worth investing in  I would offer the qualification, just to amplify what Don   said, that I doubt a dry run is going to tell us much about what’s really material to the choice   here  It won’t tell us anything about the market dynamics  It won’t tell us anything about how   the decision will affect the dynamics of the discussion  It won’t tell us anything about how hard   it is to get a consensus on the minutes if the differences of view become consequential  My   sense is that we should think through these two specific questions of whether it complicates an   intermeeting decision or reduces our discretion on intermeeting action  And we should explore a   bit Bill Poole’s question about whether there are discussions we would have in this room—on   subjects such as a major financial system issue—that we would not want to mention publicly    within six weeks much less three weeks or two weeks  I think those matters are worth exploring,   frankly, before we take this next step of going into a dry run  But just to end where I began, I   think it’s worth trying to see if we can get ourselves more comfortable with moving in this   direction because I suspect the returns are worth it     Why don’t we ask the barons of this place to explore a   bit some of these technical questions that haven’t been explored in detail in the paper?  Why   don’t we ask them to do that, and come back to us before we go through the mechanics of   launching a dry run?  I suggest that because I think those issues are more important, frankly, than   what we’re going to learn in a dry run       I have only the weakest of convictions on this issue  I   think Mike Moskow’s point is a very interesting one  If there are sensible changes that we could   all embrace in how we present these forecasts but we’re all against or uncomfortable with   elevating their importance, it may be a mistake to contemplate sensible changes  I have a   somewhat more open mind to the merits of thinking about some sensible changes even if we’re   going to retain the current relatively limited role of the forecasts in our thinking  So I’d say   those minor adjustments are worth thinking through a bit more  But I see no great benefit in   substantially raising the profile or the contribution of the forecasts—nor the time we invest in   them—as a guide to policy going forward  It may not be worth going through this, but I don’t   think there’s a case for increasing their frequency, and I don’t know how I come out on the   merits of separating them from the testimony itself  So I offer those weak convictions     The third sentence in the second paragraph, which is   the sentence about labor markets, now reads in the proposed text  “Although new hiring   remained subdued, other indicators show an improvement in the labor market”  I was just going   to suggest that we replace “show” with “suggest”   SPEAKER(?)  Yes, that’s a good idea     January 27-28, 2004 188 of 238   "
7491,2004-01-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Developments in the   Second District seem to be tracking those in the nation as a whole  We are strong where the   national economy is strong  The Empire survey shows very high levels of business confidence,   orders, shipments, and most things we measure, but the slope of the increase has flattened    Employment is still soft, perhaps a bit softer than it has been nationally  In our neighborhood,   however, inflation seems to be running somewhat ahead of the national numbers, and our survey   shows further increases in prices received and paid as well as higher expectations for both six   months out     Developments in the national economy since our last meeting support growing comfort in   the outlook  The expansion seems more broad-based, with strength continuing in household   January 27-28, 2004 150 of 238    spending and housing, and capital spending growing at reasonably rapid rates  Exports are   performing well, consumer and business confidence are at quite high levels, and business caution   has receded  The increased confidence in the sustainability of the expansion seems justified    Although we have a somewhat softer outlook for growth than the central tendency of the   forecasts around this table, we share the general expectation that the payroll number should   begin to show more rapid growth  The fall in claims, increasing part-time employment, and   surveys of enterprise plans support this view  With demand growth strong, it would be   surprising if we did not see more-rapid growth in hiring  Inflation, of course, is still very low  It   is hard to find evidence yet of a change to the trajectory of a gradual downward drift in the rate   of increase in core inflation    Looking outside the United States, demand looks stronger and the news is generally   encouraging  Still, the major economies are growing at rates substantially short of the US pace   Policy in Europe and Japan may be getting better, but it doesn’t look too impressive when judged   against the scale of the structural challenges  Fundamentals in emerging-market economies have   improved, although perhaps not to the extent implied by the very low spreads to Treasuries  The   broad consensus in favor of open trade policies seems more fragile these days despite the   strength and breadth of the global recovery    Overall, we believe that the US economy is likely to continue to expand at a pace   somewhat above our estimate of potential growth and will do so for the next several quarters    We believe that the range of uncertainty around this outlook has narrowed, but the probability of   a stronger outcome may now exceed that of a weaker outcome, and this is a good thing  We   expect inflation to stay low  There is some chance that inflation will decelerate further in the   near term, but we can afford to be less worried about this risk given the apparent strength in   January 27-28, 2004 151 of 238    demand  We now face a rising, if still small, probability that inflation will find its floor and   begin to move modestly higher  The critical question, of course, is whether this will happen   even if the apparent slack in the economy is absorbed only gradually   This is a reasonably encouraging outlook, but it is probably healthy to acknowledge the   sources of uncertainty and risk  The sources of uncertainty and risk are not new, but they are   compelling still  The apparent strength of productivity growth supports the view that the   microeconomic fundamentals of the US economy are exceptionally strong relative both to its   recent path and to the performance of other major economies  There is a lot, though, that we do   not know about these dynamics and what they mean for employment and inflation, given our   forecast for growth, and what in turn the implications of these dynamics are and how soon it will   be appropriate for us to adjust policy  Caution here argues for giving ourselves more flexibility   than our statement now provides, with a possibility that we may need to move sooner than we   had thought and than the market now expects    The scale of the broader imbalances in the economy—the low level of private savings,   the substantial deterioration of the structural fiscal position, and the size of the external   imbalance—remains a source of considerable risk  Even if the long-run sustainable level of US   growth is higher than conventionally thought, the factors necessary to bring these imbalances   down to more comfortable levels are not now in place, and they do not appear to be in prospect    The fact that the dollar decline has been so benign should not be too reassuring, given the forces   at work to slow it and to support official foreign demand for US fixed-income assets and given   the extent of the further adjustment in the dollar that may still be required  These risks don’t   alter the balance for monetary policy now, but they may suggest that we need to be more   January 27-28, 2004 152 of 238    attentive to the downside of giving the markets too much confidence that policy will remain on   hold indefinitely   And finally, of course, financial conditions are now very accommodative  Asset markets,   credit spreads, risk premiums, and measures of volatility have all moved a long way toward a   very benign view of the world  These factors make the fundamentals look better than they   probably are  They make us more vulnerable to the buildup of distortions in financial markets   that can only be unwound with some drama  They amplify the force provided by our already   exceptionally accommodative policy stance  This merits attention, and at the margin it probably   also reinforces the case for recalibrating our signal a bit to position us more comfortably to deal   with the possibility that we may see a case for moving policy before the end of the year  This is   not a call to arms or a call to action  This is meant just to be a case—to borrow yesterday’s   formulation—for a gentle, gradual evolution [laughter] in how we frame the forward-looking   signal in our statement  Thank you  "
7492,2004-01-27,  So do I  
7554,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll do this briskly    Economic developments in the Second District remain quite favorable  Business and consumer   confidence have weakened some, employment has fallen a bit, and in our Empire State survey   the forward-looking six-months-ahead expectations show somewhat diminished optimism, but   the numbers are still reasonably strong  Manufacturers report stronger pressure on input prices,   with particular concern in steel and energy, as many of you have said  Perhaps more   significantly, they are reporting higher prices received and expectations of more pricing power   ahead   The parts of the New York business and financial community with national and global   businesses continue to report a reasonably positive view of the outlook  They are a bit more   March 16, 2004 61 of 107    cautious than they have been, less because of concern about actual diminished growth in demand   or profits than because of uncertainty about the sustainability of the expansion if employment   growth fails to strengthen, the implications of the political calendar on the economic policy   debate, and renewed concerns about terrorism risks  Greater confidence in productivity growth   is not leaving people with as warm a feeling about the future as one might think is justified     In our view, the basic elements of the expansion appear to be on the same path as they   did at our last meeting  With powerful support from the forces of monetary policy,   accommodative financial conditions generally, and the structural acceleration of productivity   growth, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a reasonably healthy pace for the next   few quarters  Consumer spending may moderate a bit, but real income growth should continue   to support expenditures at a comfortable rate  We expect investment to continue to strengthen at   a quite rapid rate, supported by confidence in demand growth, competitive pressures to upgrade,   ample profit margins, and very favorable financial conditions  We’ve moved our forecast up a   bit, but we are somewhat lower in terms of GDP growth for 2004 and 2005 than is the   Greenbook  The main differences are in the expected path of consumption and a larger negative   contribution from net exports  We see consumer expenditures slowing somewhat because we   anticipate a gradual rise in the private saving rate—we are more optimistic about virtue  We are   less positive about impetus from asset prices, inflation, and interest rates  We also see   productivity growth staying at a more elevated level longer and falling less than does the Board’s   staff, and as a result we expect more-moderate employment growth  On balance, though, we   share the staff view that growth will continue at a level somewhat above what we consider to be   trend or potential   March 16, 2004 62 of 107    In our judgment, the core inflation numbers are likely to remain low, but we may now   have reached the point where the rate of increase will stop falling  Unit labor costs should start   to rise modestly as productivity growth moderates, but the increases should be quite modest for a   while  We suspect that the surveys on pricing pressure and a growing ability to pass on those   price increases mean something in terms of a diminished probability of further falls in inflation   On balance, we see the risks to this outlook for growth and inflation as quite close to   symmetric  Relative to our last meeting, the chances of a substantial upside surprise on output   growth seem diminished  And until we see employment growth strengthen and unit labor costs   turn, there will continue to be some chance of a further decline in core consumer price inflation    Even if—or when, I should say—those conditions materialize, we consider it unlikely that   inflation will accelerate over the forecast period to a range above our comfort level   So on this basis, we see monetary policy as appropriately calibrated to these conditions,   and we believe that could prove to be the case for some time  However, the Committee’s   success in convincing markets that it will be patient is contributing to conditions in financial   markets that could cause us and the macroeconomy—and even Don Kohn—[laughter] some   discomfort  I think we should be uncomfortable now with the extent to which expectations of   the turn in the fed funds rate have receded  With the overall risks close to balance, we have less   need for and face more risk in a communication signal that is still interpreted as designed to hold   interest rate expectations down well beyond the immediate policy horizon This is not an   encouragement that we act now to dial back that signal  But we need to consider thinking about   doing it soon, if only to increase our future room for maneuver  Thank you  "
7555,2004-03-16,"  Mr Chairman, I’m comfortable with your   recommendation both on policy and on the statement  I think it’s true that the anecdotal   information on prices is worse since our last meeting  But the numbers haven’t moved  And our   statement already reads that the risks on inflation are quite close to balance  “Almost equal” is   quite close  [Laughter]  On that basis, I’m comfortable with the suggestions you proposed  "
7605,2004-05-04,  Thank you  
7606,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The balance of risks has   changed since our last meeting, and the changes seem largely favorable  The outlook for growth   seems stronger, with less downside risk  Inflation risks appear more balanced around a higher but   still quite moderate path   The economy of the Second District has continued to improve  The pace of the expansion   has increased  Where we were weaker earlier in the year, we are now stronger  There is less   caution in the commentary  Employment is increasing quite rapidly, and businesses report plans to   increase hiring further in the months ahead  We hear, as do others, lots of reports about skills   mismatches and difficulty in filling positions  Inflation in our region is higher than the national   average—about double—despite what seem to be higher levels of resource slack and a later onset of   recovery  Much of the rise in prices is due to housing, but business contacts in the District report   higher input prices and a greater ability to pass on these costs, on goods at least   For the nation, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a rate of roughly 4½ percent   this year even if monetary policy follows the path now reflected in market interest rates  The   fundamentals of an improving labor market, moderate compensation growth, and high reported   confidence levels seem likely to support a reasonably strong pace of growth in consumer spending    Investment spending seems likely to continue its rapid recent pace, supported by greater confidence   in demand growth, strong profit margins, and favorable financial positions  In contrast to the   picture at some points over the last few months, it’s hard to find evidence of actual or incipient   softness in demand  Although we forecast continued strong productivity growth, we expect the   pace to moderate and employment to expand at a rate somewhat above estimates of the underlying   rate of growth in the workforce  Overall, we continue to support a balanced risk assessment on   growth, with a path only moderately above what we consider to be potential     May 4, 2004 52 of 112       The inflation outlook has changed more significantly  The acceleration in inflation suggests   a more broad-based shift than simply the transitory effects of large changes in a few components of   the index  Surveys of establishments show a more generalized increase in the ability to pass on cost   increases  Unit labor costs seem likely to have shifted into positive territory in the first quarter—a   significant swing, even if the overall rate of increase seems only modestly positive  The TIPS   spreads show a significant rise in inflation expectations over the medium term and a very modest   rise—one could even say by some measures a small decline—over the longer term  These   developments do not, in our view, portend a significant risk of sustained acceleration in inflation in   the near term to levels inconsistent with our objective of price stability  We still believe that the size   of profit margins, the degree of slack remaining in the labor market, the fading effect of the decline   of the dollar, the recent surge in commodity and energy prices, and the pressures of competition will   work to contain the degree of acceleration in core consumer prices   Our forecast is for the core PCE to increase roughly 1½ percent in 2004  We are less   confident in that forecast, however, given the uncertainty we face about the path of productivity   growth, the size of the output gap, and the relationship between output and inflation in this   environment of transition  These developments alter the monetary policy calculation We need to   be more attentive now to the risk that a sustained increase in prices could materialize at an earlier   point than had seemed likely, and we can afford, of course, to be less concerned with the risk of an   unwelcome fall in the rate of inflation  The risks of being late compared with the risks of moving   too early are now more symmetric  We need to adjust our statement accordingly, to position us to   be ready to act soon if the numbers confirm the recent trend toward stronger employment growth   The financial markets seem to reflect a high degree of confidence in our capacity to contain   the risks of a significant acceleration of inflation  The stability in long-term expectations that seems   May 4, 2004 53 of 112       to be reflected in the term structure, however, can’t be separated from the substantial degree of   monetary policy tightening now priced in over the next twelve months  This is a sign of credibility    On balance, I think we should welcome the degree to which markets have pulled forward their   expectations of the timing of the first increase in rates  Thank you  "
7607,2004-05-04,"  I was going to give a less ringing endorsement by   characterizing the proposal as better than the known alternatives  [Laughter]  Essentially what   we’re debating is whether a statement with this ending is too soft, too reassuring about the future   May 4, 2004 90 of 112       path of the fed funds rate  I believe that’s the right question to debate  But I think it’s important to   recognize that this wording gives us the flexibility to move in June, if necessary  Although our risk   assessment is balanced, this statement has an overt asymmetric bias, whichever way one looks at it    As Roger just said, the last sentence is qualified in at least four different ways  It says “at this   juncture”; it is conditioned on certain fundamentals; it says “likely”; and the word “measured” itself   must have a range of possible interpretations  Now, it’s difficult to defend the statement both as not   constraining and helpful as a signal, but maybe that’s its virtue [Laughter]  So I’m comfortable with   it, and I support the recommendation  "
7655,2004-06-29,"  I have a question for Karen and Joe  Karen, do you   want to hazard a view on whether the probability of a benign adjustment exceeds that of a malign   disorderly adjustment?      So in a sense, you think we control the risk?      I want to come back to scenario 1 in your exhibit 5, in   which you have the dollar falling 30 percent in a year  Certainly an outright cliff of that   magnitude in a year—     In two quarters  And you assume that comes with no   increase in risk premiums on other US financial assets  I’m asking how realistic is that?      So you’ve drawn no particular policy implications in   terms of things we could do to mitigate the risk of an adverse outcome beyond what we would do   anyway, such as try to keep monetary policy credible, inflation expectations low, and rediscover   fiscal virtue  Another question is, Does it matter at all what happens to exchange rate policies in   greater Asia?      I know it’s about time to end this discussion, but I   have one more question  Does it matter what happens to the projected foreign share of the US   Treasury market under a scenario where our external imbalance is substantially larger—maybe   getting larger than the increase in the net borrowing requirement of the government?  Is there a   point at which you would worry about the implications of these lines going on indefinitely, with   a growing foreign share of the outstanding stock of US risk-free assets?     You assume that the preference would change?     You assume that their preference would change as   their share increased?     This goes to thirty years  "
7656,2004-06-29,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Developments since our last   meeting support a reasonable degree of confidence in the strength of the expansion and somewhat   more concern about the outlook for inflation  The economy of the Second District seems to have   strengthened further  Employment is growing very rapidly, and retail sales have been strong even in   the face of the softer national numbers  Our survey of manufacturers shows persistently strong   readings, with even more optimism six months out  Credit demand seems to be growing  Core   inflation in the region has fallen off a bit but remains well above the national average  The   anecdotal story in the District suggests a continued ability to pass on cost increases and growing   pressure to raise compensation to attract and retain workers with the requisite skills   At the national level, we think the fundamentals support continued strength in demand   growth at a comfortable, if somewhat softer, rate  High levels of reported consumer confidence,   strong income growth, and more-rapid gains in employment should support reasonably healthy   growth in consumption  Investment seems likely to have ample reason and room to continue to   grow at a rapid rate, with corporate balance sheets strong, profit margins strong, inventories low,   and orders running high  We think foreign demand looks pretty positive, too, but not strong enough   to avoid a significant negative contribution from net exports this year and next   June 29-30, 2004 122 of 203          On the assumption that monetary policy roughly tracks the present path of market   expectations, we project GDP growth of about 4½ percent in real terms this year and somewhat   under 4 percent in ’05  We see the risks to this path as balanced, with the principal downside risks   coming from the strategic realm rather than the economic—strategic in terms of a terrorist event or   a major oil supply shock  On the economic side, the principal risks seem likely to come from a   more substantial slowdown in household spending, a sharp reduction in near-term or expected   productivity growth, or a sharp decline in the willingness of nonresidents to acquire US financial   assets   We are somewhat more concerned about the inflation outlook  We have now seen   significant acceleration in underlying inflation to a level somewhat above our range of comfort  We   face some risk that a modest increase in inflation expectations—even after the recent moderation of   those expectations—will feed through to higher compensation growth  The extent of the swing in   unit labor costs, the various indications of supplier delays despite high reported capacity numbers,   and the persistent reports of pricing power all suggest a pattern of inflation dynamics that is hard to   reconcile with the degree of slack we thought we had perceived in the economy   So we have raised our inflation forecast for core PCE a bit to 1¾ percent for ’04, with a   somewhat lower rate in ’05  It stays below 2 percent in part because we still assume a reasonably   substantial monetary policy response that is effective in containing expectations, in part because we   believe oil and commodity prices will start to bring down the headline numbers, and in part because   we still think productivity growth is going to be reasonably high  All those factors, combined with   high profit margins, strong competitive pressures, and an expected gradual pace in the absorption of   remaining slack in the labor market, work to contain inflation going forward  But we think the risks   to that forecast may be somewhat to the upside  Or if we want to say the risks are balanced, we   June 29-30, 2004 123 of 203          think they are balanced around a higher path for underlying inflation and a higher bulge in the near   term     The uncertainty in the outlook reinforces the case for underscoring our commitment to do   what is necessary to contain the risks to our objective of price stability  The costs of being   perceived as too complacent about underlying inflation probably are now greater to us than the   alternative  Now that we’ve reached the point where we need to begin to move to a more neutral   fed funds rate, we take some comfort from the fact that financial markets seem reasonably well   prepared for the beginning of this transition  The things we can measure as well as the anecdotal   reports from a broad range of financial intermediaries suggest, as the Board staff now concludes,   that the anticipated change in the fed funds rate will not cause a lot of collateral damage or be   accompanied by a lot of volatility amplifying position adjustments and hedging  But there’s a lot   we cannot measure and cannot know about how the world will react to the initiation of what will   have to be a substantial increase in the fed funds rate over time, after a very long period of low rates,   and we’re likely to encounter some surprises even if they are not systemic in their magnitude   We are reasonably comfortable with the extent of the tightening that is now priced in, and   we are pleased with how responsive those expectations have been both to the stronger data and the   higher inflation numbers  However, the path of expectations still suggests a reasonably high degree   of confidence that we will move in only 25 basis point increments  I don’t think we can be fully   confident that we can afford that gentle a path  Our signal should aim to qualify further the   qualifications we have gradually introduced over the past few meetings and to emphasize that we   will act as necessary to keep expected inflation low  We don’t need to try to induce a significantly   steeper path for the fed funds rate right now, but it probably would be helpful if the market built in a   June 29-30, 2004 124 of 203          somewhat greater expectation that we could move in larger increments this year if circumstances   warranted  Thank you  "
7707,2004-08-10,"  On this same subject though, Vincent, isn’t it true that   the distribution, derived from options, about the expectations for the fed funds path doesn’t appear   August 10, 2004 8 of 103          to have narrowed substantially?  There’s still a fairly broad distribution in expectations, a fair   amount of uncertainty still priced in around the path  I don’t think it’s true, just looking at how   that’s changed over the past nine months or so, that the band of uncertainty is narrower     No, that has not changed  I’m just talking about   whatever concerns some people here may have about market participants displaying excessive   reassurance  If market participants feel reassured, it hasn’t produced substantially more confidence   around that band  I think that, combined with the fact that expectations are moving around in   response to the data is, again, good countervailing—  "
7708,2004-08-10,"  For the national economy, the underlying pace of growth   seems to have moderated since our last meeting, as have inflation risks  On the assumption that   monetary policy follows roughly the path now priced into markets, we foresee a somewhat softer   path for the expansion than we had in June, with growth moving back to a pace modestly above   potential— perhaps under 4 percent—for the balance of ’04 and for ’05 and the core PCE staying   just under 2 percent  We view the risks as roughly balanced around this trajectory but with a bit   more uncertainty and caution about the growth outlook and somewhat more comfort with the   inflation outlook   We are broadly comfortable with the Greenbook forecast  Relative to that forecast and with   a slightly steeper path to monetary policy, we expect somewhat less growth in consumption than the   Greenbook, somewhat stronger productivity growth, somewhat weaker employment growth, and   somewhat less moderation in the core PCE, but these differences are relatively small  We believe   the fundamentals of the expansion remain favorable even if the breadth of the recent deceleration in   spending is somewhat troubling  The productivity numbers seem to be holding up quite well    Income growth is reasonably strong  Corporate balance sheets, profit margins, and cash flow are   very strong  These factors combined with reasonably good confidence numbers among consumers   and establishments suggest that growth should move back to a level somewhat above potential  Our   August 10, 2004 43 of 103          forthcoming Empire survey, for what it’s worth, shows a significant moderation in the overall   outlook—a greater moderation than we’ve seen in the national surveys of business confidence  But   the overall numbers are still at a level that suggests continued expansion, and the six-months-ahead   numbers we look at fell by much less than those relating to the present    The risks to this outlook lie principally in the possibility of a shock that causes a very large   sustained further rise in energy prices, a substantial terrorist event in the United States, or some   abrupt change in the willingness of nonresidents to acquire US assets  But even without those   events, we could still see a new wave of caution induced by the threat of their occurrence, by   concern that demand may stay soft and employment growth remain weak and erratic, or by a further   rise in the saving rate  In a sense, our forecast requires a modest leap of faith that households and   enterprises will look through this latest softness and the increased uncertainty   On inflation, with monetary policy moving back to neutrality, we’re reasonably confident   that the core PCE will stay just below 2 percent  The recent moderation in the data helps support   this view, but we haven’t had that much confirmation of a downward trend yet  This follows what   had been a sustained large, unanticipated, and still-not-well-understood rise of underlying inflation   that should give us a bit of humility as we go forward  If monetary policy were not to continue to   adjust toward a more neutral position, then we would face the risk that the elevation in near-term   inflation expectations would feed through to a higher rate of underlying inflation  Back to our   Empire survey for a moment, it may be worth noting that the respondents report some moderation in   cost pressures and pricing power and a more substantial reduction in expected pricing power six   months out    I think it is encouraging that market expectations about the path of the fed funds rate are   proving so responsive to the data and that, despite concerns that we’ve provided too much assurance   August 10, 2004 44 of 103          about that path, there’s a fair amount of uncertainty reflected in those prices in terms of how far and   how fast we will move  I think it is hard to argue with the path now priced in  Or to put it   differently, given the thicker fog surrounding the near-term outlook, I don’t think we know enough   to want to use our statement today to try to induce a change to that path either by steepening or   softening it  Nor should we do anything to alter the presumption that now exists that we’ll be   moving toward neutrality at an appropriate pace and that the pace of that adjustment will depend on   the data and what they do to our forecast  Thank you  "
7709,2004-08-10,"  I’m comfortable with the statement and with your   recommendation  I just want to raise a question about your “no surprises” rule  That’s not quite the   way you framed it  I’m a little uncomfortable being in a regime where we never surprise—     No, no, I’m not trying to say that you did     Well, with that qualification, I’m fine  I just say this   because we’re in a situation where the market is now pricing in moves of somewhat less than   25 basis points a meeting for the next two quarters, but we want to make sure that we have the   capacity to move at that pace, if not faster, without creating the risk of adverse surprise  We have   the tension of that  Maybe the data will save us from that problem because the markets may react to   the data by pricing in a somewhat steeper path than is priced in now  But we shouldn’t be in a   position, if on the eve of the next meeting we have a somewhat greater distribution of views about   the outcome for that meeting and there has been some fundamental change in our forecast, where   we’re constrained to move another 25 basis points  So I just offer that slight qualification on an   extreme version of the no-surprise doctrine  I support your recommendation  "
7757,2004-09-21,"  Of course, I have no objection to a study  But I think   Vincent has it right when he says that the implications of the regime you are proposing, which as   I understand it is for the Desk to pre-commit to some amount of reserves that it is going to add   independent of—  "
7758,2004-09-21,"  When Karen did her June paper, I asked her if she was   going to recommend Plaza Two—that the paper was just the stalking-horse for recommending   Plaza Two  But I think it’s hard to conceive of a strategy that we could manage—you weren’t   suggesting this, but let me just say it—where to deal with the risks in our presumptively   unsustainable external position, we would induce a run on our currency and induce a broad-  based run on US financial assets     Yes  I think the lesson of those various periods is just   how hard it is—once the expectation is created that as a matter of policy we’re going to try to   induce a substantial decline in the value of our currency—to contain it or to slow it and manage   it  And yet if we could immaculately induce the rest of the world to revalue against us in some   gradual way, we’d do it if we could  That would be rather nice       Or the G-10     Karen, am I correct in remembering that one of the   things your June paper showed is how little an ambitious fiscal consolidation plan buys us in   terms of an improvement in the external position?     With the exception of the deterioration in the external   imbalance, our view of the outlook has not changed significantly since the last meeting  The   inflation news seems better  The growth news seems somewhat reassuring but not exciting    There do not appear to us to be any compelling signs at this stage of a deeper and more   protracted deceleration in growth that might raise concern about the sustainability of the   expansion   September 21, 2004 56 of 100          Relative to the tone around the room, I’d put myself at a slightly more optimistic point on   the continuum  On the expectation that we will continue to move monetary policy toward a   more neutral stance at a pace that matches present market expectations, we expect the economy   to grow at the pretty solid rate of around 4 percent in real terms for the balance of this year and   at a pace of just over 3½ percent in ’05 and ’06  And we see core PCE staying close to a range   of 1 to 1½ percent during that period   The fundamentals of the staff forecast remain as they have been  There is reasonably   steady improvement in the labor market, with healthy growth in compensation supporting   consumer confidence and consumption  Productivity growth reverts only gradually to the still-  impressive average of the ’90s surge  Global demand growth remains quite broad-based—at   close to potential—though not strong enough to help exports provide a positive contribution to   US growth  With strong balance sheets, enterprises commit more resources to investment and   to employment growth and compensation  Unit labor costs accelerate modestly, and firms   absorb some of that increase with lower margins, as competitive pressures contain pricing   power  We see the probability of a higher or lower trajectory to this outlook of 3½ to 4 percent   real growth and 1½ to 2 percent on the core PCE as roughly balanced for both growth and   inflation, though perhaps we should be uncomfortable on how moderate and benign this outlook   looks     This leaves us with slightly lower growth than the Greenbook and slightly higher   inflation, but those differences are not particularly large  The main differences in our views   involve the path of monetary policy and its consequences  The Board’s staff sees a considerably   more gradual move upward in the fed funds rate, with the consequence that the real fed funds   rate stays low relative to most measures of neutral or equilibrium for a longer time, without   September 21, 2004 57 of 100          inducing much in terms of a surge in growth above potential or in terms of accelerating inflation    In this sense, Janet raises the right question  I think she has the right answer   To us the greatest sources of uncertainty involve the issues of whether households decide   to save more of their income, whether enterprises show less tentativeness in spending, and   whether the process of arresting and reversing the deterioration in our external imbalance will be   traumatic or benign  Higher household saving, of course, would be a rational response to a   number of forces, including an increase in debt with interest rates rising, the prospects of lower   future returns on housing, the expectation that individuals will bear more of the burden of rising   health care costs and more of the risk in accumulating a viable pension benefit going forward,   and the prospects of higher taxes over the medium term   We don’t have a good explanation for the degree of tentativeness among US businesses   that remains  Perhaps it will fade  Businesses nationally are showing somewhat less confidence   in the strength and sustainability of this expansion than we seem to think is justified  The virtue   in this, of course, is that they’ve gotten themselves less overextended  Our Empire survey, for   what it’s worth, shows a significant recovery in September in sentiment about present and   prospective business conditions and almost every other indicator that we asked our survey   respondents about  Hopefully this portends good things for the nation   The deterioration in our forecast for the external imbalance puts us in very uncomfortable   territory, more vulnerable to a shock to confidence  The fact that the dollar has been broadly   stable and long-term rates have fallen in the context of the large upward revision to the expected   path of the current account deficit may suggest that the risks in this area have diminished, but I   suspect that is not the case  And just because a problem has no apparent solution does not mean   it’s not a problem  [Laughter]   September 21, 2004 58 of 100          I think we should be quite comfortable with the path of the fed funds rate now priced into   the markets; and we should be pleased with how responsive the slope of that path has been to   changes in the data  My view is that we should seek to leave that path unchanged in our signal   today  We don’t see evidence of upside risks at this point that would justify inducing a steeper   path  And absent a major change in our confidence about the strength of future demand, I think   we should be careful not to induce expectations of a more gradual tightening until we have   established a more definitively positive real fed funds rate and have moved closer to the range   that defines neutrality  Thank you  "
7759,2004-09-21,  I support the recommendation  
7811,2004-11-10,"  Yes, I was going to stay on this subject  It’s always a   pleasure to echo Don   I don’t know that I fully internalize Fed doctrine on imbalances and exchange rate policy   and things like that, but let me just say something from the perspective of my previous life  I   always had the sense sitting there in my position at the Treasury that US policymakers should   November 10, 2004 10 of 107    always be careful not to convey the sense that they actually know the desirable direction for the   dollar and that they should not in any way suggest that they were going to try to induce that move  I   think that’s true in general, but it’s much more important when we’re talking about a prospective   decline  Once established, the sense that a decline is desirable is very hard to reverse, and it makes   it very hard to manage the risk of a more acute decline causing broader collateral damage to asset   prices   So I just wanted to make the obvious point  Even if we’re very careful and even if we   allude only very generally and indirectly to our concern about the size of the imbalances and their   unsustainability—and that an adjustment in relative prices likely has to come as part of the   unwinding—I think our musings in public will make it harder for the Administration to discipline   its own ranks, which is always a formidable challenge   Let me also echo the conclusion of the committee of two  I thought the analysis was nicely   framed and did a good job of looking at the alternatives  And those alternatives met that critical   test, which was to illustrate why they were not particularly compelling against the regime in which   we operate now     Could I ask Karen a question?     Karen, I have a question on whether we’re seeing a   change in emerging Asia in exchange rate policies and practices  I’m curious about whether you   think there’s a common factor behind it in the following sense  Do we see across these countries a   significant change in underlying inflation that has caused them to decide that they want more   independence in monetary policy?  Or are we seeing something that is more idiosyncratic, with   different sets of forces at work?  "
7812,2004-11-10,"  David, maybe I misperceived this, but your model   seemed to have trouble generating a high inflation outcome  What is it that produces a “high   inflation” scenario with almost no material increase in inflation?  The difference in the monetary   policy assumption that underpins that scenario is not that large  So is there some failure of   imagination in the forecast that we could correct for?     We feel reasonably comfortable about the national   outlook  Anecdotal reports continue to convey a sense of tentativeness about the strength of   demand growth going forward, but the national numbers have been pretty solid  The surveys seem   to us to show some softening in expectations about the pace of expansion in the period immediately   ahead, but this still looks like a modest decline from reasonably high levels  On inflation, the   anecdotal reports still reflect concern about rising costs even beyond energy, despite the substantial   deceleration in the price indexes we’ve seen  On balance, to us the economy appears to have been   quite resilient in the face of the sustained rise in oil prices, terrorist concerns, election uncertainty, et   cetera  Our forecast for real GDP growth is between 3½ and 4 percent for 2005 and 2006, with   core PCE in the neighborhood of 15 percent on the assumption that monetary policy follows a path   of further measured tightening  We continue to see the risks as roughly balanced around this   forecast  Relative to the Greenbook, we are slightly less positive on growth, but the difference is all   due to net exports  Our quarterly pattern in the next two quarters is a bit different, but if you   average the two, we also show some deceleration   We have a bit less confidence that the now-prevailing equilibrium rate of interest is as low   as many believe, nor are we confident that we should at this stage plan to lean against the range of   potential headwinds out there—a higher household saving rate, fiscal contraction over a longer   November 10, 2004 53 of 107    period of time, negative net exports, sustained business caution, et cetera  By keeping the fed funds   rate lower than in the range of more conventional views on equilibrium for a longer period, the   Greenbook path is significantly lower than the market path  So we assume a different path for   monetary policy, one closer to that now priced into markets   In broad terms, we still see a moderate expansion in employment and in hours supporting   pretty healthy compensation growth and some deceleration of consumption expenditures    Businesses still seem to have the means and the justification for continuing quite strong rates of   growth in investment  Growth outside the United States has moderated some but appears to be on a   path around estimates of potential  For what it’s worth, the governors in Basel this weekend   seemed to share a fairly positive view of the strength of the expansion globally  As ECB President   Trichet put it, the world economy is somewhat less dynamic but still dynamic   Back to the United States, we see productivity growth slowing somewhat before returning   to what we hope is the medium-term trend of around 2½ percent  The associated rise in unit labor   costs in the interim is largely absorbed in shrinking profit margins, as competition holds down   pricing power  With output growth close to potential, inflation in our view should stay contained   even as the gap narrows     We’re pretty comfortable with this view, but we should recognize that it’s an exceptionally   benign view of underlying inflation, and there are risks in the other direction  We don’t know that   much about the size of the remaining gap or the likely path of productivity  We may face more   dollar depreciation, and it’s possible that pass-through may increase as foreign margins decline    The energy price pass-through could also surprise us; it could prove higher than we expect given   the size and persistence of the recent shock and the persistence expected in futures markets  Core   finished goods in the PPI, as we know, are still showing fairly high rates of increase  Some models   of inflation—time series models—show more-elevated rates of increase and a higher probability of   November 10, 2004 54 of 107    increases above our comfort range  Inflation expectations at the one-year and up to the five-year   horizon have moved up again materially—though, of course, some of that is just the response to   inflation in the pipeline from recent energy price increases   We face the same familiar risks to the outlook, which I won’t go through  The dollar’s   resumed decline has so far come without significant negative effects on risk premiums on other   financial assets in the United States or, I think, significant apparent damage to confidence in   Europe, Japan, and the other economies that have let their currencies move up against the dollar  I   think it’s very good to see some modest flexibility arising in many emerging Asian currencies, even   though China has yet to move  Perhaps this offers some comfort about the prospects for a benign   deflation of the US imbalance, but the magnitudes of these changes in relative growth rates and   exchange rates obviously aren’t large enough to make much difference now  We live, therefore,   with the vulnerability—of an indeterminate but growing probability—of a substantial change in the   terms on which nonresidents are willing to finance us  The world’s savers may still be somewhat   underinvested in foreign assets in general, but they seem to be quite concentrated in US assets    Our productivity growth premium doesn’t seem that high relative to the plausible estimates of the   dollar decline ahead  We have focused here so far primarily on scenarios that anticipate a very   benign adjustment process that’s basically positive on net for the United States and not that   damaging for the rest of the world  Perhaps it makes sense for us to think a bit more about those   scenarios that come with a lot more collateral damage   I think that we should leave our signal largely intact as we move today  The language of   qualified optimism we’ve used to describe the near-term outlook seems about right  I don’t see a   strong case for trying to convey more confidence or more concern at this stage  I think it’s a good   thing for us that the market is now pricing in a greater than 50 percent probability of a move in   December  In my view, we should seek to leave unchanged the market’s expectation of the path of   November 10, 2004 55 of 107    the fed funds rate going forward  We don’t know enough now to justify trying to talk them into a   different view in either direction   Now, on the questions of when to pause, how to transition to a slower pace of increases, and   the slope of the funds rate path going forward, we’re obviously approaching a more complicated set   of judgments  For now I think we want to continue to convey the sense that we plan to move   further over the course of this year toward a more positive real fed funds rate, though of course at a   pace that adjusts with changes to our evolving forecast   I would not be that comfortable with a presumption of a flat fed funds rate for most of 2005   or with that as the presumptive path from which we would deviate only in the event of a very   positive shock to growth or a negative upward surprise in inflation  I’d be more comfortable in a   world where we keep the presumption of a positive slope for the course of 2005  We can move in   either direction from that path depending on how events unfold  I think we would have to have a   fair amount of confidence that we are in the midst of a few quarters of significantly below-trend   growth to justify pushing expectations in the market down toward a flatter path  I’d rather take the   risk in the approach that’s now priced into the market than the risk that the fed funds rate would get   stuck too low for too long and thus face greater risk of inducing unanticipated changes in the rate in   the future  Thank you  "
7813,2004-11-10,"  I support your recommendations  I wish I knew what I   thought about the desired statement!  [Laughter]  I would just point out not only that the market   now expects us to slow the pace of increase significantly from what we’ve been doing but also that   the minutes from our last meeting have some nice artful language near the end—which is probably   November 10, 2004 90 of 107    relevant to some of the concerns many of you expressed—saying that the market has not   misinterpreted us as signaling a steady reflexive march up at 25 basis points per meeting  I think   the minutes are helpful against that risk of being misinterpreted, and I look forward to a discussion   about the future structure of the statement in December and beyond   SPEAKER(?)  You may be the only one!  [Laughter]  "
7865,2004-12-14,"  I support early release  We don’t have to do this, but I   think it’s the sensible thing to do, and I think it’s the sensible time to do it  I can’t improve on the   arguments made in favor of it by Don, Gary, and Ben  I would say, Bill, that the argument you led   off with is sort of an argument for extending the delay and taking release of the minutes out of the   time frame when they would be viewed as having any signal value for the future stance of monetary   policy  You weren’t advocating that, but I think it’s awkward to suggest that we should release the   minutes outside the time period of the meeting to which they relate  In my view it’s better to take   the risk of some noise added to the signal by releasing the minutes between meetings, closer to the   relevant meeting, than to have the risk that the release comes after a new policy decision has been   made and thus creates broad confusion about how to interpret the minutes in that context  Generally   I think early release will add more perspective to our views about the outlook for inflation and   output growth and will provide more context to the range of views across the Committee    Therefore, I believe it will give people a better sense of the factors shaping our decision, and in that   sense, I think it would be helpful     Mr Chairman, just one more question or suggestion for   Vincent  Maybe you’ve already considered this  When you release the minutes for the first time,   you might want to consider adding some of the Secretariat’s clarifying information about the   conventions in the language—an explanation of some of the terminology  I don’t know if you were   intending to do that, but I think it would be helpful      And the hierarchy of the language around the terms   “majority” and “several” and so forth might be helpful, too   December 14, 2004 102 of 118          "
7866,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m overwhelmed, as   always, by the intelligence and imagination of the staff, [laughter] and I don’t have too much to add    Our view of the outlook hasn’t changed much since our last meeting, and we’re very close to the   Greenbook on most dimensions of the forecast  The sentiment in New York seems to have become   December 14, 2004 42 of 118           a bit more positive over the last few months  Our forthcoming Empire survey for December has   very strong readings and shows a very substantial improvement in most measures—orders,   shipments, employment, and general conditions   Nationally, we see more momentum in demand growth going into the new year  The main   fundamentals of an expansion at slightly above trend growth seem intact  Global demand growth is   a little softer but still pretty good  Our forecast for real GDP growth remains between 3½ and   4 percent for ’05 and ’06, with core PCE in the neighborhood of 1½ percent, with a path for   monetary policy close to that now reflected in the market  We see the risks as roughly balanced   around this forecast, with a bit less downside risk to growth and somewhat greater probability of a   higher inflation outcome than we thought a few months ago   We’re at least one quarter and perhaps two quarters now into a different constellation of   factors affecting inflation fundamentals  productivity growth slowing significantly, unit labor costs   rising at a rate perhaps slightly above that of core PCE, and margins starting to come in a bit  Even   allowing for the normal fog that surrounds these judgments, this constellation of factors seems   likely to continue over at least part of the forecast period  This transition comes on top of an   environment with significant other cost pressures in the pipeline, a declining dollar, a smaller output   gap—with the gap perhaps now within the margin of error—and demand growth, as I said, slightly   above trend    Inflation expectations are sticking at a level somewhat above what we consider comfortable   or consistent with our implicit inflation target, even though they have come off a bit since our last   meeting  So in this context, I think the overall stance of monetary policy should continue to be   directed at moving the real fed funds rate higher, with a significant positive slope to the path of the   fed funds rate for the forecast period  I don’t see a compelling reason to seek to alter the market’s   December 14, 2004 43 of 118           expectations today for the near-term path of the funds rate  This suggests a signal today that is   neutral to present market expectations, which I think implies very little change to the structure or   content of our statement   Now, would leaving market expectations unchanged today risk leaving the stance of   monetary policy too tight and jeopardize the expansion?  I think that seems unlikely  Might we end   up having to move further and faster in ’05 than is now priced into the futures path?  Possibly  On   balance, I think the probability that we will end up moving along a path that is slightly steeper than   is now priced in seems to exceed the probability that we’d move on a path that is softer than what is   now priced in  But we don’t face that choice today  I think the best way of avoiding a more   damaging adjustment to balance sheets or a more damaging adjustment to the overall economy, as   we move on this path to equilibrium, is to continue to make sure we move far enough fast enough   that we don’t raise the risk that we end up having to catch up and move more abruptly in response to   a rise in expectations  Thank you  "
7867,2004-12-14,"  Oh, no!  [Laughter]     I support your recommendation  "
7930,2005-02-01," Thank you I think anybody who looks at US monetary   policy today and in the recent past would have to be impressed with what this Committee has   achieved And I can’t really imagine any other regime under which I’d rather live and have to make   policy There are two aspects of our current regime that give me some discomfort  One is that I’m a   little troubled by the concern that exists, not just around this table but more broadly, that there is an   undesirable degree of ambiguity in our communications to the public regarding our objective for and   our definition of price stability  I am uncomfortable with the extent to which the people who   actually think about and make policy believe there is some ambiguity in how we define our price-  stability objective The other piece of our regime that gives me a little discomfort is how we think   about the forecast and how we explain at each meeting the basis for our decision   I think it is worth investing time and effort in thinking through those two attributes of our   regime—which are the two things that in my view distinguish us from most other credible central   banks in serious countries—in terms of whether we can do somewhat better than we do now and   how to do that And I, for one, would prefer to invest time thinking this through while this Chairman   sits in that chair than I would deferring further consideration of these questions until some more   remote time in the future   I do think that the issue on the table, even though it’s presented in a very qualified soft form,   would amount to a change in the regime  I don’t really think one can think about the merits—and in   my view most of you addressed the merits appropriately—without a change in regime  To me this   would be—just to invoke an awkward metaphor—a regime change of choice, not a regime change   of necessity And, as in the case of war, those are the kinds of decisions that we should make   cautiously and only after considering very carefully the full implications of the change and how we   would live within and operate in that regime  And I don’t believe we’re in a position at the moment           February 1-2, 2005 56 of 177  to make that kind of judgment about a regime change, despite the fact that there’s a fair degree of   consensus around the Committee on many of the questions that were raised   I am uncomfortable with any change that would require us to seek the consent or explicit   approval of the Administration or the Congress, even if it didn’t require a change in legislation  My   gut feeling is that there are huge risks for us in that process and that it would be damaging to our   credibility and damaging to the independence of this institution  So I would take that step with great   reluctance   I would also want to consider very carefully the implications of this change in regime for   how we communicate about monetary policy, and I do not believe that our communication policy, as   it now stands, is up to that challenge We would have to adjust our communications in some way,   and I think it would take a lot of careful work to decide how we should talk about monetary policy in   this new world We should discuss fully the attributes of the communications process we would use   in connection with this change before we actually do it   I would want to be very comfortable that there is a very strong consensus—it may require   unanimity—of the Committee about all of the important attributes of this basic regime and what they   mean  On all the questions raised by Vincent I think we’d want to have a very high degree of   consensus Before we launch a new approach, we’d want to know that we agree on what is a   credible or optimal way to proceed  I’m not sure we know what that is  But if there is an optimal   way to do this, I’d want to know that the consensus is going to be close to that before I moved   The questions that have been raised—how we talk about the time horizon, how we resolve   the debate about zone versus point, how we think about where to set the upper end of the zone if it is   a zone, and what our tolerance is for deviations from the upper or the lower end of the zone for long   periods of time—are the sort of questions that we have to think through carefully and about which   we need a fair degree of comfort that we have a common understanding of what our answers mean   for monetary policy before we launch a new regime           February 1-2, 2005 57 of 177  Let me just end with a somewhat awkward point, which relates to the succession process    We are going to have a new Chairman in the not-too-distant future  Even if there were unanimity   around this table that we should go this route, I don’t think it is a decision we should make at this   time  I do not believe it would be fair to the Chairman’s successor to bequeath to him or her this   change in regime  I say that in part because it’s appropriate deference to the successor, but also   because operating within this regime—which I think is the equivalent of a soft, flexible, inflation   targeting regime—may be difficult to do  It will put a much greater burden on communication  The   challenges of how to explain monetary policy in this context will increase  Let’s ask ourselves   whether we would be taking a step that would be beneficial to the Chairman’s successor in forcing   that person to operate at the beginning with a much greater burden of communication  In that   context, I think moving forward at this time may not actually help the credibility of monetary policy   and may hurt it  I think it would be a challenge that would test the competence of any plausible   successor, and it would take a fair amount of time for anybody to be comfortable operating in that   regime   So, I’m in a slightly awkward position, in the sense that I think there is a lot of merit in   exploring an evolution in the US monetary policy regime and our communication regime around   these two dimensions which now distinguish us from other models out there  I think the arguments   in favor of moving in this direction are reasonably compelling and have a lot of merit  But I don’t   believe that it would be prudent to move in that direction now, without a much more careful and   thoughtful deliberation So I would encourage us to use the next six months, year, or perhaps   eighteen months to think through the implications of living within a regime like the one being   considered, rather than put this in a little box and come back to it a decade from now, which is in   some sense what we’ve done since 1996  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
7931,2005-02-01," We haven’t changed our view of the national outlook   significantly since the last meeting  Our forecast is quite close to the Greenbook in all components,   and quite close, I think, to the central tendency of the rest of your forecasts I don’t have anything   material to report about the economy of the Second District that I think has relevance to the national   outlook   On the assumption that monetary policy follows a path close to that now priced into markets,   we expect growth to be above potential over the forecast period, at slightly above 3½ percent, with   core PCE inflation staying around 1½ percent We think the distribution of probabilities around that   forecast is roughly balanced, and we have somewhat more confidence in our forecast this time than   we did at the last FOMC meeting  At the margin, we see less downside risk to the growth forecast   than we have over the past few meetings    The resilience of the expansion in the face of recent shocks, the breadth of underlying   strength in the main components of GDP except net exports, the fundamental sources that seem   likely to underpin a continuation of recently strong consumer spending and investment, the survey-  based measures of consumer and business confidence, the anecdotal reports of somewhat diminished   business caution, and the moderate pace of the expansion so far all seem to add to the arguments in   favor of a forecast for solid growth slightly above trend                     February 1-2, 2005 111 of 177  There is some talk among people who run major global corporations in New York about   fragility remaining in the outlook, about a world of lower growth and higher volatility, about more   lurches in the outlook for economic activity and asset prices  But I think the overall tone is a bit   more positive; it has become progressively more positive over the last few months   On the inflation outlook, we face diminished risk of a significant decline in inflation from   current levels and somewhat higher risk of some acceleration of inflation from these moderate   levels, although the recent news, of course, has been reassuring As productivity growth slows,   resource utilization increases, and unit labor costs accelerate, we lose some of the cushion that has   supported what has been a very benign performance of inflation recently  Profit margins are   substantial enough to absorb significant acceleration in labor costs and other costs, but firms seem to   be reporting increasing pricing power still With the markets apparently confident that we will   continue to move the fed funds rate closer to equilibrium—whatever that is—we’ve been successful   in keeping inflation expectations stable at relatively low levels   This forecast, of course, looks implausibly benign  It’s hard to imagine that the path of the   economy between now and the end of 2006 will materialize as the consensus not just around this   table but among private forecasts seems to envision  The confidence around this view, which is   evident in low credit spreads—low risk premia generally—and low expected volatility, leaves one, I   think, somewhat uneasy  The general reduction in fear and uncertainty that now prevails has the   effect of making everything look better  But, of, course it also may increase our vulnerability to   some adverse shock and could magnify the effects of some types of shocks   The greatest risk to the forecast, I believe, involves this combination of very low risk premia   with our large growing external imbalance, uncertainty about the prospects for a meaningful   improvement in the fiscal baseline, and uncertainty about the sustainability of high structural   productivity growth Together, these factors increase the probability of some unwelcome surprise—   some unwelcome shock to asset prices which, of course, could feed into a substantial slowdown in   consumer spending                       February 1-2, 2005 112 of 177  Obviously, it would not make sense for us to use our monetary policy signal to reintroduce   more cautious risk premia and greater uncertainty  But we probably need to be careful over time, to   the extent that it is possible, to avoid doing things that reinforce an unhealthy degree of confidence   in the future path of the fed funds rate or leave that path less responsive to changes in the data and   the outlook   Monetary policy should, in my view, continue to be directed at moving the fed funds rate   higher toward a level more comfortably in the range of equilibrium and at convincing markets that   we will continue to move the funds rate higher at a pace determined by our evolving view of the   outlook—that is, sufficiently fast to keep inflation expectations stable at low levels  I don’t know   whether that path will end up being steeper or softer than what is now priced into markets  As we   move today, I think the signal in our statement should try to be neutral to the expectations now   prevailing about the near-term path of monetary policy  Thank you  "
7932,2005-02-01," Vincent, in exhibit 2, this is a measure of the point on the   calendar where the market expects us to stop?    Again, I’m sorry to ask this; I should know the answer    But are you projecting forward the range of estimated equilibrium real rates?    That they move sideways?  Does that make sense?    Wouldn’t that significantly alter the path in the upper   panels if that were true?                              February 1-2, 2005 127 of 177   Should we infer from your presentation that you would   not change the structure of this paragraph until we reach the point where the probability of a move   up equals the probability of a move down?  Would you say that the point at which the desirable path   of the fed funds rate is flat is the optimal time for evolution or would it be ahead of that point?    You’d say that would be an obvious intermediate change    I have one more question  Should one also infer from   your presentation that you think the optimal path of monetary policy in the period ahead is to get   behind us all the moves necessary to get the funds rate closer to the midpoint of the range of its   equilibrium?  Are you saying that we should steadily get those moves done, so we get more quickly   to the point where one could expect a flatter path going forward, or are you not suggesting that?    And yet if you repeat that language in the minutes again,   as you suggested, reasonable people might interpret that as a conscious decision to try to signal in                    February 1-2, 2005 130 of 177  some sense that a pause is approaching  That’s a little awkward to justify, given that we’re in a   period of time where I think the probability the market is attributing to the next three moves is higher   than it has been over the last six to nine months    I support your recommendation  "
7992,2005-03-22, So moved  
7993,2005-03-22," Karen, could you give us a fair and balanced view—   [laughter]—of the significance of the changes to the Stability and Growth Pact?  On net, are they   really that bad?  The market didn’t seem terribly worried about what they mean for fiscal policy   going forward There were some aspects of the revised agreement that might be regarded as a   tightening, which I don’t really understand What is your assessment?    But they didn’t accommodate greater cyclical   divergence on their path    It really is accommodating structural changes that go   in the wrong direction to the objectives even if those changes otherwise make some sense    PAYGO does not apply  [Laughter]    I have no humor in my statement and nothing that differs   from the consensus    Careful [Laughter]  The near-term outlook appears more   favorable to us, as it does to everybody else We have moved up our forecast to reflect stronger­  than-anticipated underlying growth and somewhat greater price pressure  On the expectation that   we will move the fed funds rate up at the somewhat steeper path now priced in the market, we now   expect real GDP to grow at a roughly 4 percent pace in real terms this year before moderating to   around 3½ in 2006 And with this tighter monetary policy assumption, we expect core PCE to come   in a bit above 1½ percent but not above 2 percent   As this implies, we are very close to the Greenbook on the broad outlines of the story and   quite close in the components, too  We have a bit more investment and less consumption and a little   higher net export drag this year We have productivity growth a bit stronger but compensation                             March 22, 2005 54 of 116  growth and unit labor costs a bit softer But overall we have a very similar view to the staff forecast   on the broad forces supporting the expansion And we are quite comfortable, as a result, with the   case this story presents for tightening policy further and for signaling more tightening to come   We see the risks as roughly balanced around this slightly higher path for growth and   inflation If there’s a case for asymmetry or less balance in our uncertainty, it seems more likely to   be on the upside than on the downside The rise in the two- to five-year inflation expectations in   TIPS, in the face of what is otherwise reasonably encouraging news on inflation fundamentals, bears   careful monitoring  We now face a lower probability that the core PCE will come in at 1½ percent   rather than above, and this itself suggests a higher path for the nominal fed funds rate   The anecdotal stories seem to have improved alongside the strengthening of private   forecasts Our Empire State Survey shows greater confidence—greater optimism about the next six   months—than we’ve seen in some time  I think we should be relatively comfortable, therefore, with   both the direction and magnitude of the change since our last meeting in market expectations   regarding the likely path of the fed funds rate I would be somewhat more comfortable if the market   were pricing in a somewhat higher probability of a 50 basis point move at some point in the near   term  I say this not because I think we can make the case now that we will need to move by 50 basis   points any time soon but simply because we need to make sure that we have the flexibility to do so   One of the consequences of the structure of our statements these days, at least until very   recently, is that the markets have responded to stronger data or more inflation risks by raising the   probability of another 25 basis point increase beyond the next meeting or two, but not by pricing in   any significant probability of a steeper slope than 25 per meeting  This has contributed to a   remarkable reduction in uncertainty about monetary policy expectations, which in turn has   reinforced other factors that have worked to bring about this broad pattern now evident of lower risk                             March 22, 2005 55 of 116  premia across financial markets  Part of this is due to fundamentals, but part seems due to our   monetary policy signal     At the margin, this implied ceiling on the slope of the path toward equilibrium raises the   possibility that we will be perceived at some point as taking some risk of getting behind inflation   expectations Buying some insurance against this prospective small cloud on our credibility is   prudent risk management  This argues for adjusting our statement to condition or qualify   “measured,” and for doing so ahead of when we might be forced to  This makes sense even if we   don’t want to significantly steepen the implied path at this point  Buying this flexibility now may   entail some modest steepening in the path, but some risk in that direction is worth it  The additional   benefit in gradually exiting from the “measured pace” language as we approach equilibrium, of   course, is that it will prepare the ground for a flatter path when that proves appropriate   Greater confidence in the sustainability of the main forces driving the expansion suggests   that the greatest risks to the forecast, apart from some shock, still lie in the imbalances we face in our   economy  Those imbalances are evident in the combination of the sustained rise in household debt,   the projected increase in public debt, and the deterioration in our net international position This   probably argues for trying to get the real fed funds rate up to a more positive level than might   otherwise have seemed appropriate  That will help provide more traction—or at least some traction,   since we don’t see much traction yet—to the process of adjustment, allowing the forces of gravity to   contribute to a more gradual unwinding of these internal and external imbalances and reducing some   of the risk in the forecast A more contractionary fiscal policy stance would make this less   necessary, but this does not now seem in prospect  Thank you  "
7994,2005-03-22," I think there’s a disadvantage in validating the market’s   current expectations so explicitly There are two ways to think about framing our policy assumption   or giving a signal One is to say, “with policy unchanged, et cetera” The other is to say, “taking the   expected path now priced in the markets, we think X”  That’s an approach a number of central   banks have taken   To me it doesn’t make sense to make that significant a change in our basic signal at this time;   I think there’s a lot of risk in a validation that explicit  In my view, there’s actually a lot of virtue in   the combination of these changes to the statement, because they condition and qualify “measured”   without taking that word out So it’s a move in the direction of giving us more flexibility without   claiming we think there’s been any abrupt change in the balance of risks  As Vincent said, we can   fall back on making explicit what has been implicit—which is that the risks have been balanced only   if we commit to do the right thing  If you don’t believe we’re going to do the right thing, …    I support your recommendation to move 25 basis points,   and I support alternative B as described here Actually, I think it’s a pretty good statement,   considering the alternatives [Laughter] It does two important things in that it conveys an evolution   in our signal in two respects It acknowledges the change in the outlook in important dimensions,   and it conveys more qualification and conditions on our serenity in a way that introduces more   uncertainty I think it’s also desirable that it does so in a nice, relatively delicate way, and I believe   it’s a pretty good outcome—again, relative to the alternatives                                   March 22, 2005 100 of 116  It’s less clear to me what is going to make sense at the next meeting  Obviously, we’re   probably going to want to look at a broader range of changes to the statement, but I don’t know what   those are going to entail And I suspect there’s some risk that we’re going to find that we’re more   comfortable with a less dramatic evolution than may be implied for the statement   Let me make one comment on the minutes  There’s a risk that the minutes, if they look more   like a transcript, would suggest that we were all over the map, with a very thin consensus regarding   anything about how to craft a signal for monetary policy  To me that would not do justice to the   Committee and the discussion  I think the minutes would be best designed—I know we can’t   massage them ex ante—if they just acknowledge the reality that we want to take a look at a number   of different dimensions about the signal when we convene in May and if they convey some of our   motivation for wanting to look at that  I think that can be done without going so far as to suggest   that our views are all over the map on this and that we’re fundamentally uncomfortable  "
8044,2005-05-03," David, you referred in your remarks to the exercise   shown in the package of materials for Monday’s Board briefing  I’m looking at the pass-through   into core inflation of the rise in energy prices, import prices, and commodity prices  If back in   December ’03, which is your baseline for this exercise, you had had a forecast for energy prices,   commodity prices, import prices, and the dollar that is consistent with what happened, would you   have expected your model to show this much pass-through to core inflation prices?  Or would this   result have been surprising?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  We think the fundamentals   underpinning a forecast of a reasonably strong expansion with moderate inflation seem reasonably   persuasive However, we are less confident than we were at the last meeting  On the assumption   that we continue to move the fed funds rate higher on a path close to that now in the market, we   expect the economy to grow at a 3½ percent rate during the balance of this year and in 2006  And   we still expect core PCE inflation to come in below 2 percent, although just below, over the balance   of the forecast period, but we think it will follow a somewhat higher path  As this implies, we’re   very close to the Greenbook projection on the overall contour of the forecast, and we’re close on the   components as well   We see greater uncertainty in the forecast, with some downside risk to growth and some   upside risk to inflation We think the probability of inflation coming in higher is greater than the   probability that growth will be lower And, of course, that judgment about the change in relative   probabilities is the key to one’s judgment for monetary policy                                    May 3, 2005 56 of 116  On the growth front, the anecdotal reports we’re exposed to are weaker than they have been   They’re weaker than the national numbers and may imply some further deceleration ahead  We   don’t have much basis for confidence that these numbers tell us much about the future, but the   sentiment does seem a bit more fragile  The fact that confidence seems to have eroded so quickly in   the face of a relatively limited period of weaker numbers might itself suggest greater vulnerability to   the forecast   Despite all of this, though, we think the near-term fundamentals of the economy look fairly   good The resilience of the recent past seems likely to be durable  We think the labor market still   looks to be on a path of gradual improvement  Investment growth still seems likely to be pretty   healthy, with profit margins high, balance sheets strong, and credit conditions favorable  We think   the factors supporting solid investment growth remain compelling  And we still are inclined to   believe that structural productivity growth is likely to remain strong, which should provide both   continued impetus to investment and continued confidence about future income growth  It’s hard to   find other constraints out there that could limit the expansion  Of course, we still face some risk of   an abrupt change in household saving behavior, and the effects of that could be significant   On the inflation front, we’ve been surprised by the extent of the acceleration in core prices   and we are a bit concerned about the higher expectations reflected in some surveys  The economy is   growing at a rate that seems likely to be sufficient to continue to absorb remaining slack, unit labor   costs have moved up, and we hear continued reports of increased pricing power  And some   measures of expectations at the intermediate horizon—the horizon over which we expect monetary   policy can affect inflation—are above the desirable level of inflation  Accordingly, we see greater   risk that inflation will follow a higher path than we are comfortable with  This seems a prudent view   of the risks to us, despite the comfort we continue to derive from the fact that compensation growth                                       May 3, 2005 57 of 116  has been modest to date—profit margins remain very high, of course—and despite expectations of   fairly good future structural productivity growth   The modest widening in credit spreads and the volatility in equity prices we’ve seen recently   have been absorbed reasonably well I’d be inclined to view this modest repricing of risk and   uncertainty as welcome and healthy rather than as foreshadowing a deeper, more protracted   deceleration   On balance, we believe that monetary policy should continue to be directed at moving the   real fed funds rate higher At our last meeting we introduced a bit more uncertainty into the   monetary policy signal by putting in more qualifications about the likely path of monetary policy   going forward and about the cumulative amount of tightening  The overall effect of these changes to   our statement was to continue to signal that we think the slope of the funds rate path remains   positive, implying, of course, that monetary policy is still too accommodative  But we also   indicated, through these changes to this statement, that we have less certainty about the slope and   shape of that path   Long-term measures of inflation expectations moderated immediately following the meeting,   and some measures of uncertainty about future rates went up  And since then, market participants   have demonstrated a very significant degree of sensitivity to incoming data—at least in terms of the   fed funds path priced into the markets  To me this suggests that we got the balance about right last   time  We bought ourselves the desirable increase in flexibility to respond to a somewhat more   uncertain set of conditions going forward, and I think we should try to preserve that balance in our   signal today We need to acknowledge, of course, the moderation in the rate of growth in output   and demand we’ve seen and the higher inflation numbers, but I don’t see a good reason to try to alter   in either direction the expectations for the path of the fed funds rate going forward                                 May 3, 2005 58 of 116  The increased uncertainty in the market about the forecast reflects some greater dispersion in   the likely path of the fed funds rate, and I think it suggests little gap between the market’s view and   our own view of policy uncertainty going forward So I don’t see a case for altering the statement   significantly today in a way that would introduce a greater degree of uncertainty about monetary   policy than is already reflected in the markets at this point  Thank you  "
8045,2005-05-03," I think it makes sense for us to raise the funds rate 25   basis points, and I support alternative B Fortunately, we don’t need to decide today whether this   statement is going to make sense in its current structure in June or in August or October  We can   make the decision at those times  The only thing we need to decide today is whether we want to   alter significantly the expectations now priced in the markets for the future path of the fed funds rate    And I agree with what a number of you said—that there’s not a compelling case for doing so    The second thing one can say we need to decide is whether we want to introduce more   uncertainty or greater dispersion around the set of expectations that now exists  Again, I don’t think   there’s a compelling case for us to try to do that as a conscious act of signaling today  I think   alternative B is actually a pretty good signal for today, and I don’t actually know what is going to   make sense in June or for the structure of the statement going forward  "
8094,2005-06-29,"  I remember that bubble!  [Laughter]  I have two   questions My first is for John Williams or perhaps for Dave Stockton  What is the right way to   think about dealing with uncertainty in considering the policy question?  Put aside Glenn’s question   about whether you know anything ever about the relationship between prices and fundamentals at a   given point  What if what you don’t know is simply the likely path of home prices going forward?   You could take the group here around the table and assume some path, but there would be a fairly   fat band of uncertainty around that path  What does your regime imply, John, for policy in that   particular circumstance?  Do you basically ignore housing prices and look at all the other things we   look at?     And you wait and see and then adjust course based on   developments as they unfold     My second question is about policy, but not monetary   policy  Glenn, in your note, you allude to other instruments if monetary policy doesn’t seem to be   the appropriate tool to address a concern about lower value prices  What do we know about the   history of the use of the supervisory tool in past periods of concern about real estate bubbles or   imprudent lending?  Do we have a rich history on the use of those instruments that tells us   something about the efficacy or about our foresight in deploying them?     Since the bills doctrine  [Laughter]     I meant in our history  In our history, have we used that   tool to good or ill effect?  Have we used it wisely and with foresight?                                                 June 29-30, 2005 45 of 234    Is the history one of using it too late, or of using it and its   having no effect because there are other ways to get money?  "
8095,2005-06-29,"  So moved     Let me just follow this conversation a little further  If I   get this right, what is new in the forecast, based on this conversation today, is that you’re   anticipating a little more persistence in what we view as the underlying rate of the core PCE   deflator  And it ends the forecast period higher than we previously expected  Again, that is in the   context of a forecast where you’re expecting both oil and commodity prices—and import prices,   too, I think—not to be a source of negative pressure  They constitute a sort of positive factor on the   inflation dynamic  And you’re expecting structural productivity growth to stay fairly high  What is   interesting, I think, is that you haven’t changed your implied path for the fed funds rate   significantly  I guess my question is Why is that?  It’s not that your growth forecast has come   down and is significantly softer  It’s not as if you’re substantially more pessimistic on the outlook   for growth relative to potential  So why wouldn’t that view on inflation, if it’s right, have induced   you to prescribe a slightly higher path?                                             June 29-30, 2005 97 of 234    If I understood the Bluebook discussion of this correctly,   in that optimal control exercise, whatever its merits, with your assumption about the symmetrical   tolerance or intolerance to deviation from your objectives, still you have the nominal funds rate   going to 4 percent with an inflation objective assumption of 1½ percent in that context  And the   difference between that view and the view that you put into the Greenbook, which I realize is not a   prescription—I’m sorry I used that term—is what explains the difference between those two things?     But are you assuming a higher implicit inflation   objective in the way you think about the Greenbook construct?     I wanted to ask a different question on the international   side  Karen, on the external forecast, how much of a change is this view of where the current   account-GDP ratio goes relative to your expectation six months ago or thereabouts?  It seems to me   that it looks slightly darker    Yes, that’s my point  Where do you expect it to stabilize   now?     No What happens to the current account if you project   out a little longer than the forecast horizon you have now?     I know, but it crosses 8 percent and goes to what?                         June 29-30, 2005 99 of 234    Thank you We’re somewhat more confident in the   strength and sustainability of the expansion than we were in May  Our view is very similar to the   staff forecast We expect real GDP growth to average roughly 3½ percent over the forecast period    We expect core PCE to follow a somewhat higher path and to end the forecast period slightly higher   than we expected in May, at just under 2 percent    This forecast assumes that we’ll continue to tighten monetary policy, perhaps by a bit more   than foreseen in the staff forecast and than is currently priced into the market  To us, the risks to   this forecast seem roughly balanced  We see no new sources of potential risk  This is not to say   that the usual sources of uncertainty and the usual candidates for a negative surprise are not                                  June 29-30, 2005 138 of 234  daunting It’s worth noting, though, that these risks—from a cliff in housing prices to a sharp   increase in household saving, to a larger and more sustained oil shock, to less favorable future   productivity outcomes, to a sharp increase in risk premia or to declines in asset prices—in general   are risks that we can’t really mitigate substantially ex ante through monetary policy   However, by making sure we get the real fed funds rate up to a more comfortable level we   can help  The alternative strategy, to oversimplify it, would be to follow a softer path for monetary   policy to provide a preemptive cushion against the negative effects on employment of a fall in   housing prices, a rise in risk premia, some rise in saving and a fall in consumption, and so forth    This would, I believe, be a less prudent strategy   Although there have been persistent concerns about the vulnerability of this expansion and   about some of its less robust characteristics, the two most remarkable aspects of this recovery are   encouraging The first is its resilience  So far, each episode of incipient softness has proved to be   shallow in depth and short in duration  Despite very prolonged and substantial headwinds in the   context of an oil shock, a large ongoing drag from net exports, a significant tightening of financial   conditions, a modest withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, etc, quarterly GDP growth—as Janet said— has   shown impressive stability around a 3½ percent annual rate over the last year and a half  And this is   a dramatic reduction in realized macroeconomic volatility  It makes the much-heralded “great   moderation” look turbulent    The second positive feature of this period has been the behavior of underlying inflation and   inflation expectations  Of course, underlying inflation seems to have moved up a bit, but large   changes in oil and commodity prices and import prices have produced periods of substantial   acceleration in headline inflation without, at least to this point, causing more than short-lived   upward moves in core inflation or inflation expectations                             June 29-30, 2005 139 of 234  The behavior of productivity growth and expectations about future productivity growth   explain some of this Also important, of course, is the credibility engendered by the record of the   FOMC  Changes in the structure of the financial system must matter, too  There are almost surely   other factors—luck for one—that are at work   Among the choices in Vincent Reinhart’s note on interest rates, I’m inclined to support the   more benign assessment of the recent behavior of forward interest rates and term premia, even   though these factors can’t fully explain those moves, and even though the future may prove to be   more volatile and adverse than the markets now seem to expect and than those explanations would   imply     So what about monetary policy going forward?  There are two salient dimensions of the   forecast One, of course, is growth slightly above trend from a starting point where the remaining   amount of resource slack, if any, is substantially diminished  The other is an underlying inflation   rate—just to focus on the core PCE—that now seems to be running at a modest margin above 15   percent and that we expect will end the forecast period above 15 percent  And inflation   expectations, at the horizon over which monetary policy operates and with reasonable adjustments   to translate them into a view on the PCE deflator, are still some margin above 15 percent     We don’t consider this inflation forecast a cause for serious concern  We anticipate upward   pressures on inflation from some firming of compensation growth and from higher unit labor costs    We expect those pressures will face the countervailing forces of relatively moderate inflation   expectations, strong competitive pressures, still substantial profit margins, the potential for some   increase in the labor force participation rate, and pretty strong expected future productivity growth   And yet it should matter to us that, even in a world where the nominal fed funds rate peaks   at 4 percent, models envision a relatively extended period during which the core PCE deflator stays                                June 29-30, 2005 140 of 234  meaningfully above 15 percent  The range of estimates in the forecasts and model simulations   before us, and the expectations we can derive from the market, place the terminal rate of the   nominal fed funds rate now between 3½ and 4½ or between 3¾ and perhaps 4¼ percent  These   estimates have moved down a bit over the last few months, but the shape of the path has steepened a   bit I don’t think we really know how much confidence we can have in these estimates, even if the   forecast unfolds as we expect today  But my view remains that we are better off following a path   that would put us at the higher end of these estimates than in taking the risk of doing too little and   stopping prematurely or trying to manage the communication challenges of a temporary pause when   we still believe we have further to go  Thank you  "
8096,2005-06-29,"  Mr Chairman, I support your proposal to raise the fed   funds rate another 25 basis points, and I support the language in alternative B, which I believe is   accurately represented on this piece of paper  In my view, this statement is as close to neutral as we   could get relative to current expectations, and I think that’s the appropriate signal for us to deliver at   this time  "
8157,2005-08-09,"  So moved      As opposed to the others  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like everyone else, we think growth has   strengthened since our last meeting  We’re going into the second half with more forward   momentum, and this has been accompanied by a broad-based improvement in confidence about   the outlook We expect a stronger second half of ’05 than we did at the last meeting  But our   forecast for next year remains essentially unchanged, with real GDP growth still a bit above   potential—we think around 3½ percent—and the core PCE deflator at around 2 percent  On the   assumption that we move the fed funds rate up on the higher path now reflected in the market,                         August 9, 2005 62 of 110  the risks around this forecast seem broadly balanced to us, with perhaps a slightly greater   probability of outcomes on the higher side   As this implies, we’re very comfortable with the basic Greenbook view, the story behind   that view, and the evolution in the estimated output gap the Greenbook expects  I guess the one   qualification I’d mention is that we don’t see a strong case yet for as significant a downward   revision in our estimate of potential growth or actual growth in ’06   The fundamentals supporting consumption and investment growth still seem intact    Underlying productivity growth still seems fairly good  Real yields appear to have increased   materially, and equity prices, credit spreads, and risk premia generally suggest a pretty favorable   view of this expansion and its durability  Our various surveys of sentiment, formal and less   formal, support this more positive view of the national outlook     We think the underlying inflation rate is following a slightly higher trajectory than we   thought at the last meeting, and we think a lot of the forces at work in the economy that we have   discussed today will continue to put some upward pressure on the inflation rate going forward    But we don’t expect a significant acceleration in inflation above this 2 percent band, and that   view, of course, is consistent with the moderation in inflation expectations we’ve seen since the   start of the year However, even this relatively modest path leaves us some margin above the 1½   percent pace for the core PCE that we believe should be our objective over time  And, of course,   even this forecast of 2 percent could prove to be too benign    All of this suggests that we should try to design our monetary policy signal to achieve   three objectives  These will be familiar objectives  First, we should reinforce the sense that the   fed funds rate needs to move higher for us to achieve our price stability objective  Second, we   need to emphasize that the extent and pace of further moves will depend on how the outlook                         August 9, 2005 63 of 110  evolves We want to ensure that expectations of policy continue to be responsive to changes in   the forecast, and we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to alter the trajectory as   appropriate It’s important in this regard that we not give the market more certainty about the   future path of the fed funds rate than we can reasonably expect to have ourselves  I think we also   want to avoid conveying the sense that our task is simply to get to neutral, that we’re confident in   our estimates of what neutral is, and that we’re unlikely to need to move beyond that point  Even   if the data continue to support this very favorable forecast we all seem to share, we may find it   increasingly difficult to decide how far we’ll need to move  And, finally, given the move up   since June in the market’s expectation of the fed funds rate path, I think we should try to leave   the expected future path of the fed funds rate largely unchanged today—or perhaps a bit firmer    But I don’t see any reason now to try to induce, or to take the risk of inducing, a major shift in   current expectations Thank you  "
8158,2005-08-09," So you have the same path here for the reversion of the term premium   to its historic average as is in the Greenbook baseline?    I support your recommendation, and I agree on the   arguments made in favor of retaining the structure of paragraph four  Let me just add one   argument to those already made  Bill, if we look at your structure in terms of what we would be   changing from the June language in section four, all we’d be doing is adding the thought that   core inflation has been relatively low in recent months  So I think the net effect of that change                                     August 9, 2005 93 of 110  might be that it would come across as somewhat more reassuring than we would want  That’s   why I think the evolution in this language from the initial draft Brian circulated to the current   draft is actually good in capturing the sense of what is slightly different in the outlook  So I   think it has a slightly better balance as currently structured  "
8202,2005-09-20,"  So moved     Karen, do we know anything about the remaining   capacity—or perhaps I should say, the will and capacity—of those other countries that have   substantial stocks of refined products to release them to us if we had another significant supply   shock that affects refined product capacity?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The balance of evidence   since our last meeting still supports, in our view, a reasonably positive outlook for output and   inflation If we look through, as we should, the transitory effects of Katrina and the   reconstruction, and if we factor in what the futures market tells us about the expected magnitude   and duration of the rise in energy prices, we still see an economy growing slightly above trend   with core inflation following a path somewhat, but not substantially, above our preferred range    The fundamentals still seem favorable to continued expansion with solid productivity   growth, strong corporate balance sheets, reasonable growth in household income, and favorable   financial conditions And on the strength of this view, with real interest rates still quite low, we   believe that we need to continue to tighten monetary policy at this meeting and beyond  At the   national level, Katrina seems more consequential politically than economically                         September 20, 2005 73 of 117  Now, of course, the degree and balance of uncertainty has changed  We face a higher   degree of overall uncertainty It will be harder to assess over the next few quarters the   underlying pace of demand growth  The rise of energy prices pre-Katrina—some of which   remains even as the initial effects of the hurricane on expectations have washed out of energy   markets, except for natural gas—creates some risk of a larger shock to confidence and behavior   than seems to have been evident over the last two years  Damage from future hurricanes to   energy and product output may prove harder to bridge through the release of international   product reserves Our capacity to discern the underlying rate of inflation is also somewhat   diminished, perhaps less because of the effect of energy prices than the difficulty of sorting out   what is actually happening to productivity growth and unit labor costs   Apart from reducing overall confidence around the forecasts, the balance of risks has   probably shifted, too—shifted toward a somewhat higher probability of slower growth relative to   the path of potential output and toward a greater risk of a larger and more persistent rise in core   inflation If the former risk materialized, the latter might be mitigated  These are risks across the   spectrum of scenarios, rather than the most probable combination   But to acknowledge the change in uncertainty is not to suggest that it would be   appropriate for us to stop or to push down the expected path of the nominal fed funds rate until   we can better assess what we do not know now The net effect of the changes to the outlook, on   balance, probably does not alter the desirable path of the nominal fed funds rate relative to what   we thought in mid-August  With the real rate still rather low, my inclination would be to   continue to weight the upside risk to inflation as greater than the prospective risk of a significant   slowdown in output relative to potential  As best we can tell today, that latter risk of weaker                            September 20, 2005 74 of 117  growth is still only prospective This implies that the slope of the expected fed funds rate should   remain materially positive, even if we move today  And I think we would be better off after this   meeting if the markets raised the expected path a bit than if the path were to fall from its pre-  meeting trajectory    I think we probably know a little less today than we did in August about how far we are   going to have to move, even if the economy appears to be following the path of our forecast  If   we move today, all we know is that we’re 25 basis points higher than we were  The fact that we   are that much closer to some point we can’t measure is a less valuable observation  We may   even know less today about where equilibrium lies and whether that range has moved  And, of   course, we still face some probability that we’ll have to move past it, or past what in retrospect   we thought was equilibrium   Most of the hard questions we face look pretty much like they did at the last meeting    How strong and durable can we expect the expansion to be in the face of less optimism about   future housing price gains or other factors that could cause household saving to rise and   consumption to grow more slowly?  Will this dramatic rise in energy prices over the past two   years cause more substantial damage to business and consumer confidence?  Will the world’s   private savers continue to be willing to acquire claims on the United States at the higher rate   implied by our current account forecast, and to do so on such favorable terms?  Will business   margins start to erode in a way that will portend slower investment and employment growth?    Will the US political system be able to make a credible effort in the near term to improve our   medium-term fiscal position and sustain our relatively open trade policy?  And, if not, do we risk   a reduction in expected potential growth in the future?                   September 20, 2005 75 of 117  These are all factors that could hurt future growth, but that doesn’t mean that monetary   policy should be more accommodative than would otherwise make sense in anticipation of those   negative effects or should try to preempt them  Rather, these familiar imbalances and concerns   make the cost of any erosion in our credibility greater  Thank you  "
8203,2005-09-20, I support your recommendation  
8245,2005-11-01," Actually, I believe Colombia’s was pure local currency,   domestic, at a 10-year maturity for the first time in a long time       There’s a moral hazard in there, too, if you look at it    [Laughter]     Dino, did I hear you correctly?  What is the probability of   a move in March?  "
8246,2005-11-01,"  So moved      We view the balance of developments since the last   meeting as strengthening the case for further firming of monetary policy  The underlying pace of   demand growth seems reasonably strong—a bit stronger than we thought at our last meeting  The   inflation outlook to us looks largely the same as it did in September, with the expected path of core   inflation higher than we would like and some risk of further acceleration   On the assumption that we increase the fed funds rate on the higher trajectory now priced into   market expectations, our forecast is for growth to continue at a pace just above our estimates of                         November 1, 2005 62 of 114  potential in ’06—somewhere between 3 and 35 percent—and for the rate of increase in the core   PCE to stay in the vicinity of 2 percent  Of course, this has to be considered an implausibly benign   view of the world [laughter] and the expansion still faces a familiar array of risks  But we don’t see   evidence yet of a substantial slowdown in demand nor of a troubling acceleration in underlying   inflation   The balance of risks in this forecast has changed a bit  I’m a little less concerned that the   cumulative rise in energy prices will itself bring about a more substantial and extended slowdown in   growth, although that obviously has to remain a concern and possibly the principal risk to the   growth outlook We believe that the modest expected tightening of financial conditions will have   less of a dampening effect on demand growth than the Greenbook assumes  We don’t see strong   evidence yet of a significant deceleration in housing price appreciation or expectations of that   outcome in household spending behavior, although both would be desirable  The evidence of   strong stability in the growth of household consumption is, in a sense, borrowing against a future   cushion, and that perhaps raises the probability of a more adverse path to future consumption  But   it’s not here yet   As in September, the relative probabilities of alternative inflation outcomes still seem slightly   skewed to the upside, thus probably justifying more cumulative firming in monetary conditions    Core PCE has remained moderate, compensation growth modest, productivity growth strong, and   long-term inflation expectations reassuringly low  But the size of the rise in headline inflation and   the deterioration in near-term expectations creates the possibility of some further drift up in   underlying inflation if, as we expect, the labor market firms further and unit labor costs eventually   start to rise more rapidly  We’re seeing some drift upward in core inflation outside of the United   States                                          November 1, 2005 63 of 114  On balance, to us this suggests we need to make sure that the market remains confident we’ll   do enough to bring inflation and inflation expectations down over the next two years  To put it   differently, we should make sure that we take out enough insurance to avoid a more adverse   inflation outcome, and in this sense we should be pleased that the market has raised its estimate of   the terminal fed funds rate to around 4½ percent  Our statement today, I believe, should be   designed to be neutral to those expectations, rather than to raise or lower the expected path   I do think it would be helpful if the minutes reflected some discussion today about the   approaching need—the approaching need, not the need today—for some changes in the structure of   the statement We’ve been very fortunate to date in how well we have managed this transition in   monetary policy, with the market expecting a sustained period of tightening but its expectation of   the terminal fed funds rate varying with changes in the outlook   Our decision to put a soft,   qualified, conditional ceiling on the fed funds rate path at 25 basis points a meeting has not cost us   to date any erosion in long-term credibility, though it probably has encouraged the market’s   investors to take more duration risk  The remarkable stability in quarterly GDP growth and in core   inflation we’ve seen has tended to reinforce expectations about the outlook for monetary policy,   adding an unusual degree of certainty about the likely path of the fed funds rate     This has to change  As we become less certain about the path ahead, that increase in   uncertainty needs to get built into market expectations  The question is when and how we alter our   statement to reflect this  So far, the dominant strategy before us has been to keep moving 25 basis   points, to signal that we will continue to do so, and to defer any major changes to the structure of the   statement until we are confident we have made our last move  Now, this may turn out to be the   optimal choice, but the language feels increasingly stale  And it may be better, in fact, to change the   language before we are forced to, when we still believe we have some firming ahead of us  This                                              November 1, 2005 64 of 114  might make the transition ahead more gentle  It would give us more than one shot at recalibrating   the signal, and it might help bring the market’s uncertainty about what’s ahead more in line with our   own   There are two areas where changes in the statement seem indicated  The first is in how we   characterize the rationale for our action  There we have some room to become more explicit about   our view of the outlook relative to our objectives without going all the way to a fully articulated,   quantitative forecast The second, of course, is in the end of the statement  If the world in   December looks about how it looks now, with a high probability of one or more moves still ahead   of us, we could, for example, replace the last three sentences of the statement with two which state   our views more simply  They would state first that the outlook for growth and inflation suggests   that further monetary policy firming is likely to be necessary, and, second, that the Committee will   respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability so as to achieve   sustainable growth   This would get us out of some of the risks of repeating “measured” going forward  It would   help address some of the problems in using the word “accommodation” to signal tightening  And it   would eliminate the awkwardness in the superfluous balance of risk sentence we now have  This   would allow an easy evolution to a more neutral signal when that becomes appropriate—with a   simple statement that policy is now roughly appropriate but that we will act as necessary to achieve   our objectives going forward   Of course, the world may look different in December, and we have to assess then what makes   the most sense  I don’t know that we can say with confidence today that evolution in December is   ideal or necessary, but I think we need to prepare ourselves and the markets for some evolution    Thank you                                         November 1, 2005 65 of 114 "
8247,2005-11-01,"  I withdraw the word “stale”  [Laughter]     May I just add to that comment?  I think we need to be   careful not to telegraph in the minutes any change until we have a little more confidence about how   we want the statement to evolve  So I think the minutes can reflect the fact that we’re discussing, as   the world hopes we’re discussing, what evolution might be sensible  We’re not—     But, Mr Chairman, may I say something?     I don’t think we normally take it upon ourselves to try to   interpret the minutes for the world  We let the minutes speak for themselves, and we convey   whatever personal views we have about what we think going forward, but—     I support your recommendation to raise the fed funds rate   25 basis points and to use the language of alternative B  And I want to clarify just for the record,   given what Mike Kelley said last night, that in not rushing immediately to compliment you on the   brilliance of your proposal I’m not implying any less confidence [laughter] but actually more   confidence  "
8290,2005-12-13,  We need to believe in something!  [Laughter]  
8291,2005-12-13,"  So moved    Our forecast for the national outlook has not changed   substantially since the last meeting, and relative to the discussions so far, I guess we’re slightly at the   stronger end   The recent data have been encouraging both here and internationally  The underlying pace of   demand growth seems pretty good to us—good enough to raise the probability of the expansion   continuing at a pace at or slightly above trend  The inflation news has also been reassuring, though   underlying inflation is still running somewhat above what we’d like to see over time                             December 13, 2005 51 of 100  We believe these conditions justify some further tightening of monetary policy, perhaps   another 50 to 75 basis points We are, therefore, comfortable with the expectations now built into the   market  And with that monetary policy assumption, we think the risks to the forecast and to our   objectives are roughly balanced  So, relative to September and October, we see somewhat less   downside risk to growth, perhaps even some upside risk, and somewhat less upside risk to inflation    As this implies, our view is very close to the Greenbook   Let me mention a few other points  The apparent strength in productivity should make us   more comfortable about the sustainability of the expansion and a bit less concerned about the near-   term inflation risks because, of course, if the productivity growth stays stronger longer, we can be   more confident that consumer spending will stay reasonably strong even if a more substantial   slowdown in housing materializes  Scenarios in which more-moderate house price appreciation or   some decline in housing prices leads to a sizable increase in the personal saving rate are probably less   plausible or less troubling in an environment where consumers are more confident in the outlook for   the economy or more confident in their future income growth   The productivity news, combined with continued moderation in the core inflation numbers   and the moderation in measures of inflation expectations, make the inflation outlook somewhat more   favorable  But against these factors there are others that justify some continued attention  Of course,   overall inflation is still high, even though we expect it to moderate  Various measures of underlying   inflation are still above what we would be comfortable with over time  There probably is still some   energy cost pressure in the pipeline  And the TIPS-derived measures of inflation expectations over   the medium term, if you adjust for the carry effect, have not really moved down that much  With   compensation growth accelerating, we would expect eventually to see some upward pressure on labor   costs, though of course less than would be the case with lower productivity numbers  Moreover,                                   December 13, 2005 52 of 100  surveys and anecdotal reports of pricing behavior, as we read them, suggest that businesses are able to   pass on some share of their increased costs  So for these reasons, even with the additional tightening   priced into the markets, we probably face some modest upside risk to our inflation forecast and to our   objective, and we should continue to lean against this risk in what we do and what we say   We don’t see evidence yet to support a concern that the path of the nominal fed funds rate   now priced into the markets risks going too far  Housing may be slowing a bit, but not really much    Other spending indicators look strong—probably stronger than we thought—and the strength is   broader than it has been across the components of GDP  Expected real rates don’t suggest a high   degree of concern, in our view  It’s just some concern, but not acute concern about the downside risk   to future growth  If you try to take out expected inflation from forward rates, it looks as if real rates   move up over the 2- to 5-year horizon  Equity prices, credit spreads, and the implied volatility of   most asset prices don’t seem to suggest a lot of concern about significant deterioration ahead in the   pace of the expansion   Although we don’t think the narrowing of the term spread itself or the low overall level of the   yield curve offers clear guidance about monetary policy—clear guidance in terms of arguing for a   softer or firmer stance than the other fundamentals might suggest—we’re somewhat more inclined to   take the view that this change in the structure of term premia suggests we will have to do more than   otherwise would have been the case  So all of this suggests to us that we should continue to tighten   further and signal that we think we have still more to do  "
8292,2005-12-13,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation to move 25   basis points and I support the language in alternative B  I think it’s a nice, balanced formulation, and I   do believe it’s the best way to leave expectations roughly neutral   I think we view the probability as very high that we’re going to need to move in January and   that March is maybe an even bet  That seems about right  This probably introduces a little bit more   uncertainty into the signal about monetary policy than has been the case before, but I think that’s   desirable  It’s a fairly flexible formulation and allows us to adapt reasonably easily going forward  I   agree that “may” would carry too much risk of taking out a good deal of the tightening that is now   built into the market, and, therefore, I don’t think it would be desirable   The problem with “measured,” of course, is that in our discussion there is so much dispersion   on how we interpret the implication of “measured” today that it’s a little hard to justify retaining it    Nevertheless, I’m comfortable retaining it because it has two virtues that are not necessarily                                December 13, 2005 89 of 100  inconsistent  One is that it does keep a bit of a cap on expectations about how much and how fast we   need to move, and I think that’s probably desirable now  The second implication it carries is the sense   that we may be facing two more moves rather than just one  Again, I think that’s desirable now, too;   so, on balance, it makes sense to me to keep it   Also, I just want to echo what many of you have said in that I agree that this was a pretty good   process  Committees sometimes have a bad name  We were a group of seventeen people this time   and I thought the process was quite good  I think the language got better through the evolution of this   statement, and that makes me more hopeful  Thank you  "
8337,2006-01-31,  So moved  
8338,2006-01-31,"  Nathan, if you look at the differences between the   Greenbook forecast of the path of the external balance and those of other forecasters, can you   summarize for us what the major sources of differences are?  Are they about the exchange rate   assumption, or are they about something else?     Mr Chairman, in the interest of crispness, I’ve removed   a substantial tribute from my remarks  [Laughter]     I’d like the record to show that I think you’re pretty   terrific, too  [Laughter]  And thinking in terms of probabilities, I think the risk that we decide in the   future that you’re even better than we think is higher than the alternative  [Laughter]   With that, the economy looks pretty good to us, perhaps a bit better than it did at the last   meeting  With the near-term monetary policy path that’s now priced into the markets, we think the   economy is likely to grow slightly above trend in ’06 and close to trend in ’07  We expect   underlying inflation to follow a path close to current levels before slowing to a rate closer to   15 percent for the core PCE sometime out there  Relative to the Greenbook, we’re a little softer on   growth in ’06 and a little stronger in ’07, but our inflation outlook is similar   The uncertainty around this forecast still seems considerable, perhaps more than the market   has priced in  On the positive side, consumer and business confidence still seems pretty high, with   January 31, 2006 55 of 106    employment growth solid and compensation growth likely to pick up  We think that household   income growth is likely to be pretty strong  Investment may be strengthening, and it could surprise   us with more strength  The tone of the anecdotal to us seems more positive, less cautious than it has   been  And just to cite our Empire survey, the six-month-ahead numbers show a fair amount of   optimism  Overall, financial conditions, of course, still seem quite supportive of continued   expansion  Global growth has strengthened  And like the staff, the market seems to have looked   through the negative surprises in the fourth-quarter numbers and priced in a bit more, rather than   less, confidence about the strength of demand growth going forward   On the darker side, we have the familiar concerns about potential adverse shocks, energy   supply disruptions, terrorism, et cetera  But even in the absence of these events, we face a fair   amount of uncertainty about key elements of the forecast  The prevailing expectation of a gradual   moderation in housing prices and a relatively small increase in the saving rate could prove too   optimistic  Private investment growth could slow further, productivity growth could disappoint, risk   premiums could rise sharply  And, of course, that could happen even in the absence of a major   deterioration in the growth or inflation outlook  But this, on balance, still leaves us with what looks   like a relatively balanced set of risks around what is still a quite favorable growth forecast   The inflation outlook still merits some concern—I think modest concern—about upside risk    Underlying inflation is still somewhat higher than we would be comfortable with over time  The   core indexes are running above levels said to define our preference over time  Other measures of   underlying inflation are running above the core rates  The behavior of inflation expectations at   longer horizons has been reassuringly stable in the face of the elevated headline numbers, but the   levels are still at the higher end of comfort  With the economy near potential, unit labor cost growth   should accelerate  And, of course, although profit margins still show ample room to absorb more   January 31, 2006 56 of 106    unit cost increases, their behavior suggests continued pricing power  The strength of global   demand, the continued rise in commodity prices, other input costs, and the latest increase in energy   prices all suggest a possibility of further upward pressure   With this outlook and this set of risks, we believe some further tightening of monetary   policy is necessary with another small move today and a signal that some further tightening is   probable  We’re comfortable with how the market’s expectations have evolved over the past few   weeks and with the present forecast of perhaps one—maybe slightly more than one—move beyond   today  It’s hard, though, to understand why the market attaches so little uncertainty to monetary   policy in the second half of the year  And this underscores the fact that one of our communication   challenges ahead is to make sure we convey enough uncertainty about our view of the outlook and   its implications for monetary policy  In this regard, I want to compliment the recent innovations to   the Bluebook presentations and hope that they persist  "
8339,2006-01-31,"  Let the record reflect that the Committee has thwarted   the attempt by the Chairman to change the process in a way that— [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, I, too, think that we should move by   25 today, and I’m comfortable with the language as it’s modified here  I do think that it’s important   to note that the market judges the odds of March as probable  The Greenbook assumption is more   consistent with that and, as Janet said, some of the Bluebook filters we can use to look at things are   slightly more in that direction  But having said that, I think it’s fine to leave the statement with   “may,” and I don’t really know whether the market’s reaction to that statement would take out some   of the pricing now built in or leave it where it is  It’s hard to know   January 31, 2006 71 of 106    I want to say one thing in response to Vince’s second question, although I’m not sure that   we need to spend much time on it  I think we should defer this decision until March  My own view   is that the actions the Committee takes are really not principally the changes in the fed funds rate we   announce or don’t announce at the meeting  They have a lot to do with how we characterize our   view of the path of output and inflation relative to our objectives, the risks around that, and what we   signal, if anything, about the monetary policy implications of that judgment  Having said that, I   think it is hard not to argue that the Committee needs to express a view when it votes on that basic   set of signals  I think it’s worth deferring that judgment, though, simply because we should talk   through a little more what it really means for our process and how we’re going to manage the   preparation and the discussion in a world where we’re more explicitly deciding what we’re going to   vote on  So my compliments to Vince for framing it the way he did, and I suggest we defer the   vote  "
