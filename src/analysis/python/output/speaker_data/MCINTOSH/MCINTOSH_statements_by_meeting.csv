993,1979-04-17," Mr Chairman, if one were to array the 8 or 10  most prominent forecasts, including the Greenbook forecast, clearly  the Greenbook forecast with its rather heroic estimates of plus 1  percent real growth in six quarters would come up on the optimistic  end of the array Our own view is that we are heading toward a  recession later this year, and that view is shared by most other  forecasts We don't see the case for tightening at this time,  particularly since it doesn't buy us anything on the price front in  1979--and perhaps much of 1980--because of the lags We think the  choice is between easing or staying pat Historically the Federal  Reserve has had a tendency to overstay its policy at peaks and  troughs, and itrs our fear that we're about to repeat that  performance Therefore, we would argue in favor of a modest move in  the direction of ease at this time in the interest of moderating the  impact of the recession that we're [expecting]    Mr Chairman, we certainly agree with your  comments with respect to adopting a policy that seems to be  appropriate given the lags in our forecasts We'd opt for either ""A""  as proposed or for the modification suggested by John Balles    Yes  "
