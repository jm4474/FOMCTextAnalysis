1889,1981-08-18, Let me see We have $34 billion in total holdings at current market value 
2049,1982-05-18," Governor Martin, I might just supplement that Half of the jumbo credit they are negotiating is to consolidate short- term debts, so it doesn't add to their reserve position And the other half--if it's a $2-1/2 billion credit or so--would last them roughly one month on their own external payments schedules  And their latest reserve figures show that they are somewhat worse off than they were at the end of April on their reserve position with regard to their note issue cover So, if they do receive the proceeds at the end of the month as they hope, they  -10-    5/18/82  don't have to come to us for this month But I think what Gretchen is saying is on the horizon is that they may have to accelerate their borrowing or find some other ways to deal with the issue to rebuild confidence "
4107,1991-02-05," No I think the Treasury's need for some contingency or a cushion for reserve is appropriate, given the uncertainties Otherwise, we'd have to review this on an emergency basis rather than--  Governor Angell, we have $339 billion in DM, in recent values  We did sell--  No, this is dollar values "
4131,1991-03-26," In the past six weeks, on the balances of DM the United States in total lost approximately $3 billion, not including yesterday's appreciation And on the yen the United States lost close to $1 billion  But those are unrealized [losses]  We have $265 billion and they have $22 billion  Although on intervention policy the Treasury has the mandated authority--  --and we have to consult and work in conjunction with them  -15-    3/26/91  I just want to bring to your attention also, as you may have heard, that Congressman Gonzalez has raised all kinds of concerns about the ESF and Federal Reserve holdings He is proposing fueling that in a Congressional setting--tying all the accounts to the IMF legislation and other sorts of problems here It's very much on his mind and his staff is making noises to that effect So, it's not an academic issue of what happens to our balances; it has some other political dimensions  May I just have one other word about the discussion? The problem is that the level of the balances and disposal of the balances are two separate items As we just discovered, even when we agree we have too much, it is very difficult to sell except at a time when the dollar is under very severe downward pressure If the pressure is in the other direction, upward, the other side is very concerned and the timing is not right or, as currently, we have other financing problems in other countries So, the problem of the disposal is as difficult as the issue of the level The other point that I think deserves at least to be mentioned is that there's always room for replenishment It's a two-way situation If one does dispose of a certain amount and feels one needs more, when the market situation is right there is a chance through intervention to acquire additional holdings  One final comment with regard to the method of sales and whether it's off-market or on-market On-market sales are equivalent to intervention in the broader scheme of things If you do affect the market at all, within a certain time it could be neutralized; whatever effect it has is the same But when you have off-market sales the timing has something to do with the interpretation of whether you have a target for your rate And you do influence your co-central bankers of whether you're trying to protect a rate and not have it go higher or lower And that again complicates the matter of disposal  Well, as Sam just pointed out, we are in some sense a victim of historical accident The year when we really accumulated huge amounts--$22 billion--was 1989 Without that the numbers would look very different, even if you adjusted $22 billion [down to make it comparable] to other years So, that was the year that we probably overbought  [Statement--see Appendix] "
4444,1992-03-11," Right, we have not changed them, but we are in the process of making the forecast for the next Greenbook The little blips in the oil price have not made us change the near-term forecast  The information coming in is still mixed with regard to whether there's a deterioration In Japan, it looks as if the weakness is getting a little more widespread At the margin we would probably be scaling [the forecast] down, but it would not be a very significant adjustment One other item with regard to Germany is that price developments don't look very favorable, at least in the    3/11/92  near term, and that adds a certain amount of caution to any possible adjustment by the Bundesbank  No, it was not very good; it was 43 percent year-over-year, which is higher than previous months' year-over-year figures And wage developments are also uncertain right now There are possibilities of strikes, and that adds other elements of uncertainty in the German picture  The difference we're talking about is relatively small The current price--  Our assumption for the oil price for the full year is around $18 [a barrel]  That is not very much different from prevailing prices And partly it's going to be affected by what OPEC does with its control of the supply If they are successful in curbing sales, then that's likely to keep the price--  Yes  We will review the assumptions for the next forecast very carefully  Yes "
4801,1993-08-17, [Statement--see Appendix] 
4890,1993-11-09," No intervention today  There has been none today as of an hour ago  [Secretary's note This telephone conference was called on short notice and took place late in the afternoon]  Thank you, Mr Chairman For quite a while the Mexican authorities have succeeded in keeping a stable exchange rate without necessarily much support on a permanent basis However, last week the pressures mounted and the authorities allowed the rate to depreciate slightly, but it required a very sizable amount of intervention as was just pointed out Nevertheless, they held [the exchange rate] in the vicinity of 315 pesos per dollar When they abandoned the internal band on the level of the peso, the rate has moved today to 324 and it is steady at this stage So they have more room for depreciation within their now enlarged band    11/9/93  The pressure on the financial markets also has spread over the past week to the stock market Whereas previously the stock market had a very sizable run-up, part of that run-up has been erased by sizable losses--losses of 1 to 2 percent--in recent days Today, however, the stock market is up slightly But [Mexican officials] are not very hopeful that they can withstand the mounting pressures partly associated with the uncertainties regarding the NAFTA debate They are fearful that additional pressures will mount unless there is some sense in the market that they have both the resources and the public support They approached the Treasury for a financial support package, a multilateral one, but emphasized that they would not necessarily want to draw on that facility  What they are looking for is a multilateral support facility, which the Treasury is considering, in the range of from the G-10 countries--including the United States--and Spain The Treasury is considering in thinking about this that the US participation would be in the $5 to $6 billion range  With regard to Federal Reserve participation, there are two aspects One, which is for the moment the item of immediate [concern] at least, is to consider allowing the Mexican authorities to draw on the $700 million swap line that is currently in existence In order for the Federal Reserve to take a part of the proposed US share of this larger facility, we would obviously have to enlarge the swap line, which is a separate issue; but that might come up as developments proceed  The Treasury has a swap line of $300 million, which they are prepared to enlarge  No, no This is between the Fed and the Bank of Mexico  For the moment it is a $700 million swap line, and that is what we have to talk about The purpose of raising this issue with you is to bring you up-to-date and to alert you that there is a possibility that either an activation of the existing swap line or potentially an enlargement of the swap line might be forthcoming  The question ""What is your reaction to the depreciation of the Mexican peso today?"" Proposed answer ""The United States believes that Mexico is pursuing sound economic policies It is apparent, however, that financial markets are responding to the uncertainties regarding NAFTA The Mexican authorities have responded within the framework of their current approach to foreign exchange markets by introducing temporarily greater flexibility in the peso exchange rate We believe that this is an appropriate step in current circumstances""  The Mexicans also raised interest rates today, to 23 percent on their overnight rate And the auction that is scheduled for tomorrow is likely to show an increase as well in long maturities because in the new offerings the rates already have increased by 2 to 3 percentage points The overnight rate increased from 15 percent yesterday to 23 percent today So, they are taking additional support actions internally They have approached the IMF for a support statement and Michel Camdessus is prepared to offer a statement to the effect that they are pursuing sound policies and that they are doing well as far as the policy environment is concerned They are not considering drawing in a standby arrangement, but they are considering having a first tranche drawing, which would give them approximately $600 million of additional liquid funds  About 324  They have moved from 315 already  They allowed it to go to 324 but they have more room to go They shifted the entire band  The upper limit is close to 330  Peso, right    11/9/93  It got there and bounced back  For them the upper limit is 305, but that is for the moment irrelevant because they are reaching the [lower limit]  No, they only widened the [internal] band  To repeat, the issue under discussion is not really to use the Federal Reserve--  They are considering using their own reserves for a while There's talk that another of their own reserves may be needed But they would like to have that moral support for the moment and So the intervention is their own intervention  To a special New York Fed account  For the moment the size of the swap is $700 million If we participate with Treasury in the order of magnitude they are talking about, then we might temporarily enlarge the swap line by an additional $18 billion  $25 billion  That is what the Treasury is proposing, yes They are asking us to--  We learned about the initiative for this multilateral support arrangement around noon We are in touch with the BIS to alert them  From Mexico, right We ourselves have not received a formal request from the Bank of Mexico This was done through the Finance Ministry of Mexico But we have alerted the BIS that this is on the horizon Part of the problem, we hear, is that speed is of the essence If it is going to be helpful to Mexico at all, they are thinking about this [being ready] by the weekend So we have informed [the BIS] But [Mexican officials] have not contacted anyone yet because [it's after] the close of business in Europe  We would act as the agent, typically  [Unintelligible] the account  From the Mexican perspective it is the size of the swap facilities [that matters]; it would have the announcement effect  It increases [how much] the international community is supporting them  If they draw it at all  That is what they are asking That is the primary request  The Treasury was talking about US participation of $5 to $6 billion That is the order of magnitude we are talking about, but [a drawing] is always subject to the conditions and terms that we impose on it Any enlargement [of the swap line] does not mean automatic access They still have to request [a drawing] The question is whether [the Committee] wants to give this preliminary ex ante approval with judicious use of it, as President Boehne suggested, or come back for another meeting at the end of the week  If participation is 50/50, that's what the arithmetic is  The last time we had a special supplementary facility it was for one year  -11-    11/9/93  You can make it shorter, too  We have not received the formal request from the Bank of Mexico, for example "
5228,1994-12-30," I'll try to be brief and outline the main elements of what they regard as a fairly austere program to restore confidence both in domestic and international markets They are still developing their program in preparation for the speech, although elements have already been revealed in various public statements They are aiming for a sizable reduction in the current account from a $31 billion current account deficit before the whole episode of the breakup of the exchange rate regime to a $14 billion current account target They aim to achieve that through--  Yes, the target is to reduce the current account deficit to $14 billion The policy program that they are considering proposes splitting it, with approximately half derived from exchange rate and wage policy adjustments and half through fiscal  -2-    12/30/94  adjustment by reductions in real outlays With this program, they are prepared to accept a very sizable reduction in their growth prospects for 1995 They also expect that because of the changed environment of the exchange rate in particular, inflation will have to rise, but they'd like to contain the rise They have outlined a set of macroeconomic policies primarily on the fiscal side to lower the fiscal deficit, although from our analysis there's room for further tightening that would help a lot They will also try to announce a variety of structural changes in the economy, including various aspects of privatization, opening their market more to various forms of competition, and what they regard as confidence-building measures Although their target objectives are pretty ambitious--to halve the current account deficit within one year and to contain the inflation pass-through--one important feature is to try to create an image that would contrast with past Latin American devaluations, in particular where there were large fiscal deficits combined with loose monetary policy and the pass-through was very rapid and full and had a spiraling effect They are trying to avoid the price increase spiral, hoping it will only be a level adjustment that will enable them to move to a better economic environment Whether they succeed or not will depend on the final outcome of their program That's the broad outline  One final comment to be made is that the market's view of the evolution of this problem attributes a lot to the way the new Administration has handled it They are seen as having made plenty of errors, but they started by taking on a very difficult problem where the economy was out of equilibrium Something had to burst sooner or later and adjustments had to be made Unfortunately, it came with a dramatic impact The other point is that they have the dilemma of trying to satisfy two audiences the domestic audience--relating to the ""pacto"" to provide assurance that it can be sustained after the adjustments are absorbed--and the external markets The elements that are necessary or desirable for the external markets are not always the things that the domestic political situation may absorb This is not to excuse them from holding on and persevering, but they have this double audience dilemma which will affect their final policy decision  I have one technical point that was being proposed as a supplement to the current framework arrangement The swap would be temporary, that's underlined, and would have a termination date Whereas the current $3 billion swap facility is an ongoing one subject to annual renewal, this one would be a supplementary one  They're talking about one year at most But the Treasury may even consider a shorter amount of time  That's possible That sounds right The Treasury is groping over the duration because it would be 90 days of drawing ability perhaps--  --hypothetically for the drawing facility and repayments of 180 days It has to be in existence longer because it has to be repaid on time in technical terms  Right  Right  President McDonough is exactly right The access to the facility would be limited to a very short time period, but the concept of a facility on the books would technically have to extend for up to one year We have had two precedents for this In 1982 and 1989 under different circumstances, we enlarged temporarily our existing swap of $700 million with Mexico by adding a supplementary facility of $325 million in 1982 and a supplementary  -6-    12/30/94  facility of $125 million in 1989 This would not be the first time it has been done  We can fix that up  I think there's no disagreement  The estimates that we have, using conventional relationships and based on the level of imports to Mexico, are that for a 30 percent devaluation, imports would fall approximately $30 billion over three years On the export side, a 30 percent devaluation would approximately increase non-oil exports by $18 billion from the current level  Yes, a large trade surplus And the current account would be similarly affected Now, that's all dependent on other associated policies they adopt in order to get that impact such as the degree of reduction in real output Our analysts looked at the program that the Mexicans presented and thought that the turnaround, with all the feedback effects that the Mexicans were proposing from $30 billion or so to $14 billion, was realistic for the current account  SPEAKER(?) Thank you  And that was based on 450 exchange rate  We have not spoken to the Canadians yet and are waiting  until we know what the FOMC decides "
5317,1995-04-28," Yes I think that's close to the number, but perhaps a bit higher  Mexico's trade adjustment appears to have been front-loaded to quite an extent Mexico's trade data provide evidence that they turned around from a sizable deficit to a small surplus for the first two months, and we are the main trading partner  Most of it was, but I can't give you an exact number on that "
5388,1995-08-22," President Minehan, in addition the Treasury has been seeking opportunities in market conditions where its intervention would have a positive effect and where it might ride a rally where one was already occurring So they piggybacked on the various measures that the Japanese took with regard to external investments, and they caught the market by surprise on several occasions And that turns out to be, for the moment at least, a little more effective than just intervening randomly  They found an opportune time  [Statement--see Appendix]  It is partly that the slowdown in the first half may well be an aberration with respect to underlying trends and underlying strength in those countries The German economy felt some impact from the depreciation of the mark, which is now being partially reversed We anticipate some Japanese policy measures as well, although we have projected a very slow Japanese performance So, there is a correction for the weakness of the first half that we don't expect will continue "
5583,1996-08-20," Don's comment about real interest rates is obviously important If other news in the market is interpreted in a way that leads to rising inflationary expectations, then long-term interest rate movements need not necessarily affect the dollar  Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]  Again, we have few details For example, with respect to the composition of the decline of more than $2 billion in imports, about one fourth is accounted for by automobiles, and automobile exports went up a little Inventory movements play a role in this sector We just do not know how that will work out Imports of industrial supplies also declined $700 million This is not a sign of economic strength Again, we are looking at very preliminary information, but eyeballing the monthly trade data from the beginning of the year, it now looks as if the large May import number may have been the outlier because it was relatively high The number we have right now for June is similar to that for most of the other months of the year, but that again is the first impression "
5843,1997-12-16," Thank you very much On my list of things from the Federal  Reserve that I will look back to, this is one of the activities that I will miss very much "
