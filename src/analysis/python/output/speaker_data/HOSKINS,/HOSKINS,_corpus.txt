Well, our long-term goal publicly stated is price stability  For 1990 the nominal GNP we're looking at is about 62 percent, I think we're looking at a monetary growth rate of 6-1/2 to 7 percent It seems to me that that implies no movement toward our long-term goal, at least in terms of our policy position If you look at P*, I find no pressure from the P* model for moving toward price stability    3/27/90  Moving toward more current kinds of considerations, it seems to me that we can always find a risk in the economy; we have done that consistently, at least over the last 2-1/2 years that I've been sitting here If we're always going to weigh our decisions toward risk to the economic expansion, then we're always going to bias ourselves toward inflation It seems to me we have a one-weighted risk scheme in here We weigh only toward the economy until inflation is in some sense beyond our control [rather] than taking very aggressive policy action I think it's very important to maintain credibility I think what we've learned from the last 20 years is that the credibility of policymakers is probably the key element in successful policy Given the lack of movement toward our goal, much less the increase in rates of inflation that we've seen, I don't think that we're providing any kind of credibility at all I don't think we need a major move at this time We may need a major move if we follow market interest rates up; if we are wrong and the economy is stronger, we will have to move more aggressively So, I would favor a 25 basis point move now and let the markets sort that one out I suppose as a fallback I could go for an asymmetric directive toward tightening if in it we expressed our concerns about the inflationary trends
