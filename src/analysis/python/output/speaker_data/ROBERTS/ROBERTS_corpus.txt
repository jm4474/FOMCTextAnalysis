 I'm glad to be here but I make no promises   Mr Chairman, I'm very conscious, having just left the private marketplace, of the fragile position of commercial banks and also the concern over large government deficits But I think that another major concern out there is that the Federal Reserve System not sort of operate without any guidelines I think that the market expects specific guidelines and, if we don't have them, there will be an anticipatory effect in the market that will be negative in terms of interest rates I would, therefore, strongly favor our    2/8-9/83  maintaining targets for monetary aggregates It appears to me from my very limited ability to study this matter that M1 has exonerated itself extremely well during this period and, on the assumption that velocity will return to a normal pattern, I would hope that M1 would be very strongly represented in those monetary aggregates   Interest rates are now going up, however   It could be wrong   Mr Chairman, I'd like to be associated with a 4 to 8 percent range, with the hope that the midpoint of the range is what we'd be working toward I think we have to come off a rapid growth rate slowly instead of abruptly    2/8-9/83   May I ask why we're establishing such a target at all? It doesn't seem to relate to anything, as I read the material There seems to be an assumption that we're going to use a target like this I don't understand what the purpose of it is   Is the question, since we can't control this measure, what it will turnout to be if we set the aggregates? We don't control this measure, do we?   But it's just a monitoring device   When you say influence your decision, Tony, do you mean that if it were running differently than you expected, you would do something differently in terms of the aggregates?   So, it should be consistent with the aggregates, if there is any relationship   Well, you can't assume that's irrational either, if the marketplace judges it to be important I think the market is concerned currently about the rate of expansion in the money stock   No, but I think we should stay hinged to a rate of growth in Ml, and we've done that And the assumption, as I understand it, is a resumption of normal velocity I don't see anything wrong with that I think this wording looks all right   Is that soft relative to those earlier targets?   I think that's just dead wrong, Mr Chairman, because if we just control interest rates without consideration of the aggregates, the markets will take over in terms of expectations--I think it's already happening in the long market--and raise interest rates and that will be self-defeating and abort the recovery We'd get exactly the reverse of what we want The Board could lower the discount rate to zero, but if it has nothing to do with market rates, it doesn't mean anything   Do you mean about weakness in the aggregates or unusual liquidity?   Doesn't it just say that regardless of the movement of the aggregates, you're going to do what you want to do?   It seems to me it's implicit If we have an international crisis or liquidity crisis we're going to deal with it ad hoc   Don't these sentences in lines 82 to 85 [of the draft directive] take care of the qualification and make it unnecessary?   We don't need them both that's for sure   So, forget the exchange rate risk   Isn't the practical consequence, though, that under those circumstances the bank would come to the discount window and give us the same asset and we would accept it for discounting and we would still have the asset?   It seems to me that, psychologically, it's a poor time to [make a] break At the moment it's still a high quality asset and it gives us flexibility I'd be for retaining the flexibility   Is there no limit on our actions? We can do whatever is our judgment?   No legal limit on anything   Why would we want to intervene? Do we know better than the market what the rate ought to be?   I have a question, just out of curiosity The change in final sales was predicated upon a big swing in CCC How big was that and is that based on something unusual? Has that happened before?   Would it be fair, therefore, to conclude that final sales weren't really as strong in the fourth quarter and aren't as weak in the first quarter?   Of course, that's financed by long-term money The best way to hold that rate down is to avoid changing inflationary expectations and that gets to our discussion, I'm sure, of the rate of increase in money Mr Chairman, I'd like to go back, if I may, to a point you were making about the July tax cut An area I'm curious about is what is happening at the state and local level with regard to tax increases I keep reading that state after state is raising taxes because of deficits, so I guess a big deficit there is changing to a lower deficit, which is going to take something out of the spending stream Have we any figures on that from the staff?   He has a boom/bust   I have just a couple of comments Our staff has consistently been optimistic and is looking for about a 5 percent fourth-quarter real growth and we think that the first quarter is probably running ahead of expectations in terms of the numbers that will come out I went around to all my branches recently, as part of an introductory thing, and I met with the boards and heard their summaries of what they thought about the economy I would say in reference to what someone said earlier that they're not euphoric at all If anything, it's a reluctant optimism; but there's definitely unanimity of optimism In the wood products area, for example, one fellow was cautioning about interpreting the February seasonally adjusted number and yet he concluded that [business is] really booming and prices are up 60 percent from the bottom He said his lumber prices are still below his costs, but that with the sharply rising prices we had to look out in terms of what that would do to housing But there was a reluctant optimism--   Lumber was up 60 percent since October   This chap heads the  -40-    3/28-29/83  and he said prices had really taken off and he was getting similar reports from people on the West Coast   My attitude is colored a little by the fact that I just contracted to buy a house in the weak St Louis market where I found the seller is very, very firm and the price is not weak at all Housing is very strong, has a large consumer oriented company--shoes and recreational products and so on --and he said he's seeing expansion in unit sales across the country for the first time; the expansion is concealed a little by the lower prices But he really is doing better than when he had higher prices and the units weren't moving So, all in all--   I might add that his profits are up very substantially with this type of development, so it's very constructive All in all, there is pretty solid and widespread optimism but nothing in terms of a soaring economy   On inflation I believe we had 5 percent My own feeling is that we're probably overestimating inflation With the good control over compensation per manhour, the good productivity figures, I think a low increase in prices is in the bag for '83 I'm more concerned about '84 in terms of this sharp buildup in liquidity   Mr Chairman, first, I have 3 comments--on distortion, velocity, and real rates My staff looked at the reference to the Board's survey on the effects of MMDAs, which was reported in The Wall Street Journal, that said 3 percent came from Ml components and 25 percent of the Super NOWS came from nontransaction balances And taking just nonseasonally adjusted measures, we conclude from that that the effect--if there has been any distortion at all, it's very modest--has been to increase the rate of growth in Ml, either measured from July to February or from December to February I don't think the distortion is significant on Ml Secondly, with respect to velocity, I think a question we ought to ask ourselves is What is the rapid growth of money having to do with the collapse of velocity and will that be corrected by a slowing in the rate of growth? As to real rates, I think Steve made the point that real rates are a function of what prices people are looking at historical, current, and prospective And someone made the point that prospective rates in the minds of the public were still pretty high, so maybe real rates aren't really that high I don't know what they will turn out to be eventually, but I believe we've had long periods of time when real rates were high and economic recovery and expansion occurred The 1920s is an example I've always thought the goal of the System is having sustainable economic expansion without undue inflation And I think that's what we ought to try to do rather than control interest rates Interest rates often go down in an economic expansion and it's not unusual that they will fluctuate in the process  I believe the economic recovery is well under way and is spreading I saw an excellent indication of confidence in yesterday's paper where I noted that a bankrupt company, Chrysler, in a highly cyclical mature industry, sold $400 million worth of stock That seems to me to indicate there is some confidence around I think the big risk is a resumption of inflation And if we keep money growing at the pace that it's growing now, particularly as measured by Ml, we are certain--not in '83 but in '84 and '85--to have excessive price inflation And if we're really interested in holding interest rates down, the way to do that is to avoid the expansion in money that will lead to higher prices and that will lead to higher mortgage rates and long-term bond rates So, my view would be that we need to start slowing the growth of the monetary aggregates, particularly Ml since that's the one that's least distorted and most related, with respect to its predictive value, to the economy I think we have the [growth] rates so high that it would be wrong to jerk them down to a low rate; my view would be that we ought to move gradually to the middle of our 4 to 8 percent [Ml] target by the fourth quarter I would like to see us move to about a 7 percent level for this quarter and come on down gradually from there over the balance of the year I'd like to see language in the directive showing a return to emphasis on Ml And I think we should, by all means, avoid interest rate targeting or just something called judgment with no standards, because that I think will    3/28-29/83  create a situation in the market that would be the reverse of what we would like to have   "A"   Right, but for the quarter   Well, "A" is indicated at 7-1/2 percent   Yes   Steve, a question These March-to-June rates are annual rates, are they not?   So M1 at 7-1/2 percent is an annual rate of growth during the quarter   So, that would be dropping from 24 percent in February or from 6 months of growth at 14 or 15 percent, which would be a very substantial decline in the rate of growth   Is the assumption that, if the borrowing level is maintained at that level and credit demands rise, we simply accommodate them to hold the interest rates and expand reserves?   And would those rates, Paul, be the rates out of alternatives A and B and so on?   Yes   Since that's the only thing we control, it would be nice to keep it in there  -67-    3/28-29/83   This language would include the sentence on fed funds at the bottom?   That would be 6 to 10 percent?   So would I   The problem with $250 million is that unless one makes an assumption that there has been a distortion that's been pushing the growth of the aggregates--and that doesn't appear to be the case with M1--$250 million does not come anywhere near the growth path that we're talking about  -72-    3/28-29/83   But the focus is how they're coming in and not on the level of interest rates per se?   It's a sign, but also if we accommodate a level regardless--if we keep the borrowings down--we'll provide more money   And if the prime moves up here shortly, we probably shouldn't try to prevent the funds rate from moving up a little also   I'd like to be associated with those who want to wait I think one month is much too early to start fine-tuning, particularly when the economy seems to be moving along all right here   I just wanted to ask a question about inventory change My understanding is that the first quarter still had a significant drag from inventory liquidation I see your numbers here change dramatically from the first quarter of 1983 on to, say, the fourth quarter 1984--$64 billion If we took out the inventory reduction in the first quarter--to kind of pursue Bob Black's analysis--you'd have a still stronger picture there contrasting with the fourth quarter And in view of your forecasted elimination of the liquidation of inventories, that suggests a lot of strength Is that a valid assumption? Are you fairly confident about the change in inventories that you are projecting?   I think I'll wait for the monetary discussion I want to respond to Tony I disagree with him about 100 percent   If we do, there will be other people then heading for cover   [Unintelligible] discussion, I have a feeling that it is time to do something about the excessive rate of growth in Ml, which I happen to feel is still an important measure of what is happening in the economy I believe, based on the contacts I have in the marketplace, which I am sure are not as extensive as others, that the market is quite conscious and sensitive to this excessive rate of expansion As I look at the situation, we have M2 conveniently within a band only because we conveniently redefined the base It might be interesting to redefine the base for Ml and thereby get it in the band and growing at about a moderate pace from here on out That probably would be appropriate in view of the strength of this economy that we all have commented on I just think that if we have to face some modest adjustment here in interest rates, we ought to face up to it earlier rather than later We have an economy that is walking along very well through the so-called real interest rates that are believed to be too high; I don't think that some modest adjustment here would be bad And if it begins to contain some of the excessive rate of expansion in Ml, I think that probably would be productive as we look ahead for either holding the interest rates in the long term or leading us to some reduction, as against having to face up to this a few months later after short-term interest rates have already gone up with the rise in the private sector and long-term rates have gone up perhaps because of changes in inflationary expectations   June is projected at a very low rate; it may not be in the bag  -21-    5/24/83   We can't change it at this point Yes   I would like to see us raise the borrowing level from $250 million to something like $500 to $750 million, if that would be the amount that would curtail the rate of growth in bank reserves that's accommodating this big expansion in Ml And if that raised the fed funds rate to 9 percent, I don't think that would be anything that would prevent this economy from continuing to expand at a sustainable pace   Alternative C is about right, as I see it I am thinking in terms of about 6 or 7 percent incremental money growth from this point forward   The prime rate may be going up anyway   And with respect to the exchange rate, it has been going up while rates have been going down   It doesn't follow that the prime would automatically go up, though, because there has been a big swing away from negotiable CDs to money market deposit accounts as a source of money The spread can change between the funds rate or the CD rate and the prime and in the meantime business loan demand is very soft   Is that 9ish reserve adjusted?   So, it's [a spread of] 150 basis points That's not uncommon   Which are going up now  SPEAKER(?) It depends on what you think--   Excellent statement, Mr Chairman   It's never been otherwise in the market, Tony   That may or may not be true The recent behavior, the very large increases, may overwhelm comments   The long rates already have started to rise without our snugging My guess would be that snugging would be positively interpreted, particularly in the long markets, and that we would more likely get a decline in rates than an increase   How about $500 million?  SPEAKER(?) [Unintelligible] going on   Stick to your guns   Why don't we just say--  -46-    5/24/83   I think your first draft is better than any of these suggestions   You have to put it in because that's the only reason we're talking about snugging   Did we have six for $400 million?  -58-    5/24/83   Okay, Mr Chairman, I give in I prefer a higher number but if we can't get any more, I'll go with the $350 million reluctantly   You mentioned a revision in manufacturing capacity Could you comment on that?   Are you suggesting that the velocity of M2 is more stable?   I don't think it's so much that the market says we're watching it as that they say it's something that has to be looked at if the economy is strong and Ml is growing too rapidly  -45-    7/12-13/83  Whether we're watching it or not, it has become a market influence You talk to people, as you say; I also talk to people and I get the impression that they're concerned about what is happening to Ml whether we are concerned or not   I think the problem is that the market fears that we are getting too far away from Ml; as the economy has strengthened and as M1 has grown at too rapid a pace, that has produced fears It's already reflected in a major change in interest rates in the market If we were to do something to indicate that we are serious about it again, particularly if we were to rebase and have a moderate rate of growth as our target, I think we would see a constructive effect in the market   But don't we have to talk about next year, Paul?   I thought it was over 6 percent   We have gone from an 11 percent rate of [velocity] decrease to about a 1 percent rate of decrease in that period, suggesting that it's straightening out   If we hit it right in the middle and have a normal cyclical velocity, we're right on   Yes, it's just as important not to pull it back too much as it is to have the right amount  -53-    7/12-13/83   June was 10 percent   That would be 2 percent   Alternative B accommodates the present rate of growth in M1 during the third quarter   The 10 percent rate we've been seeing in Ml in the third quarter would be reflected under alternative B It's running about 10 percent   [July] is estimated, I thought he said, at about the same as [June]   Everything has moved 5/8 to 3/4 point except the prime   And we had the first month of a turnaround in business loan demand in June  -66-    7/12-13/83   Well, some people are still paying prime, but it's less of a significant rate in the C&I market In New York, three-fourths of the new loans are not at prime; in Chicago, half of them are not at prime   I think Si's view is about where I would be Alternative B is closer to what I would like to see a funds rate of 9-1/2 to 10 percent and the borrowing somewhere around $800 million if excess reserves are going to be around $400 million  -69-    7/12-13/83   You could have, could you not, a 10 percent nominal GNP, 4th quarter over 4th quarter? I think that could still be consistent  -79-    7/12-13/83   If we had 6 percent growth in money, which is right in the middle of our range, and got a 10 percent middle range nominal GNP, assuming 3-1/2 percent velocity--   Higher than the 27 we heard   Well, that isn't exactly right We've had an excessive rate of growth here for a long period of time; it's continuing at a little more moderate pace Normally in a business expansion we would moderate that; it's time that we signal that to the market very clearly And I would be in favor of the 4 to 8 percent   We're telling the market that we accept this bulge that has taken place--that we are not going to do anything about trying to get rid of it That ought to be a positive influence   It's subject to a resumption of normal velocity   There was a reference to our guarantee of the BIS credit Is that a full or a partial guarantee?   "We" meaning the US Treasury?  SPEAKER(?) The Treasury  SPEAKER(?) About $200 million   Question Did I hear that the historical cost of the currencies we own [is $4 billion and] the current value is $3 billion? Does that mean an unrealized loss of a billion dollars on currencies?   I mean for the United States   Where does all that flow through--the Exchange Stabilization Fund?   Are you referring to single-family primarily?   Isn't there some increase in the multifamily area that is partially offsetting that?   Since that hasn't been true up to now--real rates have not slowed the growth at all--why will it be true later in the year?   We should keep in mind, though, that the housing recovery started at a higher level of mortgage rates than you're suggesting would be a problem   But so far the consensus is better than the individual forecasts; that's been the experience of this guy out in Arizona   Well, I'd like to suggest that alternative C would be no change We agreed last time that we wanted 7 percent growth in Ml and alternative C would take us there I think the economy is doing great and we shouldn't change what we're doing, which is working And I would recommend that we go to alternative C   It seems we could use our monitoring a little more sensitively, though, which I'd appreciate   Well, I don't know what the right level is You remember the discussion the last time; we were so panicked over going to $400 million and nothing dreadful seemed to have [happened] in the market when we went to $900 million In fact, the rates have subsided here I'd let the borrowing go up if necessary to maintain the path   Well, it looks to me as if we've had a constructive effect The policy has resulted in a path that has slowed the [growth of the] monetary base, which is getting reflected here in a slowing in the stock of money   I don't want to repeat what has been said I'd like to associate our District viewpoint with the staff view except to say that we think the '84 prospects are probably for a little less real growth and a little more price pressure I have a couple of comments from our District that might be of interest to you Auto production is going up very well Chrysler has added [unintelligible] employees in the last two weeks Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors are all in the expansion phase of their production in the District They seem to be very optimistic about future sales potential, particularly for large cars, which is where they have shortages that are affecting their sales at the moment GM has put an enormous amount of money into a new plant in Wentzville, west of St Louis, and has yet to produce a car These are front wheel drive cars and GM is having some difficulty with their quality but they are expected to come on line soon head of a major independent oil company that he's reasonably sanguine about the outlook for energy prices, even in the face of a probable disruption of supplies from the Middle East, because of the large amount of indicated shut-in production He said that for the first time there's enough shut-in production outside the Gulf states to offset essentially anything that could happen in the way of reduced supplies from [the Middle East]  I had the principal homebuilders in our area in for lunch recently and they classified themselves as a hardy group of survivors They certainly were guarded in their optimism and made comments about the distortions in the national figures on home building that really should be related to areas such as Dallas and conceal more difficult marketing problems in mature areas such as St Louis But they then went on individually, almost without exception, to speak of their recent land purchases and their plans for expanded building over the balance of this year and next year They said home prices are up about 6 to 8 percent from a year ago and that, admittedly, there had been some pressures on them a year ago but not a whole lot They didn't sell much but when they sold something the price hadn't been down There is concern about rising materials costs, notwithstanding the indicated drop in the cost of lumber; several of them mentioned that the sharply higher cost of lumber was affecting them Overall, I'd say the expansion continues in our District, but we are getting a few more downs than ups for a while, and the agricultural area remains severely depressed from the effects of the drought  -12-    10/4/83   Well, I suppose we are concerned about the buildup in liquidity in the economy and the lag effect we expect to be associated with that   Paul, I think Bob Sweeney's projection went like this If Iran and Iraq had no production at all, [the difference] from the decreased levels at which they now operate could be offset by shut-in production He assumed that the Saudi production would be protected by the United States That's the big difference here   Me too It's very disturbing   Mr Chairman, I think that's a very good starting point and I would recommend that we pursue that path My only concern would be that we not let the growth of the aggregates diminish from these suggested rates in October through December, which are well above where we've been recently   Yes, because $28 billion is 6-1/2 percent   But "B" already has the fourth quarter down to 56 percent, dependent upon December being at an 8 percent growth rate I'd go the other way and say the risk is that it's going to be too tight   Oh yes The latest week is right on the September average   So if it's up, we're already above   Very little less   I really can't help you much on that; I'm sorry I have two comments, which are sort of questions On the productivity, I guess you took into account this major change from manufacturing to services in the 1970s as one of the factors holding back productivity With services now such a large part of the economy, would that from here on out tend to cause the same or an increased rate of productivity if it stabilized, let's say?   That really is the point that I was coming to I think maybe some of the drag in productivity in the services sector is now being overcome Productivity is coming to the services sector And if you have lower [productivity in the] manufacturing sector also as [the staff] has here--I'm just saying that I think productivity estimates are too low for the short run anyway Then I had a question I'm intrigued by this expectations effect on inflation Do I understand this correctly That if someone expects inflation, it's more likely to happen regardless of the policies in effect? That is, if a person loses his job, even though he has expected inflation, it's more likely to happen although the conditions are [such as] to cause him to be unemployed?   I guess what I don't see is how, if inflation expectations rise and policies are in place so that the sales can't be made at the higher prices, that really would affect real inflation It might in the very short run  -10-    11/14-15/83   It would make it tougher for the policies to work   Finance the deficit from overseas   Just a quick question on Schroeder, Meunchmeyer, [Hengst & Company] Did they have a lot of foreign exchange positions in the market? Was it a fairly small bank?   Just the bank?   Has any consideration been given to changing the nonperforming loan classifications that might develop at year-end if there were major failures to pay interest?   There are reversals of interest accruals also   What is the latest on the IMF bill? Is that likely to be approved soon?   It doesn't diversify for the stockholders of the holding company, but it meets the statutes of lending limits for the banks   In the Eighth District, things are looking good I would say we've moved from what I previously called reluctant optimism to near euphoria Sales, which reflect consumer attitudes, are running very strong The merchants we've talked to in the major cities in the District think we're going to have a very outstanding Christmas season Automobile sales are good; they are running about 21 percent over a year ago Unemployment, which has been high, is coming down now very noticeably and the Missouri Division of Employment is predicting substantial reductions beginning in December A large part of this is due to planned expansions at the area's auto plants Ford and GM are planning expansions around the first of the year and Chrysler is going to add a second shift of 1,200 workers to one of their assembly plants, number 2 There is an interesting anecdote regarding this workforce expansion--some good news and some bad news, I guess Chrysler is limiting applications for the jobs to a total of 6,000 They're taking 3,000 applications through their Presswood employment office but they distributed 3,000 interview cards to present employees to give to interested parties The story going around is that employees are selling these cards for about $200 a piece, which either indicates that there are still a lot of people who want to be employed who aren't or, if you figure the chances of being hired are about 1 in 5, that the present value of the rents after union dues is $1,000 per worker at the Chrysler plant I guess that tells you something about why we don't do well with import competition GE is adding 1,400 workers to its Louisville appliance plant by mid-January--again, an indication of a tough area that's coming back Granite City Steel is going to add 1,000 to its workforce, and steel has been a very depressed area Even residential home sales are looking good They're below the peaks but still strong and well ahead of a year ago Construction of new homes is brisk We have good order backlogs I hear the builders expressing optimism again after being rather blue a couple of months ago Residential construction in St Louis is up 21 percent Nonresidential construction in September in Missouri was double the September '82 figure Overall, the nonresidential numbers are looking quite good So, except for agriculture, where we've had the worst drought in 50 years and where with the PIK program we've had big reductions in yields in corn, soybeans, tobacco, and cotton, I would be with the optimists in terms of the outlook, for the fourth quarter in particular  -49-    11/14-15/83   Well, I share John Balles' concern about the persistent deceleration in the rate of Ml [growth] as evidenced from August through October I don't think any major change is called for Alternative B, which would show [M1 growth] rates of 6 percent in November and 9 percent in December would be fine with me I would be cautious in view of the character of the expansion about moving over to "A," because if we were successful in achieving it, John, that would have us moving into the new year at an 11 percent rate of growth in Ml, which I think would be excessive I agree that there has been some unwinding, but all of our research would indicate that if we persist in restraint of this magnitude, we will in fact stop the recovery sometime beyond midyear of next year So, I would like to see us get back on track and address the issue in terms of the monetary base and Ml and let the interest rate fall out wherever it does   Well, isn't "7 percent or less" saying that we're staying on the track that we were on but weren't accomplishing? Isn't that all it's saying? And that implies a higher growth rate from now until year-end, which is in line with "B"   He said "7 percent or less," I thought   I don't think we ought to imply that 5-1/2 percent is the desired path from here forward   I think it's too low   Monthly rates aren't affected by rebasing   I'm not thinking about the base or the range I'm thinking about a very restrictive 3-month pattern that is likely to extend into at least another month, and I would like to see a pattern of expansion in the money supply from here forward so that we're getting back more on the track that we set out to be on when we said we wanted a 7 percent rate of growth   Yes, I understand I could go either way with 7 percent or less or 5 to 6 percent I just said I don't see anything wrong with 7 percent or less   That should imply tightening, while in actuality we're loosening if we accomplish this A 5 to 6 percent growth gives you 7-1/2 percent October to December, and we've been saying 7 percent from another period Now if we say 5 to 6 percent, it sounds like less but it's really more   Before we vote, Mr Chairman, what does this imply about borrowing?  -68-    11/14-15/83   May I ask a question of the staff? Steve, is the $650 million intended to be consistent with your November and December [projections of] 6 and 9 percent growth in Ml?   You don't see anything in the level of borrowing you've been assuming that is associated with these constrictive growth rates up to now?   That's what I wanted to know   It has been my assumption that the purpose of contemporaneous reserves, which have involved an enormous effort to put in place, is to improve control over the aggregates, particularly Ml I don't want to repeat what President Black said; I'd like to associate myself entirely with his views I concur with him  I was going to ask the question, Steve If the purpose is better control of the money supply, wouldn't we be better off targeting on total reserves? I think we should [exercise] reduced flexibility rather than the other way around The only problem that I can see from that is increased volatility of interest rates, which I think the market would adjust to readily   The multiplier differences are generally very short term, though, aren't they?   I'm thinking about our target in recent months and our actual experience and wondering about our control   Even banks learn!  SPEAKER(?) Over time   Mr Chairman, I agree with you on that entirely, but I think we've left unsaid here one point that is important And that is In this interim high-risk period of 6 months we've built very wide latitudes on reserve requirements and we've essentially made the smaller banks immune to the process, which I think reduces the risk It doesn't eliminate it, but it certainly reduces it   We don't get growth in December on this experimental [version]   The seasonals wouldn't affect the reserve requirements, would they?   They're real, but they're converted--   Just a very brief comment, Mr Chairman In my experience with businessmen, they always extrapolate the present and [unintelligible]; for example, it causes them to underestimate inventory/sales ratios because they always assume that sales are going to continue as [they see] them now I'll talk tomorrow about lead effects that we ought to be considering here I'm not that optimistic about the economy   Well, I just wanted to introduce the idea that the liquidity flows through the economy, as I'm sure everybody around this table knows, operate with differential lags I've been concerned  -28-    12/19-20/83  all year about inflation later this year and in 1985, which I think is going to happen I was not concerned about the fragility of the economy and that is because of the flow of liquidity through the economy We've had a real constraint for some time on Ml, whether you look at it as 13 percent in the first half and 5 percent in the second half, or whether you look at it as 4 or 5 months with no growth I think that by the second or third quarter of next year we're going to see some restraint in the economy, with an output effect flowing through on a near-term basis and then an inflation effect late next year It's the worst of all possible worlds I would anticipate that we will have real growth in the 3-1/2 percent area next year and that we still will have troublesome inflation late in the year   Well, Mr Chairman, with respect to 1985 or any longer-term period, I would be very cautious about expressing specific mathematical ranges unless we were required to do that by the Congress I would rather see us have a qualitative objective, which is to reduce inflation steadily until we've eliminated it eventually over whatever period that might encompass  -43-    12/19-20/83  As for 1984, I think the 4 to 8 percent range, in view of what is developing on Ml, is probably too wide I would be inclined to say 4 to 7 percent, except that for whatever reasons our directed growth of Ml has tended to be to the lower end of the range rather than otherwise So, because of that tendency, I would be inclined to say 5 to 8 percent, raising the bottom figure My reason is that I'm concerned about the recent slowdown that we've had in Ml, as I said yesterday, whether measured as 13 percent in the first half and 5 percent in the second half or measured as 4 to 5 months, essentially, of no growth In terms of the leads here, I think we have a probable slowdown in the economy in the second and third quarters already built in; and because of the surge in money late last year and earlier this year, I think we have an increase in inflation built in late next year or early in 1985 And I don't want us to be like the businessmen I refer to who extrapolate the present and fight the ebullience of the economy right now I would rather see us get Ml growing again at a moderate pace Alternative B, which essentially suggests about a 6 percent [MI growth] pattern, is acceptable to me; it may be slightly on the high side, but I think unless we get that going we will have a cost in terms of real output in 1984 and we should not be sanguine about 1984 I would like to see us accept the fact that the aberration in velocity caused by a recession, lower inflation, and lower interest rates on these new deposit accounts may now be ending We see a sharp rise in velocity here in the fourth quarter I think we should get onto a trend line assumption of velocity, since it clearly can't be predicted in the short run, and build our money growth rates around that If you accept that as on the order of 3 percent, then the 6 percent accommodates the 9 percent nominal GNP So, I would like to see us remove Ml from the so-called monitoring range [status] since it really is the one variable that we can control most directly I'd place it at least equal with the other aggregates and preferably give it primary status More importantly, I'd like to see us do something to get it growing again We have a forecast of 8 percent in December but we've had forecasts of increases for month after month that haven't materialized I note that we have been decreasing reserves in November and December and it seems to me that's an expected result of that type of policy   It was fascinating to read in the paper this morning that the OPEC countries have a $31 billion deficit   But the OPEC world, remember, was going to end with a $100 billion surplus   Paul, when you say you wouldn't ease, do you mean in terms of our current borrowing standard? You're not talking in terms, say, of looking at 2 percent money growth in the fourth quarter?  -56-    12/19-20/83   I think "B" is a liberalization of major magnitude, if we can get it done, as against what we have been doing   Mr Chairman, although I'm concerned about the fact that we haven't been able to get M1 growing, I would be willing to accept the staff forecast for December and the 6 percent growth in the first quarter implied in alternative B and would accept your proposal of not increasing restraint at this time Along with Mr Balles, I would prefer that we make it very clear that if we don't get that expansion in Ml, we will look to lesser restraint promptly because I think another full quarter of this would put us in a dangerous position where we may be looking at a decline in output by midyear   "Bulge" being growth over 6 percent, say?   I think that is worrying about fighting the last war The inflation that we're going to experience here comes from things that have happened in the past If we have a very sluggish Ml series, just because contemporaneously the consumer price index is registering a change that reflects past conditions it would be a mistake to react to that, I think   No I'm saying that the prices that will be flowing through the economy are a function of past money growth--say, in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year  -65-    12/19-20/83   Well, the trend growth of money is about 8 percent I don't know what period you would pick, but you would get a pretty closely correlated price change over any longer period of time with the growth of money   You might pick out a cycle and have a deviation   Well, one way to explain it is that the pattern has been very erratic, which is continuing this year with 13 percent growth in the first half and 5 percent in the second half   Well, it creates a different situation than just, say, averaging a year If you had one [half] at 20 percent and one [half] at 0 and average that out, I don't think it's the same as having a 9 percent year   Mr Chairman, do you suggest taking out this modifying phrase about lesser restraint in the context of a significant shortfall of growth in the aggregates? It's in there now  -68-    12/19-20/83  If we were to have December flat and January developing flat in money growth, wouldn't you want to have that leeway?   But if that happens, you would probably have a meeting   Well, Mr Chairman, I'm a little confused by the financial legerdemain of these benchmark and seasonal revisions But, as I look at them, it appears to me that we have more growth in money than we [thought we] had before but we still have a rather precipitous decline in the second half of last year from the first half--from 12 percent to 7 percent And that concerns me in terms of the near-term outlook for the economy I think we have enough momentum to carry us through the first quarter, but we could very likely see some leveling temporarily in the second quarter Therefore, I would want to see moderate growth in money for the year as a whole I think the time clearly has come to reinstate the primacy of M1 in our policy directives since it is really the only thing we control and since it has the demonstrated relationship to predicting the economy I think that CRR coming along gives us a golden opportunity to improve our control over M1 While obviously there's a transitional period to go through, we ought to use this new tool as soon as possible and be willing to see the funds rate fluctuate if that's necessary to control the growth rate of money-- which is really the important thing to do We have made a major move on inflation and it has been at the expense of great pain and misery; and it would be a terrible disaster if we missed the opportunity now  -29-    1/30-31/84  to try to continue that improvement And I think the way to continue that improvement is to tighten the ranges that we apply to the monetary aggregates, particularly M1, and to reduce monetary growth Therefore, I would be in favor of a 4 to 7 percent range and approximately 6 percent growth in money, which I believe is somewhere between alternative II and alternative III   Alternatives B and C, I'm sorry   Okay   I'd like to see us tighten the range to something like 4 to 7 percent in consideration of the inauguration of CRR But I could live with 4 to 8 percent because I think a target of 6 percent is in the right direction, and that's in the middle of that [latter range]   "Accomplish the roll-over of existing debt"   I think Si has a good point   It's 10 percent, so it's about 3 percent velocity in the first quarter   [Unintelligible] 7 percent money growth for the first quarter   I see, yes   Take it out   Steve, have you been hearing from the banks about the free ride in both the vault cash and other categories?    1/30-31/84   I know the larger banks are anticipating [unintelligible] capitalize them   Well, I understand the nuance, but if we had all those things together--if we had more rapid expansion of the aggregates, stronger business, and inflationary pressures--the Chairman probably would take the action and we wouldn't be worried about those things   I agree I don't think it should be evenhanded   Well, for clarification Why wouldn't you have greater restraint if the aggregates were growing faster and if there were strong evidence of stronger business and inflationary pressures?   Why do you need to say "might" then? I understand you want to be careful but if all those things applied, it would seem to me that it isn't necessary to be that careful about it   That's a point, sure  -66-    1/30-31/84  SPEAKER(?) Well, that has been a continuing problem all along But it is true that there is a clear expectation of inflationary pressures later this year   Well, there is a danger that we might over- supply reserves too if we did that, and then we would have the problem of withdrawing them later on   Every day is going to be Wednesday now   They don't get there all the time   It is a problem For example, I didn't get mine this time Usually I have it delivered late Sunday, so I don't have any time for consultation except while flying on the airplane   Up until Sunday at about midnight!  -11-    3/26-27/84   In view of all this stepped-up security, Tony, maybe the [additional] day is not that much exposure   It could be transmitted that way and then we could pick up the regular report when we come down here   Stop calling it a Greenbook That's how they identify these things They hear there's--   The previous period is usually a reserve adjustment and the current period is a reversal   If you had an adequate reserve you wouldn't have to replenish it?   That's right The bank is the beholder   It just takes one, doesn't it?   Yes, Brazil   I think most points have been covered I'll make a very brief statement In the Eighth Federal Reserve District there's a very broad general feeling of optimism, confirmed by surveys that we've done, meetings with our board and branch boards, and sessions I've had with large and small companies, commercial construction people, and business economists I find no real exception to that general pattern, whereas maybe a fourth of those people three months earlier would have had some remaining pessimism There are rising expectations of price increases to come later this year on the heavier industry side We hear talk in the chemical industry in particular about major price increases to come later on On the consumer side, all the evidence we've picked up is of continuing confidence in spending [Representatives of] three very large nationally-based department stores indicated to me that sales slowed down a little in February but since then, in 10-day sales reports, each has indicated that sales have picked up again and that they think the earlier slowdown was weather-related Housing is very strong in our District In all the major cities we're seeing some increases in prices in the 7 to 10 percent range after stability for quite a while Autos are very strong Added capacity is being planned in the large-car category and in special areas Chrysler just announced an expected $350 million expenditure to produce more mini- vans, which is a red hot product in their line that they are producing in the St Louis area Business loan demand, according to bankers that I've talked to, is beginning to pick up now in the major cities of the District after having picked up some earlier in the outlying areas None of this is related to merger activity In the wage area, the only indication of change that I've seen is at TWA and Ozark where concessions have been made by employees I don't think that relates to the general economy; it is a reflection of the pattern of deregulation in that industry I would certainly concur with the view that Governor Martin expressed about the shift of risk in the mortgage area from the savings and loans to the borrowers This is a rising concern on the part of the major savings and loans in my District Even though they're shifting a lot of the risk away from themselves, they are worried about the impact generally from rising interest rates on the variable rate loans If there are any problems in my District,  -49-    3/26-27/84  they seem to be a residual from the past and they would be in areas of excess real estate financing, coal mining, agriculture, and the foreign area   On this large increase in reserves in February to accommodate the build-up in excess reserves I notice that you say excess reserves are subsiding and that pretty much takes care of itself But if loan demand is rising and the excess reserves go into loans, what is the effect of that prospectively?   I agree that the economy is quite strong at the moment, although I wouldn't be surprised to see some moderation in its growth by midyear And I think that will be a function of these capacity constraints that have been mentioned, a slowdown in some of these high growth rates that are predicted on seasonals like housing, and the lagged effect [on economic activity] of the reduced money growth the last half of last year On the other hand--and I think we should deal with these lags--the lagged effect of the very large growth in money in late '82 and the first half of '83 should be showing up in higher prices by later this year, which fits into our other discussion about the economy So, it's important not to aggravate this higher inflation that I expect by raising the growth of the aggregates beyond the trend line Therefore, I think our original objective of staying in the center of the 4 to 8 percent range, or about 6 percent, is an appropriate policy at this time I don't see why we should be concerned about the natural consequences of increased credit demand relating to a good and adequate supply of money It's normal that if activity is strong, interest rates will rise And that's not something that is likely to kill the economy; it's simply an evidence of the strength of the economy I would prefer to see us operate on alternative B, with perhaps a small minus on that, in order to accomplish those objectives   So do I   No, there was this last time   I think it's a very great leap to say we're going back to volatility My impression of the market is that it would receive this favorably, Tony In fact, the market has already discounted an increased emphasis on M1, which it monitors very, very closely, as you know I think all these arcane issues of the placement of one thing somewhere else are viewed by the market as rather silly   Of course, the real question is Suppose we have 10 percent money growth--pick your own aggregate--for a while What would we do except to let interest rates go up if the market was demanding that level of credit? Since that's all we can do, why is that such a concern?   Well, in fact our language has been suggesting just that that we have been assuming we would get a more normal pattern of velocity It does appear to be emerging We are charged legislatively with managing the aggregates This takes us away from this accusation that we're trying to downplay the growth in the real economy I think this is an excellent statement in the right direction   We don't in fact use it as a rationale We say that is our policy--that what we control is the money supply and if demand rises, the effect of that is that interest rates move--instead of saying that we set an interest rate independent of its response on the aggregates [The latter] doesn't seem to be very rational in a period when we all agree that the inflationary danger is rising   They can take the time they gain on Fridays!   It has to be good and sound   There are also a lot of shell-shocked investors sitting on big losses They don't want to buy any more long bonds   But the relationship they put on the short or the future can determine whether it's profitable to them They can hedge it but at a loss initially   Conditions in the Eighth District are really favorable I tried to find some weak spots recently and, with the exception of agriculture which I will comment on, there don't seem to be any There is a general optimism and the underlying momentum of business activity seems to be quite decidedly upward We took a survey recently of 257 businesses in the District and 73 percent anticipate that their volume of activity is going to be expanding in the next three months Department stores sales, including those of some national companies, are very strong; they are running about 13 percent ahead And most of that is real; they don't see a significant amount of price inflation in that Automobile sales are very strong We're seeing year-over-year increases as high as 40 percent and in one of my branch cites they are breaking new records Industrial activity is robust Anecdotally, we're hearing that the mid-South furniture industry in northern Mississippi is headed for its strongest year in a decade after a long period of tough times Housing and construction remain strong People mention their concern about the recent rise in interest rates but [the effect] hasn't shown itself yet  In terms of prices, there is surprising stability I had a group of chief financial officers of major companies in recently They all seem to be concerned about the possibility of price increases but they say in terms of what they buy and in terms of what they get that the price front is very quiet and nothing is really bothersome at the moment So, there is no acceleration of prices Demand for loans in the banks in the District is vigorous now after a slow start I think there are two problem areas, potentially One is the saving and loan business Our largest savings and loans are very thin on capital position and are not making any money; and with rising interest rates those that are narrowly making money are going to start losing money In agriculture we have another troublesome situation, with rain delaying planting For example, 21 percent of the corn is planted now versus the normal 54 percent, and that affects production I was in northern Mississippi recently and I would say that the agricultural situation down there could best be assessed as grim The bankers tell me that farmers who inherited their land, who didn't have debt on the land and who have been good managers, are having a very, very difficult time and can't handle their credits, and they are very concerned I had occasion to talk to four major national retailers recently and asked them what their sense of the consumer's attitude was Uniformly they said that business is still okay but that the  -13-    5/21-22/84  froth is off The March/April experience has shaken out and in the latest two ten-day intervals they have had good but slowing business   Don't you think, Tony, it's that pervasive fear of the deficit, right or wrong, that makes people think that?   Yes, that's my point I don't necessarily agree with that, but that's what everyone says to me--that the big deficits mean big inflation ahead   Well, from a regulatory policy standpoint, what I'm hearing is that, as Jerry said, they have land on which they would take a big hit if they were to put it on the market They are saying that the sensible thing is to live with that for a while, and they are asking for forbearance Good bankers--   We've had some PCA failures--big ones--up in the Northwest   I prefer alternative B and I would hope that we could widen the band on fed funds to 8 to 12 percent in order to be able to focus on the monetary aggregates if what Chuck is talking about should develop I hope, even though we have flexibility to deal with financial crises--which certainly ought to be the case--that if we use that, we continue to [neutralize] the excess reserves that are created   It says appraisals of--   We always have it in when a $40 billion institution fails!   I think it's a very modest mention of a major problem and people would be very surprised if we don't pay some attention to it   So do I   Isn't it true that up to now in this expansion, notwithstanding cost reduction stories and so on, productivity has gained less than in the average expansion in the postwar period?   Do you mean that the percentage gain in the labor force has been higher in this cyclical expansion than in the past?   Despite all the talk of cost reductions?   Well, I won't repeat the comments that others have made, many of which I would have stated But I feel that the cyclical momentum of this expansion will probably carry us comfortably through 1985 I think growth is slowing now and that growth will continue as we approach capacity utilization as it always does I think price pressures will increase from capacity utilization and probably from a leveling of the dollar rather than a decline and from the lagged effect of rapid monetary growth in the past That leads me to the point that is critical that we not provide excess money growth to fuel inflation in the future I share Governor Wallich's view that we will have a critical problem at the end of 1985 if we do that As to financial fragility, I'm aware of Continental's situation and the fact that the thrifts on an operating basis are breaking even or are slightly in the red But to put that in perspective We've been through a stiff recession There is always a lagged effect of problem loans after one of those If I'm not mistaken, the nonperforming assets in March were lower than they were at year-end And we have some specialized problems, including the energy situation, which seems to be improving some My own guess is that we could easily exaggerate this, including on the LDC front; it appears to me that major progress is being made So, I'm not concerned that a moderate increase in interest rates, which would appear to be appropriate in terms of the direction of the economy, would in any way cause a major problem in the financial system   We monitor it and see if it leads us to something we can do or control as against something we look at   I agree with Tony that the intellectual argument is for 4 to 7 percent, with Lyle that the message is much more important than the tactics, and with Karen that narrowing is the critical thing at this point I think we need to have a strong message We have a very strong momentum going here and I'd much rather see us, if necessary, run over [the range] and say we're working toward something that we think is satisfactory in the long run, which is what we're talking about here So, I would prefer to see us have a 4 to 7 percent band on M1 and that range should be very comfortable whether velocity growth is 2 or 3 percent   Stay in there, Sam!   One should give some consideration to the fact that banks have been expanding CDs very rapidly in recent months, however I don't think this entire widening of spreads would be as qualitative as you analyze it Spreads always widen when they pump CDs up   But in that context, the banks have expanded their loans tremendously, and have financed it with expansion of domestic CDs That is my point And you would expect that to result in a widening of spreads, notwithstanding the fact that, obviously, Continental and Manufacturers Hanover have been a qualitative factor in the market The market really, I guess, has worked pretty well   Wasn't June rather high?   Yes   Well, I think there is a time to do some snugging, and there's a difference between snugging and a gross move What I would like to see is sort of a "B+", which would be something like a 5 percent growth from June-to-September because--   Well, "B-," if you want to call it that way   I think of that as a "B+" I note that the quarterly average under "B," in fact, accelerates to 77 percent And    7/16-17/84  I think we ought to be raising the borrowing target modestly to, say, $1-1/4 billion, so that there is less opportunity to spill over inadvertently into a rapid growth in money as we maintain a borrowing target and provide reserves to get used and transferred into money I think the momentum of the economy fully justifies this and I think the market has probably already significantly discounted something like this together with an increase in the discount rate   Can we lend to the Home Loan Banks?   Paul, if borrowing burgeoned, let's say, to $25 billion in the System and we didn't have the collateral to sell, just technically isn't it possible that we could raise reserve requirements? I understand the psychology, but that would be the mechanical way to resolve it, wouldn't it?   If we announced that that was the purpose   But if we didn't have anything to sell--   We could ease If we're expanding reserves by the borrowing, we could less than offset them by the reserve requirements and still ease   It's better than the alternative, Chuck, of saying "We can't accommodate you at the window"   Well, it's interesting how the deficit has disappeared from the market's thinking It was pervasive and now it's somewhere in the background   Just responding to this question of attitudes, we've been surveying people in our District and I would say the consensus is that no one anticipates a downturn this year They are all feeling comfortable They are a little more cautious as they sense the slowdown We've been asking them what they think about prices and they give us two responses One is that there are no price pressures out there from their suppliers and they are not able to raise prices in the market Every time they try, they get knocked down Looking ahead, however, to the year-end or the fourth quarter-- not next year--they are all trying to raise prices about 4 percent   Pres, I'm sure that's a possibility; I don't deny that at all But the experience I had was that the stress in the thrift institutions in Chicago was [met with] a yawn We had one situation involving a panic in a small S&L where they made people line up But whenever they were working [these situations] out in mergers, people seemed to be totally indifferent  -17-    8/21/84   Well, what is happening there? Are the under $100,000 accounts actually being withdrawn?   So that's a real change   It seems to me that the present policy is producing about the right results We had 7 percent growth in money in the first quarter and 6 percent in the second quarter So, I wouldn't change the borrowing target I think we ought to pay less attention to the fed funds rate and, therefore, I would like to see the band widened by 1/2 percentage point to accommodate the probabilities there At this stage of the cycle and with the past pattern of money growth, it seems to me that the odds favor some pickup in inflation notwithstanding the anecdotal information that we have I would favor alternative B, indicating growth of about 5-1/2 percent in M1 in the third quarter This also would have the advantage of avoiding the base drift and would set us up in a good position in the fourth quarter to start our plan for money growth for next year In terms of the concern in the marketplace, we have to think about what concerns might arise if we were to ease at this time, causing concern about inflation and possibly creating the opposite  -31-    8/21/84  result than we intended, which would be higher long-term rates Long- term rates have eased some at this point and if we hold firm in our policy, the probability is that they could ease some more I don't think that just a slackening of growth in the business cycle necessarily should be associated with lower inflation We could have the worst of all worlds--a slackening growth and rising inflation, as we've had in the past   Well, it has just bounced around month-to- month April was down, May was up, June was up, July was down, and the quarter is up   I could give you the answer They are  -41-    8/21/84   I think they are torn This wide spread makes them want to have mechanical errors on Friday and that sort of thing   Why do you say the money supply has gone down? It hasn't gone down year-to-date; it hasn't gone down quarter-to- quarter; it was just down in July   It's back up already in August   It's very stable quarter-to-quarter   I hear a lot of talk from the smaller and medium size banks about how they are more carefully limiting their fed funds sales Is there possibly a net shrinkage in the market here?   They are certainly more selective Maybe they distribute it out [more]   That's what I am hearing also--that they have become sluggish again after a little pickup in late August and early September   Mr Chairman, in the Eighth District, economic activity is still strong--I think a little stronger than the national average--but we are clearly seeing signs of a slowdown Building activity is high but housing starts are declining Builders are comfortable with where they are but are worried about what will happen in the fall and generally are anticipating that the high interest rates will severely and adversely affect them Consumer spending is strong in our District; sales of consumer goods haven't really slowed down We have gotten a lot of information from national retailers that sales, after flattening out in the summer, picked up in late August or early September and, as I said, have become sluggish again Locally, there is less of that sluggishness Except for in the northern part of our District, the agricultural situation has improved; there is some reduction in the financial pressures that the farmers have been feeling for the last two years  I made a comparison here of weak points and strong points and what I ended up with is that the same industries and the same activities are on both the weak and the strong side For example, in agriculture we have a very weak situation in northern Missouri In the case of soybeans, it costs more to produce them than they can be sold for at the moment even though we are getting a lot of production --in the area of 50 bushels an acre The value of the dollar is an adverse factor in exports, and cotton and rice are export crops in part of the District On the other hand, they have the biggest production in history--greater than 1982 So, how that will come out is a close call in terms of the effects on them Construction is at a high level but the outlook is for a weakening In production, generally we're at a very high level Automobile sales are characterized by the major dealers as red hot They can't handle the demand, particularly for some of the larger cars So, that looks good On the other hand, we've had some plant closings in the District International Harvester, a producer of farm implements, just closed a plant with 1500 workers; a small foundry closed; we saw the first AT&T effect in telecommunications with a small plant closing In terms of the confidence factor, there is considerable concern about the thrifts I had an interesting coincidence of three visits in the last two weeks by bankers who are concerned about the condition of thrifts Now, why they are [concerned] may be a product of industry discussions, but they foresee major failures without identifying them As I talk to the thrift people, they are concerned about the negative interest arbitrage but they haven't seen any deterioration in quality, including in the variable rate loans The  -21-    10/2/84  consumer's confidence is reflected in our District in rising consumer loans; the consumer is still borrowing All in all, what I see is a slowing at a high level--not a lot of imbalances around that we could really do anything about Agriculture is an example There is some effect of the high dollar, but no big inventory problems that haven't been resolved Our expectations are that nationally we'll probably see a continuation of about 3 percent growth next year but with inflation rising, probably on the order of 5-1/2 or 6 percent   I would prefer that we use alternative B but make certain that we do everything possible to accomplish the M1 growth projected for the fourth quarter I think the recent experience has demonstrated that when we have too many targets we can get inconsistencies in borrowing and interest rates and money and it probably is too big a pot I would concentrate on money and if that caused us to lower the borrowing level or lower interest rates in order to accomplish that, I would be in favor of that It seems to me that we have a broadly based economic expansion that has reached a high level and is turning a little sluggish but still doing all right Price [increases] have slowed down Interest rates have come down significantly And we're dealing here with lags What we have at the moment reflects the past monetary growth and what we do now will affect the future And contrary to what Emmett mentioned, my observation is that people at the Conference Board, Chase, DRI, Morgan, and Citicorp, all are looking for 4-1/2 to 6 percent inflation next year in the projections that I see And that's the range that I see also We're right in the middle of the ranges on the money supply and I think we ought to try to stay right there   I am seeing in my District some of the change in attitude that has been commented on by others I had a meeting with about a dozen chief executive officers of large companies last week and their consensus was that business had turned toward the soft side They were generally concerned about inventory levels; it was not that inventories had gotten out of control, but the focus of these CEOs had moved to the control of inventories The retailers spoke of a good Christmas instead of their previous very optimistic  -16-    11/7/84  expectations about the Christmas season They are reassessing their prospects in the retail area, and this group included four national retailers who had a pretty good feel of conditions nationally They were focusing particularly on [sales in] recent weeks In the manufacturing sector, one thing that struck me was that without exception, none of them sees any inflation anywhere either in what they buy or in their ability to change prices of what they sell They relate this principally to the import competition, which seems to be pervasive All of them one way or another seem to be experiencing that across the board The other thing that impressed me was that they all felt that wages were under complete control--that settlements that had occurred were very modest indeed, and their expectations about wage settlements were of the same variety  The housing area has been fairly stable; we have had some softness in single-family starts offset by multifamily starts In the appliance manufacturing area, we have seen specific reductions For example, the GE manufacturing facility in Louisville has just announced another 1400 layoffs, including about 300 white collar workers In the textile area, where import competition has a big effect, four plants in Arkansas have just been closed involving about 22,000 workers The shoe industry in Missouri is in extremis, as they say, in terms of import competition Agriculture in particular is hurting now because of rains that are delaying harvesting and causing some problems We are getting reports that harvesting of animals is including breeding stock and that is an indication of problems there So, when I put the whole thing together, I see a change of attitude and conditions from a slowing in the economy to an economy that has flattened out My judgment is that the staff forecast is probably optimistic for the fourth quarter and for next year as well My best guess is that, absent a significant change of policy soon, the next move in the economy will be down   It's a very thin edge   $43 billion   Steve, are you saying that as the differential between NOW accounts and MMDAs declines, there's a percentage that shifts [to MMDAs] instead of the contrary?   But that's an interesting thesis that someone who accepts a lower-than-market rate gets more interested in changing to the market rate as the spread declines instead of as it widens   Not from NOWs to MMDAs but from the market to MMDAs   For a while the money market funds were more attractive than the bank funds and that spread has declined more recently   I would like to reinforce what Governor Martin said I think we are testing our luck by having had no growth in M1 for five months And based on our inability to meet our past targets for M1 growth, I have no confidence that the projected November and December increases will occur unless we refocus our policy on reserve growth instead of interest rates, which is what I think we should have done I think the reason M1 has not expanded is that we have been willing through our policy of targeting borrowing to resist the natural market declines in interest rates that otherwise would have occurred I noticed that the growth in total reserves and M1 from the fourth quarter [of 1983] to October are essentially the same, for example But in recent times we have had this precipitous drop in reserves So my view would be that this is a time to effect a significant easing and to accomplish a growth in reserves that will result in a growth in money--without concern about the level of market rates   A good part of the seasonal is arbitraging the discount rate That was certainly true in my District People just took advantage of the opportunity and they will stop doing it   There is the possibility, of course, that the market, having already discounted a discount rate decrease and a move [by this Committee], might react adversely if we didn't move enough   You have the Fauntroy letter; I don't know about the Garn letter  3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our presentation this afternoon,   entitled “Explaining Low Inflation since the Mid-1990s” reflects joint work with Flint   Brayton and David Lebow and will be presented by myself and David  As shown in   the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the rate of unemployment fell through the   late 1990s, eventually reaching a level not seen in thirty years  Nevertheless, core   consumer price inflation—shown at the upper right—remained in the 1½ to 2 percent   range throughout this period This outcome struck many observers as being at odds   with the view that low unemployment necessarily pushes up inflation  The objective   of our briefing today is to provide an explanation for these developments  To do this,   we find it helpful, as summarized in the middle panel, to step back and ask whether   changes may have been occurring in the economy over a longer span of time that may   have altered the inflation process We then focus on the recent past and ask why   inflation remained so low in the late 1990s, when unemployment was also low    Finally, in light of the changes that we identify as being important, we evaluate the   likelihood that the recent conjunction of low inflation and low unemployment can be   repeated in coming years    By our reckoning, three factors account for much of the recent experience of   simultaneously low inflation and low unemployment, as listed in the lower panel of   the exhibit First, a change in the way monetary policy has been conducted over the   past two decades, compared with the 1960s and 1970s, may have reduced the short-  run responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization  This factor is a relatively small   part of our overall explanation for why inflation has remained so low  The second   factor is the pickup in productivity growth that started in the mid-1990s  As output   per hour advanced more rapidly, hourly compensation responded only gradually, and   the pressure on prices from unit labor costs temporarily waned  This element is the   largest part of our explanation for the late-1990s experience  Looking to the future,    3 Materials used by Mr Roberts and Mr Lebow are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)                                June 25-26, 2002 22 of 179  the influence of the pickup in productivity growth on inflation should diminish over  time as hourly compensation adjusts more fully to the faster trend growth in output  per hour Lastly, structural developments in labor markets may have caused the  natural rate of unemployment today to be about ½ percentage point lower than in the  mid-1980s  These effects are likely to persist   I should note that our presentation does not discuss the influence on recent  inflation of movements in the prices of imports, energy, and food  Although these  standard “supply-shock” variables have at times had significant effects on the year-to­ year pattern of inflation, we see their net contributions to the good inflation  performance of the past several years as being relatively small   The framework for our analysis, the FRB/US model of inflation dynamics, is  sketched out in exhibit 2 This model and others like it help inform the staff  projection In this framework, inflation (π) is a function of lagged inflation, expected  future inflation (πe), the difference between the unemployment rate (U) and its natural  rate (Un), relative price shocks (such as movements in food, energy, and import  prices), and unit labor costs In FRB/US, households and businesses form  expectations of inflation based on their knowledge of the structure of the economy,  including the manner in which monetary policy is conducted   The factors we examine fit into this model as follows  First, for reasons we will  expand on shortly, changes in the conduct of monetary policy alter the influence of  the unemployment rate on expected inflation  Second, changes in labor productivity  growth affect inflation through unit labor costs  Finally, the labor market  developments we highlight influence the natural rate of unemployment directly and  thereby alter the amount of inflation impetus associated with any given level of the  actual unemployment rate   Although economic slack, as measured by the gap between the unemployment  rate and the natural rate of unemployment, clearly affects inflation in this framework,  the equation also makes clear that unemployment is by no means the only  determinant of inflation  According to the FRB/US model, since the mid-1960s,  movements in this unemployment gap account for only about 20 percent of the  variation in consumer price inflation, when measured in terms of its year-to-year  change This estimate includes the direct influence of unemployment on inflation  shown in the equation as well as the indirect influence that is transmitted through the  behavior of expected inflation   The top panels of exhibit 3 show the change in inflation from one four-quarter  period to the next plotted against the unemployment rate over the past forty years,  with a split at the end of 1983  In each panel, we present the simple regression line   As you can see, the lines are downward sloping, indicating that periods of high  unemployment tend to be associated with declining inflation  But it is also clear that  the points in the post-1983 period are clustered in a narrower range than in the 1960­ 83 period And as Art Rolnick noted earlier, the average slope of the relationship is                    June 25-26, 2002 23 of 179  considerably shallower in the post-1983 period than in the earlier period—indeed, the  slope falls by about half   The change in the relationship between inflation and unemployment could have  occurred for many reasons, but we find it plausible to attribute at least some of it to a  change in the way that monetary policy has been conducted  As highlighted in the  first bullet point of the lower panel, many studies suggest that since the early 1980s  monetary policy has moved more aggressively to stabilize the economy than it did in  the 1960s and 1970s In the staff’s FRB/US macroeconomic model, such a change in  monetary policy reduces the sensitivity of inflation to unemployment by altering the  way households and businesses form their expectations of inflation  In particular,  under a more aggressive policy, low unemployment is no longer as strong a signal of  higher future inflation, and so expectations are better “anchored”   Based on simulations of the FRB/US model, we find that a conventional  representation of this change in policy would reduce the sensitivity of the change in  inflation to unemployment by about a third and thus would account for more than half  of the reduction in the sensitivity seen in the top panels  Other models imply similar  reductions, although the precise results are sensitive to the model used and the exact  specification of the change in policy  While the policy shift predates the low-inflation  episode on which our attention is focused, this timing means that by the late 1990s the  change in policy had been in place long enough that it was likely reflected in the  expectations-formation process  As a consequence, the low unemployment rate of the  late 1990s induced less deterioration in inflation expectations, and thus in actual  inflation as well, than would have been expected from the average historical  relationship between inflation and unemployment   It is important to keep in mind that policymakers cannot “exploit” the new, lower  sensitivity of inflation to the unemployment rate  If policymakers were to respond to  this lower sensitivity by moving less aggressively when unemployment fell below the  natural rate, this reversion to a less aggressive policy would, over time, alter the way  in which expectations are formed, leading to an increase in the sensitivity of inflation  to economic slack  David Lebow will now continue our presentation    We think the productivity effect indeed may be just about played out,   but we do believe that the other labor market developments are going to be more durable  So   that portion we expect to continue    It certainly is a story for why investment collapsed and why it might   not rebound right away I think you are right that people do seem to be more cautious now               June 25-26, 2002 45 of 179   Our reading of the literature on where productivity comes from and   where technological progress comes from is that whether or not greater competitive pressure is a   factor driving greater productivity growth seems to be an open question  One shred of evidence   in that regard comes from international comparisons of growth that suggest that more-open   economies do tend to grow faster than less-open economies  So there’s one shred of evidence   that actually draws a link from—     Absolutely  I meant productivity growth  In open economies output   per person grows faster    The labor share has come back up to near its average    Yes And in our view, that is indicative of the productivity story   having played itself out We would expect, as the productivity story is played out, that the labor   share would tend to come back to its historical average    The key is that we’re anticipating some acceleration in productivity   again as capital accumulation picks up  So we expect to get an additional benefit for a while
