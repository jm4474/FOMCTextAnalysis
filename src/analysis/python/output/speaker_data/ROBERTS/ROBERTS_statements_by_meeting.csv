6766,2002-06-25,"3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our presentation this afternoon,   entitled “Explaining Low Inflation since the Mid-1990s” reflects joint work with Flint   Brayton and David Lebow and will be presented by myself and David  As shown in   the upper left panel of your first exhibit, the rate of unemployment fell through the   late 1990s, eventually reaching a level not seen in thirty years  Nevertheless, core   consumer price inflation—shown at the upper right—remained in the 1½ to 2 percent   range throughout this period This outcome struck many observers as being at odds   with the view that low unemployment necessarily pushes up inflation  The objective   of our briefing today is to provide an explanation for these developments  To do this,   we find it helpful, as summarized in the middle panel, to step back and ask whether   changes may have been occurring in the economy over a longer span of time that may   have altered the inflation process We then focus on the recent past and ask why   inflation remained so low in the late 1990s, when unemployment was also low    Finally, in light of the changes that we identify as being important, we evaluate the   likelihood that the recent conjunction of low inflation and low unemployment can be   repeated in coming years    By our reckoning, three factors account for much of the recent experience of   simultaneously low inflation and low unemployment, as listed in the lower panel of   the exhibit First, a change in the way monetary policy has been conducted over the   past two decades, compared with the 1960s and 1970s, may have reduced the short-  run responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization  This factor is a relatively small   part of our overall explanation for why inflation has remained so low  The second   factor is the pickup in productivity growth that started in the mid-1990s  As output   per hour advanced more rapidly, hourly compensation responded only gradually, and   the pressure on prices from unit labor costs temporarily waned  This element is the   largest part of our explanation for the late-1990s experience  Looking to the future,    3 Materials used by Mr Roberts and Mr Lebow are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)                                June 25-26, 2002 22 of 179  the influence of the pickup in productivity growth on inflation should diminish over  time as hourly compensation adjusts more fully to the faster trend growth in output  per hour Lastly, structural developments in labor markets may have caused the  natural rate of unemployment today to be about ½ percentage point lower than in the  mid-1980s  These effects are likely to persist   I should note that our presentation does not discuss the influence on recent  inflation of movements in the prices of imports, energy, and food  Although these  standard “supply-shock” variables have at times had significant effects on the year-to­ year pattern of inflation, we see their net contributions to the good inflation  performance of the past several years as being relatively small   The framework for our analysis, the FRB/US model of inflation dynamics, is  sketched out in exhibit 2 This model and others like it help inform the staff  projection In this framework, inflation (π) is a function of lagged inflation, expected  future inflation (πe), the difference between the unemployment rate (U) and its natural  rate (Un), relative price shocks (such as movements in food, energy, and import  prices), and unit labor costs In FRB/US, households and businesses form  expectations of inflation based on their knowledge of the structure of the economy,  including the manner in which monetary policy is conducted   The factors we examine fit into this model as follows  First, for reasons we will  expand on shortly, changes in the conduct of monetary policy alter the influence of  the unemployment rate on expected inflation  Second, changes in labor productivity  growth affect inflation through unit labor costs  Finally, the labor market  developments we highlight influence the natural rate of unemployment directly and  thereby alter the amount of inflation impetus associated with any given level of the  actual unemployment rate   Although economic slack, as measured by the gap between the unemployment  rate and the natural rate of unemployment, clearly affects inflation in this framework,  the equation also makes clear that unemployment is by no means the only  determinant of inflation  According to the FRB/US model, since the mid-1960s,  movements in this unemployment gap account for only about 20 percent of the  variation in consumer price inflation, when measured in terms of its year-to-year  change This estimate includes the direct influence of unemployment on inflation  shown in the equation as well as the indirect influence that is transmitted through the  behavior of expected inflation   The top panels of exhibit 3 show the change in inflation from one four-quarter  period to the next plotted against the unemployment rate over the past forty years,  with a split at the end of 1983  In each panel, we present the simple regression line   As you can see, the lines are downward sloping, indicating that periods of high  unemployment tend to be associated with declining inflation  But it is also clear that  the points in the post-1983 period are clustered in a narrower range than in the 1960­ 83 period And as Art Rolnick noted earlier, the average slope of the relationship is                    June 25-26, 2002 23 of 179  considerably shallower in the post-1983 period than in the earlier period—indeed, the  slope falls by about half   The change in the relationship between inflation and unemployment could have  occurred for many reasons, but we find it plausible to attribute at least some of it to a  change in the way that monetary policy has been conducted  As highlighted in the  first bullet point of the lower panel, many studies suggest that since the early 1980s  monetary policy has moved more aggressively to stabilize the economy than it did in  the 1960s and 1970s In the staff’s FRB/US macroeconomic model, such a change in  monetary policy reduces the sensitivity of inflation to unemployment by altering the  way households and businesses form their expectations of inflation  In particular,  under a more aggressive policy, low unemployment is no longer as strong a signal of  higher future inflation, and so expectations are better “anchored”   Based on simulations of the FRB/US model, we find that a conventional  representation of this change in policy would reduce the sensitivity of the change in  inflation to unemployment by about a third and thus would account for more than half  of the reduction in the sensitivity seen in the top panels  Other models imply similar  reductions, although the precise results are sensitive to the model used and the exact  specification of the change in policy  While the policy shift predates the low-inflation  episode on which our attention is focused, this timing means that by the late 1990s the  change in policy had been in place long enough that it was likely reflected in the  expectations-formation process  As a consequence, the low unemployment rate of the  late 1990s induced less deterioration in inflation expectations, and thus in actual  inflation as well, than would have been expected from the average historical  relationship between inflation and unemployment   It is important to keep in mind that policymakers cannot “exploit” the new, lower  sensitivity of inflation to the unemployment rate  If policymakers were to respond to  this lower sensitivity by moving less aggressively when unemployment fell below the  natural rate, this reversion to a less aggressive policy would, over time, alter the way  in which expectations are formed, leading to an increase in the sensitivity of inflation  to economic slack  David Lebow will now continue our presentation    We think the productivity effect indeed may be just about played out,   but we do believe that the other labor market developments are going to be more durable  So   that portion we expect to continue    It certainly is a story for why investment collapsed and why it might   not rebound right away I think you are right that people do seem to be more cautious now               June 25-26, 2002 45 of 179   Our reading of the literature on where productivity comes from and   where technological progress comes from is that whether or not greater competitive pressure is a   factor driving greater productivity growth seems to be an open question  One shred of evidence   in that regard comes from international comparisons of growth that suggest that more-open   economies do tend to grow faster than less-open economies  So there’s one shred of evidence   that actually draws a link from—     Absolutely  I meant productivity growth  In open economies output   per person grows faster    The labor share has come back up to near its average    Yes And in our view, that is indicative of the productivity story   having played itself out We would expect, as the productivity story is played out, that the labor   share would tend to come back to its historical average    The key is that we’re anticipating some acceleration in productivity   again as capital accumulation picks up  So we expect to get an additional benefit for a while  "
